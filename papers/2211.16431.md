# [NeuralLift-360: Lifting An In-the-wild 2D Photo to A 3D Object with   360Â° Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16431)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:How can we lift a single 2D image into a 3D object that allows generating photorealistic novel views from any viewing angle (i.e. 360 degree views)?The key hypothesis is that by combining neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with denoising diffusion models, it is possible to reconstruct a plausible 3D object from a single image that can render high-quality 360 degree novel views. Specifically, the paper proposes that:- NeRFs can provide a useful 3D scene representation. - Diffusion models can provide strong priors and hallucinate plausible unseen views.- With proper training techniques like a ranking loss and CLIP-guidance, even very rough depth estimation can suffice to create compelling 3D objects from single images.So in summary, the central research question is how to lift a single 2D photo to a 3D object with 360 degree novel views. The key hypothesis is that combining NeRFs and diffusion models in the right way can achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:- Proposing a novel framework called NeuralLift-360 that can lift a single in-the-wild image into a 3D object with 360 degree novel views. This is the first method that can generate plausible 3D objects with 360 degree views from a single image.- Using a neural radiance field (NeRF) as the 3D scene representation and integrating prior knowledge from a denoising diffusion model to hallucinate unseen views.- Introducing a ranking loss that provides supervision using rough depth estimation, making the method more robust to depth estimation errors compared to prior work. - Adopting a CLIP-guided sampling strategy for the diffusion prior that provides coherent guidance aligned with the input image.- Proposing to finetune the diffusion model on the single input image to adapt it to in-the-wild images while maintaining diversity.- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on generating 360 degree views from diverse real world images compared to prior works. The method shows promising results in easing 3D content creation from 2D images.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel end-to-end framework NeuralLift-360 that can generate high quality 3D objects with 360 degree views from just a single input image, enabled by innovations like the ranking loss and CLIP-guided diffusion prior.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method called NeuralLift-360 that can take a single 2D image of an object and generate a 3D model with 360 degree views by combining neural radiance fields with generative diffusion models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of lifting 2D images to 3D:- It focuses on a more challenging task of generating a full 360 degree 3D object from a single image, compared to prior works that only generate limited views or require multiple input views. Most prior works focus on faces, toys, or synthetic datasets, while this aims for general real-world objects.- It proposes a novel framework NeuralLift-360 that combines neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with diffusion model priors to generate the 3D object. This differs from previous hybrid approaches using depth estimation or 3D datasets. It is most similar to SinNeRF in using NeRF with limited input, but goes further with the diffusion prior.- The method introduces a ranking loss for supervision from rough depth maps, making it more robust to poor depth estimation compared to methods like SinNeRF. This helps extend to real images where consistent depth is unavailable.- It finetunes the diffusion model on the input image to adapt the prior specifically to that image, unlike general text-to-image priors used before. This better tailors the prior to the given image.- Experiments demonstrate stronger performance on real images over baselines, showcasing the robustness and generalization of NeuralLift-360. The qualitative results showing coherent 360 views are more sophisticated than prior works on real images.Overall, this paper pushes the boundary on single image 3D lifting with a novel framework and losses tailored for real images. The diffusion prior and depth ranking supervision appear to be key innovations that allow generating more complete 3D objects from limited real image input.
