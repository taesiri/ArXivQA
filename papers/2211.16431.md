# [NeuralLift-360: Lifting An In-the-wild 2D Photo to A 3D Object with   360Â° Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16431)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:How can we lift a single 2D image into a 3D object that allows generating photorealistic novel views from any viewing angle (i.e. 360 degree views)?The key hypothesis is that by combining neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with denoising diffusion models, it is possible to reconstruct a plausible 3D object from a single image that can render high-quality 360 degree novel views. Specifically, the paper proposes that:- NeRFs can provide a useful 3D scene representation. - Diffusion models can provide strong priors and hallucinate plausible unseen views.- With proper training techniques like a ranking loss and CLIP-guidance, even very rough depth estimation can suffice to create compelling 3D objects from single images.So in summary, the central research question is how to lift a single 2D photo to a 3D object with 360 degree novel views. The key hypothesis is that combining NeRFs and diffusion models in the right way can achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:- Proposing a novel framework called NeuralLift-360 that can lift a single in-the-wild image into a 3D object with 360 degree novel views. This is the first method that can generate plausible 3D objects with 360 degree views from a single image.- Using a neural radiance field (NeRF) as the 3D scene representation and integrating prior knowledge from a denoising diffusion model to hallucinate unseen views.- Introducing a ranking loss that provides supervision using rough depth estimation, making the method more robust to depth estimation errors compared to prior work. - Adopting a CLIP-guided sampling strategy for the diffusion prior that provides coherent guidance aligned with the input image.- Proposing to finetune the diffusion model on the single input image to adapt it to in-the-wild images while maintaining diversity.- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on generating 360 degree views from diverse real world images compared to prior works. The method shows promising results in easing 3D content creation from 2D images.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel end-to-end framework NeuralLift-360 that can generate high quality 3D objects with 360 degree views from just a single input image, enabled by innovations like the ranking loss and CLIP-guided diffusion prior.
