## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents FoundationPose, a unified framework for 6D object pose estimation and tracking that supports both model-based and model-free setups for novel objects. The key innovation is the use of a neural implicit representation to bridge the gap between the two setups, enabling effective novel view synthesis from just a small number of reference images. This allows the downstream pose estimation modules to remain invariant within the same framework. The method achieves strong generalization via three main contributions: (1) a large-scale synthetic data generation pipeline aided by large language models for asset augmentation, (2) a novel transformer-based architecture, and (3) a contrastive learning formulation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that FoundationPose outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods specialized for each individual task, often by a large margin. Remarkably, it achieves comparable performance to instance-level methods despite requiring less object knowledge assumptions. The unified nature of the framework, its versatility across tasks, and its strong generalizability to novel objects are highly impressive.
