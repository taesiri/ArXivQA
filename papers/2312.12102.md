# [I-CEE: Tailoring Explanations of Image Classifications Models to User   Expertise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12102)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing explainable AI (XAI) techniques for image classification widely generate "one-size-fits-all" explanations without considering differences between users. There is a lack of personalization in the explanation process. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a framework called "Image Classification Explanations tailored to User Expertise" (I-CEE) that provides personalized explanations of image classification models tailored to each user's expertise.

The key ideas are:
1) Model each user's task-specific expertise as an expertise vector. This captures their ability to utilize different concepts for image classification.
2) Based on user expertise, select the most informative subset of training images, local explanations, and model predictions to display to the user. Specifically, choose images where the user is estimated to have low confidence in the model's prediction. This targets their knowledge gaps.

Main Contributions: 
1) Identify the opportunity and develop the first framework for tailored explanations according to user expertise for explaining image classification models. 
2) Demonstrate through simulation experiments that I-CEE improves users' ability to predict model decisions compared to existing XAI techniques.
3) Conduct human subject experiments (N=100) showing I-CEE enables users to better understand and simulate the model's decisions relative to the state-of-the-art. The approach is also subjectively preferred.

In summary, the paper presents a novel perspective on personalized explanations based on modeling and considering user expertise differences. Experiments validate the efficacy of this paradigm towards more human-centered XAI systems.
