# [Conversational Grounding: Annotation and Analysis of Grounding Acts and   Grounding Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16609)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Conversational grounding is crucial for building reliable dialog systems that can accurately track and recall shared information. However, current dialog systems lack robust grounding capabilities.
- Grounding Acts (GAs) and Common Grounding Units (CGUs), introduced by Traum (1999), provide a way to structure grounding but have seen limited adoption, especially in large language models.

Proposed Solution:
- Annotate two dialog corpora - Meetup and Spot the Difference - with GAs, CGUs and degree of grounding. 
- Propose adding new grounding categories like Repeat and None based on insights from the annotation process. 
- Introduce sub-categories of acknowledgment to offer more nuanced understanding.
- Establish baseline by training a T5 model to categorize utterances into GAs and group them into CGUs.

Main Contributions:
- Make available large corpora annotated with GAs, CGUs and degree of grounding to support future research.
- Provide refined coding manual for GAs and CGUs incorporating changes to Traum's original classification.
- Discussion of key challenges and analysis based on the annotation of natural dialogs. 
- Preliminary benchmark for modeling GAs using a T5 transformer model.

In summary, the paper introduces an annotated resource and analysis to advance research on conversational grounding, especially incorporating insights from natural dialogs. The coding scheme and model establish a baseline for future efforts to endow dialog systems with enhanced grounding capabilities.
