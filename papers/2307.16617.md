# [FULLER: Unified Multi-modality Multi-task 3D Perception via Multi-level   Gradient Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16617)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper tries to address is: 

How to effectively integrate multi-modality fusion and multi-task learning for 3D perception tasks in autonomous driving scenarios?

Specifically, the paper identifies two key issues that arise when naively combining multi-modality fusion and multi-task learning:

1) Modality bias: Different modalities (e.g. LiDAR, camera images) provide complementary information useful for different tasks. Without proper regularization, one task may favor or bias towards its best compatible modality, leaving other modalities under-optimized. 

2) Task conflict: When training on multiple tasks simultaneously, the gradient signals of different tasks can be imbalanced. A task with smaller gradients may get overwhelmed by another task with larger gradients during joint training.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a multi-level gradient calibration technique applied during end-to-end training:

1) Inter-gradient calibration to balance gradients between tasks and prevent task conflict. 

2) Intra-gradient calibration to ensure different modalities are learned at a balanced pace and prevent modality bias.

By applying multi-level gradient calibration, the paper aims to effectively integrate multi-modality fusion and multi-task learning within a unified framework for robust 3D perception in autonomous driving. Experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate clear improvements over baseline methods.

In summary, the core research contribution is a novel optimization technique based on multi-level gradient calibration to enable effective joint multi-modality multi-task learning for 3D perception tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel framework called Fuller that unifies multi-modality fusion and multi-task learning for 3D perception in autonomous driving scenarios. The key idea is to use multi-level gradient calibration to address the issues of modality bias and task conflict that arise in naively combining these approaches. 

2. It introduces a lightweight transformer-based design for the 3D detection and map segmentation heads, which achieves strong performance while saving significant parameters compared to prior designs.

3. It provides extensive experiments and analysis on the nuScenes dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of Fuller. The results show substantial improvements over strong baselines, e.g. a 14.4% mIoU boost on map segmentation and 1.4% mAP increase on 3D detection. 

4. The paper offers insights into the links between modalities and tasks, and how their gradients interact during end-to-end training. It is the first work to systematically study multi-modality multi-task learning for 3D perception in self-driving.

In summary, the main contribution lies in proposing the Fuller framework that can effectively unify multi-modality fusion and multi-task learning, two increasingly important paradigms in 3D perception for autonomous driving. The paper offers convincing experimental validation and provides useful analysis into the optimization challenges.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Fuller that calibrates the gradients between tasks and modalities in a multi-task, multi-modal 3D perception model to address issues with task conflict and modality bias, improving performance on nuScenes benchmarks for 3D detection and map segmentation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in the field of multi-modality multi-task learning for 3D perception:

- This paper proposes a novel framework called Fuller that unifies multi-modality fusion and multi-task learning for 3D perception tasks like 3D object detection and semantic segmentation. Other works have focused on either multi-modality fusion or multi-task learning, but not both together.

- The key contribution is using multi-level gradient calibration to address the issues of modality bias and task conflict that arise when naively combining multiple modalities and tasks. This is a new approach not explored by prior works. 

- Experiments are conducted on the large-scale nuScenes dataset using point cloud and images as input. Most prior multi-modality works focused only on 3D detection, while this paper tackles 3D detection and segmentation.

- Compared to BEVFusion, which also fused point cloud and images, this paper explicitly handles the problems of modality bias and task conflict that BEVFusion did not address. Fuller improves segmentation mIoU by 14.4% and detection mAP by 1.4% over BEVFusion.

- The lightweight transformer-based task heads used in Fuller improve accuracy while reducing parameters by ~40% compared to prior designs. This is a novel architecture contribution.

- Evaluations under different dataset distributions and loss weight settings demonstrate Fuller's effectiveness in various conditions. This rigorous evaluation goes beyond what most prior works have done.

Overall, this paper makes significant research contributions in multi-modality multi-task learning for 3D perception by proposing the new Fuller framework with multi-level gradient calibration and lightweight transformer task heads. The thorough experiments demonstrate clear improvements over existing methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some key future research directions suggested in the paper:

- Developing more advanced techniques for gradient calibration to balance tasks and modalities during multi-task multi-modal learning. The authors propose multi-level gradient calibration as an initial approach, but mention there is room for improvement.

- Exploring different network architectures and objective functions that are inherently more compatible with multi-task multi-modal learning. The authors use a fairly standard backbone network and loss functions. Custom architectures and losses could further improve training stability.

- Evaluating on more complex benchmarks with additional modalities (e.g. radar), more tasks, and more complex driving scenarios. The authors demonstrate results on nuScenes, but more extensive benchmarks could reveal new challenges.

- Studying how to dynamically calibrate gradients during training as the importance of tasks/modalities changes over time. The current approach uses fixed calibration. Adaptive calibration may lead to better optimization.

- Investigating metrics beyond gradient magnitude to calibrate tasks and modalities, potentially incorporating gradient direction as well. This could provide a more nuanced view of compatibility between tasks/modalities.

- Exploring the theoretical underpinnings of multi-task multi-modal learning more formally using principles from optimization, game theory, etc. This could lead to new principled calibration techniques.

In summary, the authors suggest continuing to improve multi-level gradient calibration, designing compatible network architectures, testing on more complex benchmarks, dynamically adapting calibration, using more nuanced calibration metrics, and formalizing the theory behind multi-task multi-modal learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called Fuller that integrates multi-modality fusion and multi-task learning for 3D perception in autonomous driving scenarios. It aims to address the issues of modality bias and task conflict that arise when naively combining these approaches. The key idea is to calibrate the gradients during end-to-end training using a multi-level approach. First, inter-gradient calibration balances the gradients from different task losses applied to the shared backbone to prevent one task overwhelming another. Second, intra-gradient calibration equalizes the gradient magnitudes from different modality branches before they separate, ensuring the modalities are learned at the same pace. Experiments on nuScenes show Fuller improves both 3D detection and map segmentation over a strong baseline, increasing mIoU by 14.4% and mAP by 1.4%. The results demonstrate Fuller can effectively unify multi-modality fusion and multi-task learning by mitigating modality bias and task conflict.
