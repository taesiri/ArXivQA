# [Generative Active Learning for Image Synthesis Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14987)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generative models like diffusion models have shown impressive capability in generating compelling images. However, their performance depends heavily on the availability of high-quality training data, which is expensive to collect. Using synthetic samples to augment real samples can improve model capabilities. 
- Active learning aims to select the most informative samples for labeling to maximize model performance with minimal cost. But it has been mainly studied for discriminative models, not generative models. Applying active learning to select informative synthetic samples for improving generative models is still an open challenge.

Main Challenges:
- Generative active learning (GAL) faces an open-ended querying scenario unlike closed-form querying in discriminative active learning. It is hard to compare information between samples or determine querying directions without first generating samples. This creates a causal loop.
- Strategies based on evaluating individual samples do not apply to GAL as generative models handle multiple complex mixed semantics unlike discriminative models targeting simple concepts.  
- Balancing exploitation of early informative iterations and exploration of new directions is important but hard.

Proposed Methods:
- Introduce anchor directions represented as embedded prompts to transform open-ended querying into a semi-open problem with some constraints.
- Propose direction-based uncertainty sampling strategy that measures uncertainty as entropy of overfitted and non-overfitted samples on an anchor direction.
- Estimate overfitting by fidelity of generations to the anchor prompt and non-subject-of-interest semantics.  
- Balance exploitation and exploration by weighting reference images from a round by the round's openness score.

Main Results:
- Outperforms random, human-based, and SOTA active learning strategies for image synthesis personalization.
- Uncertainty sampling enables selection of informative directions and exploration. Balancing prevents early overfitting.
- Human feedback with balancing provides an estimate of optimal performance. The proposed method approaches this estimate.
- Significantly outperforms SOTA methods like StyleDrop and DreamBooth for both style and object-driven personalization.

In summary, the paper presents a novel direction-based active learning framework tailored for generative models to effectively select informative synthetic samples for improving personalization capability. The experimental results validate the efficacy of this method.
