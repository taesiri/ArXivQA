# [Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving Using a Transformer Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16501)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Predicting surrounding vehicles' future trajectories is critical for safe autonomous driving. However, this is an inherently challenging task due to the significant variability in agents' actions and preferences. Most prior works use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model temporal dependencies in trajectory data. This paper argues that RNNs have limitations in modeling longer sequences and Transformer networks are better at sequential modeling tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Context-Aware Transformer (CATF) model to predict surrounding vehicles' multimodal future trajectories conditioned on contextual information. The key components are:

1. A context-aware module extracts bird's eye view scene features using a CNN backbone. This provides relevant contextual cues to the model. 

2. A Transformer encoder-decoder architecture models temporal dependencies and generates multimodal trajectory predictions for each agent. 

3. A novel auxiliary off-road loss penalizes infeasible predictions outside the drivable area. This is combined with the main classification loss in a multi-task learning framework.

4. To reduce the computational complexity of multi-head attention, a linear projection technique is used leading to the CATF_l model.

Main Contributions:

1. Proposes one of the first Transformer-based models for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving. Shows Transformers outperform RNN baselines.

2. Injects scene context information into the model using a CNN feature extractor. Demonstrates including contextual cues improves performance.  

3. Introduces an off-road loss to constrain predictions to be more feasible. This significantly reduces the off-road rate.

4. The CATF model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Lyft L5 prediction benchmark, outperforming prior LSTM and CNN baselines.

In summary, the paper presents a novel context-aware Transformer approach for multimodal trajectory prediction that generates accurate and feasible predictions conditioned on scene context. The method advances the state-of-the-art on a large-scale autonomous driving dataset.
