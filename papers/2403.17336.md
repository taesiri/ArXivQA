# [Don't Listen To Me: Understanding and Exploring Jailbreak Prompts of   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17336)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper systematically studies jailbreak attacks against large language models, including analyzing existing attack strategies, investigating the human process of crafting attacks, and exploring the feasibility of automating jailbreak prompt generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It provides a comprehensive systemization of existing jailbreak prompts by collecting 448 real-world prompts and categorizing them into five categories with ten unique patterns. This helps gain a structured understanding of common jailbreak strategies.

2) It evaluates the efficacy of different jailbreak strategies by assessing three state-of-the-art commercial LLMs using proposed statistical metrics based on human annotations. The results identify the most effective strategies and reveal the existence of universal jailbreak prompts. 

3) It conducts a user study with 92 participants to unveil the process of humans manually creating jailbreak prompts. This identifies new prompt patterns and shows even inexperienced users can succeed in jailbreaking.

4) Building on the user study insights, it develops an interactive system using AI to automatically refine failed prompts to successful ones that can elicit prohibited content. This demonstrates the feasibility of automating semantically meaningful jailbreak prompt generation.

In summary, the key contribution is providing a comprehensive analysis into the emerging threat of jailbreaking large language models from multiple perspectives - systemizing existing prompts, evaluating their efficacy, understanding manual creation process, and exploring automatic generation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two new metrics, Expected Maximum Harmfulness (EMH) and Jailbreak Success Rate (JSR), to quantify the efficacy of jailbreak prompts. How exactly are these metrics calculated and what are the key differences between them? What are the limitations of using these metrics?

2. The paper conducts an ablation study on one of the universal jailbreak prompts to understand the key factors contributing to its efficacy. What are some other semantic or structural elements that could be manipulated in the ablation study to further analyze universal jailbreak prompts?  

3. The paper finds that longer, more complex jailbreak prompts tend to be more successful at eliciting detailed harmful responses from the target LLMs. What are some potential reasons behind this observation? How can this insight be utilized to make jailbreaking attacks more potent?

4. In the user study, what factors contribute to the variation in jailbreaking effectiveness across different participant groups? How can future studies better control for and quantify the impacts of factors like gender, age, expertise level etc. on jailbreak outcomes?

5. The paper proposes an automatic jailbreak generation framework involving an LLM assistant. What are some limitations of using an LLM to judge the harmfulness of responses for guiding the optimization process? How can this quantification of harmfulness be improved?

6. Beyond the three transformation techniques explored in the paper, what are some other semantic or structural mutations that could be automatically applied to prompts in the proposed automatic jailbreaking framework? 

7. The user study finds that humans are capable of creating successful jailbreaks even without expertise. What does this imply about the feasibility of jailbreaking attacks proliferating among general LLM users? How can defenses be strengthened against this threat?

8. How reliable and scalable are the human annotations used to label LLM responses and quantify jailbreak efficacy in this study? What are some ways to address these limitations in future work?  

9. What ethical considerations need to be made regarding the disclosure of discovered jailbreak prompts and collaboration with LLM developers? How can the insights from this study be shared responsibly?

10. The study focuses primarily on text-based LLMs. How do the jailbreaking attacks and defenses differ for multimodal LLMs that can generate images, videos, and other non-text content? What additional risks need to be considered?
