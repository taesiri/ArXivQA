# [GrASP: Gradient-Based Affordance Selection for Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04772)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents GrASP, an algorithm for gradient-based affordance selection for planning in reinforcement learning (RL) problems with continuous action or option spaces. 

The central research question is how to effectively deal with continuous action spaces when using tree-search planning methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The key challenge is that it is not feasible to expand every possible action at each node when the action space is continuous. 

The main hypothesis is that we can learn to select a small set of "affordance" actions or options that are useful to consider during the tree expansion process in planning. The affordances would be selected in a goal-and-state-conditional way, so that different affordances are chosen depending on the state and goal. 

The key ideas are:

- Represent affordances as parametric mappings from states (and goals) to actions/options. Learning to select K affordances means learning K such mappings. 

- Use gradients through the planning computations to update the parameters of the affordance mapping functions. This allows dynamically discovering good affordances online during learning and planning.

- Show that it is possible to simultaneously learn good affordances and a value-equivalent model of their effects, such that planning performance is competitive or better than model-free RL on several benchmark domains.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is focused on using gradients through planning to dynamically discover a small set of affordances or high-level actions that are useful for tree-search planning in continuous action/option spaces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Introducing the idea of using gradient-based optimization to learn a small set of "affordance mappings" to select good actions or options to consider during tree-based planning in reinforcement learning problems with continuous action spaces. 

- Proposing the GrASP algorithm which computes gradients through the planning procedure to update the parameters of the neural network functions representing the affordance mappings. This allows for online discovery of useful affordances for planning.

- Demonstrating empirically that GrASP can successfully learn both primitive action and temporally-extended option affordances in several benchmark RL control tasks, despite the non-stationarity inherent in simultaneously learning the affordances and a value-equivalent model.

- Showing that planning using the discovered affordances and learned model can often outperform model-free TD3, a strong baseline, in terms of sample efficiency. This helps address the challenge of effective planning with continuous actions.

- Providing evidence that learning multiple affordance mappings is useful, as the planning policy exhibits clear switching between the outputs of the different heads, and outperforms using any single affordance mapping as the policy.

- Illustrating the generality of the approach by using different planners (shallow complete-tree search and UCT) with the affordances, and by learning affordances in both the options setting and for primitive actions.

So in summary, the key ideas are using gradients to discover useful affordances for planning in continuous action RL, and empirically demonstrating that this GrASP method can enable more effective planning and improve over model-free approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper introduces GrASP, a method for gradient-based affordance selection for planning that computes gradients through the planning procedure to update parameters of functions representing affordances, in order to deal with continuous action spaces where considering every action during tree-search planning is infeasible.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in the field of affordance learning and planning for reinforcement learning agents:

- The idea of using affordances (learned state-to-action mappings) to guide planning in continuous action spaces is novel. Most prior work on affordances focuses on using hand-designed affordances or learning affordances directly from object features. This paper introduces the idea of learning affordances by taking gradients through the planning process.

- The GrASP algorithm is one of the first approaches to try learning affordances in tandem with a value-equivalent model for planning. Many model-based RL methods like PILCO learn models separately from policies. GrASP shows it is feasible to simultaneously learn a model and useful affordances via planning gradients.

- GrASP demonstrates affordance learning for both low-level actions and temporally-extended options. Most prior affordance research looks at object-related affordances for primitive actions. This paper shows affordances can be discovered at multiple levels of abstraction.

- The empirical results demonstrate GrASP can learn good affordances quickly enough to compete with strong model-free baselines on several continuous control tasks. This helps show the viability of this method, though more work is needed to scale it up further.  

- Compared to state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithms like MuZero or Dreamer, GrASP has not yet shown superior performance. The strength of this work lies more in the ideas than achieving new benchmarks. Extending it to match advanced model-based methods is an interesting direction.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel conceptual approach of using planning gradients to learn affordances, demonstrates promising initial results, but further development of the core ideas is likely needed to achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex tasks. The affordance learning framework seems promising and differentiated from prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

1. Integrating the affordance discovery method into more sophisticated model-based RL algorithms like MuZero to scale up to larger and more complex domains. The paper shows the affordance discovery method works with simple planners, but integrating it into state-of-the-art model-based RL would be an important next step.

2. Exploring different neural network architectures for the affordance module beyond the simple multi-headed feedforward network used in the paper. The fixed number of outputs may limit the flexibility and scalability of the approach.

3. Considering forms of affordance discovery that do not rely on a fixed discrete set of affordances. The paper discusses always choosing a fixed number K affordances, but more flexible ways of generating affordances could be beneficial.

4. Experimenting with different planning algorithms like MCTS beyond the simple complete tree search and UCT methods shown in the paper. More sophisticated planning methods may yield additional benefits.

5. Comparing the affordance discovery approach to other state-of-the-art methods for dealing with continuous action spaces in model-based RL, like recent extensions of MuZero. The paper shows the approach is promising but a direct comparison on standard benchmarks would be informative.

6. Exploring whether the idea of affordance discovery could be useful in model-free RL methods that employ planning, not just model-based methods. The core idea of selecting useful actions for planning may have broader applications.

In summary, the main suggestions are to integrate the affordance discovery idea into more advanced model-based RL algorithms, explore more sophisticated neural network architectures and planning methods, systematically compare to other state-of-the-art approaches, and investigate wider applications beyond model-based RL.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents an algorithmic LaTeX style file called "algorithm" that defines a floating algorithm environment for LaTeX documents. The style allows algorithms to be specified in pseudocode within this floating environment so they can be numbered, captioned, and referenced in a LaTeX document like figures and tables. It provides several formatting options for the visual style of the algorithm box (plain, ruled, boxed). It also allows control over the numbering and placement of algorithms by allowing the numbering to be reset within document divisions like parts, chapters, sections, etc. or to have continuous numbering throughout the whole document. Overall, this LaTeX package provides a clean way to present algorithms visually separated from the main text in a customizable style with consistent numbering and referencing.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a LaTeX style package called algorithm for creating floating algorithms in LaTeX documents. The package allows algorithms to be specified in pseudocode and float to appropriate locations in the document like figures and tables. 

The package provides several options for customizing the appearance and behavior of the algorithms, including whether they appear in plain, ruled or boxed styles. It also allows specifying the numbering convention, like having algorithms numbered within parts, chapters, sections, etc. of the document. The command \listofalgorithms generates a list of algorithms. The overall goal of the package is to provide an easy way to include algorithms specified in pseudocode into LaTeX documents, while giving control over their formatting and behavior like other floating elements. The package aims to improve over using figure environments for including algorithms by providing better formatting options and integration.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method presented in the paper:

The paper proposes GrASP, a gradient-based method for learning to select affordances - small sets of useful actions or options - for use in planning. The key idea is that the parameters of an affordance selection module can be updated via gradients computed through the planning procedure. Specifically, the affordance module maps states (and goals in multi-task settings) to a small discrete set of actions or options. This allows constructing a planning tree by expanding each state node with the afforded actions/options. The planning tree is used to estimate state values, and gradients are taken through the planning computations with respect to the affordance module parameters. These gradients are then used to update the affordance module to maximize the root state value. Simultaneously, a value-equivalent model is learned for use inside the planner. The method is evaluated on several continuous control tasks, where it is shown to learn useful affordances quickly enough to enable effective planning and outperform model-free baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be introducing a LaTeX style file called "algorithm.sty" for formatting algorithms in LaTeX documents. 

Some of the key points:

- The package provides a new "algorithm" floating environment for displaying algorithms in a LaTeX document, similar to how figures and tables work. 

- It allows algorithms to be numbered, captioned, and listed separately like figures and tables.

- The visual style of the algorithm can be customized - it supports plain, ruled, or boxed styles.

- The numbering and placement of algorithms can be configured - they can be numbered within chapters, sections, etc. or sequentially through the whole document.

- New commands are provided like \listofalgorithms to generate a list of algorithms.

So in summary, it addresses the problem of how to nicely format and display algorithms with captions, numbering, and custom visual styles in LaTeX documents. It provides a clean solution by creating a new standardized "algorithm" environment and associated commands modeled after LaTeX's existing floating environments like figure and table.

The package aims to make working with algorithms in LaTeX documents easier and more consistent by handling the formatting and display automatically.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms are:

- Affordances - The concept of affordances, referring to actions that are perceivable and can be performed based on the state of the environment, is central to this work. The paper focuses on learning to select useful affordances for planning.

- Gradient-based learning - The proposed GrASP algorithm uses gradients to update the parameters of the affordance functions, computing gradients through the planning procedure. This is a key aspect of the method.

- Planning - The paper is situated in the context of using learned models for planning in reinforcement learning. Discovering good affordances is posed as a way to enable effective planning with continuous action spaces.

- Options - The affordances considered include options or temporally extended actions, not just primitive actions. Learning to select useful options is examined.

- Value-equivalent models - The GrASP agents learn value-equivalent models, which aim to predict state values rather than observations. This is in contrast to more traditional observation prediction models.

- Tree search - The affordances are used to focus tree search by restricting the actions considered at each node. Both shallow complete tree search and UCT (a MCTS algorithm) are investigated for planning.

- Continuous action/option spaces - A key challenge the paper aims to address is dealing with large or continuous action/option spaces in model-based reinforcement learning and planning.

In summary, the key ideas have to do with using gradients to learn affordance selections to enable effective planning with learned models in continuous spaces, using both primitive actions and options.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes GrASP, a novel method for learning to select useful affordances for planning in reinforcement learning agents with continuous action spaces. The key idea is to learn a small set of affordance mappings from states (and goals) to actions/options that serve to focus the planning search tree. The affordance mappings are represented as neural networks and their parameters are optimized via gradients through the planning computations to maximize the value estimate at the root of the search tree. Experiments demonstrate GrASP's ability to learn good primitive action and option affordances on both control tasks and navigation tasks with pretrained options, often outperforming strong model-free baselines. The method discovers intuitive affordances like object-centric options even when the full option space is not object-oriented. Analysis shows evidence of non-trivial switching between the learned affordances during planning. Overall, GrASP offers a promising approach to integrating learned models and planning in continuous domains by focusing planning via learned affordances. The method helps address a key challenge in scaling model-based RL.

 The paper presents GrASP, a gradient-based method to learn affordance selections for planning in reinforcement learning agents dealing with continuous action spaces.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents GrASP, a method for gradient-based affordance selection for planning in reinforcement learning. The key idea is to learn a small set of affordances - actions or options useful for planning - from a large continuous action space. This allows tree-search planning methods to be applied effectively in continuous domains by only expanding each node with the learned affordances rather than all possible actions. GrASP learns affordance mappings, implemented as neural networks, that take in a state (and goal in multi-task settings) and output a small set of actions/options. The affordance module parameters are trained by computing gradients through the planning procedure to maximize the value estimate at the root node of the planning tree. Experiments on hierarchical control tasks with continuous option spaces and DeepMind control suite tasks with continuous action spaces demonstrate that GrASP can learn useful affordances quickly while simultaneously learning a value-equivalent model. Using the learned affordances for planning results in better sample efficiency than model-free methods in most tasks. Analysis shows evidence of switching between affordance mappings, indicating they are useful as affordances rather than collapsing to policies.
