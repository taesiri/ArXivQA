# [FM-G-CAM: A Holistic Approach for Explainable AI in Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05975)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explainability is crucial for real-world use of AI models, especially computer vision models. 
- Existing methods like Grad-CAM generate saliency maps to visually explain model predictions, but focus only on a single target class.
- This neglects much of the model's rationale behind a prediction. Top-1 accuracy can be very different from top-5 accuracy in image classifiers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FM-G-CAM, which generates saliency maps using multiple top predicted classes instead of just one class.
- This provides a more holistic explanation of the model's decision making process.
- FM-G-CAM calculates gradient-weighted activation maps per class. These are filtered, normalized, and fused into a final multicolor saliency map.

Main Contributions:
- Concise review of existing saliency map techniques and their limitations
- Introduction of FM-G-CAM method with mathematical formulation and algorithms
- Comparative examples against Grad-CAM highlighting benefits on real images and chest X-rays
- Open source Python library for convenient usage of FM-G-CAM

In summary, the paper identifies an issue with single-class saliency maps not capturing the full context behind a prediction. It proposes a multi-class approach via FM-G-CAM that gives a more holistic visual explanation of the model's reasoning. Comparisons and code are provided to demonstrate the utility of this new method.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new method called Fused Multi-class Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (FM-G-CAM) that generates visual explanations for CNN image classifications by fusing saliency maps from multiple top predicted classes to provide a more holistic explanation of the model's rationale compared to only explaining the single top predicted class.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A concise review of existing saliency map generation techniques for explaining CNN predictions. The paper discusses similarities, differences, and drawbacks of these techniques, highlighting gaps that exist. 

2. A holistic approach called Fused Multi-class Gradient-weighted Activation Map (FM-G-CAM) to explain CNN predictions by considering multiple top predicted classes instead of just one class. This provides a more comprehensive visualization of the model's rationale. The method is explained mathematically and algorithmically.

3. Practical usage examples comparing FM-G-CAM to Grad-CAM on general image classification and medical image diagnosis. This highlights the benefits of FM-G-CAM in providing a unified visualization instead of separate class-based saliency maps.

4. An open-source Python library implementing FM-G-CAM to allow convenient generation of saliency maps to explain CNN model predictions.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of FM-G-CAM to holistically explain CNN predictions by fusing saliency maps from multiple top predicted classes into a unified visualization. This aims to overcome the limitation of existing methods that focus only on one target class.
