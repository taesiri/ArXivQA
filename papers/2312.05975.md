# [FM-G-CAM: A Holistic Approach for Explainable AI in Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05975)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explainability is crucial for real-world use of AI models, especially computer vision models. 
- Existing methods like Grad-CAM generate saliency maps to visually explain model predictions, but focus only on a single target class.
- This neglects much of the model's rationale behind a prediction. Top-1 accuracy can be very different from top-5 accuracy in image classifiers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FM-G-CAM, which generates saliency maps using multiple top predicted classes instead of just one class.
- This provides a more holistic explanation of the model's decision making process.
- FM-G-CAM calculates gradient-weighted activation maps per class. These are filtered, normalized, and fused into a final multicolor saliency map.

Main Contributions:
- Concise review of existing saliency map techniques and their limitations
- Introduction of FM-G-CAM method with mathematical formulation and algorithms
- Comparative examples against Grad-CAM highlighting benefits on real images and chest X-rays
- Open source Python library for convenient usage of FM-G-CAM

In summary, the paper identifies an issue with single-class saliency maps not capturing the full context behind a prediction. It proposes a multi-class approach via FM-G-CAM that gives a more holistic visual explanation of the model's reasoning. Comparisons and code are provided to demonstrate the utility of this new method.
