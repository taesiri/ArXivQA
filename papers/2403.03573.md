# [Time-optimal Point-to-point Motion Planning: A Two-stage Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03573)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of time-optimal point-to-point motion planning, which involves computing the fastest trajectory to move a system from an initial state to a desired terminal state while satisfying constraints.
- Two existing approaches have limitations: 1) The time scaling approach can result in coarse trajectories and infeasibilities when interpolated for control; 2) The exponential weighting approach requires a very long horizon and has numerical issues.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a two-stage approach that combines the benefits of the time scaling and exponential weighting formulations. 
- Stage 1 uses a short, fixed horizon with fixed discretization. This avoids interpolation errors when applying the control.
- Stage 2 uses a time-scaled formulation with variable discretization to achieve time-optimality.
- The two stages are linked with an equality constraint. The objective function balances optimality across the stages.

- To handle long computation times, an asynchronous nonlinear MPC (NMPC) strategy called ASAP-MPC is integrated. This selects a future predicted state for replanning to account for delays.

Main Contributions:
- The two-stage formulation enables time-optimal planning with short horizons for tractability, avoids interpolation feasibility issues, and prevents numerical problems.
- Integration with ASAP-MPC enables real-time replanning by accounting for fluctuating computation times in a principled manner.
- Numerical simulations demonstrate the approach solves a complex time-optimal planning problem with obstacles faster than previous formulations.
- The approach facilitates implementation on embedded systems for physical time-optimal planning tasks.

In summary, the paper makes key contributions in formulating and solving time-optimal planning problems to enable real-time performance even with constraints and computational delays. The two-stage approach balances optimality, robustness and efficiency.
