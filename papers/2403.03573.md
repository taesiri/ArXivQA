# [Time-optimal Point-to-point Motion Planning: A Two-stage Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03573)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of time-optimal point-to-point motion planning, which involves computing the fastest trajectory to move a system from an initial state to a desired terminal state while satisfying constraints.
- Two existing approaches have limitations: 1) The time scaling approach can result in coarse trajectories and infeasibilities when interpolated for control; 2) The exponential weighting approach requires a very long horizon and has numerical issues.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a two-stage approach that combines the benefits of the time scaling and exponential weighting formulations. 
- Stage 1 uses a short, fixed horizon with fixed discretization. This avoids interpolation errors when applying the control.
- Stage 2 uses a time-scaled formulation with variable discretization to achieve time-optimality.
- The two stages are linked with an equality constraint. The objective function balances optimality across the stages.

- To handle long computation times, an asynchronous nonlinear MPC (NMPC) strategy called ASAP-MPC is integrated. This selects a future predicted state for replanning to account for delays.

Main Contributions:
- The two-stage formulation enables time-optimal planning with short horizons for tractability, avoids interpolation feasibility issues, and prevents numerical problems.
- Integration with ASAP-MPC enables real-time replanning by accounting for fluctuating computation times in a principled manner.
- Numerical simulations demonstrate the approach solves a complex time-optimal planning problem with obstacles faster than previous formulations.
- The approach facilitates implementation on embedded systems for physical time-optimal planning tasks.

In summary, the paper makes key contributions in formulating and solving time-optimal planning problems to enable real-time performance even with constraints and computational delays. The two-stage approach balances optimality, robustness and efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a two-stage approach to formulate the time-optimal point-to-point motion planning problem, combining the advantages of fixed time grid and variable time grid formulations, and integrates it with an asynchronous nonlinear model predictive control update strategy to handle fluctuating computation times.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a two-stage approach to formulate the time-optimal point-to-point motion planning problem. Specifically:

- The two-stage approach combines the advantages of the time scaling approach and the exponential weighting approach to formulate the time-optimal OCP. It uses a fixed and low number of control steps in the first stage for computational manageability, and avoids interpolation errors associated with the time scaling approach.

- The paper integrates the two-stage approach with an asynchronous NMPC (ASAP-MPC) update strategy to handle fluctuating and delayed computation times in solving the time-optimal OCP online. This facilitates replanning in real-time.

- The effectiveness of the two-stage approach and its integration with ASAP-MPC is demonstrated through numerical examples of autonomous navigation with collision avoidance. The examples highlight the advantages over other existing approaches in the literature.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the two-stage formulation for the time-optimal OCP and its integration with ASAP-MPC to enable real-time replanning for autonomous systems. The advantages are shown numerically for autonomous navigation scenarios.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The two-stage approach combines a fixed time grid in stage 1 and a variable time grid in stage 2. What are the advantages of having this combination compared to using only a fixed or only a variable time grid?

2. In the objective function for the two-stage approach, there are weighting factors $w_1$ and $w_2$. These weights change depending on whether the system is in the initial or end phase. Explain the rationale behind how these weights are set in each of these phases. 

3. The two-stage approach is integrated with an asynchronous NMPC (ASAP-MPC) update strategy. Explain why an asynchronous update strategy is needed compared to a classical NMPC update approach when dealing with fluctuating computation times.

4. In the ASAP-MPC update strategy, a future predicted state is used as the initial state for replanning. Explain the assumptions needed on the tracking controller performance to ensure this predicted future state aligns well with the actual future state. 

5. Compare and contrast the exponential weighting approach and the two-stage approach in how they ensure time-optimality over a finite prediction horizon. What are limitations of using only the exponential weighting approach?

6. One of the advantages mentioned for the two-stage approach is avoiding interpolation errors. Explain where such errors can arise in the time scaling approach and why they can lead to infeasibility. 

7. The paper compares three approaches on a point-mass unicycle model with an elliptical obstacle avoidance constraint. Suggest another example system and constraints that could benefit from using the two-stage time-optimal planning approach.

8. The computational performance of the approaches is compared in Section IV-A. Analyze the factors that contribute most to the computational complexity of each approach.

9. In the ASAP-MPC example, the computation time remains under 25*ts. Discuss how the horizon lengths N1 and N2 could be adapted if longer computation times are expected. 

10. The final example shows the system reaching the desired terminal state in an open loop fashion. Propose some ways the method could be extended to handle disturbances and uncertainties to ensure robustness.
