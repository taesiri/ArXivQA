# [TaskFlex Solver for Multi-Agent Pursuit via Automatic Curriculum   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12255)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of multi-agent pursuit, where slow pursuers cooperate to capture fast evaders in a confined environment with obstacles. Existing heuristic algorithms often lack expressive coordination strategies and are highly sensitive to task conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods can obtain cooperative strategies but face challenges in training for complex scenarios due to vast amounts of required training data and limited adaptability to varying task conditions.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes the TaskFlex Solver (TFS), which combines RL and curriculum learning to solve multi-agent pursuit problems with diverse and dynamically changing task conditions in both 2D and 3D scenarios. TFS consists of two main components:

1) Task Evaluator: Evaluates task success rates in a given task pool and selects tasks of moderate difficulty to construct a curriculum learning archive. 

2) Task Sampler: Constructs the training distribution by sampling tasks from the curriculum archive and task pool to maximize policy improvement.

Main Contributions:

- TFS utilizes a curriculum learning method that automatically constructs task distributions based on training progress, enhancing efficiency and performance.

- Experiments show TFS produces much stronger performance than baselines and achieves close to 100% capture rates in both 2D and 3D multi-agent pursuit problems with diverse and dynamically changing scenes.

- TFS is the first algorithm that can solve the multi-agent pursuit problem with different task conditions in 3D scenarios. All baselines fail in 3D while TFS obtains over 90% capture rates.

- Analysis shows TFS learns cooperative strategies with key phases of chasing, formation, and coordinated approach, while baselines lack such expressive coordination.

In summary, TFS advances the state-of-the-art in applying RL to multi-agent pursuit by using curriculum learning to enable training over diverse and dynamic conditions in complex 3D scenarios.
