# [Rule-driven News Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05101)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing news image captioning methods have achieved good performance by relying on large-scale pre-trained models. However, they overlook the fundamental rules of news reporting, such as accurately describing the individuals and actions associated with the event depicted in the image. They focus only on the correlation between input news content and output captions.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a rule-driven news captioning method that can generate captions following designated rule signals. The key components are:

1) Named Entity Extraction: Extract named entities from news articles using pre-trained NER, and match them to image content using CLIP image-text similarity.

2) News Rule Construction: Design a "news-aware semantic rule" that incorporates the primary action in the image (e.g. "performing") and the roles of related named entities (e.g. "Agent", "Place"). This links image content to article entities.

3) Caption Generation: Inject the semantic rule into multiple encoder layers of BART using prefix-tuning. This guides BART to generate captions adhering to the news rule.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose a novel rule-driven captioning method that enables following designated rule signals, unlike existing methods focusing only on input-output correlation.

2) Design a news-aware semantic rule encompassing primary image action and roles of related named entities. Inject this into BART using prefix-tuning for guided caption generation.

3) Demonstrate state-of-the-art or competitive performance on GoodNews and NYTimes800k datasets. Particularly, achieve significant 8.93% CIDEr improvement over best existing method on GoodNews.

4) Confirm the efficacy of the approach through ablation studies and visualization of constructed semantic rules.

In summary, the paper presents a new perspective of rule-driven captioning for news images and demonstrates its effectiveness quantitatively and qualitatively. The core novelty is the injection of a specially designed news-aware semantic rule into the caption generation model.
