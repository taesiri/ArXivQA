# [Survey on Trustworthy Graph Neural Networks: From A Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12477)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent research efforts on causality-inspired graph neural networks (CIGNNs). It highlights the importance of equipping GNNs with causal learning abilities to enhance their trustworthiness in terms of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability, fairness, and explainability.

The paper first analyzes the rationale behind the poor performance of mainstream GNNs on the three trustworthiness aspects from a causal perspective. It argues that the susceptibility of GNNs to capturing spurious correlations instead of genuine causal mechanisms is the fundamental reason. The paper then proposes a taxonomy to categorize existing CIGNNs based on the type of causal learning capability they incorporate, i.e. causal reasoning and causal representation learning. 

For causal reasoning empowered CIGNNs, the paper focuses on group-level and individual-level causal effect estimation techniques as well as counterfactual explanation generation methods. It reviews causal strategies such as backdoor adjustment, frontdoor adjustment, matching, intervention, etc. that have been tailored to graphs to eliminate spurious correlations. For causal representation learning empowered CIGNNs, the paper introduces supervised methods under group invariant learning frameworks and self-supervised methods under graph contrastive learning frameworks. It highlights how these methods enable the learning of causal graph representations.

The paper also summarizes useful open-source benchmarks, data synthesis strategies, evaluation metrics and codes to facilitate future research endeavors. Finally, it discusses promising future directions including scaling up CIGNNs, developing causality-inspired graph foundation models, integrating causal discovery into CIGNNs, and extending graph counterfactual fairness notions.

In summary, this paper provides valuable insights into emerging CIGNNs from a causality perspective and offers an instructive guidance for future explorations in this direction to establish more trustworthy and reliable graph learning solutions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this survey paper on causality-inspired graph neural networks:

1. The paper categorizes existing works into causal reasoning and causal representation learning groups. What are the key differences between these two capabilities and how do they contribute to improving graph neural network trustworthiness?

2. The paper reviews several techniques like backdoor adjustment and frontdoor adjustment for estimating group-level causal effects on graphs. What assumptions do these techniques make and what are their limitations in the context of complex graph data? 

3. Deep generative modeling is discussed as a method for individual-level causal effect estimation. What are the main challenges in learning fine-grained structural causal models from raw graph data?

4. How does the idea of invariant learning enable supervised causal representation learning on graphs? What objectives and constraints are commonly adopted to guide the learning towards invariant causal representations?

5. What graph augmentation strategies have been explored under the self-supervised learning paradigm to generate views for contrastive causal representation learning? What similarity measurements are suitable for this task?

6. What tailoring is needed to adapt the global variable decorrelation idea from the tabular domain to graphs for mitigating latent feature biases in GNNs?

7. The paper argues that the graph counterfactual fairness notion sets a higher standard than correlation-based fairness notions. Why is this the case and what objectives can promote a GNN model to achieve graph counterfactual fairness?  

8. What are the main challenges in using causal intervention to estimate individual-level treatment effects for subgraphs to generate reliable instance explanations for GNNs?

9. Continuous optimization methods define objectives aligned with the graph counterfactual explanation definition to learn explanation masks. What are the main limitations of such methods?
