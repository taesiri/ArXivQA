# [Survey on Trustworthy Graph Neural Networks: From A Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12477)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent research efforts on causality-inspired graph neural networks (CIGNNs). It highlights the importance of equipping GNNs with causal learning abilities to enhance their trustworthiness in terms of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability, fairness, and explainability.

The paper first analyzes the rationale behind the poor performance of mainstream GNNs on the three trustworthiness aspects from a causal perspective. It argues that the susceptibility of GNNs to capturing spurious correlations instead of genuine causal mechanisms is the fundamental reason. The paper then proposes a taxonomy to categorize existing CIGNNs based on the type of causal learning capability they incorporate, i.e. causal reasoning and causal representation learning. 

For causal reasoning empowered CIGNNs, the paper focuses on group-level and individual-level causal effect estimation techniques as well as counterfactual explanation generation methods. It reviews causal strategies such as backdoor adjustment, frontdoor adjustment, matching, intervention, etc. that have been tailored to graphs to eliminate spurious correlations. For causal representation learning empowered CIGNNs, the paper introduces supervised methods under group invariant learning frameworks and self-supervised methods under graph contrastive learning frameworks. It highlights how these methods enable the learning of causal graph representations.

The paper also summarizes useful open-source benchmarks, data synthesis strategies, evaluation metrics and codes to facilitate future research endeavors. Finally, it discusses promising future directions including scaling up CIGNNs, developing causality-inspired graph foundation models, integrating causal discovery into CIGNNs, and extending graph counterfactual fairness notions.

In summary, this paper provides valuable insights into emerging CIGNNs from a causality perspective and offers an instructive guidance for future explorations in this direction to establish more trustworthy and reliable graph learning solutions.
