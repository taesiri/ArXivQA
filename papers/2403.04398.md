# [MAGR: Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization for Continual Action Quality   Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04398)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of continually refining action quality assessment (AQA) models to adapt to evolving individual skills over time. For example, in applications like athlete rehabilitation monitoring, movement quality evolves across recovery stages. This poses challenges for traditional AQA methods trained on static datasets. The paper introduces a new task called Continual AQA (CAQA) to enable continuous adaptation of AQA models using sparse new data without catastrophic forgetting of past knowledge.

A key challenge in CAQA is the misalignment between static old features extracted by the model backbone and the dynamically changing feature manifold, resulting in severe catastrophic forgetting. Updating the backbone provides better adaptability but misaligns old features. The paper identifies this as a critical issue needing resolution.

Proposed Solution: 
To address this, the paper proposes Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization (MAGR). The core idea involves two main steps:

1) Manifold Projector (MP) - It learns to estimate the manifold shift using only the current session data to respect privacy. It then translates deviated old features onto the current manifold. This alignment is done dynamically without storing raw data.

2) Intra-Inter-Joint Graph Regularizer (IIJ-GR) - It constructs a graph jointly arranging old and new aligned features based on quality scores. This focuses on realigning feature distributions with evolving quality distributions locally within a session and globally across sessions.

Together, MP and IIJ-GR enable adaptive refinement of AQA models on non-stationary data without catastrophic forgetting.

Contributions:
1) Introduces the new task of CAQA to facilitate lifelong adaptation of AQA models using sparse sequential data.

2) Proposes MAGR to address the misalignment issue in CAQA by correcting deviated old features and aligning feature distributions with dynamic quality distributions across sessions.

3) Extensive experiments on multiple AQA datasets demonstrate that MAGR outperforms recent strong baselines substantially, with correlation gains of up to 15.64%.

4) Establishes benchmarks and protocols to stimulate more research into this important yet understudied Continual AQA direction with real-world significance.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in advancing CL and AQA research by enabling continuous refinement of assessment models amidst non-stationary skill variations. MAGR offers an effective solution while prioritizing privacy.
