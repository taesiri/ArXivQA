# [Hybrid Graph: A Unified Graph Representation with Datasets and   Benchmarks for Complex Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05108)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world networks often involve complex node relations beyond just pairwise connections, which simple graphs cannot capture. Hypergraphs and hierarchical graphs have been introduced, but still cannot fully represent the complexity.
- Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) are usually only evaluated on simple graph datasets, which do not reflect the complexity of real-world graphs. 
- There is a need for a unified representation of complex graphs, as well as comprehensive datasets and evaluation frameworks to understand GNN performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce the concept of "hybrid graphs" - a unified definition of complex graphs that extends simple graphs by allowing hyperedges (connecting multiple nodes) and multiple node hierarchy levels. Hybrid graphs enclose simple graphs, hypergraphs and hierarchical graphs.
- Construct the Hybrid Graph Benchmark (HGB), consisting of 23 real-world hybrid graph datasets across domains like biology, social media, e-commerce. Carefully built to not contain personal information.
- Provide an evaluation framework and codebase with common tasks and metrics to facilitate training and evaluating GNNs on HGB.

Main Contributions:
- Concept of hybrid graphs for unified complex graph representation
- HGB dataset collection with 23 real-world hybrid graphs covering diverse applications 
- Extensible HGB evaluation framework and codebase
- Empirical study revealing: (1) hypergraph GNNs may not outperform simple GNNs on large graphs, (2) sampling helps hypergraph GNNs, (3) combining simple graph and hypergraph information enhances performance.

The paper introduces hybrid graphs as a versatile graph representation to foster further research in representation learning on complex graphs. HGB contributes datasets, an evaluation framework and reveals insights to guide future work.
