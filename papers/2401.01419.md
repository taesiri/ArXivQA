# [To Diverge or Not to Diverge: A Morphosyntactic Perspective on Machine   Translation vs Human Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01419)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper investigates the quantitative differences in translation divergences (structural differences between source and target sentences) between machine translation (MT) and human translation (HT). 
- It is known that translation divergences naturally occur in HT but less is known about how much more conservative MT is compared to HT.

Methodology:
- The authors conduct comparative analyses between MT and HT using fine-grained morphosyntactic patterns based on Universal Dependencies. 
- Experiments are done for three language pairs (English-French, English-German, English-Chinese) using Transformer encoder-decoder models.
- Two types of divergence patterns are analyzed - word-based and arc-based. 
- Analyses are done on diversity, convergence rates, similarity of distributions, and effect on MT quality.

Key Findings:
- MT exhibits less morphosyntactic diversity and more convergence compared to HT. The difference ranges from 6-22% across metrics and language pairs.
- The distributional difference between MT and HT increases for less frequent source patterns.
- Beam search decoding introduces biases that favor convergence even when the model distribution resembles HT. This bias peaks when the convergent pattern appears ~50% of the time in HT.  
- Majority of frequent divergences in HT correlate with reduced MT performance but frequency alone does not fully explain this.

Main Contributions:  
- First large-scale fine-grained comparative analysis of MT vs HT through the lens of morphosyntax.
- Demonstrates quantitatively how much more conservative MT is compared to HT.
- Shows beam search bias towards convergence, especially for patterns occurring ~50% of the time.
- Reveals correlation between some divergences in HT and poorer MT performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper conducts a large-scale comparative analysis between machine translation and human translation through the lens of morphosyntactic divergence, finding machine translation to be more conservative with less diversity, more convergence, and stronger biases from beam search compared to human translation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

Conducting a large-scale fine-grained comparative analysis between machine translations (MT) and human translations (HT) through the lens of morphosyntactic divergence. Specifically, the paper demonstrates quantitatively that MT is more conservative than HT, with less morphosyntactic diversity, more convergent patterns, and more one-to-one alignments. The paper also attributes this discrepancy largely to the use of beam search in MT, and shows that the presence of divergences in HT tends to correlate with decreased MT performance.

In short, the main contribution is a systematic comparative study between MT and HT in terms of fine-grained morphosyntactic patterns, providing new insights into the conservative nature of MT and the challenges that translation divergences present.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Machine translation (MT) vs human translation (HT)
- Morphosyntactic divergence 
- Translation divergence
- Beam search bias
- Diversity of translations
- Convergence rate
- Universal Dependencies
- Control verbs
- Translationese

The paper conducts a comparative analysis between machine translation outputs and human translations through the lens of morphosyntactic divergence. It looks at diversity, convergence rates, alignment patterns, the effect of beam search, and the correlation between divergences in human translations and MT quality. The analysis is done using linguistic annotations from Universal Dependencies. The paper concludes that MT is more conservative and literal compared to human translations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper conducts a comparative analysis between machine translation (MT) and human translation (HT). What are the two types of morphosyntactic divergence used in this analysis and how are they defined? Explain in detail.

2. The paper makes extensive use of conditional probability distributions of target translation patterns given a source pattern. Formally define these probability distributions for MT and HT, and explain how diversity scores and convergence rates are calculated based on them. 

3. Explain how the control and experiment groups are constructed when correlating the presence of a divergence in HT with MT quality. What are the limitations of using BLEU and BLEURT as the metrics here?

4. Wasserstein distance with a unit cost matrix is used to directly measure the distributional difference between MT and HT. Explain what this metric captures intuitively and discuss its advantages over other divergence measures like KL-divergence. 

5. This paper attributes the conservative nature of MT to the use of beam search. What evidence is presented to support this claim? Critically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of this argument.

6. Different language pairs seem to exhibit different degrees of distributional divergence between MT and HT in the paper's analyses. Propose some hypotheses that could explain these cross-lingual differences.  

7. The paper hypothesizes an architectural bias in MT models towards structural convergence. What analyses motivate this hypothesis and what future work could be done to investigate it further?

8. What correlations are found between frequencies of divergent patterns and their impact on MT quality? Critically discuss whether frequency alone can explain the variance in MT performance.

9. The paper relies heavily on automatic tools for annotations. Discuss the limitations this presents in the granularity and types of divergences that can be analyzed. How could future work address these?

10. The analyses focus exclusively on morphosyntactic divergence patterns. What other linguistic aspects could complement this study to develop a more comprehensive understanding of differences between MT and HT?
