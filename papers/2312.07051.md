# [Mask as Supervision: Leveraging Unified Mask Information for   Unsupervised 3D Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07051)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised 3D human pose estimation that utilizes mask information as a supervisory signal. Motivated by the insight that foreground masks contain valuable clues about pose, the method employs a coarse-to-fine scheme with Skeleton and Physique Mask representations to effectively extract pose supervision from masks. Specifically, the Skeleton Mask incorporates structural priors about the human body to constrain predicted keypoints into anatomically feasible configurations. Meanwhile, the Physique Mask utilizes a learned model to refine the overall shape based on the current pose estimate. Additionally, techniques like Geodesic Weighting and Cascaded Optimization are proposed to further enhance performance. Without needing any manual annotations or template models, the method achieves state-of-the-art results among unsupervised techniques on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. Further experiments also demonstrate the ability to leverage extra unlabeled in-the-wild video to improve generalization. By effectively exploiting free supervisory signals from widely available mask data, this work provides an promising direction for scaling up 3D pose estimation.
