# [How the level sampling process impacts zero-shot generalisation in deep   reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03494)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents have limited ability to generalize to new environments, even when the new environments share similarities with environments seen during training. The paper investigates how the sampling strategy of training environment instances (levels) affects the zero-shot generalization ability of RL agents.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors first analyze how mutual information (MI) between the agent's internal representation and the training levels correlates with overfitting to specific instances. Adaptive sampling strategies like prioritized level replay (PLR) that minimize this MI enable better generalization. However, MI cannot be reduced beyond a limit when training over a fixed level set. 

To further reduce MI, the authors propose Self-Supervised Environment Design (SSED) to augment the training set with new levels generated by a variational autoencoder (VAE). The VAE is trained on the initial levels to approximate their distribution. SSED then generates new levels through VAE latent space interpolation and adds high scoring ones to the buffer. An adaptive sampling strategy over this augmented buffer minimizes MI more aggressively.

Contributions:
- Establish connection between instance overfitting and mutual information (MI) between agent representation and level identities
- Show PLR reduces MI and enables better generalization than uniform sampling 
- Propose SSED method to generate new levels from a VAE trained on initial levels
- SSED minimizes MI more effectively by expanding the training set
- SSED outperforms prior level sampling strategies in zero-shot generalization on Minigrid navigation by 1.25-3x

In summary, the paper demonstrates MI is a useful metric correlated with overfitting, and shows both adaptive sampling and training set expansion through SSED can minimize MI and improve generalization ability of RL agents. The SSED framework strikes a balance between reducing overfitting and limiting distribution shift.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates how different level sampling strategies in deep reinforcement learning impact an agent's ability to generalize to new environments, finding that methods which minimize the mutual information between the agent's internal representation and the training levels improve generalization while avoiding overfitting or over-generalization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is proposing a new method called Self-Supervised Environment Design (SSED) for improving the zero-shot generalisation of reinforcement learning agents. SSED generates new training environments using a variational autoencoder while also employing an adaptive sampling strategy over the generated environments. The key ideas behind SSED are:

1) Minimizing the mutual information between the agent's internal representation and the training environments helps reduce overfitting to specific environments. SSED generates new environments in a way that reduces this mutual information.

2) Simply generating new environments in an unconstrained way can cause the training distribution to shift away from the target distribution, leading to over-generalization. SSED uses a variational autoencoder to generate environments in a way that approximates the underlying training distribution, avoiding distribution shift. 

3) Combining environment generation with an adaptive sampling strategy over generated environments is more effective at improving zero-shot generalisation compared to either approach alone. SSED strikes a balance between reducing overfitting and avoiding over-generalization.

Experiments in a Minigrid navigation domain show SSED achieves statistically significant improvements in zero-shot generalisation over other environment generation methods and fixed environment sampling strategies. The key insight is controlling both how new environments are generated and how they are sampled during training.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Zero-shot generalization (ZSG) - The paper investigates how different level sampling strategies affect an agent's ability to generalize to new environments without additional training.

- Mutual information (MI) - The paper analyzes the mutual information between an agent's internal representation and the training levels, finding it correlates with overfitting. Strategies that reduce MI tend to improve ZSG.  

- Overfitting and over-generalization - Two failure modes the paper examines. Overfitting refers to agents learning policies specific to training levels. Over-generalization is when agents learn behaviors incompatible with the target task distribution.

- Adaptive level sampling - Strategies like prioritized level replay that adaptively select training levels rather than uniform sampling. These can reduce MI and improve ZSG.

- Environment generation - Methods like unsupervised environment design (UED) that generate new levels rather than sample from a fixed set. But UED risks over-generalization. 

- Self-supervised environment design (SSED) - Proposed method that uses a VAE to generate new levels, reducing MI while staying close to the training distribution to avoid over-generalization.

- Contextual MDPs (CMDPs) - Formalism used to model a distribution of related environments. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes expected return across CMDP levels.

- Distribution shift - When environment generation methods alter the training distribution in a way that harms performance on the targeted CMDP levels. SSED is designed to minimize this.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the mutual information metric allow the authors to theoretically connect instance overfitting during training to poor generalization performance at test time? What assumptions does this theoretical connection rely on?

2) The paper argues that the value prediction loss encourages the model to learn representations that allow identifying the current level. Explain the reasoning behind this argument and discuss whether you expect other auxiliary losses commonly used in RL (e.g. policy entropy) to have similar effects.  

3) The SSED framework alternates between a generative phase that augments the level set and a replay phase that trains the agent's policy. Discuss the rationale behind separating these two phases rather than performing generation and policy updates concurrently. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages?

4) How does interpolating in the VAE's latent space during the generative phase help improve the quality of the generated levels? What issues could arise from sampling levels based on a fixed prior over the latent space instead?

5) The paper introduces a new over-generalization gap metric. Explain what this metric captures compared to the standard generalization gap and why it is necessary in the context of generation-based methods like SSED.

6) Compare and contrast the effects of distribution shift during the generative phase under SSED versus unsupervised environment design methods. How does each method account for or fail to account for distribution shift?

7) The VAE model employs several architectural choices such as graph convolutions and separate decoder heads. Discuss the motivation behind these choices and whether you expect them to be necessary components for good performance.  

8) The paper finds that directly minimizing mutual information leads to poor performance even though it reduces generalization error. Explain this result and discuss what it suggests about the balance between regularization and representation learning.

9) How difficult do you expect it would be to scale SSED to more complex environments compared to the baselines? What modifications or additional components might be needed?

10) The SSED framework combines ideas from prior work like PLR and unsupervised environment design. Discuss how SSED builds upon these methods and addresses some of their potential limitations in improving generalization.
