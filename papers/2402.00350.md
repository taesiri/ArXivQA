## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions two main types of LLMs-based fuzzers - ones that train specialized models on historical vulnerability data vs ones that integrate LLMs into traditional fuzzing workflows. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each approach? Which approach seems more promising for future work?

2. The paper discusses how LLMs can be used for prompt engineering and seed mutation in fuzzing. However, generating valid and meaningful seeds can be time-consuming. How can the efficiency of seed generation using LLMs be improved? 

3. What kinds of biases could exist in the historical vulnerability datasets used to train specialized LLMs-based fuzzing models? How could these biases impact model performance and effectiveness?

4. The paper argues LLMs can find more complex software bugs and vulnerabilities compared to traditional fuzzers. What specific capabilities of LLMs enable the discovery of deeper programming errors?

5. Several LLMs-based fuzzing techniques mentioned achieve higher code coverage than traditional methods. However, maximizing coverage does not always lead to more bugs found. How should coverage metrics be interpreted for evaluating LLMs-based fuzzers?

6. The paper suggests developing a specialized evaluation framework for benchmarking and comparing LLMs-based fuzzers. What specific metrics and tests should this framework include beyond traditional fuzzing criteria?

7. Most LLMs-based fuzzing techniques still require some manual effort. What are the main barriers to achieving fully automated fuzzing powered by LLMs?

8. How can the high computational expenses of using large LLMs be reduced to improve efficiency of LLMs-based fuzzing? Are there certain model architectures better suited for this task?

9. The paper focuses on AI and non-AI software testing. How readily can LLMs-based fuzzing methods generalize to other complex cyber-physical systems like automotives, robotics, or hardware?

10. Several LLMs-based fuzzers utilize the same foundational models like GPT-3.5 and Codex. How can model diversity be increased to avoid shared weaknesses among these techniques?
