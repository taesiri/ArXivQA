# [Partial Differential Equations is All You Need for Generating Neural   Architectures -- A Theory for Physical Artificial Intelligence Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08313)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how partial differential equations (PDEs) can be used to generate common deep neural network architectures and learning algorithms. The key hypothesis is that PDEs, specifically nonlinear parabolic PDEs, can be considered the fundamental equations for artificial intelligence systems. By discretizing these "neural PDEs" using numerical methods like finite difference methods, the authors show that popular neural network building blocks like MLPs, CNNs, and RNNs emerge.In essence, the paper proposes that PDEs can provide a theoretical foundation and physical interpretation for deep learning models and algorithms. The use of PDEs allows for an explainable AI approach based on principles from physics and an avenue for designing analog computing hardware for physical AI systems.
