# [Partial Differential Equations is All You Need for Generating Neural   Architectures -- A Theory for Physical Artificial Intelligence Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08313)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how partial differential equations (PDEs) can be used to generate common deep neural network architectures and learning algorithms. 

The key hypothesis is that PDEs, specifically nonlinear parabolic PDEs, can be considered the fundamental equations for artificial intelligence systems. By discretizing these "neural PDEs" using numerical methods like finite difference methods, the authors show that popular neural network building blocks like MLPs, CNNs, and RNNs emerge.

In essence, the paper proposes that PDEs can provide a theoretical foundation and physical interpretation for deep learning models and algorithms. The use of PDEs allows for an explainable AI approach based on principles from physics and an avenue for designing analog computing hardware for physical AI systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here are the main contributions of this paper:

- It proposes neural partial differential equations (NPDEs) as a general theoretical framework for describing artificial intelligence systems. The paper argues that NPDEs can be seen as the fundamental equations for physical artificial intelligence (PAI).

- It shows how several common PDEs from physics, like reaction-diffusion equations, Schrodinger's equation, and Helmholtz equation, are examples of NPDEs.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of using partial differential equations for generating neural network architectures:

- The idea of connecting neural networks and PDEs is not entirely new, but this paper provides a more extensive theoretical framework than previous works. For example, some previous papers have shown connections between residual networks and ODEs/PDEs, but this paper generalizes to other architectures like CNNs and RNNs. 

- The core idea of deriving neural architectures from discretizations of PDEs provides a nice interpretability that is lacking in many pure machine learning papers on neural nets. The physical intuition and interpretability is a strength.

- However, the theoretical connections alone don't necessarily provide advantages in terms of practical performance or results. The paper is focused more on theoretical foundations rather than empirical evaluations. So it's unclear if this approach leads to better performing architectures.

- Most similar papers have focused only on continuous depth networks arising from ODEs. The inclusion of both depth and width directions in the PDE formulation is interesting. However, the treatment of both directions seems a bit superficial compared to papers focused only on the depth aspect.

- Overall, I would say this paper provides a solid theoretical foundation connecting neural nets and PDEs. The scope is quite broad in terms of covering multiple architectures. However, more work needs to be done to realize the practical advantages of this approach over pure machine learning techniques for architecture design. Evaluating the performance of the generated architectures will be important future work. But the paper succeeds in laying a theoretical groundwork for a physics-based perspective on neural networks.

In summary, the paper offers a comprehensive theoretical framework for relating PDEs and neural architectures, broadening previous work focused only on the depth aspect or residual networks. However, more empirical evaluation will be needed to demonstrate the practical advantages of this physics-based approach over pure machine learning techniques. The interpretability is a strength but performance needs to be assessed in future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

- Using path integral formulation from quantum mechanics to find optimal network architectures by considering different architectures as different paths.

- Analyzing how to solve neural PDEs numerically, including handling various boundary/initial conditions and complexity versus accuracy trade-offs.

- Applying neural PDEs to materials design through "inverse design", determining parameters that achieve desired outputs.

Overall, the authors propose neural PDEs as a new fundamental theory for physical AI systems and suggest a variety of applications and extensions of the framework as interesting future research directions. Developing new techniques specialized for neural PDEs seems to be a key focus.
