# [Partial Differential Equations is All You Need for Generating Neural   Architectures -- A Theory for Physical Artificial Intelligence Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08313)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how partial differential equations (PDEs) can be used to generate common deep neural network architectures and learning algorithms. The key hypothesis is that PDEs, specifically nonlinear parabolic PDEs, can be considered the fundamental equations for artificial intelligence systems. By discretizing these "neural PDEs" using numerical methods like finite difference methods, the authors show that popular neural network building blocks like MLPs, CNNs, and RNNs emerge.In essence, the paper proposes that PDEs can provide a theoretical foundation and physical interpretation for deep learning models and algorithms. The use of PDEs allows for an explainable AI approach based on principles from physics and an avenue for designing analog computing hardware for physical AI systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here are the main contributions of this paper:- It proposes neural partial differential equations (NPDEs) as a general theoretical framework for describing artificial intelligence systems. The paper argues that NPDEs can be seen as the fundamental equations for physical artificial intelligence (PAI).- It shows how several common PDEs from physics, like reaction-diffusion equations, Schrodinger's equation, and Helmholtz equation, are examples of NPDEs. - It demonstrates how the basic building blocks of deep neural networks, including multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks, can be generated by discretizing NPDEs using finite difference methods.- It discusses how the parameters of NPDEs can be learned using optimization methods like stochastic gradient descent, Adam, and L-BFGS. It also proposes a new PDE-constrained optimization approach.- It provides an interpretable physical view of deep neural networks, where information propagates and reacts in a virtual medium described by NPDEs. This links deep learning to physics and could aid analog computing hardware design.In summary, the key contribution is introducing NPDEs as a unified theoretical foundation for neural architectures, learning algorithms, and analog hardware implementations of AI systems. The paper aims to provide a physics-based interpretability to deep learning.
