# [Incorporating Visual Experts to Resolve the Information Loss in   Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown rapid progress recently, adopting a data-driven approach of collecting diverse instruction-following datasets. 
- However, they have limited visual perception ability due to the use of CLIP-like encoders for visual feature extraction. These encoders suffer from information loss as textual captions only partially capture image contents.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Incorporating Visual Experts (IVE) to enhance MLLMs' visual perception ability. 
- IVE incorporates multi-task encoders (semantic, low-level and document encoder) to provide comprehensive visual understanding.
- It also utilizes visual tools to extract structural knowledge (object categories, locations, text) that serve as prompts during training and inference.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel visual perception enhancement method for MLLMs using mixture-of-experts and structural knowledge.
- Integrates multi-task encoders for more nuanced visual understanding from diverse perspectives.
- Incorporates structural knowledge throughout training and inference to mitigate noise and enable discerning salient information.
- Achieves improved performance over state-of-the-arts on various tasks - general dialog, OCR text recognition, document understanding.
- Provides extensive analysis to demonstrate effectiveness of the approach.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in advancing MLLMs by aggregating visual experts to overcome inherent limitations in visual perception ability. The proposed IVE framework showcases significant improvements spanning multiple multimodal tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Incorporating Visual Experts (IVE), a method to improve the visual perception ability of multimodal large language models by aggregating information from multiple complementary encoders and visual tools to provide a more comprehensive representation of images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a method called "Incorporating Visual Experts (IVE)" to improve the visual perception ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, IVE incorporates two additional modules:

1) Multi-task encoders that integrate multiple complementary encoders (semantic, low-level, document-related) to extract richer visual information from images. 

2) Structural knowledge enhancement that utilizes visual tools to extract structural data about objects, texts, etc. in the images and uses that as prior knowledge fed into the language model.

Through these two modules, IVE aims to provide a more comprehensive description of visual inputs to MLLMs, overcoming the information loss dilemma faced by existing models that rely only on CLIP-like encoders. Experiments across various multimodal tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of IVE in advancing MLLMs by improving their visual perception ability.

The goal is to address the information loss dilemma faced by current MLLMs that rely solely on CLIP-like encoders for visual understanding.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes incorporating visual experts into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance their visual perception ability. What are the key rationales and motivations behind this idea? How does it aim to address the limitations of existing MLLMs?

2. The paper introduces two main modules - multi-task encoders and structural knowledge enhancement. Can you explain in detail the design and working of these two modules? What is the intuition behind using multiple complementary encoders?  

3. The multi-task encoders utilize three types of encoders - semantic, low-level and document-related information encoders. What are the specific encoders used for each? What kind of information do they aim to capture?

4. The paper extracts structural knowledge using visual tools and uses it as prompts. What are some of the visual tools used? What type of structural knowledge do they extract? How is this knowledge represented and incorporated into the model?

5. The paper conducts a 3-stage training strategy. Can you walk through what happens in each training stage? Which model components get trained in each stage? What datasets are used?

6. Ablation studies demonstrate that fusing multiple encoders leads to improvements. Can you analyze the results and explain why combining semantic, low-level and document encoders enhances performance?  

7. Another ablation study shows that using structural knowledge in both training and inference improves robustness to noise. What could be the reasons behind this observation?

8. The paper evaluates on multiple VQA datasets. Can you summarize the direct transfer results? How does the model perform after task-specific fine-tuning?

9. Qualitative results showcase improved perception over prior MLLMs. Can you analyze some example images and compare model responses to explain the advantages of this approach?

10. The idea of incorporating external knowledge/experts shows promise for MLLMs. What are some limitations of the current work? How can this idea be extended or scaled up to include more comprehensive knowledge?
