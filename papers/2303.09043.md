# [HE is all you need: Compressing FHE Ciphertexts using Additive HE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09043)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we compress fully homomorphically encrypted (FHE) ciphertexts, specifically Learning with Errors (LWE) and Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) ciphertexts, to reduce their size before sending them back to the client?The key points about the research question:- The focus is on compressing FHE ciphertexts, particularly LWE and RLWE ciphertexts, which tend to be very large. - The goal is to reduce the ciphertext size before sending from server to client.- This addresses the issue of large FHE ciphertext sizes being an obstacle for practical deployment, especially for clients with limited bandwidth.- The paper proposes the first technique to compress FHE ciphertexts by using an additional additive encryption scheme with smaller ciphertexts.So in summary, the central research question is how to compress large FHE ciphertexts to make them more practical, by leveraging an additional additive encryption scheme. The core contribution is a novel technique to achieve this ciphertext compression.
