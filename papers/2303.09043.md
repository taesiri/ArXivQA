# [HE is all you need: Compressing FHE Ciphertexts using Additive HE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09043)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we compress fully homomorphically encrypted (FHE) ciphertexts, specifically Learning with Errors (LWE) and Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) ciphertexts, to reduce their size before sending them back to the client?The key points about the research question:- The focus is on compressing FHE ciphertexts, particularly LWE and RLWE ciphertexts, which tend to be very large. - The goal is to reduce the ciphertext size before sending from server to client.- This addresses the issue of large FHE ciphertext sizes being an obstacle for practical deployment, especially for clients with limited bandwidth.- The paper proposes the first technique to compress FHE ciphertexts by using an additional additive encryption scheme with smaller ciphertexts.So in summary, the central research question is how to compress large FHE ciphertexts to make them more practical, by leveraging an additional additive encryption scheme. The core contribution is a novel technique to achieve this ciphertext compression.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing techniques to compress FHE ciphertexts, particularly those based on LWE/RLWE,  using an additive encryption scheme with smaller ciphertexts. The key ideas are:- The first step of LWE/RLWE decryption is linear in the secret key. So if the client sends encryptions of the secret key bits under an additive scheme to the server, the server can compute this linear step homomorphically and send back a compressed ciphertext. - For RLWE, the client can send encryptions of the secret key coefficients. The server can then extract and compress only the desired coefficients instead of the full ciphertext.- The paper shows up to 95% and 97% compression for LWE and RLWE ciphertexts respectively using these techniques.- The paper proves these techniques are secure under standard assumptions.In summary, the main contribution is protocols to significantly compress FHE ciphertexts by leveraging properties of LWE/RLWE and using an additional additive cryptosystem. This addresses the large ciphertext sizes which is an obstacle to adopting FHE.
