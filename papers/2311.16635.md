# [MotionZero:Exploiting Motion Priors for Zero-shot Text-to-Video   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16635)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MotionZero, a novel strategy for zero-shot text-to-video generation that enables accurate and disentangled motion control of different objects in videos. The key idea is to first extract motion priors for each object directly from the text prompt and generated first frame using language models. This allows inferring which objects should move and in what direction in each frame. The motion priors are then applied to corresponding object regions in the video latent space, located using segmentation masks. This achieves disentangled motion control where different objects can move independently according to the prompts. Additionally, a motion-aware attention mechanism attends to frame features based on motion intensity to improve video coherence. Experiments demonstrate MotionZeroâ€™s ability for precise and adaptive motion modelling, outperforming prior arts like CogVideo, DirecT2V and Text2Video-Zero on both qualitative and quantitative metrics. The disentangled control also enables versatile video editing applications in a zero-shot manner such as foreground/background replacement and camera viewpoint changes. Overall, MotionZero sets a new state-of-the-art for controllable zero-shot text-to-video generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a prompt-adaptive and disentangled motion control strategy for zero-shot text-to-video synthesis that extracts motion priors for different objects from prompts and the generated first frame, and applies motion control separately on corresponding objects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a prompt-adaptive and disentangled motion control strategy called MotionZero for zero-shot text-to-video synthesis. Specifically, it makes the following key contributions:

1) It proposes to exploit motion priors for different objects from the input text prompts and generated first frames using large language models. 

2) It proposes a disentangled motion control mechanism to apply the extracted motion priors separately to corresponding objects in the feature space. This allows controlling the motion of different objects accurately.

3) It proposes a Motion-Aware Attention scheme to determine attending frames adaptively based on motion amplitudes described in the prompts. This allows generating videos with varying degrees of motion.

4) Extensive experiments show the method can correctly control motion of different objects, support versatile applications like zero-shot video editing, and outperform existing zero-shot text-to-video works.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling prompt-adaptive and disentangled motion control in zero-shot text-to-video generation through exploiting linguistic knowledge and disentangled feature manipulation. This addresses limitations of previous works and supports new applications.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Zero-shot text-to-video generation - Synthesizing videos from text prompts without any training videos.

- Motion priors - The motion information (e.g. direction of movement) that is inherent in the text prompts. 

- Disentangled motion control - Separately controlling the motion of different objects in the generated video based on the motion priors.

- Large language models (LLMs) - Models like GPT that are used to help extract motion priors from the prompts.

- Motion-aware attention - An attention mechanism that determines which frames to attend to based on the amount of motion in the video.

- Prompt-adaptive - Strategies that are tailored to the specific text prompt, rather than being prompt-agnostic. 

- Applications - The paper shows applications like video editing, body pose control, and camera motion control.

In summary, the key focus is on better exploiting motion priors from prompts and disentangled control of motion to improve zero-shot text-to-video generation. Concepts like prompt-adaptivity, leveraging LLMs, and applications are also relevant.
