# [SUDO: a framework for evaluating clinical artificial intelligence   systems without ground-truth annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17011)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Clinical AI systems are often evaluated on a held-out dataset, with the assumption that this data represents "real-world" data the system would encounter when deployed. However, real-world "in the wild" data often differs systematically from the held-out data (distribution shift).
- This makes it difficult to evaluate the performance and reliability of AI system predictions on the in the wild data, especially since this data lacks ground truth labels. Challenges include identifying unreliable predictions, selecting optimal models, and assessing algorithmic bias.

Proposed Solution - SUDO Framework:  
- Temporary assign "pseudo-labels" to samples of unlabeled in the wild data by making an initial assumption of the class they belong to (e.g Class 0). 
- Retrieve an equal number of samples from the opposite class from the training data that have ground truth labels (e.g. Class 1).
- Train classifiers to distinguish between pseudo-labeled data and true labeled data. 
- Evaluate classifier performance on held-out labeled set. High performance suggests assigned pseudo-label is likely correct.  
- Repeat by cycling through different possible pseudo-labels for the in the wild data. 
- The discrepancy between classifier performances with different pseudo-labels indicates the likelihood that data belongs to one class or the other. This is referred to as the pseudo-label discrepancy or SUDO.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate SUDO correlates strongly with model accuracy, allowing it to act as proxy for performance on in the wild data without ground truth labels. Enables assessing reliability of predictions.
- Show SUDO can inform AI model selection when deploying on unlabeled in the wild data exhibiting distribution shift. 
- First demonstration of using SUDO to assess algorithmic bias on data without any ground truth labels.
- Provide guidelines around implementing SUDO, choice of hyperparameters, and showcase versatility across modalities (images, text, etc.)


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces SUDO, a framework to evaluate AI systems deployed on datasets exhibiting distribution shift and lacking ground-truth annotations, which uses temporary labels and classifiers to identify unreliable predictions, select favorable models, and assess algorithmic bias.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called "SUDO" to evaluate AI systems on data that exhibit distribution shift and lack ground-truth labels. Specifically:

- SUDO assigns temporary "pseudo-labels" to data points and trains classifiers to distinguish between pseudo-labeled data and real labeled data. By comparing classifier performance under different pseudo-label assignments, SUDO can quantify the reliability of predictions without ground-truth labels.

- Experiments show SUDO correlates well with model performance on medical imaging and clinical text datasets with distribution shift, allowing identification of unreliable predictions, selection of favorable models, and assessment of algorithmic bias without annotations. 

- SUDO provides a way to assess AI system performance and trustworthiness on real-world unlabeled data where distribution shift and lack of ground-truth labels are common challenges. This could improve integrity of AI-based findings and contribute to ethical, reliable deployment of AI in medicine.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a novel framework to evaluate AI reliability and trustworthiness on unlabeled, real-world data exhibiting distribution shift.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Pseudo-label discrepancy (SUDO): The core framework proposed in the paper for evaluating AI systems on data without ground-truth labels. Involves assigning temporary "pseudo-labels" to data points and quantifying the discrepancy between classifiers trained on different pseudo-labels.

- Unreliable AI predictions: AI-based predictions that may be incorrect and should not be relied upon without further verification. Identifying these is a key goal of SUDO.

- Distribution shift: When data that an AI system encounters (data "in the wild") follows a different distribution than the data it was trained/validated on. Causes model performance to degrade.

- Algorithmic bias: Differences in an AI system's performance across groups of patients (e.g. gender). Assessing bias typically requires ground-truth labels which are missing from unlabeled data.  

- Model selection: Choosing the best performing AI system for a given task. SUDO aims to help with model selection on unlabeled data through techniques like the reliability-completeness curve.

- Clinical data: The paper focuses specifically on evaluating AI systems for clinical data, including medical images, clinical notes/reports, and electronic health records.

So in summary, key terms cover the proposed SUDO framework, problems it aims to address like unreliable predictions and algorithmic bias, and its application to clinical AI systems and data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the SUDO method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that SUDO can deal with data modalities beyond images and text, such as time-series data. What modifications or additional considerations would need to be made to apply SUDO to time-series modalities?

2. When using SUDO, what strategies can be employed to determine the optimal number and granularity of probability intervals to use for sampling data points? Are there tradeoffs to consider?

3. How does the choice of pseudo-labeling strategy impact the performance of SUDO? For example, how would randomly assigned pseudo-labels compare to pseudo-labels assigned based on model confidence?

4. The paper demonstrates applying SUDO to binary classification tasks. How could the framework be extended to multi-class classification scenarios with more than two target classes?

5. What types of classifier models tend to work best when distinguishing between the pseudo-labeled data points and real labels in SUDO? Do complex deep learning models provide any benefit over simpler linear models?

6. In the survival analysis experiments, what steps could be taken to further control for potential confounding factors beyond line of therapy when validating predictions?  

7. The paper mentions SUDO is sensitive to label noise. What modifications could make the framework more robust to noisy labels in the held-out evaluation data?

8. How well does SUDO perform when the distribution shift between the training data and unlabelled data involves entirely new classes unseen during training? What are the limitations?

9. Could consistency between SUDO values obtained using different classifier models and evaluation metrics provide greater confidence in the reliability of predictions?

10. How well would SUDO transfer between vastly different domains, such as from medical images to analyzing source code or audio data? What domain similarities are needed?
