# [Language Models are Free Boosters for Biomedical Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17343)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Biomedical image analysis is critical for healthcare but faces challenges in data requirement and model optimization. Vision transformers (ViTs) have shown promise but still confront barriers limiting further performance gains. 

Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel approach of using a frozen transformer block from a large language model (LLM) as an encoder layer in ViTs for biomedical tasks. 

- The method inserts a residual-based LLM (R-LLM) block between alignment layers in the ViT architecture. The R-LLM block remains frozen while the alignment layers are trained. No language components are used.

- This allows the pre-trained weights of the LLM block to serve as a general-purpose visual feature extractor and boost performance without additional data or tuning.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates consistent accuracy and AUC gains from adding R-LLM across 2D and 3D biomedical classification tasks.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets like OCTMNIST and FractureMNIST3D, showing the effectiveness of the approach.

- Simplifies use of LLMs for biomedical imaging via modular frozen blocks instead of full vision-language models or prompts.

- Opens up new research directions in employing transformer architectures across vision and language modalities without reliance on pre-training or textual supervision.

In summary, the paper makes LLMs accessible as free and adaptable plug-and-play boosters for biomedical visual encoders by utilizing their pre-trained weights in an innovative residual framework. This both enhances performance on existing tasks and expands the understanding of how language models can aid specialized visual domains.
