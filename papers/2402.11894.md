# [Have Seen Me Before? Automating Dataset Updates Towards Reliable and   Timely Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating language model performance lack diversity and scale. They are limited in the types of skills assessed and number of examples.
- Manual generation of diverse, large-scale benchmark datasets is costly and time-consuming.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose an automatic framework called ALL-MBENCH to generate multi-skill benchmarks at scale. 
- The core of the framework involves mimicking existing datasets and extending them along different cognitive dimensions using prompt engineering.

Methodology:
- To mimic datasets, the authors use an iterative process of generating similar-but-different examples using a question generation model conditioned on seed examples.
- To extend datasets, they systematically manipulate prompts to elicit questions targeting different cognitive skills levels.

Key Outcomes:
- Demonstrated automatic generation of over 15K quality question-answer pairs covering 10 topics. Questions assess four cognitive skills levels.
- Benchmark evaluation shows ALL-MBENCH questions effectively differentiate model capabilities, with substantial gaps between the best and worst performing models.
- Human evaluation and model analysis confirm the high quality and cognitive diversity of the generated benchmarks.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to automatically generate multi-skill benchmarks with scale and diversity for comprehensively evaluating LLMs
- Mimic and extend strategies to produce quality and cognitively-diverse questions in a customizable, low-cost manner
- Extensive empirical analysis demonstrating ALL-MBENCH's reliability and utility for exposing model strengths/weaknesses

In summary, the paper presents an automated pipeline for generating diverse, multi-skill benchmarks on demand to more rigorously assess language model performance. Both human and model evaluations confirm the quality and usefulness of the benchmarks produced.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a framework to automatically generate questions for evaluating language models, involving mimicking existing questions and extending to new domains, with customized model fine-tuning and evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing an automatic framework to augment existing QA datasets by generating additional high-quality questions and answers. Specifically, the paper introduces two strategies:

1) A "mimic" strategy to automatically generate new questions and answers that mimic the style, format, and content of an existing QA dataset. This allows expanding the size and coverage of existing datasets.

2) An "extend" strategy focused on generating questions at different cognitive levels (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate) to systematically assess an AI system's capabilities. This produces a more comprehensive test set.  

The paper conducts experiments on both strategies, demonstrating the ability to reliably augment datasets from BIG-Bench and self-constructed domain-specific sets. Both human evaluations and model performance analyses confirm the quality of the generated data.

In summary, the core contribution is using the proposed automated framework to meaningfully and scalably expand QA datasets to more rigorously evaluate AI systems across different skills and knowledge areas. The framework and findings help advance benchmarks for more robust AI evaluation.
