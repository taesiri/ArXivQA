# [Have Seen Me Before? Automating Dataset Updates Towards Reliable and   Timely Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating language model performance lack diversity and scale. They are limited in the types of skills assessed and number of examples.
- Manual generation of diverse, large-scale benchmark datasets is costly and time-consuming.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose an automatic framework called ALL-MBENCH to generate multi-skill benchmarks at scale. 
- The core of the framework involves mimicking existing datasets and extending them along different cognitive dimensions using prompt engineering.

Methodology:
- To mimic datasets, the authors use an iterative process of generating similar-but-different examples using a question generation model conditioned on seed examples.
- To extend datasets, they systematically manipulate prompts to elicit questions targeting different cognitive skills levels.

Key Outcomes:
- Demonstrated automatic generation of over 15K quality question-answer pairs covering 10 topics. Questions assess four cognitive skills levels.
- Benchmark evaluation shows ALL-MBENCH questions effectively differentiate model capabilities, with substantial gaps between the best and worst performing models.
- Human evaluation and model analysis confirm the high quality and cognitive diversity of the generated benchmarks.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to automatically generate multi-skill benchmarks with scale and diversity for comprehensively evaluating LLMs
- Mimic and extend strategies to produce quality and cognitively-diverse questions in a customizable, low-cost manner
- Extensive empirical analysis demonstrating ALL-MBENCH's reliability and utility for exposing model strengths/weaknesses

In summary, the paper presents an automated pipeline for generating diverse, multi-skill benchmarks on demand to more rigorously assess language model performance. Both human and model evaluations confirm the quality and usefulness of the benchmarks produced.
