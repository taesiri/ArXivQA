# [The Potential of AutoML for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04453)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has greatly advanced ML applications like computer vision and machine translation, but has found little attention in the Recommender Systems (RecSys) community. 
- Only few and relatively simple Automated Recommender Systems (AutoRecSys) libraries exist that adopt AutoML techniques. These libraries are based on student projects and lack the sophistication of AutoML libraries.  
- It is an open question whether an inexperienced user can achieve suitable performance with AutoML compared to AutoRecSys, ML, or RecSys algorithms.

Proposed Solution:
- Compare performance of $60$ algorithms from $7$ AutoML, $1$ AutoRecSys, $28$ ML and $23$ RecSys libraries, plus a mean predictor baseline, on $14$ explicit feedback RecSys datasets.
- Simulate perspective of an inexperienced user by using default hyperparameters for all algorithms.
- Implemented a Docker-based evaluation tool with resource limits on time and memory.
- Transformed RMSE into ranks to compare performance across datasets.

Main Contributions:
- Showed AutoML and AutoRecSys libraries performed best overall, with AutoRecSys library Auto-Surprise being the single-best performer.  
- AutoML performed best on $6$ out of $14$ datasets ($43\%$), but different AutoML libraries performed best on different datasets.
- Showed clear need for more sophisticated AutoRecSys libraries, given AutoML's strong performance despite not being tuned for RecSys.
- Presented first systematic comparison of AutoML techniques on RecSys tasks.
- Collected and preprocessed $14$ explicit feedback RecSys datasets.
- Open-sourced implementation of comparison tool and dataset preprocessing scripts.

The paper demonstrates the potential of AutoML techniques for RecSys tasks compared to existing approaches. It highlights the need to advance AutoRecSys libraries and extend AutoML libraries to RecSys.
