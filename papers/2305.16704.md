# [A Closer Look at In-Context Learning under Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16704)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Are transformers more adept than some natural and simpler architectures at performing in-context learning under varying distribution shifts?The key hypothesis appears to be that transformers will exhibit better in-context learning abilities compared to simpler models like set-based MLPs, especially under distribution shifts between the train and test data. The authors aim to study the generality and limitations of in-context learning through the lens of linear regression by comparing transformers to set-based MLPs. Specifically, they categorize in-context learning into in-distribution ICL vs out-of-distribution ICL and evaluate how the two model architectures perform under these different settings. Their hypothesis seems to be that transformers will show stronger in-context learning abilities overall.
