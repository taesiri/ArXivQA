# [FedRKG: A Privacy-preserving Federated Recommendation Framework via   Knowledge Graph Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11089)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recommendation systems rely on centralized storage of user data, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning enables collaborative modeling without sharing raw data. 
- Recent graph neural network (GNN) methods improve recommendations by modeling high-order user-item interactions. However, privacy constraints prevent sharing the entire interaction graph.
- Existing federated recommendation methods have limitations in utilizing side information while preserving privacy or have high computation overhead.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose FedRKG, a GNN-based federated recommendation framework that enhances recommendations via a global knowledge graph (KG) while preserving privacy.
- Server constructs KG from public item data and maintains embeddings. Clients locally store user-item interactions.
- Clients generate obfuscated request items and request necessary embeddings & model from server for training. Server samples KG subgraph for request items and distributes to client.
- Client expands local graph by merging KG subgraph, allowing higher-order interactions without exposing actual interactions. Relation-aware GNN model trained locally.
- Employ local differential privacy and pseudo-labeling to protect interaction privacy. User embeddings kept local, gradients encrypted before uploading.

Main Contributions:
- First work to introduce a knowledge graph to improve federated recommendation accuracy while ensuring privacy preservation.
- Propose novel user-item graph expansion algorithm using KG subgraphs for better local model training.
- Innovative privacy-preserving techniques to protect interaction items, while reducing communication overhead through selective embedding distribution.
- Experiments on 3 datasets demonstrate superiority over federated baselines (4% average accuracy gain) and competitiveness with centralized methods.

In summary, FedRKG allows federated recommendation systems to benefit from knowledge graphs for accuracy improvements through privacy-preserving designs for protecting sensitive user data.
