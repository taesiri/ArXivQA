# [Small Language Model Can Self-correct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07301)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative language models like ChatGPT can generate inaccurate or false information with high confidence. 
- Existing methods for inducing self-correction rely on complex prompts and pipelines that are difficult for small models with limited parameters to follow.  
- There is a need for an intrinsic self-correction mechanism that enables even small LMs to spontaneously detect errors and modify their initial responses.

Proposed Solution - Intrinsic Self-Correction (ISC):  
- ISC aims to empower LMs with the capability for autonomous self-verification and self-modification of initially generated responses.  
- A pipeline is introduced to construct self-correction training data in a standardized format.
- A novel fine-tuning technique called Partial Answer Masking (PAM) is proposed to enable models to evaluate their own generated answers for accuracy.  
- Experiments are conducted on small LMs with 6B to 13B parameters on question answering tasks to validate ISC.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate even small LMs can gain self-correction abilities without relying on ground truth or external models.  
- Propose an intrinsic one-step correction mechanism mimicking spontaneous human correction.
- Devise a generalizable pipeline to build self-correction training data.
- Introduce PAM method to impart self-verification skills during fine-tuning. 
- Show improved accuracy across multiple small LMs on two distinct QA datasets through ISC.

In summary, the paper devises an intrinsic self-correction approach to enhance answer quality of small generative LMs by providing them skills to automatically detect and fix inaccuracies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Intrinsic Self-Correction to empower language models, even small ones, with the capability to spontaneously self-verify and self-modify their initial responses without relying on external signals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. To the best of the authors' knowledge, they are the first to demonstrate that small language models with even 6 billion parameters possess the capacity for self-correction during response generation without relying ground truth.

2. They propose "Intrinsic Self-correction" (ISC), an intrinsic mechanism that relies on two basic abilities - self-verification and self-modification - to enable language models to correct themselves. This is distinct from existing self-correction methods that rely on complex prompt engineering.  

3. To achieve self-correction capability in small LMs, they devise a pipeline for constructing self-correction data and define the data format. They also introduce a novel training method called Partial Answer Masking (PAM) to enable models to self-verify generated answers.

4. They conduct experiments on open-source LMs with varying parameter scales and demonstrate improvements in accuracy across two different datasets using their proposed ISC method. This shows that even small LMs can have their output quality further improved by empowering them with intrinsic self-correction capability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Intrinsic Self-Correction (ISC) - The core concept introduced in the paper, referring to the capability of language models to spontaneously self-verify and self-modify their initial responses without relying on external signals or models. 

- Self-verification - The ability of a language model to evaluate the accuracy of its own generated responses. A key prerequisite for achieving self-correction.

- Self-modification - The process of a language model revising its initial response upon detecting errors through self-verification. 

- Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) - Training method that involves providing a language model annotated examples to teach it to generate responses based on prompts/instructions.

- Partial Answer Masking (PAM) - Novel training technique proposed in the paper where only correct answer parts are used to calculate loss during IFT of "bad cases" to enable better self-correction capability.

- Chain-of-Thought (COT) - Approach to prompt language models to provide step-by-step reasoning before generating a final response. Used in the paper to elicit high-quality responses for constructing self-correction training data.

- Parameter efficiency - Ability to achieve capabilities like self-correction even in smaller language models with limited parameters. One of the key goals targeted in the paper.

In summary, the core focus is on enabling intrinsic self-correction abilities in language models, even smaller ones, through methods like instruction fine-tuning with the proposed partial answer masking technique.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an "Intrinsic Self-Correction" method to empower small language models with the capability for self-correction. Could you elaborate more on why existing methods of using prompt engineering for self-correction in large models are difficult for small models to follow?

2. The Intrinsic Self-Correction method relies on two key abilities - self-verification and self-modification. Could you explain in more detail the process through which the model provides self-verification on its initial output? How is the determination of whether modification is needed made?

3. The paper constructs specialized self-correction data to train models. Walk through the detailed steps involved in the pipeline for building this self-correction data. What are some ways the diversity of the data could be further improved?  

4. The Partial Answer Masking (PAM) method is introduced during model fine-tuning. Explain why PAM handles good cases and bad cases differently in terms of loss calculation. What is the intuition behind employing PAM?

5. The paper discovers that high confidence in a model's own outputs can negatively impact the accuracy of self-verification. Why do you think this occurs? How can this issue be alleviated?

6. Provide some examples of cases where the model successfully changes an initially wrong answer to the right one after self-correction. What attributes of the model enable such successful modifications? 

7. The results show that in some cases, the model iteratively provides wrong answers despite attempts at self-correction. Analyze the potential reasons behind why errors persist even after multiple corrections.

8. How exactly is the generalization ability of the Intrinsic Self-Correction method evaluated on a new task? Discuss the significance of the model exhibiting strong generalization capability to new tasks.

9. Compare and contrast the Intrinsic Self-Correction method with other similar state-of-the-art techniques for improving language model performance. What are some limitations of the proposed approach?

10. The method focuses on smaller sized models. Discuss whether you think the approach could be applicable to much larger models with billions of parameters as well in order to improve their performance.
