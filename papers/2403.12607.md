# [Looking for the Human in HRI Teaching: User-Centered Course Design for   Tech-Savvy Students](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12607)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using a Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) course as an opportunity to teach tech-savvy computer science students important user-centered design skills like top-down thinking. The authors argue that while HRI inherently involves a human focus, students may still approach problems from a technology-first perspective. 

To foster user-centered thinking, the HRI course incorporates elements of scenario-based design, self-empowerment, and user studies. Students work in groups to design and implement realistic HRI scenarios using Pepper robots and an open-source visual programming tool. Scenarios span domains like restaurants, hotels, and libraries.  

The course grading promotes both individual accountability and group collaboration. Students individually review a research paper and complete a report on their scenario using AI. For the group project, a multi-stage proposal process helps scope scenarios appropriately. A novel group formation approach based on an initial proposal fair aims to create good group dynamics.  

Though not all students master the most complex HRI concepts like emotional expression, most gain basic competency across verbal, non-verbal, spatial, and emotional interaction. The authors observe students improving in user-centered thinking, problem finding, merging ideas, and feeling empowered to make design decisions.

In conclusion, the authors advocate leveraging HRI courses - with their inherent human focus - as opportunities to teach critical user-centered design skills relevant for engineers and computer scientists. Their course model combines theory, research reviews, scenario design, user studies, and tool usage to achieve this.
