# [Looking for the Human in HRI Teaching: User-Centered Course Design for   Tech-Savvy Students](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12607)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using a Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) course as an opportunity to teach tech-savvy computer science students important user-centered design skills like top-down thinking. The authors argue that while HRI inherently involves a human focus, students may still approach problems from a technology-first perspective. 

To foster user-centered thinking, the HRI course incorporates elements of scenario-based design, self-empowerment, and user studies. Students work in groups to design and implement realistic HRI scenarios using Pepper robots and an open-source visual programming tool. Scenarios span domains like restaurants, hotels, and libraries.  

The course grading promotes both individual accountability and group collaboration. Students individually review a research paper and complete a report on their scenario using AI. For the group project, a multi-stage proposal process helps scope scenarios appropriately. A novel group formation approach based on an initial proposal fair aims to create good group dynamics.  

Though not all students master the most complex HRI concepts like emotional expression, most gain basic competency across verbal, non-verbal, spatial, and emotional interaction. The authors observe students improving in user-centered thinking, problem finding, merging ideas, and feeling empowered to make design decisions.

In conclusion, the authors advocate leveraging HRI courses - with their inherent human focus - as opportunities to teach critical user-centered design skills relevant for engineers and computer scientists. Their course model combines theory, research reviews, scenario design, user studies, and tool usage to achieve this.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes incorporating scenario-based design and other user-centered techniques into an introductory Human-Robot Interaction course to teach tech-savvy students to think from the user's perspective when developing robotics solutions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be:

The paper proposes an approach for designing and conducting a Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) introductory course that focuses on fostering top-down, user-centered thinking skills in tech-savvy computer science students. Specific elements proposed include:

- Using scenario-based design of lab projects to encourage thinking from the user's perspective
- Having students discuss, merge, and iterate on ideas in groups
- Empowering students to make decisions about their own scenarios and solutions
- Evaluating solutions in a user-centered way via user studies
- Using generative AI responsibly as a text generation tool

The paper provides a detailed breakdown of the course components, including HRI topics, paper presentations, the lab scenario implementation, and grading. It shares results from previous iterations and student-selected scenarios. The goal is to provide ideas and encouragement to the HRI teaching community to fully realize the human-centered potential in their courses.

In summary, the key contribution is a proposed approach and framework for an HRI course that makes user-centered thinking a core learning outcome.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions setting several learning goals including "being able to think top-down, from a user/customer perspective". How exactly does the course design and activities aim to develop this skill in students? What evidence exists that these methods achieve this goal?

2. The paper proposes a "proposal fair" for students to present their ideas and form project groups. What are the specific benefits of this method over typical group formation techniques? How does it encourage better collaboration and learning? 

3. The paper requires students to design their own user study to evaluate their system. What are the pedagogical goals of this? How does it differ from actually conducting the study, and what could be done to bridge that gap?

4. The visual programming tool Node-RED is utilized in the course. What specific affordances does this tool provide over traditional programming? How does it align with the course's goals of empowering students? 

5. The paper argues HRI is well-suited for teaching user-centered design. What unique attributes of HRI make this argument sensible? Could the same approaches be applied in other technical course contexts?

6. The course grading scheme includes both individual and group components. Why is this breakdown important? What problems could arise by weighting one component too heavily over the other?  

7. The paper proposes adapting the course and project difficulties to student level. What specific parameters could be tuned? What challenges exist in scaling up or down the scope appropriately?

8. The paper observes students struggled meeting advanced learning goals like integrating emotions. Why might this be the case? What scaffolding could help students reach higher-level goals?  

9. The paper plans to utilize generative AI as a reflective exercise. What unique insights might this provide over traditional writing? What ethical considerations should guide the use of such technology?

10. Certain professional scenarios like "dance instructor" were favored. How might selection of imaginative scenarios better achieve learning objectives compared to traditional examples? What risks might exist?
