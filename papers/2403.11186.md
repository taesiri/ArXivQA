# [NetTrack: Tracking Highly Dynamic Objects with a Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11186)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "NetTrack: Tracking Highly Dynamic Objects with a Net":

Problem: 
- Tracking arbitrary objects, especially highly dynamic ones with severe deformations, fast motion, and frequent occlusions, is challenging for existing multi-object tracking (MOT) methods. 
- Most MOT methods rely on coarse-grained representations like bounding boxes or overall features and struggle when internal relationships within objects get distorted due to high dynamicity.  
- Establishing accurate object-text correspondence is also difficult for localized dynamic objects.

Proposed Solution - NetTrack:
- Introduces fine-grained learning using "Nets" to make tracking robust to dynamicity. 
- Leverages physical points on object surface as fine-grained visual cues that are less affected by deformations. 
- Performs fine-grained sampling to obtain points of interest (POIs) and matches them across frames using fine-grained similarity scores.
- Learns fine-grained object-text correspondence during pre-training to better distinguish dynamic objects.
- Allows embedding descriptors (e.g. GPT-3.5) to provide context.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes NetTrack for tracking highly dynamic objects by using fine-grained Nets and object-text correspondence.
- Introduces BFT, a challenging benchmark dataset for dynamic open-world MOT with 22 bird species and 14 distinct scenes.
- Comprehensive evaluation shows NetTrack handles dynamic objects effectively and generalizes well to other datasets without finetuning.
- Analysis shows the introduced fine-grained learning exhibits stronger ability to track dynamic objects compared to coarse-grained methods.
- Discusses potential applications like video editing, ecological inspection, and leveraging descriptors.
