# [Large Language Models Are Human-Level Prompt Engineers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01910)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we automatically generate high-quality natural language instructions to effectively steer the behavior of large language models (LLMs)?

Specifically, the authors aim to develop an automatic method for generating prompts/instructions that can successfully control how LLMs behave on downstream tasks. This involves framing prompt engineering as a problem of "natural language program synthesis" and proposing an algorithm, Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE), to search over the space of possible prompts to find those that produce the desired model outputs. 

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) LLMs can be leveraged to automatically propose and assess the quality of instruction candidates for prompting themselves. That is, LLMs can be used for both proposal generation and scoring/selection when optimizing prompts.

2) An iterative Monte Carlo style search process can be used to effectively explore the space of possible prompts and identify high quality instructions for steering LLM behavior.

3) This automatic prompt engineering method can match or exceed the performance of human-authored prompts across a diverse range of tasks and LLM objectives (e.g. maximizing accuracy, truthfulness, etc).

In summary, the central research question is how to automate the prompt engineering process for LLMs using the models themselves to propose and assess prompt quality through a guided search process. The key hypothesis is that this approach can outperform human prompt engineering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Framing instruction generation for language models as a form of natural language program synthesis. This allows them to leverage ideas from the program synthesis literature like using the language model itself to propose candidate programs (instructions) and guide the search process.

2. Proposing an algorithm called Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) that uses language models in two key ways: (a) to generate candidate instruction prompts based on a few input-output demonstrations, and (b) to score/evaluate candidate prompts on held-out data. 

3. Demonstrating that APE can automatically generate prompts that allow language models to achieve human-level or better performance on a variety of NLP tasks, including instruction following, question answering, and commonsense reasoning tasks.

4. Providing extensive analysis to understand the factors that affect APE's performance, such as model size, scoring functions, iterative search, etc.

5. Showing several applications of APE, such as improving few-shot learning by prepending APE-generated prompts to examples, optimizing chain-of-thought reasoning prompts, and steering language models towards truthfulness or informativeness.

So in summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing and analyzing an automatic prompt engineering algorithm that can elicit human-level performance from language models across a diverse set of tasks by treating prompt generation as a form of program synthesis guided by the language models themselves.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- The paper focuses on using large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate and select natural language instructions to steer LLMs towards desired behaviors. This is a novel approach compared to other prompt engineering techniques like manual prompt engineering or differentiable prompt tuning. The idea of framing it as a natural language program synthesis problem guided by the LLM itself seems unique.

- Most prior work on prompt engineering relies heavily on manual effort and human expertise to craft effective prompts. This paper proposes a more automated approach using the LLMs themselves to generate and assess prompt quality. The goal is to reduce human effort.

- The proposed method leverages recent advances in LLMs and their ability to follow instructions. It builds on capabilities like instruction following and instruction induction that have been demonstrated in models like InstructGPT.

- The performance of the method on instruction induction and BIG-Bench tasks is comparable or superior to human-authored prompts. This suggests LLMs may be capable of prompt engineering at or above human levels.

- The applications demonstrated like improving few-shot learning, finding better chain of thought prompts, and steering towards truthfulness are consistent with current trends in leveraging LLMs for controllable generation.

- The framing as program synthesis is a novel lens compared to typical prompt engineering literature. The techniques borrowed from program synthesis like inference models and search seem applicable to prompt optimization.

Overall, the paper introduces a new automated approach to prompt engineering that reduces human effort by having LLMs propose and assess prompts. The applications and performance demonstrate this approach is viable and aligns with current directions in leveraging LLMs for controllable generation. The connections made to program synthesis also provide a new perspective compared to existing prompt engineering literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring different search strategies and proposal distributions for generating instruction candidates in APE. The paper mainly focused on using LLMs to generate candidates, but other types of models could be investigated as well.

- Applying APE to additional domains beyond NLP, such as image generation and music generation. The general framework of APE could potentially work for other generative models that use natural language prompts.

- Developing better scoring functions and metrics for evaluating instruction quality. The paper relied primarily on execution accuracy, but other metrics capturing aspects like fluency, fairness, etc could be useful. 

- Studying whether instructions generated by APE transfer across different LLMs. The paper found limited transferability, so more research on what makes an instruction generalizable is needed.

- Reducing the computational cost of APE by optimizing the prompt lengths and developing better search procedures. There is a tradeoff between cost and performance that needs further analysis.

- Exploring whether APE-generated prompts can be fine-tuned or adapted online to further improve performance after the initial search.

- Developing better techniques for few-shot learning by combining APE instructions with in-context examples. The interplay between instructions and examples needs more investigation.

- Using APE to optimize parts of existing human-designed prompts and templates, as was done for chain-of-thought reasoning. This could be a common use case.

- Engineering the meta-prompts used for generating APE instruction candidates, which was found to affect performance. More research on meta-prompt design is needed.

- Applying APE to steer models towards safety, fairness, truthfulness etc by using appropriate scoring functions. Useful for aligning LLMs with human values.

- Exploring theoretical connections between APE and program synthesis, which could provide a better mathematical framework.

In summary, the authors propose many exciting research avenues related to automatic prompt engineering and optimization using LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel algorithm called Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) for automatically generating and selecting natural language instructions to control large language models (LLMs). APE treats instruction generation as a natural language program synthesis problem, formulating it as a black-box optimization task guided by LLMs. It uses LLMs in two key ways - first to propose candidate instructions based on input-output demonstrations, and then to score and select the best instruction that aligns with the desired behavior on a downstream task. APE is evaluated on a suite of 24 instruction induction tasks and achieves human-level or better performance using only model-generated instructions. Additional experiments demonstrate APE's ability to improve few-shot learning, find better chain-of-thought reasoning prompts, and steer LLM behaviors like truthfulness. The paper provides extensive analysis into factors like model size, scoring functions, and iterative search. Overall, APE offers a general framework to automate prompt engineering for LLMs by leveraging their own capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) for automatically generating high-quality prompts to control the behavior of large language models (LLMs). APE treats prompt engineering as a kind of program synthesis problem. It uses an LLM to generate candidate prompt instructions based on a few input-output demonstrations. It then scores these candidate prompts by executing them on a target LLM and measuring their performance on a downstream task. The prompt with the best score is selected. APE is able to generate prompts that match or exceed human performance on a variety of natural language tasks, including instruction following, question answering, and commonsense reasoning.

The authors conduct extensive analysis of APE. They find larger LLMs generally produce better prompts, though all model sizes can generate good prompts if enough candidates are sampled. They also compare different scoring functions and find execution accuracy works best overall. An iterative Monte Carlo version of APE provides marginal gains. Case studies demonstrate how APE can improve few-shot learning, find better reasoning prompts, and steer models toward truthful and informative responses. The cost analysis shows larger models are more efficient for APE despite higher per-token pricing. In summary, APE provides an automated way to perform prompt engineering at human-level across many NLP tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel algorithm called Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) for automatically generating and selecting natural language instructions to control the behavior of large language models (LLMs). APE treats instruction generation as a natural language program synthesis problem, posing it as a black-box optimization that leverages LLM capabilities in two key ways. First, an LLM is used as an inference model to generate candidate instructions based on input-output demonstrations. Second, the search process is guided by using an LLM to score instructions on held-out data. APE initially generates candidate prompts, then recursively filters and refines them by scoring and resampling semantically similar variants, ultimately returning the top scoring instruction. Experiments using APE show it can achieve human-level or better performance in steering LLMs on instruction induction and reasoning tasks compared to human-authored prompts.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points are:

- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 show impressive capabilities when conditioned on natural language instructions/prompts, but finding good prompts requires careful engineering. This paper aims to automate the prompt engineering process.

- The authors propose treating prompt engineering as a type of program synthesis, where the prompt is the "program" that controls the LLM "computer." They formulate it as a black-box optimization problem of searching for an optimal prompt within the space of natural language.

- They use LLMs in two ways: (1) as inference models to propose a set of candidate prompt programs based on input-output examples, and (2) to score/evaluate candidate prompts by executing them on the target LLM and dataset.

- Their method, Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE), is able to achieve human-level or better performance in zero-shot learning across several NLP benchmark tasks.

- They demonstrate applications of APE-generated prompts for few-shot learning, zero-shot chain of thought reasoning, and steering LLMs towards truthfulness or informativeness. 

- Overall, the paper shows that prompt engineering for LLMs can be effectively automated using the LLMs themselves, reducing the need for manual effort in finding good prompts. The framing as program synthesis and the use of LLMs for inference and scoring are the key technical innovations.

In summary, the paper addresses the challenge of automating prompt engineering for large language models in order to unlock their capabilities without extensive human effort. The proposed APE method achieves this using LLMs for search and scoring within the space of natural language prompts.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) to automatically generate high-quality natural language prompts for large language models (LLMs). APE frames prompt engineering as a natural language program synthesis problem and uses LLMs to propose candidate prompts as well as evaluate them. Specifically, APE leverages LLMs in three ways: 1) an LLM generates initial prompt candidates based on input-output demonstrations, 2) prompt candidates are scored by executing them on the target LLM and computing metrics like accuracy, and 3) an iterative Monte Carlo search allows refinement of prompt candidates. Through extensive experiments on 24 instruction induction tasks and 17 curated BIG-Bench tasks, APE is shown to match or exceed human performance in prompt engineering. The authors provide detailed analysis into the method, studying the effects of model size, scoring functions, iterative search, and other factors.
