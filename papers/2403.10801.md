# [Securely Fine-tuning Pre-trained Encoders Against Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10801)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained encoders from self-supervised learning are being increasingly used in downstream tasks through fine-tuning. However, recent work has shown they are vulnerable to downstream-agnostic adversarial examples (DAEs). 
- Attackers can craft effective DAEs targeting downstream models using only publicly available pre-trained encoders, without needing access to downstream data or task details.
- Existing defense methods fail against DAEs due to: (1) domain shift between pre-training and downstream causing reduced feature diversity (2) sensitivity of pre-trained encoder parameters limiting defenses.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Gen-AF, a two-stage fine-tuning method to enhance model robustness against DAEs while preserving generalization ability.

- Stage 1: Genetic-driven dual-track adversarial fine-tuning
   - Separately fine-tunes pre-trained encoder (small LR) and classifier (standard LR) using genetic regularization loss to constrain feature space changes.
   - Aims to inherit pre-trained encoder robustly without forgetting original capabilities.

- Stage 2: Evolutionary adaptability fine-tuning 
   - Assesses layer sensitivity to perturbations and selects top-k insensitive layers.
   - Further fine-tunes selected layers to improve generalization without affecting robustness.

Key Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of defense methods against DAEs, uncovering key limitations.
- Novel genetic-driven adversarial fine-tuning approach specifically tailored for pre-trained encoders to balance robustness and generalization.  
- Extensive experiments across diverse setups demonstrating effectiveness against 5 state-of-the-art attacks while achieving high accuracy.
- Demonstrates applicability in defending backdoor attacks on pre-trained encoders without modifications.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in securing pre-trained models against DAE threats through a specially designed two-stage fine-tuning technique inspired by biological evolution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage adversarial fine-tuning method called Gen-AF that inherits a pre-trained encoder's feature extraction capabilities through genetic regularization while enhancing model robustness and generalizability, in order to defend against downstream-agnostic adversarial examples targeting publically accessible pre-trained models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. They present Gen-AF, the first genetic evolution-nurtured adversarial fine-tuning approach, aiming to enhance downstream model robustness and generalizability against adversarial attacks targeting pre-trained encoders.

2. They conduct a comprehensive analysis of mainstream defense methods, underscoring their limitations in a pre-training scenario. 

3. Gen-AF demonstrates outstanding defense performance against five state-of-the-art universal adversarial attacks designed for pre-trained encoders. Evaluation spans ten popular self-supervised learning methods, two pre-training datasets, and six downstream datasets.

4. Experimental results showcase Gen-AF's effectiveness in defending against adversarial examples and backdoors targeting pre-trained encoders.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new adversarial fine-tuning method called Gen-AF that can effectively improve the robustness of downstream models built on pre-trained encoders against various adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy. The method is comprehensively evaluated on diverse settings.
