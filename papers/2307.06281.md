The paper proposes MMBench, a new multi-modality benchmark for evaluating vision-language models. MMBench contains around 3000 multiple-choice questions covering 20 distinct abilities, ensuring diversity and comprehensiveness. To enable robust evaluation, the paper introduces a novel CircularEval strategy where each question is tested multiple times with circularly shifted choices.
