# [MMBench: Is Your Multi-modal Model an All-around Player?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06281)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main research question is: How can we develop a systematic benchmark to robustly evaluate the various abilities of large vision-language models? 

The key points related to this question are:

- Existing benchmarks like VQA and COCO have limitations in providing fine-grained ability assessment and use non-robust evaluation metrics. 

- Recent subjective benchmarks with human evaluation are biased and not scalable. 

- This paper proposes MMBench, a novel objective benchmark with the following goals:

1. Systematically evaluate vision-language models across diversified abilities using a hierarchical taxonomy.

2. Enable robust evaluation by using a novel CircularEval strategy and leveraging ChatGPT for comparing free-form predictions to choices.

So in summary, the central focus is on creating a rigorous benchmark that can thoroughly and robustly assess the multifaceted capabilities of vision-language models, overcoming limitations of prior evaluation methods. The key contribution is the systematic design of the benchmark itself.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces MMBench, a new benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of vision-language models. The main contributions are:

1. Systematically-constructed dataset: MMBench contains thousands of multiple-choice questions covering 20 fine-grained abilities across perception and reasoning. The dataset is meticulously designed to provide a comprehensive and balanced evaluation. 

2. Robust evaluation: The paper proposes a novel CircularEval strategy that evaluates models multiple times on rotated options, making the evaluation more robust. It also leverages ChatGPT for extracting choices from free-form predictions, enabling fair comparisons between models.

3. Analysis and observations: The paper benchmarks 14 existing models on MMBench and analyzes their capabilities across different skills. The results provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current models, guiding future research directions.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of MMBench, which is the first systematic and robust benchmark for evaluating the diverse capabilities of vision-language models through thousands of carefully designed questions and a reliable evaluation protocol. MMBench can facilitate more meaningful comparisons and drive progress in this field.

- Analysis: In addition to quantitatively benchmarking models, this paper also provides insightful qualitative analysis into model strengths/weaknesses and directions for future work. The observations on instruction following, logic reasoning, etc. are valuable findings.

- Google Bard: This work provides the first analysis comparing capabilities of the new Google Bard model against open source vision-language models. The examples highlight Bard's reasoning ability.

Overall, this paper pushes forward the goal of standardized, rigorous, and fine-grained evaluation and analysis of vision-language AI through its novel benchmark, evaluation techniques, comprehensive experiments, and thoughtful discussion. The work helps advance progress in this quickly evolving field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Expanding the ability taxonomy to be more comprehensive. The authors mention that the current taxonomy and evaluation abilities are not static and can be further extended. Expanding the range of abilities evaluated would allow more comprehensive benchmarking of vision-language models.

- Developing more robust evaluation strategies. The authors propose CircularEval as a more robust alternative to vanilla evaluation, but mention there is room for developing even better strategies. More robust evaluation is key to properly benchmarking models. 

- Improving cross-instance understanding and logical reasoning. The evaluation reveals weaknesses of current models in these areas, suggesting they are promising avenues for future research and optimization of vision-language models.

- Incorporating object localization into training. The authors observe strong performance by models trained with object localization data, indicating this could benefit other models as well.

- Exploring few-shot evaluation protocols. The authors plan to construct a subset for few-shot evaluation, anticipating this will become a standard assessment approach similar to natural language models.

- Pursuing stronger instruction-following capabilities. The authors note current models struggle to follow instructions for choice output, suggesting improving instruction-following is important for broader applications.

In summary, the main future directions are: expanding the taxonomy, developing more robust evaluation, improving cross-instance and logic reasoning abilities, adding object localization data, exploring few-shot evaluation, and strengthening instruction-following. The analysis provides insights into current model limitations to guide the research community.

MMBench contains around 3000 multiple choice questions covering 20 ability dimensions, providing a comprehensive assessment of models' capabilities. The questions are carefully curated from multiple sources to ensure diversity. 

MMBench also proposes a robust evaluation strategy called CircularEval, where each question is tested multiple times with shifted choices. This prevents models from exploiting biases in the dataset. To handle free-form outputs, MMBench leverages ChatGPT for choice extraction. Experiments show ChatGPT can match human performance on this task. The paper comprehensively evaluates 14 vision-language models on MMBench, revealing their individual strengths and weaknesses. The observations provide insights into training data selection, model architectures, and other factors for future optimization of multi-modality models.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes MMBench, a new multi-modality benchmark for evaluating vision-language models. MMBench contains around 3000 multiple-choice questions covering 20 distinct abilities, ensuring diversity and comprehensiveness. To enable robust evaluation, the paper introduces a novel CircularEval strategy where each question is tested multiple times with circularly shifted choices. The model must succeed in all passes to be considered correct. To handle free-form model outputs, ChatGPT is used to match predictions to choices. The paper shows ChatGPT can accurately extract choices, even for models with poor instruction following. MMBench employs ChatGPT to convert predictions to choices, then compares to ground truth answers. This allows fair evaluation across models and avoids false negatives from strict matching. The comprehensive benchmark and robust evaluation strategy allows systematic assessment of vision-language models across diverse abilities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It discusses the challenges with current benchmarks for evaluating large vision-language models, including:

1) Inefficient data collection - Existing benchmarks either require lots of human effort to collect data (not scalable) or aggregate most public datasets (introduces redundancy). 

2) Inefficient evaluation metrics - Depend too much on biased human judgment or use strict exact match, leading to false negatives.

- To address these issues, the paper proposes MMBench, a new multi-modality benchmark with two main features:

1) Systematically collected dataset with ~3000 multiple choice questions covering a diverse range of 20 abilities, ensuring conciseness and diversity.

2) A robust evaluation strategy called CircularEval that uses ChatGPT to match model predictions to choices, enabling fair comparison of models with different instruction following capabilities.
