# [Chain-of-Discussion: A Multi-Model Framework for Complex Evidence-Based   Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16313)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Open-ended question answering is challenging for large language models (LLMs) as it requires finding appropriate evidence, reasoned analysis, and discussion of relevant scenarios beyond the literal question.  
- Issues include unreliable evidence selection, incomplete analysis, incorrect reasoning paths leading to problematic or misleading answers.

Proposed Solution:
- A new Chain-of-Discussion (CoD) framework that allows multiple LLMs to interact by summarizing, criticizing and revising each other's outputs.  
- Aims to provide more correct and comprehensive answers by leveraging synergies between different LLMs. 

Key Contributions:
- Collected a high quality dataset of 200 Chinese legal consultation questions with annotated evidence and answers.
- Proposed the CoD framework for multi-LLM interaction via summarize-criticize-revise steps to reduce hallucination and improve evidence selection.  
- Showed through experiments that the framework helps individual LLMs benefit from each other and enhances the quality of their responses in terms of correctness and comprehensiveness.
- Released the new legal consultation dataset and code to support further research.

The paper addresses an important challenge in complex open-ended QA where single LLMs struggle. The proposed CoD framework is novel in enabling synergistic multi-LLM discussions to overcome individual model limitations. Experiments demonstrate clear improvements in answer quality across correctness and comprehensiveness dimensions.
