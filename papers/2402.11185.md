# [Minimally Supervised Topological Projections of Self-Organizing Maps for   Phase of Flight Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11185)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Identifying phases of flight in general aviation is important for flight safety but manual labeling of flight data is expensive and time-consuming. 
- General aviation flight data is large-scale, per-second, class imbalanced, and rules for labeling flight phases lack granularity for automation.
- Training classifiers on this data faces challenges of needing large labeled datasets and robustness to class imbalance.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a novel Minimally Supervised Self-Organizing Map (MS-SOM) method that can effectively classify flight phases using very little labeled data. 
- MS-SOM utilizes topological nearest neighbors in a trained SOM for "informed" majority votes on class estimates.
- Compare MS-SOM with standard SOM trained on full labeled dataset.

Contributions:
- Created and publicly released a dataset of 6 files with 41K rows of sensor data from Cessna 172S flights with expert annotated flight phases.
- Demonstrated MS-SOM reaches similar accuracy to standard SOM using full flight file with only 30 labeled rows per class.
- Showed MS-SOM significantly outperforms standard SOM on minority classes due to class imbalance robustness.  
- Results highlight that very little labeled flight data is needed for effective phase of flight identification using MS-SOM.
- MS-SOM methodology has potential for minimally supervised learning in other domains with class imbalanced data.

In summary, this paper proposed an MS-SOM method that can effectively classify flight phases using minimal labeled data, created and released a useful new flight dataset, and demonstrated the approach is robust to class imbalance, outperforming standard SOMs. The results showcase the potential of MS-SOM for minimally supervised learning in aviation and other domains.
