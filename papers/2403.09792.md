# [Images are Achilles' Heel of Alignment: Exploiting Visual   Vulnerabilities for Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09792)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have potential safety issues like their backbone language models, as they can still generate harmful responses when presented with malicious instructions and images. 
- However, there lacks a systematic analysis on how visual inputs influence the harmlessness of MLLMs' responses.

Methodology:  
- The authors first empirically analyze several MLLMs by evaluating their responses on harmful text prompts, with and without images.
- They find that images pose alignment vulnerabilities to MLLMs - the presence and harmfulness level of images correlate with higher rates of models generating harmful responses.  
- Based on these findings, they propose HADES, a 3-step jailbreak approach to generate adversarial examples for auditing MLLMs' safety:
   1) Hide textual harmfulness as image pointers
   2) Amplify image harmfulness with an iterative optimization method 
   3) Further amplify via adversarial attack on visual embeddings

Experiments:
- Test HADES on both open-source (e.g. LLaVA, MiniGPT) and commercial MLLMs (e.g. Gemini Pro Vision)
- It effectively fools models to give affirmative and harmful responses, achieving high attack success rates of 90.26% on LLaVA-1.5 and 71.60% on Gemini.

Contributions:
- Provides new empirical analysis and insights on harmfulness issues of MLLMs w.r.t. visual inputs
- Proposes an automated jailbreak approach that exploits MLLMs' visual alignment vulnerabilities
- Extensive experiments demonstrating efficacy of the HADES method

The key message is that images can introduce additional harmfulness vulnerabilities not present in language-only models, which the HADES attack exposes and takes advantage of through hiding, amplifying, and adversarially optimizing visual harmfulness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors conduct detailed empirical studies on the harmlessness alignment of representative multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and systematically investigate the possible sourcing factors that violate the harmlessness alignment of MLLMs. The results reveal that the visual modality of MLLMs poses a critical alignment vulnerability.

2. The authors introduce HADES, a novel jailbreak approach that hides and amplifies the harmfulness of the original malicious intent using meticulously crafted images. Experimental results show that both open-source MLLMs based on aligned LLMs and powerful closed-source MLLMs struggle to resist HADES. Notably, HADES achieves an Attack Success Rate of 90.26% on LLaVA-1.5 and 71.60% on Gemini Pro Vision.

In summary, the key contribution is revealing the alignment vulnerability posed by the visual modality in MLLMs, and demonstrating a new jailbreak method that exploits this vulnerability to effectively attack major MLLMs. The findings underscore the need for further research into cross-modal alignment for MLLMs.

The paper conducts an empirical analysis of harmlessness alignment in MLLMs, revealing vulnerabilities posed by the visual modality. It then proposes a jailbreaking approach called HADES that hides and amplifies harmfulness using crafted images to exploit these vulnerabilities. Key terms cover concepts related to multimodal models, alignment, adversarial attacks, the proposed HADES approach, evaluation metrics, and the models analyzed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes hiding and amplifying harmfulness in images to jailbreak multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Could you explain in more detail the motivation behind this approach and why images were chosen as the attack vector? 

2. The three-stage attack strategy utilizes typography, an optimized harmful image, and an adversarial image. Could you walk through each stage in more depth and explain the purpose and implementation of each component?

3. The paper finds that images can act as an alignment backdoor for MLLMs. What specifically makes images a vulnerability compared to text inputs? How does cross-modal fine-tuning exacerbate this issue?

4. When optimizing image harmfulness, the paper uses an iterative process with an LLM attacker model. What is the logic behind taking an optimization approach here? How does the LLM enable more effective image optimization versus just using a single harmful image?  

5. For the adversarial image component, gradient update is used to optimize the noise. Explain this process in greater technical detail - what is the objective function, how are gradients calculated, what constraints are in place?

6. Analysis shows the attack has strong transferability across MLLMs, but lower transferability between certain categories. What underlying reasons could explain this difference in transfer rates? 

7. The results show different MLLMs have varying degrees of robustness to the HADES attack. Compare and contrast two MLLMs in terms of what factors contribute most to model robustness against this style of attack.  

8. The papercategorizes successful jailbreak cases into OCR, captioning, and instruction following. Speculate on how deficiencies in each of these areas specifically enable the attack to succeed. 

9. The attack hides textual harmfulness in images. Can you conceive of other modalities besides images that harmful content could be hidden in? Would the attack methodology differ across modalities?

10. The paper suggests future work on cross-modal alignment. What specific techniques could strengthen multimodal integration to prevent the vulnerabilities exposed in this attack? What challenges exist in that endeavor?
