# [Colorful Image Colorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an automatic colorization algorithm that produces vibrant, perceptually realistic, and plausible colorizations of grayscale images? The key points are:- Previous colorization methods using deep learning produce desaturated and implausible results. This is likely due to using loss functions that minimize Euclidean error, which encourages conservative predictions.- The authors propose framing colorization as a multinomial classification problem to model the multimodal nature of color and better capture ambiguity.- They use a classification loss with a rebalancing scheme to emphasize rare colors. This encourages exploiting diversity in the large-scale training data.- Their method produces more vibrant and realistic colorizations compared to previous approaches, as evaluated through a "colorization Turing test" and other metrics.- Colorization serves as an effective pretext task for self-supervised representation learning, achieving competitive results on several benchmarks.In summary, the main hypothesis is that modeling colorization as classification with class rebalancing can produce more vibrant and realistic automatic colorizations compared to previous approaches. The method is extensively evaluated to test this hypothesis.
