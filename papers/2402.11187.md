# [LaCo: Large Language Model Pruning via Layer Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11187)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly increasing in size, leading to high costs for training and inference. 
- Existing methods to reduce costs like quantization, distillation and pruning have drawbacks: impacts performance, requires extensive training, alters model structure.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new layer-wise structured pruning method called "Layer Collapse" (LaCo). 
- Rear layers of the LLM collapse into a prior layer, aiming to preserve the model's output representation as closely as possible. This directly removes 30-50% of layers without retraining.
- The method is based on "Reserving-Differences-while-Seeking-Common" (RDSC) layer merge. This involves parameter differencing between layers and merging the differences to substitute multiple layers with one layer.

Main Contributions:
- LaCo outperforms state-of-the-art structured pruning methods by over 10% in maintaining average task performance at 25-30% pruning ratios.
- It preserves the model structure and intermediate dimensions, enabling quick adaptation.
- Post-training experiments show pruned models via LaCo rapidly converge, indicating effective inheritance of original model parameters.
- Analysis of layer similarity and evaluations across pruning ratios motivate and validate the approach.

In summary, the paper introduces LaCo, a straightforward yet powerful layer collapse method to effectively prune large language models while maintaining performance and model structure. Experiments and analysis demonstrate clear improvements over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a concise layer-wise structured pruning method called Layer Collapse (LaCo) which involves collapsing rear model layers into preceding layers to rapidly reduce model size while preserving performance and structure better than state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a concise layer-wise structured pruning method called "Layer Collapse (LaCo)". The key aspects of the LaCo method include:

- It can directly remove 30%-50% of model layers without training while maintaining over 80% of model performance on average. Experiments show it outperforms existing state-of-the-art structured pruning methods.

- It preserves the internal structure of model layers, maintaining intermediate dimensions unchanged. This allows it to be quickly adapted to existing applications. 

- Experiments confirm that models pruned by LaCo can efficiently inherit parameters from the original model. After minimal post-training, the pruned models can restore performance and converge at a similar loss level to the original models.

- The motivation stems from observing high similarity in parameters and representations between adjacent layers in LLMs. This led to the proposed "Reserving-Differences-while-Seeking-Common Layer Merge" idea.

- It demonstrates stable performance across varying pruning ratios, with average scores staying above 70% even when nearly 50% of parameters are pruned.

In summary, the main contribution is the LaCo pruning method that is concise, preserves model structure, inherits parameters effectively, and significantly outperforms existing pruning techniques.
