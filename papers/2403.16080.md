## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- High-quality reconstruction and photo-realistic rendering of human activities is important for applications like AR/VR and 3D content production, but remains challenging due to complexity of human shapes, motions, and scenes.
- Lack of large-scale, high-fidelity datasets of human performances is impeding progress. Existing datasets lack scale, detail, complexity of motions, interactions, and high resolution.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present PKU-DyMVHumans, a large-scale multi-view video dataset of human performances designed for high-fidelity reconstruction and rendering. 
- It contains 8.2 million frames captured by 56-60 synchronized cameras across 45 scenes featuring 32 subjects doing various activities like dance, sports, fashion shows etc.
- It has high resolution (4K), intricate texture details, complex cloth and body motions, human-object and multi-person interactions against complex backgrounds.

Main Contributions:
- The dataset enables research in high-fidelity neural human modeling - tasks like foreground/background decomposition, novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes, 3D human reconstruction etc.
- Authors provide an off-the-shelf benchmark framework to easily implement and evaluate state-of-the-art NeRF-based approaches on the dataset.
- Extensive experiments conducted with analysis and insights revealing new challenges that emerge from using such high-fidelity dynamic data.
- Addresses gap between existing datasets and requirements of real-world dynamic human reconstruction and rendering applications.

In summary, the paper presents a large-scale, detailed multi-view video dataset of human performances to foster research into high-fidelity neural modeling of dynamic humans against complex backgrounds.
