# [Visual Prompting Upgrades Neural Network Sparsification: A Data-Model   Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01397)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large neural network models like vision transformers have very high computational and memory costs. Pruning models by removing unimportant parameters can reduce these costs, but most pruning methods take a model-centric perspective, focusing only on analyzing the model topology. The role of data and its interaction with model-centric pruning is not well explored. Specifically, the effect of "visual prompts" on sparse vision model performance is not clear. 

Proposed Solution - VPNs Framework:

The paper first conducts a pilot study showing that simply adding visual prompts to pruned vision models does not improve performance. To effectively utilize visual prompts, the authors propose a data-model co-design framework called VPNs:

1) VPNs designs appropriate visual prompts by adding learnable perturbation parameters to the input images.

2) It jointly optimizes these prompt parameters and weight masks to identify a high-quality sparse subnetwork.

3) The identified subnetwork is further fine-tuned together with the visual prompt.

This allows pruning in a data-model synergistic manner, leveraging both model topology and input data.

Main Contributions:

- Systematic study showing inefficacy of post-pruning visual prompts for vision models.

- Proposal of VPNs, a new data-model co-design pruning paradigm using visual prompts.

- Extensive experiments showing VPNs outperforms SOTA methods by 1.7-3.5% in accuracy across architectures and datasets.

- Demonstration of better transferability of VPNs' sparse masks across downstream tasks.

- Potential for VPNs to enable real-time speedups with competitive accuracy.

Overall the paper explores an underexplored area of using data-centric techniques to enhance model compression and provides useful insights into data-model co-design for vision model sparsification.
