# [DGNet: Dynamic Gradient-guided Network with Noise Suppression for   Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06999)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes DGNet, a lightweight and efficient network for underwater image enhancement. DGNet introduces a dynamic gradient guidance strategy that constructs additional gradients from pseudo-labels generated by applying CLAHE to the network's predictions. This allows the network to focus more deeply on image degradation factors and avoids getting stuck in local optima during training. To address noise, DGNet presents two modules - the Feature Restoration and Reconstruction (FRR) module that eliminates irregular noise and other factors by reconstructing the feature distribution, and the Frequency Domain Smoothing (FRS) module that smooths motion noise and artifacts using fixed-weight Laplacian convolutions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with a PSNR of 25.6dB on UIEB, achieved using only 0.2M parameters. Compared to a recent top method, DGNet attains a 3.3% higher PSNR and 61.7% higher efficiency with 88.3% fewer parameters, making it well-suited for practical underwater applications. The simplicity, efficiency and strong performance of DGNet stems from its dynamic gradient strategy and noise handling modules that allow it to generalize effectively across diverse underwater conditions.
