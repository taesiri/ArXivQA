# [DGNet: Dynamic Gradient-guided Network with Noise Suppression for   Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06999)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Underwater image enhancement (UIE) is challenging due to multiple degradation factors like noise, uneven illumination, blurring, and color shifts. 
- Existing methods either oversimplify the degradation model or rely too much on synthetic datasets, limiting their generalization. 
- Many methods also neglect the impact of noise or require high computational complexity.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a lightweight Dynamic Gradient-guided Network (DGNet) for efficient UIE.

Key Components:
- Feature Restoration and Reconstruction (FRR) module - Removes noise and reconstructs feature distribution using channel combination inference and fusion.
- Frequency Domain Smoothing (FRS) module - Smooths motion noise and artifacts using fixed-weight Laplacian convolution. 
- Dynamic gradient guidance - Uses predicted images to generate pseudo-labels and additional gradients, helping avoid local optima.
- Custom loss function - Combines reference loss, perceptual loss and dynamic tuning loss for optimization.

Main Contributions:
- FRR and FRS modules effectively handle noise and distortions with low overhead.
- Dynamic gradient strategy adapts to diverse scenarios and avoids poor local optima.
- Comprehensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets with fewer parameters and high efficiency.
- Achieves PSNR of 25.6dB on UIEB, surpassing top methods like Semi-UIR and Rex-Net.
- Small model operates at 26 FPS on 1080P images with an RTX 3090 GPU.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient network architecture and training strategy to address key challenges in UIE regarding noise, distortions and dataset limitations. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the approach.
