# [DGNet: Dynamic Gradient-guided Network with Noise Suppression for   Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06999)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes DGNet, a lightweight and efficient network for underwater image enhancement. DGNet introduces a dynamic gradient guidance strategy that constructs additional gradients from pseudo-labels generated by applying CLAHE to the network's predictions. This allows the network to focus more deeply on image degradation factors and avoids getting stuck in local optima during training. To address noise, DGNet presents two modules - the Feature Restoration and Reconstruction (FRR) module that eliminates irregular noise and other factors by reconstructing the feature distribution, and the Frequency Domain Smoothing (FRS) module that smooths motion noise and artifacts using fixed-weight Laplacian convolutions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with a PSNR of 25.6dB on UIEB, achieved using only 0.2M parameters. Compared to a recent top method, DGNet attains a 3.3% higher PSNR and 61.7% higher efficiency with 88.3% fewer parameters, making it well-suited for practical underwater applications. The simplicity, efficiency and strong performance of DGNet stems from its dynamic gradient strategy and noise handling modules that allow it to generalize effectively across diverse underwater conditions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a lightweight and efficient underwater image enhancement network called DGNet that uses dynamic gradient guidance and specialized noise reduction modules to achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and higher efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes DGNet, a dynamic gradient-guided network for underwater image enhancement (UIE). DGNet uses a pseudo-label strategy to construct additional dynamic gradients that guide the network to focus more on the fundamental causes of image degradation. This helps the network adapt to diverse scenarios.

2) It designs modules like Feature Restoration and Reconstruction (FRR) and Frequency Domain Smoothing (FRS) to address the impact of noise on UIE. Unlike other denoising methods, these modules do not target specific noise types but eliminate degradation factors deviating from the overall distribution.

3) DGNet has a simple and efficient architecture with low parameter size, making it suitable for practical underwater applications. Experiments show it achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with fewer parameters and higher efficiency compared to existing methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient network architecture for UIE that uses dynamic gradients and specialized modules to address issues like noise and adaptation to diverse underwater conditions. Its simplicity, low parameter size and high performance make it practical for real-world usage.
