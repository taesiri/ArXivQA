# [Region-Aware Exposure Consistency Network for Mixed Exposure Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18217)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing exposure correction methods typically address either overexposure or underexposure in images, but struggle with images that have mixed exposure (both overexposed and underexposed regions). Mixed exposure images have non-uniform distributions that vary across regions, making them challenging to handle in a unified framework. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Region-aware Exposure Correction Network (RECNet) to effectively handle images with mixed exposure. The key ideas are:

1) A Region-aware De-exposure Module (RDM) that segments the image into overexposed and underexposed regions using a learned mask predictor. It then normalizes the features of each region separately to map them into an exposure-invariant space. 

2) A Mixed-scale Restoration Unit (MRU) that integrates the normalized features with the original features using multi-scale convolutions and channel-wise attention. This helps recover discriminative details that may be lost during normalization.

3) An Exposure Contrastive Regularization (ECR) strategy that constraints intra-region consistency and inter-region continuity of exposure. This achieves uniform exposure distribution globally.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to explicitly address correction of mixed exposure in a single image containing both overexposed and underexposed regions
- Novel region-aware normalization scheme to handle varying exposure distributions 
- Multi-scale feature integration and exposure contrastive regularization for optimal color/detail correction
- State-of-the-art performance on datasets containing images with mixed exposure

The proposed RECNet demonstrates superior exposure correction ability on images with spatially-varying and mixed exposure levels compared to previous methods. The modular design also allows the region-aware de-exposure module to be integrated into other baseline networks and improve their performance.
