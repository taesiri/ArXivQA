# [GPT-4's assessment of its performance in a USMLE-based case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09654)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper investigates the performance and confidence levels of the large language model (LLM) GPT-4 on a set of questions from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). As LLMs are increasingly used in sensitive domains like healthcare, understanding their capabilities and limitations is crucial. Specifically, the study examines how providing feedback to GPT-4 on the correctness of its answers impacts its confidence in its responses.

Methodology 
The authors prompted GPT-4 with 100 USMLE-based multiple choice questions, as well as some additional high school biology questions. For each question, the model provided an absolute confidence score (AC) from 0 to 1 on its ability to answer correctly, as well as a relative confidence score (RC) comparing itself to other LLMs. These confidence scores were elicited both before and after answering each question. The questions were divided into two groups - with feedback (WF) where GPT-4 was told after answering if its response was correct, and no feedback (NF).

Key Findings
- On average, median confidence scores were around 0.9 for both AC and RC, before and after answering questions. 
- Providing feedback influenced GPT-4's relative confidence in its abilities but did not consistently increase or decrease confidence levels.
- For the WF group, accuracy was 88% compared to 92% for the NF group, indicating feedback does not strictly correlate with higher performance. 
- Statistical analysis did not show significant differences in average confidence between WF and NF groups. But qualitative inspection revealed instances where confidence deviated more extremely without feedback.
- Sequential analysis indicates feedback makes GPT-4's confidence more volatile and sensitive to errors. The model expressed higher overall confidence when answering questions without external feedback.

In conclusion, the study demonstrates the intricate relationship between confidence calibration and performance in LLMs, underscoring the need for further research as these models are increasingly trusted for sensitive tasks like healthcare.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This study analyzes GPT-4's confidence levels and accuracy when answering medical questions from the USMLE exam in order to understand the impact of feedback on the model's self-assessment capabilities, finding that feedback influences relative confidence but does not consistently increase or decrease it.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contribution of this paper is:

This study investigates GPT-4's assessment of its performance in healthcare applications using questions from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). The key findings are:

1) Feedback influences the relative confidence of GPT-4 but doesn't consistently increase or decrease it. 

2) In the absence of feedback, GPT-4 exhibits slightly higher accuracy (92% vs 88% with feedback) in answering USMLE questions.

3) Analysis shows instances where GPT-4 displays overconfidence by having high confidence even when providing incorrect answers. There are also cases where it shows under-confidence by having low confidence even for correct answers.

4) The study underscores the complexity of confidence calibration in language models and its impact on accuracy, especially for sensitive applications like healthcare. It highlights the need for further research to optimize feedback mechanisms to improve AI reliability.

In summary, this paper explores GPT-4's confidence in handling medical data, evaluates the model's self-assessment capabilities, and analyzes the role of feedback in influencing its confidence - making a case for rigorous testing before real-world deployment in healthcare.

The paper explores GPT-4's performance and confidence levels in addressing questions from the USMLE exam, comparing cases with and without feedback provided to the model. It analyzes concepts like the confidence-competence gap in AI and the role of feedback mechanisms in improving confidence calibration. The goal is to shed light on the reliability of large language models like GPT-4 for sensitive use cases such as healthcare.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper categorizes the questions into two groups - with feedback (WF) and no feedback (NF). What are some potential advantages and disadvantages of providing feedback to the model when evaluating its responses? How might this impact model performance and calibration?

2. The study uses a simple prompting technique to elicit responses from the model. In what ways could more complex prompting strategies provide additional insights into the model's capabilities and thought processes? What are some prompting techniques you would suggest exploring? 

3. The paper examines both absolute confidence (AC) and relative confidence (RC) scores of the model. What might account for the instances where AC and RC scores diverge or demonstrate inconsistent patterns in the results? What theories could potentially explain this?

4. One interesting result is that feedback does not necessarily correlate with higher accuracy rates. What factors might lead feedback to sometimes decrease model accuracy? How could the impact of feedback be further studied?  

5. The distribution plots reveal potential differences in confidence between WF and NF groups, especially at the extremes of the distributions. Why is it important to study the tails of the distributions and not just central tendencies when evaluating model confidence?

6. The violin plots demonstrate that median confidence can be high for both correct and incorrect answers. How should we interpret what appears to be overconfidence in incorrect answers? What mechanisms could better calibrate confidence to accuracy?

7. The sequential analysis provides a narrative of how confidence evolves over the sequence of questions. What insights do the abrupt changes in confidence scores reveal about the model's decision process? How could this sequential approach be expanded?

8. While the statistical tests indicate minimal difference between WF and NF, the distribution and sequential plots reveal potentially notable differences. How do you reconcile and contextualize these statistical versus visual results? What future analyses could provide more conclusive insights?

9. The paper speculates the model may be over-adjusting confidence in response to feedback leading to errors or attempting to re-calibrate itself. What studies could further investigate the dynamics of how models self-correct confidence levels in response to external input? 

10. The paper surfaces tensions between potential overconfidence and under-confidence of model predictions. What framework would you propose to identify optimal confidence levels that maximize reliability and adoption of AI tools like GPT-4? What factors should determine target confidence scores?
