# [Query-OPT: Optimizing Inference of Large Language Models via Multi-Query   Instructions in Meeting Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00067)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Using large language models (LLMs) for query-based meeting summarization requires calling the LLM inference API/endpoint for each new query, even if the context (meeting transcript) is the same. This significantly increases costs.
- Techniques like knowledge distillation and quantization can optimize costs but have limitations (e.g. reduced accuracy) and don't work for closed-source models like GPT-4.

Proposed Solution:  
- Investigate if combining multiple queries for the same meeting transcript into a single prompt can minimize API calls and reduce costs.
- Created a multi-query version of the QMSUM dataset and evaluated ability of various LLMs to follow multi-query instructions.

Models Evaluated:
- Closed-source: GPT-4, PaLM-2
- Open-source (default & fine-tuned): LLaMA-2, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, FLAN-T5

Key Findings:
- Most models fail to generate outputs in the required format despite responding to multi-query prompts.
- GPT-4 stands out in its ability to reliably follow instructions and generate formatted outputs summarizing multiple queries.  
- Fine-tuned open-source models perform better on single queries than multi-queries.
- Proposed new ROUGE-based evaluation approach to compare models fairly.

Main Contributions:
- Insights on ability of different LLMs to follow multi-query prompts to optimize costs.
- Identification of GPT-4's superior performance on multi-query meeting summarization. 
- Evaluation methodology for multi-query summarization when output format varies across models.

Limitations and Future Work:
- Limited human evaluation of quality of generated summaries.
- Effects of training data size need further investigation.
- More prompt engineering could further improve multi-query performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper investigates whether combining multiple queries for the same input context in a single prompt can be successfully used to minimize repeated calls to large language model inference endpoints in the task of query-focused meeting summarization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper conducts an extensive evaluation of various language models (LMs) on their ability to follow multi-query instructions for query-focused meeting summarization. Specifically, it studies whether LMs can process prompts that combine multiple queries for the same meeting transcript, in order to minimize repeated calls to the LLM inference API. This is done to optimize production costs when deploying LMs in real-world applications. The paper compares the performance of open-source and closed-source LMs on single-query and multi-query versions of a meeting summarization dataset. It finds that most LMs successfully respond to multi-query prompts but fail to generate properly formatted responses. The key insight is that ability to reliably follow multi-query instructions is limited to certain LMs like GPT-4. The experimental results provide guidance on optimizing prompts to reduce production costs while ensuring high LLM accuracy when building real-world systems.

It conducts an extensive evaluation of various popular LLMs on their ability to follow multi-query instructions and generate summaries from meeting transcripts. The key goals are reducing production costs while deploying LLMs in real-world systems and understanding which models have the emergent capabilities for multi-query prompting. Overall, the paper provides insights into prompt optimization strategies alongside model strengths and limitations in multi-query settings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes combining multiple queries for the same context into a single prompt to optimize inference cost. What are some potential challenges or limitations of this approach? For example, is there a risk of the model getting confused with multiple queries or exceeding maximum token limits?

2. The paper evaluates performance using ROUGE scores in both single-query and multi-query settings. What other evaluation metrics could also be used to compare model performance in these two settings more thoroughly? 

3. The paper finds most models fail to generate responses in the required JSON format consistently, even after fine-tuning. What techniques could help improve the models' ability to follow precise output instructions and formats?

4. For the models that did manage some level of correct JSON formatted responses (GPT-4, Mixtral-8x7B), what accounts for their better performance? Are there any model architecture differences that enable this?

5. The paper limits analysis to a specific query-focused meeting summarization dataset. How would the findings generalize or differ across other long-form conversation summarization tasks?

6. GPT-4 demonstrated better instruction following for multi-query prompts. Does this indicate emerging abilities in certain large language models? What is needed to further test and develop these abilities?  

7. The paper briefly mentions prompt engineering as a limitation. What specific prompt optimization techniques could help improve multi-query performance and output formatting for models like LLaMA, PaLM, etc?

8. How do optimal context lengths and maximum token limits impact the feasibility of multi-query prompting for real-time production systems? Is there a threshold where it becomes impractical?

9. For the models with 0% JSON formatting accuracy, what level of human post-processing would be needed to parse and extract query-summary pairs from the generated text? Is this viable in practice?

10. Beyond inference cost optimization, what other production bottlenecks exist when deploying LLMs for multi-query meeting summarization? How should end-to-end systems be designed?
