## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Designing effective and efficient neural network architectures for image segmentation is challenging and labor intensive, requiring a lot of manual effort.  
- Naively replacing convolution layers with self-attention layers is inefficient due to high memory and computation costs, especially for high resolution feature maps.
- Manually designing networks that combine convolutional and self-attention layers in multi-resolution, multi-branch frameworks is non-trivial.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search (HyCTAS) framework to automatically search for efficient segmentation networks.
- Design a search space with multi-resolution, multi-branch components to preserve high resolution representations.
- Introduce a light-weight convolution module and a memory-efficient self-attention module as basic building blocks.
- Employ a genetic search algorithm to optimize for multiple objectives like latency and accuracy to find Pareto optimal architectures.

Main Contributions:
- Novel search space design supporting multi-resolution multi-branch combinations and multiple modules (conv, attention).
- New memory-efficient self-attention module and light-weight conv module tailored for segmentation.  
- Multi-objective search strategy to find networks balancing speed and accuracy.
- State-of-the-art tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency on Cityscapes segmentation benchmark.
- Analysis provides insights into integrating self-attention into convolutional nets.

In summary, the paper presents an automated search framework to design fast and accurate networks combining convolutional and self-attention layers for semantic image segmentation. The approach sets new state-of-the-art results on the Cityscapes dataset.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called HyCTAS to automatically search for efficient semantic segmentation architectures that combine high-resolution representations, attention mechanisms, multi-resolution feature fusion, and optimizations for multiple objectives like performance and speed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It designs a novel searching framework incorporating a multi-branch space for high resolution representation and a genetic-based multi-objective search (considering metrics like latency and mIoU). This allows obtaining multiple networks covering both real-time speed and high precision within a single search.

2. It presents a series of Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search (HyCTAS) models that combine a light-weight convolution module to reduce computation cost while preserving high-resolution information, and a memory efficient self-attention module to attend long-range dependencies. This enables searching for efficient architectures with high-resolution representations and attention.

3. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes demonstrate better efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods on semantic segmentation. The searched architectures not only fuse features selectively for efficiency but also maintain high resolution representations for performance.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel architecture search framework to automatically design networks combining convolutional and attention modules for efficient high-resolution semantic segmentation.
