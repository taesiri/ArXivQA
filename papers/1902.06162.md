## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Learning Features from Synthetic Data: With the increasing availability of large-scale synthetic datasets generated by game engines, the authors suggest exploring self-supervised methods that can learn visual features from synthetic data. Bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data is noted as an open problem.

- Learning from Web Data: The authors suggest leveraging the vast amount of web data (e.g. images and videos from Flickr, YouTube) and their associated metadata (titles, tags, comments) for self-supervised learning. Dealing with noise in web data is noted as a challenge. 

- Learning Spatiotemporal Features from Videos: The authors note that self-supervised video feature learning, especially with 3DConvNets, is relatively less explored compared to images. Developing more effective pretext tasks specifically for spatiotemporal feature learning from videos is suggested.

- Multi-modal and Multi-sensor Learning: The authors suggest exploring self-supervised methods that can utilize data captured by different sensors and modalities (e.g. RGB, depth, audio, ego-motion sensors in self-driving cars) by using the relationships between them as supervision signal.

- Multi-task Learning: Instead of using a single pretext task, the authors suggest exploring self-supervised methods that combine multiple pretext tasks to provide richer supervision signals and learn more robust features.

In summary, the main future directions highlighted are: leveraging synthetic data, web data, multiple data modalities/sensors, videos, and multi-task learning to develop more effective self-supervised visual feature learning techniques. Handling domain gaps and noise in web data are noted as open challenges.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of deep learning-based self-supervised visual feature learning methods from images and videos. The motivation for self-supervised learning is to avoid the need for expensive human annotation of large-scale datasets. The general pipeline involves defining a pretext task that can generate pseudo-labels automatically, then training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on this pretext task. After pre-training on the proxy task, the CNN can be used for transfer learning on downstream tasks like image classification and action recognition. The paper categorizes common pretext tasks into four types: generation-based (e.g. image colorization), context-based (e.g. solving jigsaw puzzles), free semantic label-based (e.g. predicting foreground masks), and cross-modal-based (e.g. predicting if audio matches video frames). It summarizes common CNN architectures used, datasets, and analyzes the performance of various self-supervised methods on benchmark tasks. The paper concludes by discussing limitations of current methods, particularly for learning spatiotemporal video features, and points out promising future directions such as learning from synthetic data, web data, multi-task learning, and multi-sensor data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of deep learning-based self-supervised general visual feature learning methods from images or videos. Self-supervised learning methods aim to learn visual features from large-scale unlabeled data without using any human-annotated labels. The motivation behind self-supervised learning is to avoid the expensive cost of collecting and annotating large-scale datasets. To learn features without labels, various pretext tasks are designed for neural networks to solve where the labels can be automatically generated based on attributes of images or videos. After self-supervised pretext task training, the learned features can be transferred to downstream computer vision tasks as pre-trained models. 

The paper first describes the motivation, general pipeline, network architectures, and terminology of self-supervised learning. It then summarizes commonly used pretext tasks, datasets, evaluation metrics, and downstream tasks. The pretext tasks are grouped into four categories: generation-based, context-based, free semantic label-based, and cross modal-based. The paper reviews recent self-supervised methods for image feature learning including generation-based methods, context-based methods, and free semantic label-based methods. It also reviews methods for video feature learning including generation-based methods, context-based methods, free semantic label-based methods, and cross modal-based methods. Finally, the paper compares the performance of reviewed methods and discusses promising future research directions such as learning from synthetic data, web data, multiple pretext tasks, and multi-sensor data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised visual feature learning approach using deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). The key idea is to train ConvNets on a pre-defined pretext task using automatically generated pseudo-labels instead of human annotations. Specifically, the method trains ConvNets to solve jigsaw puzzles made up of shuffled image patches. The network is fed image patches extracted from an image, shuffled in random order. The task is to recognize the correct order of the shuffled patches. To accomplish this, the network must capture the spatial context and semantics of the image content. The pseudo-labels for the pretext task (i.e. correct patch order) can be automatically generated without human effort. After pre-training on this self-supervised jigsaw puzzle task over a large unlabeled image dataset, the ConvNet learns meaningful visual features that generalize well to downstream tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation. Fine-tuning the pre-trained ConvNet on a target dataset with human annotations then leads to improved performance on the downstream task. The self-supervised pre-training approach avoids the need for expensive manual labeling for supervised pre-training, while learning useful features.
