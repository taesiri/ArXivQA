# [Self-supervised Visual Feature Learning with Deep Neural Networks: A   Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06162)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main focus of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of recent self-supervised visual feature learning methods using deep convolutional neural networks. The key aspects covered in the paper include:- Motivation for self-supervised learning - to avoid the need for large labeled datasets by learning from unlabeled data.- Terminology definition - key terms like human-annotated labels, pseudo labels, pretext tasks, etc. are clearly defined. - Common network architectures used for self-supervised learning of image and video features.- Categories of pretext tasks - generation-based, context-based, free semantic label-based, and cross modal-based.- Commonly used downstream tasks like image classification, object detection, etc. to evaluate learned features.- Review of existing image and video self-supervised learning methods based on the pretext task categories.- Quantitative performance comparison of different methods on benchmark datasets. - Discussion of limitations and future research directions.So in summary, this paper aims to provide a structured, comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art in self-supervised visual feature learning using deep convolutional neural networks. The central goal is to review the methodology, algorithms, applications and performance of self-supervised learning techniques for computer vision.
