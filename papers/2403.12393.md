# [Dr3: Ask Large Language Models Not to Give Off-Topic Answers in Open   Domain Multi-Hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12393)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Open domain multi-hop question answering (ODMHQA) aims to answer complex questions by reasoning over multiple retrieved passages. 
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving ODMHQA. 
- However, LLMs often generate off-topic answers that are irrelevant to the original questions. Off-topic answers account for around 1/3 of incorrect answers but this issue is underexplored.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Discriminate→Re-Compose→Re-Solve→Re-Decompose (Dr3) mechanism to reduce off-topic answers in ODMHQA.
- A Discriminator module leverages LLM's capabilities to judge if an answer is off-topic. 
- If off-topic, a Corrector module performs step-wise revisions along the reversed reasoning chain until the answer becomes on-topic. This involves re-composing the reasoning, re-solving sub-questions, and re-decomposing the original question.

Main Contributions:
- First work to identify and analyze the prevalent issue of off-topic answers in ODMHQA using LLMs.
- Propose the Dr3 mechanism containing the Discriminator and Corrector modules to alleviate off-topic answers.
- Experiments on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA datasets show Dr3 reduces off-topic answers by 13% and improves performance by 3% in exact match.
- Provide insights on the capability of Discriminator, impacts of different Corrector components, effect of sub-question numbers, and off-topic issue across question types.
