# [Semi-Siamese Bi-encoder Neural Ranking Model Using Lightweight   Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14943)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the key research questions addressed in this paper are:1. Can lightweight fine-tuning (LFT) methods like prefix-tuning and LoRA effectively replace full fine-tuning for BERT-based neural ranking models (NRMs)? 2. Can semi-Siamese network architectures, which allow queries and documents to be handled slightly differently, further improve the performance of LFT for BERT-based bi-encoder NRMs?The central hypothesis seems to be that both LFT and semi-Siamese networks can enhance the performance of BERT-based bi-encoders for document ranking. Specifically:- LFT methods like prefix-tuning and LoRA can achieve comparable or better performance than full fine-tuning while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters. This makes LFT desirable for NRMs.- Semi-Siamese networks, where the query and document encoders have a small number of different parameters, can better reflect the distinct characteristics of queries and documents. This allows better relevance estimation compared to completely shared Siamese encoders.The paper provides extensive experiments with three BERT-based NRMs (monoBERT, TwinBERT, ColBERT) on three datasets to validate these hypotheses. The results confirm that both LFT and semi-Siamese approaches are effective for improving bi-encoder NRMs, especially when queries are short.In summary, the core research questions are about replacing full fine-tuning with LFT and using semi-Siamese networks to improve BERT-based bi-encoder NRMs for document ranking. The hypotheses are that both approaches enhance efficiency and effectiveness compared to the standard practices.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The paper proposes using lightweight fine-tuning methods like prefix-tuning and LoRA to replace the full fine-tuning of existing bi-encoder neural ranking models (NRMs). 2. The paper shows that using semi-Siamese networks can significantly improve performance when queries are very short. The semi-Siamese networks are based on a common pre-trained BERT model with mild differentiation between the query and document networks implemented through lightweight fine-tuning.3. For cross-encoders, the paper shows that adapter-based lightweight fine-tuning methods like LoRA and LoRA+ can improve performance by 0.85-5.29%.4. For bi-encoders, the paper shows that prefix-tuning works well for datasets with short queries like Robust04 and ClueWeb09b. It provides large improvements for TwinBERT and modest gains of 0.12-3.9% for ColBERT.5. For bi-encoders, the paper shows that semi-Siamese learning is effective, providing overall gains of 1.46-16.23% for ColBERT.In summary, the main contributions are proposing lightweight fine-tuning and semi-Siamese networks to improve existing BERT-based neural ranking models, especially bi-encoders, and demonstrating their effectiveness empirically on several datasets. The methods help improve efficiency and performance.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of neural ranking models:- The focus on improving bi-encoders is relevant, as bi-encoders are more efficient but tend to perform worse than cross-encoders. Trying to close this performance gap is an important area of research.- The use of lightweight fine-tuning methods like LoRA and prefix tuning is novel in the context of neural ranking models. Most prior work has focused on full fine-tuning. Showing the efficacy of these methods helps reduce computational requirements.- Investigating semi-Siamese networks is a unique contribution. Allowing limited differences between the query and document encoders is logical given their differing characteristics, but hasn't been explored much before. - The exploration of different lightweight tuning combinations and orderings is thorough. Many options are systematically tested on multiple model types and datasets.- The performance gains over baseline models are modest. Though statistically significant, most improvements are in the 1-5% range. Some other recent papers have shown larger gains with architectural modifications.- The analysis of results based on query characteristics provides useful insights into when different techniques are most impactful.Overall, this paper makes several solid contributions to advancing the state of the art in efficient and effective neural ranking. The modifications proposed are intuitive yet novel, and their impacts are rigorously evaluated. The gains are meaningful, if not huge. This paper nicely complements other recent work focused on improvements in accuracy with bigger architectural changes.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Studying in more depth how the characteristics of queries and documents differ. The authors propose using semi-Siamese networks to handle queries and documents slightly differently to reflect their distinct characteristics. However, they suggest more research is needed to deeply understand how queries and documents differ in their characteristics. - Applying lightweight fine-tuning methods to other neural ranking models beyond the BERT-based models studied in this paper. The authors show lightweight fine-tuning can enhance both cross-encoder and bi-encoder models. They suggest examining if similar benefits can be obtained when applying these methods to other types of neural ranking models.- Investigating other ways to implement semi-Siamese networks for ranking. The authors propose specific implementations of semi-Siamese networks using prefix tuning and LoRA. They suggest exploring other techniques to allow queries and documents to be handled with a limited amount of difference.- Studying the effects of different degrees of parameter sharing in semi-Siamese networks. The authors use only around 1% different parameters for query and document branches. Analyzing the impact of using varying amounts of parameter differences could provide insight into the trade-offs.- Evaluating the methods on a wider range of datasets and real-world systems. The authors demonstrate results on 3 datasets. Testing on more datasets and in operational systems would further validate the benefits. - Combining semi-Siamese networks with other techniques like self-supervised learning to further improve performance. The authors focus only on semi-Siamese and lightweight fine-tuning. Exploring integrating semi-Siamese with other promising techniques could lead to additional gains.In summary, the authors propose continuing to research how to best handle differences between queries and documents, apply lightweight fine-tuning more broadly, design improved semi-Siamese architectures, and combine semi-Siamese networks with other promising techniques for ranking.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes two approaches to improve the performance of BERT-based bi-encoder neural ranking models (NRMs) for information retrieval. The first approach replaces the full fine-tuning of BERT with lightweight fine-tuning methods like adapter-based methods (LoRA), prompt-based methods (prefix-tuning), and hybrids of the two. Experiments on monoBERT, TwinBERT, and ColBERT show these lightweight methods improve performance while reducing computation. The second approach develops semi-Siamese NRMs where query and document encoders have a small number of different weights but share most weights, allowing them to learn some distinct representations while preserving shared knowledge. Experiments show semi-Siamese learning, implemented via lightweight fine-tuning, improves performance, especially for datasets with short queries. The results demonstrate both lightweight fine-tuning and semi-Siamese learning significantly enhance BERT-based bi-encoders. Lightweight fine-tuning also benefits cross-encoder monoBERT.
