# [Jatmo: Prompt Injection Defense by Task-Specific Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17673)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to "prompt injection attacks" where malicious input data can hijack the model's instruction-following abilities. This allows attackers to manipulate the model's responses.
- Prompt injection is a major threat to LLM-integrated applications as attackers can override intended model behavior.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces "Jatmo", a method to create task-specific LLMs resilient to prompt injection attacks. 
- It works by using an "instruction-tuned" teacher model to label a dataset for a specific task. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a "base model" (non-instruction tuned).
- The fine-tuned model solves only that single task but is immune to injected prompts added to inputs.
- Jatmo can automatically generate a synthetic dataset requiring only a task description and optionally a single example input.

Main Contributions:
- First effective defense against prompt injection attacks in LLMs. Reduces attack success rate from 87% down to 0.5%.
- Automated creation of task-specific models robust to attacks. Can work from only a task description. 
- No loss of quality compared to standard models when using sufficient real examples or high-quality synthetic data.
- Easy to apply Jatmo to secure existing or new LLM-integrated applications.

Limitations:
- Requires training one model per task. Upfront cost.  Unsuitable for interactive chatbots.
- Focused on protecting applications rather than chat interfaces.
- Robustness guarantees only provided for prompt injection attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces Jatmo, a method for generating task-specific language models resilient to prompt-injection attacks by using a teacher model to label a dataset that is then used to fine-tune a base model, resulting in models that match the teacher quality while reducing attack success rate from 87% to 0.5%.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contribution of this paper is presenting a method called "Jatmo" for generating task-specific language models that are resilient to prompt-injection attacks. Specifically:

- Jatmo leverages a "teacher" instruction-tuned model to generate a task-specific dataset, which is then used to fine-tune a base model (a non-instruction-tuned model). This results in a model tailored to a specific task that is not vulnerable to injected prompts.

- Jatmo can automatically construct the task-specific model even when no dataset is available, using GPT-4 to generate synthetic inputs. This makes the approach easy to apply.

- Experiments on six tasks show Jatmo models provide high quality outputs while being extremely resilient to prompt injection attacks, reducing attack success rate from 87% on average down to 0.5%.

So in summary, the main contribution is presenting and evaluating a practical defense method against prompt injection attacks by creating task-specific models.

The paper introduces a new framework called "Jatmo" for defending against prompt injection attacks on large language models (LLMs). The key ideas involve using task-specific finetuning of base models on synthetic datasets to create models tailored for a single task that are immune to injected prompts. The framework is evaluated on several language tasks and shown to be highly effective at preventing prompt injection attacks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes fine-tuning a "base model" that is not instruction-tuned. What are the key advantages and disadvantages of using a non-instruction tuned model as the base? How does this impact model performance and security?

2. The framework relies on an "instruction model" to generate the task-specific training data. What are the security implications of using an insecure model in this intermediate step? Could weaknesses in the instruction model compromise the security of the final fine-tuned model?

3. The authors claim task-specific models generated by this framework match the teacher model's quality. But quality is evaluated on metrics like automated ratings and accuracy relative to the teacher model. How might the fine-tuned models fall short in absolute quality compared to large models like GPT-3.5?  

4. Synthetic dataset generation seems crucial when real training data is limited. How might the zero-shot and one-shot synthetic datasets fail to capture key properties of real-world data for certain tasks? When would you expect zero-shot synthetic data to be inadequate?

5. The framework cuts the prompt injection success rate from 87% to 0.5%. What are limitations of the attacks evaluated? What more sophisticated prompt injection strategies might successfully attack models produced by this framework?

6. The paper focuses on defending prompt injection attacks for LLM-integrated applications. What challenges remain in scaling this defense to interactive chat platforms where prompts vary widely?

7. Query parameterization is cited as the accepted defense for SQL injection attacks. Beyond separating control from data, what are key differences in how this framework adapts query parameterization principles for securing LLMs?

8. What implementation challenges might arise in applying this framework to production LLM-integrated applications? How might the need to train specialized models impact development and deployment pipelines?  

9. The paper mentions combining indirect prompt injection across chained models. How might defenses fail if attacks extend across composed services relying on vulnerable base models? 

10. This framework defends specifically against prompt injection and not alignment or adversarial examples. How do you see defenses against these issues intersecting with methods like this one focused narrowly on prompt injection?
