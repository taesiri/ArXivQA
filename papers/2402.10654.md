# [Enhancing Numerical Reasoning with the Guidance of Reliable Reasoning   Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10654)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Numerical reasoning is an important capability for NLP systems to handle numeric information in texts and tables. 
- Recent work shows that teaching models to generate reasoning processes alongside answers significantly improves performance.  
- However, most methods generate reasoning processes using large language models (LLMs), which can be unreliable as they may contain extraneous information not supporting the answer.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Encore, a method to generate reliable reasoning processes by decomposing the answer formula into operators and operands. 
- This ensures the process fully supports the answer. 
- To overcome insufficient training data, Encore uses pre-training tasks with synthesized data to teach process generation.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes Encore to generate reliable reasoning processes by decomposing answer formulas, ensuring full support for the answer.
- Introduces pre-training tasks to alleviate insufficient training data for process generation.  
- Evaluates Encore on 5 datasets, showing average 1.8% improvement over baselines. Outperforms processes from GPT-3.5 by 10%.
- Analyzes performance over different answer and evidence types. Shows particular gains on tabular evidence and arithmetic answers.
- Limitations include reliance on labeled formulas and simple operand extraction.

In summary, the paper presents Encore to improve numerical reasoning by generating reliable reasoning processes. Pre-training tasks aid learning the process generation. Experiments demonstrate clear improvements across datasets. The reliability of processes is a key benefit over existing methods.
