# [Enhancing Numerical Reasoning with the Guidance of Reliable Reasoning   Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10654)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Numerical reasoning is an important capability for NLP systems to handle numeric information in texts and tables. 
- Recent work shows that teaching models to generate reasoning processes alongside answers significantly improves performance.  
- However, most methods generate reasoning processes using large language models (LLMs), which can be unreliable as they may contain extraneous information not supporting the answer.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Encore, a method to generate reliable reasoning processes by decomposing the answer formula into operators and operands. 
- This ensures the process fully supports the answer. 
- To overcome insufficient training data, Encore uses pre-training tasks with synthesized data to teach process generation.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes Encore to generate reliable reasoning processes by decomposing answer formulas, ensuring full support for the answer.
- Introduces pre-training tasks to alleviate insufficient training data for process generation.  
- Evaluates Encore on 5 datasets, showing average 1.8% improvement over baselines. Outperforms processes from GPT-3.5 by 10%.
- Analyzes performance over different answer and evidence types. Shows particular gains on tabular evidence and arithmetic answers.
- Limitations include reliance on labeled formulas and simple operand extraction.

In summary, the paper presents Encore to improve numerical reasoning by generating reliable reasoning processes. Pre-training tasks aid learning the process generation. Experiments demonstrate clear improvements across datasets. The reliability of processes is a key benefit over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel numerical reasoning method called Encore that enhances reasoning by generating reliable reasoning processes fully supporting the answers, obtained by decomposing answer formulas, and uses pre-training tasks to help the model learn to generate such processes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel numerical reasoning method called Encore (Enhancing Numerical Reasoning with the Guidance of Reliable Reasoning Processes) to address the limitations of current reasoning process generation methods. The key ideas include:

1) Generating reliable reasoning processes by decomposing answer formulas to ensure the processes fully support the answers, avoiding unrelated information. 

2) Presenting a series of pre-training tasks to help models learn to generate reasoning processes better using synthesized data, to overcome the insufficient data issue.

3) Evaluating Encore on five mainstream numerical reasoning datasets, showing improved performance with an average boost of 1.8% over baselines, proving its effectiveness and generalization.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a reliable reasoning process generation method Encore and the pre-training tasks to enhance numerical reasoning for small-scale models.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Numerical reasoning - The paper focuses on enhancing numerical reasoning abilities of NLP systems to handle arithmetic questions and numeric information. This is a core focus.

- Reliable reasoning processes - The paper proposes generating "reliable" reasoning processes that fully support the answers, as opposed to processes from LLMs that may contain unrelated information.

- Decomposing answers - A key aspect of the proposed method is decomposing answers into operators and operands to derive a reliable reasoning process. 

- Pre-training tasks - To overcome insufficient training data, the paper proposes pre-training tasks to help the model learn to generate reasoning processes.

- Located formulas - Replacing numeric values in answers with pointers to table headers, to reduce the difficulty of value memory and table understanding.

- Enhancing numerical reasoning - The overarching goal is enhancing numerical reasoning capabilities of models by generating reliable reasoning processes during training.

- Performance improvement - Experiments across 5 datasets show performance gains using the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness.

In summary, the key focus is on improving numerical reasoning by generating reliable reasoning processes, using answer decomposition and pre-training strategies. The main results demonstrate gains across multiple datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that current methods generate "unreliable" reasoning processes using large language models (LLMs) that could contain unrelated information. Can you expand more on why the LLM-generated processes are considered "unreliable"? What specifically makes them unreliable?

2. The core idea of the proposed method is to generate reliable reasoning processes by decomposing the answer formula. However, decomposing formulas requires the answers to be annotated with formulas. What can be done if the dataset does not have answer formulas? How would the method handle such cases?

3. One limitation mentioned is that the method requires training data with answer formulas, which demands high labeling effort. What are some ways the labeling effort could potentially be reduced while still allowing the method to work effectively?

4. Could the proposed pre-training tasks be expanded or modified to handle more complex numerical reasoning beyond basic arithmetic operations? What changes would need to be made?

5. The method seems to focus primarily on improving reasoning for tabular evidence rather than textual evidence. Why is this the case? And can the techniques be extended more for textual evidence?

6. For the table location prediction pre-training task, what prevents the model from simply memorizing table cell values rather than genuinely learning to map headers to cells?

7. The error analysis reveals that operand extraction is still the major error category. What enhancements could be made specifically to improve operand extraction?

8. How suitable do you think the method would be for extremely large datasets beyond the scale of the ones experimented on? What difficulties may arise?

9. The method is model-agnostic. Do you think certain model architectures would be more suited to the approach than others? Why?

10. The paper claims the method generates more "reliable" processes than LLMs. But what exactly constitutes and defines a reliable reasoning process? What metrics quantify process reliability?
