# [Global Convergence Guarantees for Federated Policy Gradient Methods with   Adversaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09940)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of Byzantine fault tolerance in federated reinforcement learning (FRL). Specifically, it considers an FRL system with N agents collaboratively training a policy, out of which f agents may be adversarial. The adversarial agents can send arbitrary information to disrupt the learning process. The paper aims to analyze the impact of such adversaries on the global convergence and sample complexity guarantees for policy gradient based federated RL algorithms.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an algorithm called Resilient Normalized Hessian Aided Recursive Policy Gradient (Res-NHARPG) which is resilient to adversarial agents. The key ideas are:

- Each agent computes a variance reduced gradient estimate using past estimates. This estimate is sent to the server.

- The server aggregates the received gradients using a $(f,\lambda)$-resilient averaging scheme. This aggregates gradients from agents reliably even in the presence of adversaries.

- The aggregated gradient is then used to update the policy parameters.


Main Results:
- The paper provides the first global convergence and sample complexity guarantees for federated policy gradient methods with adversaries. 

- It is shown that with appropriate choice of the aggregator, the sample complexity of Res-NHARPG is $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2 (1/(N-f) + \lambda^2))$. This demonstrates resilience to $f$ adversaries while still achieving speedup compared to single agent methods.

- For certain aggregators like MDA, CWTM and MeaMed, the sample complexity becomes $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2 (1/N + f^2/N^2))$ which matches information-theoretic lower bounds (upto log factors). So these aggregators are order optimal.

- Experimental results on CartPole and InvertedPendulum environments demonstrate the effectiveness of Res-NHARPG under different attacks like random noise, random actions and sign-flipping.

To summarize, the paper provides theoretical and empirical evidence for achieving Byzantine resilience in federated RL without compromising much on the sample efficiency. The analysis and algorithm design open up an important research direction at the intersection of robust distributed optimization and multi-agent reinforcement learning.
