# [Why Change Your Controller When You Can Change Your Planner: Drag-Aware   Trajectory Generation for Quadrotor Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04960)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Quadrotors carrying payloads often experience unmodeled aerodynamic drag forces that lead to large deviations from planned trajectories, which can cause failures. Prior approaches treat these forces as disturbances and update the controller, but this is reactive and still suffers from tracking errors. The authors aim to proactively account for deviations by changing the trajectory generator rather than the controller.

Proposed Solution:
The authors formulate a two-layer quadrotor control problem with a planning layer that generates reference trajectories, and a control layer that tracks them. They introduce a drag-aware planning problem that adds a tracking cost term which measures how well a fixed controller can follow a trajectory. This cost term acts as a regularizer during trajectory optimization to find paths that can be more accurately tracked. They use supervised learning on simulation data to estimate this tracking cost function.

Main Contributions:
1) Formulation of a drag-aware planning problem for quadrotors that adds a tracking cost regularizer to find dynamically feasible trajectories.

2) A data-driven approach to learn the tracking cost function of an SE(3) controller without relying on a specific discretization time.

3) Evaluation in simulation and hardware experiments showing the planned trajectories significantly reduce tracking error (83% in simulation) compared to prior methods by avoiding controller saturation.

In summary, the key idea is to change the trajectory generator instead of the controller to account for unmodeled drag forces. This is achieved by learning how well the controller can track different trajectories and using this as a planning regularizer. Experiments validate the approach and show large improvements in tracking performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

Motivated by payload delivery challenges for quadrotors, the authors propose a data-driven drag-aware trajectory generation method that acts as a regularizer at the planning layer to reduce tracking error of an SE(3) controller in the presence of aerodynamic drag forces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Formulating and solving a data-driven "drag-aware trajectory generation" problem for a quadrotor system subject to aerodynamic wrenches. This is done by applying a relaxation to a quadrotor optimal control problem.

2. Showing that this relaxation naturally yields a regularizer that captures the tracking cost of an SE(3) feedback controller. The authors propose a data-driven approach to learning this tracking cost function.

3. Designing simulations and hardware experiments that evaluate the proposed drag-aware trajectory generation method against a baseline method on an SE(3) controller. Results show significant improvements in position tracking error.

In summary, the key contribution is a method for trajectory generation that takes into account the tracking abilities of the low-level controller in the presence of disturbances like aerodynamic drag. This is achieved by learning a model of the tracking cost function and using it as a regularizer during planning. Experiments validate that this approach improves tracking performance compared to planning without considering the controller tracking abilities.

The paper focuses on trajectory generation for quadrotor systems experiencing aerodynamic wrenches/forces like drag. It proposes a data-driven, drag-aware planning approach to generate trajectories that can be better tracked by an $SE(3)$ controller compared to baseline methods. Key ideas include applying layering/decomposition to the optimal control problem to separate planning and control, learning a tracking cost function in a supervised way, and incorporating that as a regularizer during planning. The approach is evaluated extensively in simulation and also demonstrated on hardware.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues that adapting the trajectory generation component while keeping the controller fixed can improve tracking performance for quadrotor systems with drag forces. What is the intuition behind taking a proactive planning approach rather than changing the controller design?

2. How does the proposed drag-aware planning problem in Equation 4 relate to the original optimal control problem formulation in Equation 2? Explain the layering interpretation and how the tracking cost acts as a regularizer. 

3. Explain in detail the augmented dynamical system defined in Equation 7 and how it is used to learn the tracking penalty function in Equation 6. What is the interpretation of the state $\mu_t$?  

4. The tracking penalty function in Equation 6 does not have an analytical form. Explain the supervised learning approach used to estimate this function from trajectory data. What are the inputs and outputs to the neural network?

5. The planned trajectories are represented as polynomial splines. Explain why this representation is used and how the coefficients parametrize the tracking cost function. What assumptions does this require?

6. Walk through the process of generating the training data used to learn the tracking cost function. What trajectory distributions and controllers are used? Why is this split into separate datasets based on ρ̅?

7. Explain the model architecture and training process for the neural networks used to estimate the tracking cost function. What considerations are made to ensure the networks can be used for real-time planning?  

8. Analyze the results showing improved tracking performance over baseline methods in simulation. Why does directly compensating for drag forces in the controller fail to improve performance?

9. The optimization problem in Equation 4 is non-convex. Discuss the challenges in solving this problem and why projected gradient descent is used. Are there opportunities to derive a convex approximation?

10. The method is demonstrated on hardware using a Crazyflie quadrotor. Explain how the training process differs for the hardware experiments. Why is the maneuver planned by the baseline method infeasible?
