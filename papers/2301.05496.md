# [Learning Transformations To Reduce the Geometric Shift in Object   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05496)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to reduce the performance drop of object detectors when there are geometric shifts between the training (source) and test (target) data distributions. 

The key hypothesis is that learning a set of geometric transformations from the unlabeled target data can help bridge this domain gap and improve object detection performance on the target data.

Specifically, the paper proposes modeling geometric transformations as a combination of homographies, and learning an optimal set of homographies in a self-training framework to minimize the geometric shift between source and target. The main hypothesis is that this will make the object detector more robust to different geometric distortions arising from changes in camera intrinsics, viewpoint, etc.

The experiments then validate this hypothesis by showing improved performance on target datasets with different field-of-view and viewpoint compared to only training on the source data. The results support the claim that learning transformations on unlabeled target data is an effective approach to adapting object detectors to geometric shifts across domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an approach to reduce geometric shifts between source and target domains for unsupervised domain adaptation in object detection. The key ideas are:

- Modeling geometric transformations as a combination of multiple homographies. This provides flexibility to approximate complex transformations.

- Introducing an aggregator module in the object detector architecture to combine features from multiple homographies. 

- Learning the homographies in an unsupervised manner using unlabeled target data, without any knowledge about the specific nature of the geometric shift. 

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach on two different shifts - field of view change and viewpoint change. The method achieves comparable or better performance than prior work, without requiring camera parameters.

In summary, the paper presents a novel method to handle geometric domain shifts for unsupervised adaptation in object detection. The main strength is learning flexible transformations in a completely unsupervised manner, making minimal assumptions about the specific shift. This provides a more widely applicable approach compared to prior work.
