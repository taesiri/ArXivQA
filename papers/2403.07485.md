# [PMBO: Enhancing Black-Box Optimization through Multivariate Polynomial   Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07485)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Black-box optimization problems where the objective function is unknown and evaluating it is expensive arise in many real-world applications like hyperparameter tuning, simulation optimization, etc. Model-based methods like Bayesian optimization use surrogate models to guide the search but suffer from sensitivity to model hyperparameters. Evolutionary algorithms like CMA-ES do not use models but lose the capability to analyze the landscape. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Polynomial Model Based Optimization (PMBO) which combines polynomials and Gaussian processes. PMBO first fits a multivariate polynomial to approximate the objective using sampled data. This polynomial is then used as the prior mean function of a Gaussian process which models uncertainty. By iteratively sampling new points, updating the polynomial and refitting the GP, PMBO inherits benefits from both models - it gets a global surrogate from the polynomial and uncertainty guidance from the GP.

Key Contributions:
- The paper introduces PMBO which resists overfitting by using polynomials while handling uncertainty through Gaussian processes.
- Empirically shows PMBO is robust to GP hyperparameter choices unlike standard BO.
- Demonstrates PMBO reaches comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods like CMA-ES and BADS on BBOB benchmarks. 
- The polynomial surrogate provides a macroscopic view of the landscape to enable further analysis like locating optima.
- Main limitations are poor scalability in high dimensions and handling objectives with extreme local variation.

In summary, the paper presents PMBO as a promising hybrid solution that surpasses standard BO, provides useful surrogates through polynomials and matches evolutionary algorithms on several optimization benchmarks.
