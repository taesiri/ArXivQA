## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Learning using statistical invariants (LUSI) is a new paradigm for classification that uses weak convergence and can handle a wide range of problems. However, computing the invariant matrices in LUSI has high cost for large-scale datasets during training. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes learning using granularity statistical invariants (LUGSI), which employs clustering to construct granules and statistical invariants for each granule. This converts one large invariant matrix into multiple smaller ones, reducing complexity and enabling feasibility for large-scale classification with faster training. 

Specifically, LUGSI first uses k-means clustering to partition the training data into granules. Then, it constructs a statistical invariant for each granule using a Î½ vector as the predicate. By maximizing between-class distance, the large invariant matrix is transformed into smaller grain-based invariant matrices. LUGSI also introduces vectors containing structural information into the invariants to capture finer local data structures.

The paper shows LUGSI is equivalent to LSSVM and VSVM under certain conditions. It also analyzes LUGSI's lower complexity compared to VSVM.

Main Contributions:

(i) LUGSI innovatively transforms one large invariant matrix into multiple smaller ones using granular statistical invariants. This reduces computational burden and demonstrates a new approach to enable large-scale classification.

(ii) LUGSI explores finer local structural information by incorporating structural vectors into statistical invariants. This enhances classification performance. 

(iii) The paper discusses relationships between LUGSI, VSVM and LSSVM, and provides equivalent conditions.

Experiments show LUGSI outperforms other methods in accuracy and training time. Results substantiate using local information and granular construction improves classification. LUGSI also exhibits feasibility for large-scale problems.
