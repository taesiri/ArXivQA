# [Depth Information Assisted Collaborative Mutual Promotion Network for   Single Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recovering a clear image from a single hazy image is an ill-posed inverse problem. Most existing dehazing methods either rely on accurately estimating transmission map and atmospheric light based on atmospheric scattering models, or use end-to-end models without any guidance, both having limitations. The paper argues that there is an inherent relationship between depth information of the scene and the hazy image generation process based on the haze formation model. Leveraging this relationship could benefit image dehazing performance. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a dual-task collaborative mutual promotion framework that integrates depth estimation and image dehazing into a joint optimization problem. The key ideas are:

1) Design an end-to-end depth information assisted image dehazing network. It consists of an encoder-decoder structure with several novel modules: local feature-embedded global feature extraction module (LEGM), dilated residual dense block (DRDB), multi-scale aggregation attention module (MSAAM) to effectively fuse features.

2) Incorporate a difference-aware depth estimation network that shares encoder features with the dehazing network. 

3) Propose a difference perception-based dual-task interaction mechanism to enable collaborative optimization between depth estimation and image dehazing. Specifically, the difference between depth maps of dehazed image and ground truth supervises depth network to focus on unsatisfactory dehazed areas, while the depth estimation result assists dehazing network.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose a novel framework to integrate depth estimation and image dehazing for joint optimization through dual-task collaboration and mutual promotion.

2) Design effective network modules like LEGM and MSAAM to extract and fuse multi-scale features for dehazing.

3) Develop a difference perception-based dual-task interaction mechanism that allows the two networks to leverage each other's capabilities in a mutually reinforcing manner.

Experiments show superior performance over state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets and real-world hazy images, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed collaborative promotion strategy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a dual-task collaborative mutual promotion framework that integrates depth estimation and image dehazing through a difference perception-based mechanism to achieve enhanced performance on both tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a depth information assisted collaborative mutual promotion network for single image dehazing. Specifically:

1) It proposes to treat image dehazing and depth estimation as two collaborative tasks and integrate them into a joint optimization framework through a difference perception-based dual-task interaction mechanism. 

2) The difference perception allows the depth estimation network to focus on the non-ideal dehazing areas based on the difference between the dehazed image and ground truth. This improves depth prediction accuracy and provides more useful guidance for image dehazing.

3) The difference perception also enables the dehazing network to pay more attention to the non-ideal regions guided by the depth difference between the dehazed image and ground truth. This further improves the dehazing performance.

4) Through such collaborative mutual promotion mediated by difference perception, the image dehazing and depth estimation networks can leverage each other's strengths in a mutually reinforcing manner and achieve better performance.

In summary, the core contribution is the novel depth information assisted collaborative mutual promotion framework for single image dehazing, which significantly improves both the depth estimation and image dehazing performance.
