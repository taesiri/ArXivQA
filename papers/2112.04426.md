# [Improving language models by retrieving from trillions of tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04426)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How does retrieval-augmented language model training improve few-shot learning performance on downstream NLP tasks compared to standard language model pre-training?The key hypothesis appears to be:Adding retrieved neighbors as additional context during language model pre-training will improve few-shot performance on downstream tasks compared to pre-training without retrieval.The authors evaluate this hypothesis by pre-training large transformer language models both with and without retrieved neighbors from a massive text corpus. They then compare few-shot performance on a variety of NLP tasks like SuperGLUE. The core finding is that models pre-trained with retrieval consistently outperform the baseline models pre-trained without retrieval by a significant margin in the few-shot setting. This supports their central hypothesis that retrieval-augmented pre-training improves generalization and transfer learning abilities.In summary, the paper aims to demonstrate the benefits of incorporating retrieved neighbors during pre-training forfew-shot performance on downstream NLP tasks. The central hypothesis is that this approach outperforms standard pre-training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:1. Introducing a new model called RETRO (Retrieval Enhanced Transformer) for natural language processing tasks. RETRO incorporates a retrieval mechanism into the Transformer architecture to allow the model to access relevant external knowledge stored in a large database during training and inference. 2. Demonstrating that RETRO substantially improves the performance of Transformer models across a diverse range of NLP tasks including language modeling, question answering, summarization, and translation. For example, on the C4 language modeling benchmark, RETRO reduces the bits per byte by 15-20% compared to a baseline Transformer.3. Showing that RETRO enables more sample-efficient training of large Transformer models. Models trained with RETRO reach strong performance with 3-4x less compute than baseline Transformers.4. Analyzing the model to understand where its gains come from, and finding that retrieval provides a complementary information source that cannot be easily replicated by simply scaling up model size. The gains of RETRO are shown to be robust even when controlling carefully for data leakage/overlap between the training and retrieval corpora.5. Introducing methods to apply RETRO to existing pretrained Transformer models via continued pretraining or fine-tuning, allowing RETRO's benefits to be obtained without training a model from scratch.So in summary, the main contribution is proposing RETRO as a way to augment Transformer models with retrieval, and showing that this provides significant improvements in model performance, efficiency, and generalization ability across a variety of NLP tasks. The analysis and methods to apply RETRO to existing models also represent key contributions of the work.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new deep learning model called a Transformer for sequence transduction tasks. The Transformer uses an encoder-decoder architecture and attention mechanisms rather than recurrence, allowing it to model long-range dependencies more effectively. The encoder is composed of stacked self-attention and feed-forward layers, while the decoder also includes attention over the encoder outputs. During training, the Transformer uses a per-position loss rather than per-timestep, allowing for increased parallelization. The authors demonstrate that the Transformer outperforms sequence transduction models such as recurrent and convolutional networks on machine translation and English constituency parsing while being more parallelizable and requiring less time to train. Overall, the Transformer presents a novel architecture using attention that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple sequence modeling tasks while overcoming some of the shortcomings of RNNs and CNNs.
