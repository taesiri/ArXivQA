# [CMMU: A Benchmark for Chinese Multi-modal Multi-type Question   Understanding and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14011)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multi-modal benchmarks focus on multiple-choice questions and common-sense knowledge, lacking complexity to evaluate domain-specific knowledge and reasoning of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). 
- Current benchmarks are predominantly in English and do not have enough diversity in question types to comprehensively assess MLLMs' understanding and generation abilities.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce CMMU, a novel Chinese benchmark for multi-modal and multi-type question understanding and reasoning.
- CMMU contains 3,603 questions covering 7 subjects, from primary to high school level.
- Includes 3 question types - multiple-choice, multiple-response, fill-in-the-blank, posing greater challenges.  
- Propose ShiftCheck strategy to rigorously evaluate multiple-choice questions by cycling option positions to reduce position bias and guesswork.

Main Contributions:
- First benchmark combining multi-modal, multi-type questions in Chinese to evaluate domain knowledge of MLLMs.
- More comprehensive assessment through wider variety of question formats.  
- Quantitative analysis of position bias in models using ShiftCheck.
- Evaluation of 11 MLLMs demonstrates CMMU poses a significant challenge to state-of-the-art models.

In summary, CMMU advances multi-modal evaluation through its linguistic diversity, expanded question types and rigorous testing approach to better benchmark domain knowledge and reasoning of advanced AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces CMMU, a new Chinese multi-modal multi-type question understanding and reasoning benchmark spanning 7 subjects and 3 question types, along with a ShiftCheck strategy to rigorously evaluate multiple-choice questions and quantify position bias.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing a novel benchmark named CMMU to evaluate the multi-modal and multi-type question understanding and reasoning abilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in Chinese. 

2. CMMU offers a more comprehensive evaluation by incorporating a broader range of question types, including multiple-choice questions (MCQ), multiple-response questions (MRQ), and fill-in-the-blank questions (FBQ).

3. Proposing the ShiftCheck approach to quantify the position bias of models, minimize the impact of randomness and ensure evaluation correctness for multiple-choice questions.

4. The evaluation results provide a deeper understanding of current MLLMs in the context of diverse and complex question formats.

In summary, the key contribution is creating a new comprehensive Chinese benchmark CMMU with multiple question types to better evaluate MLLMs on multi-modal understanding and reasoning. The ShiftCheck strategy is also proposed to enable more rigorous evaluation of multiple-choice questions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- CMMU - The name of the new benchmark dataset introduced in the paper for evaluating Chinese multi-modal multi-type question understanding and reasoning.

- Multi-modal - The paper focuses on multi-modal content, meaning questions that contain both textual and visual (image) components.

- Multi-type questions - CMMU contains three different question types: multiple-choice, multiple-response, and fill-in-the-blank.

- ShiftCheck - The evaluation strategy proposed in the paper to rigorously assess multiple-choice questions, reduce position bias, and quantify the extent of position bias. 

- Domain-specific knowledge - CMMU focuses on evaluating knowledge across 7 school subjects, requiring specialized knowledge beyond just common sense.

- Chinese - The dataset contains Chinese text and is aimed at evaluating abilities of models on Chinese language and content specifically.

- Question understanding and reasoning - Key capabilities that CMMU aims to evaluate in multi-modal large language models.

So in summary, the key terms cover the name of the benchmark, the multi-modal and multi-question type nature, the proposed evaluation strategy, the focus on domain knowledge and Chinese language, and the core abilities tested.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new dataset called CMMU. What are some key differences between CMMU and existing multi-modal QA datasets like MMLU, MMBench, and ScienceQA? What unique capabilities does CMMU aim to evaluate?

2. The paper categorizes questions in CMMU into 3 types - multiple-choice, multiple-response, and fill-in-the-blank. Why is having diverse question types important for comprehensively evaluating multi-modal models? What additional challenges do multiple-response and fill-in-the-blank questions pose?

3. The paper introduces a "ShiftCheck" strategy for evaluating multiple-choice questions. Explain the key ideas behind ShiftCheck and how it helps mitigate issues like position bias. How is the bias rate quantitatively measured?

4. Table 2 shows statistics comparing CMMU to other datasets. What are some key fields of comparison and what advantages does CMMU have over other benchmarks?

5. The overall results in Table 4 show significant gaps between different model types on CMMU. What differences do you observe between closed source vs open source models? What might explain the performance gaps? 

6. From the subject-wise and grade-wise breakdown in Figure 5 and Table 5, what trends do you notice in terms of relative model performance? What kinds of knowledge seem most challenging for current MMLMs?

7. The position bias analysis reveals that most models have a preference for certain answer options. Why might this occur and how can ShiftCheck help account for it? Are there still limitations?

8. The case study highlights some common issues faced by even a strong model like GPT-4V on CMMU questions. What are some root causes of errors like image misunderstanding and misleading reasoning?

9. The paper focuses evaluation on Chinese language questions. How might the findings generalize or differ for English language knowledge?

10. The paper suggests future work on expanding CMMU's coverage. What are some ways the benchmark could be expanded to pose even greater challenges to MMLMs? What additional capabilities could it test?
