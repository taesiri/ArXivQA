# Generative causal explanations of black-box classifiers

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we develop a method to generate causal explanations for black-box classifiers?The key ideas and contributions appear to be:- Proposing a framework that combines generative modeling and causal modeling to construct explanations consisting of independent latent factors that describe different aspects or concepts in the data.- Using mutual information, derived from principles of causality, as a metric to quantify the causal influence of the latent factors on the classifier output.- Developing an optimization objective that encourages the latent factors to both represent the data distribution and have high causal influence on the classifier output. - Providing both intuitive analysis in a simple linear-Gaussian setting and demonstration on real image data that the method can learn disentangled latent factors where some factors causally influence the classifier and others do not.So in summary, the main research question is focused on developing a principled framework leveraging generative and causal modeling to construct post-hoc explanations of black-box classifiers in terms of meaningful latent factors. The key innovation seems to be the use of causal reasoning to quantify and maximize the causal influence of explanatory factors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is developing a method to generate causal explanations of black-box classifiers using a generative model and information-theoretic measures of causal influence. More specifically:- The paper proposes a framework to learn a low-dimensional disentangled representation of the data such that some factors ("causal factors") have a large causal influence on the classifier output while the complete set of factors can generate samples from the data distribution. - To achieve this, the paper defines a structural causal model relating the latent factors, data, and classifier outputs. This allows the causal influence of latent factors on the classifier output to be quantified using the information flow metric. - An optimization objective is proposed that combines this information flow-based measure of causal influence with a term ensuring fidelity of the generated samples to the data distribution. - The method allows constructing both global explanations, by visualizing the effect of varying the learned causal factors, and local explanations, by observing the latent factor values for a specific data sample.- The approach does not require labeled attributes or knowledge of causal structure, unlike some prior methods. The learned disentangled representation provides a more flexible vocabulary for explanation compared to feature selection or saliency map methods.- Analysis with simple linear models provides intuition about the method, while experiments on image classifiers demonstrate its practical utility.In summary, the key contribution is a principled framework leveraging generative modeling and causal reasoning to construct interpretable explanations of black-box classifier decisions. The central ideas are learning a disentangled latent representation optimized for causal influence on the classifier output while respecting the data distribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper develops a method to generate causal explanations of black-box classifiers by learning a low-dimensional representation of the data using a generative model, with the objective of encouraging the learned factors to have high causal influence on the classifier output while faithfully representing the data distribution.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on explaining black-box classifiers:- It takes a generative modeling approach to constructing explanations, as opposed to selecting or highlighting features in the original input space. This is similar to some other recent work like Goyal et al. 2019 and Chang et al. 2019 that also use generative models. The key distinction of this paper is the focus on learning disentangled representations where different factors causally influence the classifier output to different degrees.- The explanations are based on an information-theoretic metric of causal influence derived from principles of causality and structural causal models. This provides a rigorous foundation and causal interpretation compared to many other methods, like saliency maps, that use purely correlational measures. - It does not require any side information like labels for semantic concepts or knowledge about causal relationships. Some related work relies on this extra information to aid explanation.- The method is model-agnostic and can explain any differentiable classifier, similar to other feature attribution methods. It is not tailored to a specific model class like neural networks.- Evaluations focus on visual inspection and ablation studies based on the learned representations. The paper does not report quantitative metrics of explanation fidelity commonly used in this field, which could be seen as a limitation.In summary, the main innovations seem to be the use of disentangled representations learned in a causally-motivated manner in order to generate explanations while remaining in-distribution. The generative modeling aspect relates this to an emerging subfield, while the causal framing provides unique advantages.
