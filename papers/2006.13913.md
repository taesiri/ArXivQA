# [Generative causal explanations of black-box classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13913)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we develop a method to generate causal explanations for black-box classifiers?

The key ideas and contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a framework that combines generative modeling and causal modeling to construct explanations consisting of independent latent factors that describe different aspects or concepts in the data.

- Using mutual information, derived from principles of causality, as a metric to quantify the causal influence of the latent factors on the classifier output.

- Developing an optimization objective that encourages the latent factors to both represent the data distribution and have high causal influence on the classifier output. 

- Providing both intuitive analysis in a simple linear-Gaussian setting and demonstration on real image data that the method can learn disentangled latent factors where some factors causally influence the classifier and others do not.

So in summary, the main research question is focused on developing a principled framework leveraging generative and causal modeling to construct post-hoc explanations of black-box classifiers in terms of meaningful latent factors. The key innovation seems to be the use of causal reasoning to quantify and maximize the causal influence of explanatory factors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is developing a method to generate causal explanations of black-box classifiers using a generative model and information-theoretic measures of causal influence. More specifically:

- The paper proposes a framework to learn a low-dimensional disentangled representation of the data such that some factors ("causal factors") have a large causal influence on the classifier output while the complete set of factors can generate samples from the data distribution. 

- To achieve this, the paper defines a structural causal model relating the latent factors, data, and classifier outputs. This allows the causal influence of latent factors on the classifier output to be quantified using the information flow metric. 

- An optimization objective is proposed that combines this information flow-based measure of causal influence with a term ensuring fidelity of the generated samples to the data distribution. 

- The method allows constructing both global explanations, by visualizing the effect of varying the learned causal factors, and local explanations, by observing the latent factor values for a specific data sample.

- The approach does not require labeled attributes or knowledge of causal structure, unlike some prior methods. The learned disentangled representation provides a more flexible vocabulary for explanation compared to feature selection or saliency map methods.

- Analysis with simple linear models provides intuition about the method, while experiments on image classifiers demonstrate its practical utility.

In summary, the key contribution is a principled framework leveraging generative modeling and causal reasoning to construct interpretable explanations of black-box classifier decisions. The central ideas are learning a disentangled latent representation optimized for causal influence on the classifier output while respecting the data distribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper develops a method to generate causal explanations of black-box classifiers by learning a low-dimensional representation of the data using a generative model, with the objective of encouraging the learned factors to have high causal influence on the classifier output while faithfully representing the data distribution.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on explaining black-box classifiers:

- It takes a generative modeling approach to constructing explanations, as opposed to selecting or highlighting features in the original input space. This is similar to some other recent work like Goyal et al. 2019 and Chang et al. 2019 that also use generative models. The key distinction of this paper is the focus on learning disentangled representations where different factors causally influence the classifier output to different degrees.

- The explanations are based on an information-theoretic metric of causal influence derived from principles of causality and structural causal models. This provides a rigorous foundation and causal interpretation compared to many other methods, like saliency maps, that use purely correlational measures. 

- It does not require any side information like labels for semantic concepts or knowledge about causal relationships. Some related work relies on this extra information to aid explanation.

- The method is model-agnostic and can explain any differentiable classifier, similar to other feature attribution methods. It is not tailored to a specific model class like neural networks.

- Evaluations focus on visual inspection and ablation studies based on the learned representations. The paper does not report quantitative metrics of explanation fidelity commonly used in this field, which could be seen as a limitation.

In summary, the main innovations seem to be the use of disentangled representations learned in a causally-motivated manner in order to generate explanations while remaining in-distribution. The generative modeling aspect relates this to an emerging subfield, while the causal framing provides unique advantages.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing methods to improve the interpretability or semantic meaning of the learned latent factors. The paper notes that while the current approach learns disentangled factors that control different aspects of the data, these factors may not always correspond to semantically meaningful concepts. Methods to improve the interpretability of the learned factors could strengthen the resulting explanations.

- Exploring different priors or modifications to encourage greater independence between the latent factors. As discussed in the disentanglement perspective section, independence plays an important role in disentanglement and improving justification for the proposed causal graph. Using priors that better encourage independence could enhance the explanations.

- Relaxing the independence assumptions between causal factors in the proposed causal graph and developing methods that can learn latent factors with more complex causal structures. This could expand the types of explanations that could be learned.

- Applying the framework to generate counterfactual explanations by optimizing over the low-dimensional latent factors rather than directly in the high-dimensional input space. This could provide a more feasible approach to generating counterfactuals.

- Examining how end users understand and interact with the explanations produced by this and other methods, to help guide technical development towards producing explanations that are useful and intuitively understandable.

- Exploring the broader impacts of explanation methods on issues of transparency, trust, and fairness of machine learning systems.

In summary, the authors highlight directions like improving interpretability of factors, relaxing modeling assumptions, generating counterfactuals, and studying end user interactions as promising areas for future work in this generative causal explanation framework.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for generating causal explanations of black-box classifiers using a generative model. The key ideas are (1) learning a low-dimensional disentangled representation of the data consisting of independent "causal factors" and additional "noncausal factors", (2) encouraging the causal factors to have a large mutual information with the classifier output (interpreted as quantifying causal influence), and (3) training the generative model to reconstruct the data distribution. This allows visualizing how changing different learned aspects or "factors" of the data affects the classifier output statistics, providing both global and local explanations while respecting the data distribution. The method is evaluated on controlled test cases which provide intuition about the framework, and on explaining image classifiers where it demonstrates benefits over common explanation techniques like saliency maps. Overall, the paper develops a principled approach for generating explanations that leverages generative modeling and causal reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method for generating causal post-hoc explanations of black-box classifiers using a learned low-dimensional representation of the data. The key components of the approach are a generative model consisting of disentangled latent factors mapped to the data space, and an information-theoretic measure of causal influence based on mutual information. 

The generative model is trained to encourage a subset of the latent factors to have a large causal influence on the classifier output, quantified by the mutual information between those factors and the output. The remaining factors are encouraged to help represent the data distribution. This results in some factors corresponding to aspects of the data that cause the classifier's decisions, providing an explanatory vocabulary for visualization. The method allows generating both global explanations, by visualizing how each factor affects classifier statistics over the dataset, and local explanations, by examining an individual data point's latent factor values. Experiments demonstrate the approach on simple test cases admitting analysis and on image classifiers, comparing favorably to saliency map explanations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper develops a method for generating causal post-hoc explanations of black-box classifiers based on a learned low-dimensional representation of the data. The explanation is causal in that changing learned latent factors produces a corresponding change in the classifier output statistics. The method uses a generative model consisting of latent factors and a generative mapping to the data space. The latent factors are divided into explanatory factors that influence the classifier output, and additional factors that contribute to representing the data distribution but not the classifier output. The generative mapping is learned by maximizing an objective function that includes both a term that encourages the explanatory factors to have a large causal influence on the classifier output (quantified by mutual information), and a term that encourages the generative model to faithfully represent the data distribution. This results in explanatory factors that control aspects of the data that affect the classifier output, providing an interpretable explanation while respecting the data distribution.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is addressing the challenge of generating explanations for black-box classifiers that are causal (rather than just correlational) and respect the data distribution. 

- Many existing methods explain classifiers by selecting important features or creating saliency maps. But these have limitations in capturing more complex relationships in the data. 

- The authors propose using a generative model with disentangled latent factors to explain classifiers. The generative model allows them to represent the data distribution. The disentangled factors serve as the vocabulary for the explanation.

- They develop a learning framework based on principles from causality. The objective encourages latent factors to have high causal influence on the classifier output, quantified using mutual information. 

- A variational autoencoder architecture is used to learn the generative model and produce explanations on image data. The method is able to learn global explanations by visualizing how changing latent factors affects the classifier output statistics. It can also provide local explanations by looking at the latent factor values for a particular input.

- Compared to saliency map methods, the explanations can differentiate between causal, classifier-relevant factors and stylistic, classifier-irrelevant factors. The generative model ensures explanations respect the data distribution.

In summary, the key novelty is the combination of generative modeling and causal reasoning to produce interpretable explanations that have desired properties of causality and data fidelity.
