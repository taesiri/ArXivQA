# [VITA: A Multi-modal LLM-based System for Longitudinal, Autonomous, and   Adaptive Robotic Mental Well-being Coaching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09740)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing robotic coaches for mental wellbeing have limitations such as lack of interactivity/responsiveness, no personalization/adaptation, occurrence of interaction ruptures, limited conversational capabilities, and no significant long-term improvements in mental wellbeing. 

Proposed Solution - VITA System:
- An adaptive, autonomous robotic coach system called VITA that delivers wellbeing coaching by adapting to each user's multimodal behaviors over time.  
- Uses reinforcement learning and prompt engineering of large language models (LLMs) to enable personalization, responsiveness, rupture detection, and natural conversations.

Key Contributions:
- Open source VITA system for researchers to develop autonomous and adaptive robotic coaches.
- Evaluation via pilot study comparing pre-scripted, generic, and adaptive models informed the design.
- Real-world longitudinal study over 4 weeks with 17 employees interacting with VITA robotic coach.
- Showed improvements in coachees' perception of robot, its adaptation over time, lack of interaction ruptures, conversational capabilities, and significant mental wellbeing gains.

In summary, the paper presents an open-source robotic coaching system called VITA that overcomes limitations of prior systems by enabling personalization and adaptation over time. Rigorous in-lab and real-world evaluations demonstrate VITA's capabilities for delivering effective and natural wellbeing coaching interactions. The key impact is enabling autonomous robotic systems that can have successful long-term coaching interactions to improve end-user mental wellbeing.
