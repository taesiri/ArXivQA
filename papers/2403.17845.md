# [TractOracle: towards an anatomically-informed reward function for   RL-based tractography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17845)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Tractography aims to reconstruct white matter pathways in the brain from diffusion MRI data. However, it suffers from generating false positive streamlines due to only using local information.  
- Existing solutions like filtering methods and supervised learning approaches have limitations in eliminating false positives or requiring annotated training data.
- Reinforcement learning (RL) methods for tractography do not use anatomical knowledge in their reward functions, causing agents to still generate incorrect streamlines.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new RL tractography system called TractOracle that incorporates anatomical knowledge to guide the agent.
- It uses a transformer network called TractOracle-Net to score streamlines based on their anatomical plausibility during tracking. 
- The scores are used to reward the agent during training to reconstruct accurate streamlines and also to stop tracking early when a streamline diverges to an incorrect path.

Key Contributions:
- TractOracle-Net classifies streamlines with state-of-the-art performance, validating its ability to judge anatomical plausibility.
- TractOracle-RL produces the most anatomically accurate streamlines on both synthetic and real datasets based on metrics and bundle visualization.
- It increases true positives by 20% and reduces false positives 3x on one dataset and increases true positives 2-7x on another dataset.  
- The joint tracking and evaluation approach is unique and demonstrates both highly accurate tractogram segmentation and generation capabilities.

In summary, the key innovation is the introduction of an anatomical plausibility scoring network to simultaneously guide tractography learning and filtering to achieve unprecedented reconstruction accuracy.
