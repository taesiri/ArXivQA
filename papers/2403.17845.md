# [TractOracle: towards an anatomically-informed reward function for   RL-based tractography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17845)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Tractography aims to reconstruct white matter pathways in the brain from diffusion MRI data. However, it suffers from generating false positive streamlines due to only using local information.  
- Existing solutions like filtering methods and supervised learning approaches have limitations in eliminating false positives or requiring annotated training data.
- Reinforcement learning (RL) methods for tractography do not use anatomical knowledge in their reward functions, causing agents to still generate incorrect streamlines.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new RL tractography system called TractOracle that incorporates anatomical knowledge to guide the agent.
- It uses a transformer network called TractOracle-Net to score streamlines based on their anatomical plausibility during tracking. 
- The scores are used to reward the agent during training to reconstruct accurate streamlines and also to stop tracking early when a streamline diverges to an incorrect path.

Key Contributions:
- TractOracle-Net classifies streamlines with state-of-the-art performance, validating its ability to judge anatomical plausibility.
- TractOracle-RL produces the most anatomically accurate streamlines on both synthetic and real datasets based on metrics and bundle visualization.
- It increases true positives by 20% and reduces false positives 3x on one dataset and increases true positives 2-7x on another dataset.  
- The joint tracking and evaluation approach is unique and demonstrates both highly accurate tractogram segmentation and generation capabilities.

In summary, the key innovation is the introduction of an anatomical plausibility scoring network to simultaneously guide tractography learning and filtering to achieve unprecedented reconstruction accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new reinforcement learning-based tractography method called TractOracle that uses a neural network to score streamline anatomical plausibility for guiding agents during training and stopping tracking early to reduce false positives, achieving state-of-the-art tractogram segmentation and generation performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution is a new reinforcement learning (RL) based tractography method called TractOracle. The key aspects of TractOracle are:

1) It uses a neural network called TractOracle-Net to score the anatomical plausibility of streamlines as they are being tracked. This score is used to reward the RL agent during training to guide it to generate anatomically plausible streamlines. 

2) The TractOracle-Net score is also used during tracking to stop the process early when a streamline starts diverging into an anatomically implausible path. This helps reduce false positive streamlines.

3) Experiments show TractOracle produces tractograms with higher anatomical accuracy and validity compared to previous RL and classical tractography methods, with up to 3x reduction in false positives and 7x increase in true positives. 

4) TractOracle is unique in that it jointly evaluates and reconstructs streamlines, using the same TractOracle-Net model for both, allowing it to generate accurate tractograms without needing any annotated training data.

In summary, the main contribution is a new self-supervised RL tractography approach that leverages an anatomical plausibility scoring network to achieve state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing anatomically valid and accurate tractograms.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new reinforcement learning (RL) based tractography method called TractOracle. What is the key innovation of TractOracle compared to previous RL tractography methods? How does it allow the system to evaluate and reconstruct streamlines simultaneously?

2. Explain in detail the architecture and training process of TractOracle-Net. What is the rationale behind using a transformer network for this task? How is the network augmented during training? 

3. The reward function of TractOracle-RL has two components - a local term and an anatomical plausibility term predicted by TractOracle-Net. Explain the formulation of each term. Why is using the anatomical plausibility score better than just relying on local diffusion information?

4. TractOracle-RL uses a new early stopping criterion based on the score from TractOracle-Net. Explain this criterion and how it prevents false positive streamlines from being reconstructed. Compare this to stopping criteria used in classical tractography methods.

5. Analyze the quantitative results of TractOracle-Net on the ISMRM2015 and BIL&GIN datasets. How does it compare to other streamline classification methods like Recobundles and FINTA? What metrics see the biggest improvements?

6. Examine the Tractometer evaluation results of TractOracle-RL on the ISMRM2015 dataset. Which metrics show significant improvements over previous methods? Why does TractOracle-RL not achieve the best overlap scores despite having high validity?  

7. Compare the qualitative results of TractOracle-RL to other methods on the TractoInferno dataset visually. Which bundles are reconstructed more fully by TractOracle-RL? Why does it recover streamlines missed even by the reference dataset?

8. Analyze the large gap in reconstructed streamline numbers classified as anatomically plausible by Recobundles, extractor_flow and TractOracle-Net for TractOracle-RL compared to other methods. What explains this big difference?

9. Discuss the limitations of TractOracle-RL from the results. What could be done to improve bundle overlap scores while retaining high validity metrics? 

10. The paper mentions giving global context to the RL agent as an important direction for future work. Elaborate on why this could help tackle the underlying ill-posedness of tractography. What are some ways global information could be incorporated?
