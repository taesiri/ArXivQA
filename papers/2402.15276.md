# [Text2Pic Swift: Enhancing Long-Text to Image Retrieval for Large-Scale   Libraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15276)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text-to-image retrieval methods using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face challenges when applied to real-world scenarios involving large-scale, diverse and ambiguous data. Specifically, they struggle with computational efficiency and issues with injective embeddings that attempt to map diverse meanings to a single point.  
- The recently released AToMiC dataset for large-scale long-text to image retrieval reflects such real-world conditions - with long, multi-faceted documents mapped to multiple images. This poses difficulties for current MLLM approaches.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a two-stage Coarse-to-Fine Index-shared Retrieval (Text2Pic Swift) framework to address these challenges.
- Stage 1 is Entity-based Ranking (ER) which handles ambiguity by transforming the task into multiple entity queries mapped to multiple image targets, generating a shared index. 
- Stage 2 is Summary-based Re-ranking (SR) which summarizes long documents into concise queries, further refining selections using the entity-based index.
- A novel Decoupling-BEiT-3 encoder is introduced, optimized for both stages. It employs decoupled encoding for faster vector-based similarity computations.

Main Contributions:
- The Text2Pic Swift framework that systematically tackles efficiency and effectiveness challenges faced by MLLMs for large-scale long-text to image retrieval.
- The Decoupling-BEiT-3 encoder tailored for both stages of Text2Pic Swift, enhancing efficiency.  
- Evaluations on AToMiC dataset show Text2Pic Swift achieves up to 11.06% better Recall@1000 than MLLMs, alongside 68.75% faster training and 99.79% faster retrieval.

In summary, Text2Pic Swift offers an effective and efficient solution for large-scale, ambiguous text-to-image retrieval scenarios, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Text2Pic Swift, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for efficient and robust retrieval of images corresponding to long text queries in large-scale datasets, using entity-based ranking and summary-based re-ranking with a novel Decoupling-BEiT-3 encoder.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing the two-stage Coarse-to-Fine Index-shared Retrieval (Text2Pic Swift) framework to tackle the effectiveness and efficiency challenges of state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches in real-world large-scale long-text to image retrieval scenarios. The framework has an Entity-based Ranking stage and a Summary-based Re-ranking stage.

2. Introducing a novel Decoupling-BEiT-3 encoder optimized for both stages of the Text2Pic Swift framework. This encoder employs a decoupled encoding design for vector-based distance computation to enhance efficiency. 

3. Evaluating Text2Pic Swift on the AToMiC dataset, showing an 11.06% improvement in Recall@1000 and reducing computational times by 68.75% in training and 99.79% in retrieval compared to current MLLMs.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the novel Text2Pic Swift framework and Decoupling-BEiT-3 encoder to address the challenges of efficiency and effectiveness for large-scale long-text to image retrieval.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage framework called Text2Pic Swift. Can you explain in detail the two stages - Entity-based Ranking (ER) and Summary-based Re-ranking (SR)? What is the purpose of having a two-stage approach?

2. The paper introduces a novel encoder model called Decoupling-BEiT-3. How is this model different from the original BEiT-3 model? What modifications were made and why? 

3. One of the core components of the Text2Pic Swift framework is the use of a pre-computed shared entity-based candidates index. Can you elaborate on how this index is constructed and what role it plays in improving efficiency?

4. The paper claims Text2Pic Swift framework is designed specifically to address the challenges in Large-Scale Long-Text to Image Retrieval. What are some of the key challenges mentioned and how does the proposed solution tackle them?

5. Can you explain the multiple-queries-to-multiple-targets strategy employed in the Entity-based Ranking stage? How does this differ from a typical one-to-one query-to-target retrieval?

6. What is the motivation behind using text summaries as queries in the Summary-based Re-ranking stage? How do summaries help mitigate issues caused by long, ambiguous documents? 

7. One of the benefits highlighted is the ability to perform vector-based similarity assessments instead of expensive model-based inferences. Can you elaborate on this comparison and why it matters?

8. The freezing of image encoders plays an important role in the framework. What trade-offs were analyzed when deciding to freeze encoder parameters? 

9. Can you analyze and explain the trends noticed when varying the Top K parameter in Entity-based Ranking? What was the final value used and why?

10. Qualitative results suggest the framework is efficient at filtering out irrelevant images. Can you explain this observation based on the two-stage retrieval process?
