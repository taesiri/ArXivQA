# [Long-Tailed Visual Recognition via Self-Heterogeneous Integration with   Knowledge Excavation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01279)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper addresses is: How to improve the performance of MoE-based methods for long-tailed visual recognition by better utilizing the intermediate features from different depths of the network?The key hypotheses are:1) Different parts of a deep neural network (shallow vs deep) may have different preferences in fitting the data from a long-tailed distribution. The shallow parts may be better at recognizing some tail classes.2) By fusing intermediate features from different depths with the high-level features in each expert branch of a MoE model, the experts can become more diverse and skilled at different parts of the distribution. 3) Knowledge distillation among diversified experts can help reduce the influence of hardest negatives, especially for tail classes, and improve overall performance.To validate these hypotheses, the authors propose two main components:- Depth-wise Knowledge Fusion (DKF): Fuses intermediate features from different depths with the high-level features of each expert to encourage feature diversity.- Dynamic Knowledge Transfer (DKT): Transfers knowledge among diversified experts by suppressing the hardest negative predictions to reduce their influence, especially on tail classes.The overall proposed method is called Self-Heterogeneous Integration with Knowledge Excavation (SHIKE). Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SHIKE compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel learning strategy called Self-Heterogeneous Integration with Knowledge Excavation (SHIKE) for long-tailed visual recognition. 2. It introduces Depth-wise Knowledge Fusion (DKF) to encourage feature diversity among experts in a mixture of experts framework by fusing intermediate features from different depths. This helps release the potential of MoE for long-tailed representation learning.3. It proposes Dynamic Knowledge Transfer (DKT) to address the issue of the hardest negative class during knowledge distillation between diverse experts in the MoE framework. This further exploits the diverse features enabled by DKF. 4. Extensive experiments show that SHIKE achieves state-of-the-art performance on four long-tailed recognition benchmarks, outperforming previous methods.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel MoE-based framework SHIKE that integrates heterogeneous experts and performs effective knowledge transfer to achieve superior performance on long-tailed visual recognition tasks. The key components are DKF for fusing multi-level features and DKT for handling the hardest negatives during distillation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel MoE-based method called Self-Heterogeneous Integration with Knowledge Excavation (SHIKE) that improves long-tailed visual recognition by fusing intermediate and high-level features within each expert (Depth-wise Knowledge Fusion) and conducting knowledge distillation to suppress the hardest negative class prediction (Dynamic Knowledge Transfer).


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in long-tailed visual recognition:- This paper proposes a new method called SHIKE (Self-Heterogeneous Integration with Knowledge Excavation) for improving long-tailed visual recognition using a mixture of experts (MoE) framework. Other recent works have also explored MoE models for long-tailed recognition, such as RIDE, ACE, ResLT, etc. However, SHIKE introduces two novel components - Depth-wise Knowledge Fusion (DKF) and Dynamic Knowledge Transfer (DKT) - which help improve knowledge transfer and distillation in the MoE framework.- A key difference from prior MoE methods is that SHIKE incorporates intermediate features from different depths into each expert via DKF, rather than just using the final deep features. This provides more diverse representations to help experts specialize in different parts of the long-tailed distribution. Experiments show clear performance gains from DKF.- The DKT component is designed to address the "hardest negative" issue during distillation between experts in the MoE framework. By dynamically selecting non-target logits for knowledge transfer, DKT can suppress misleading information from the hardest negatives. This is a unique approach not explored in other MoE methods.- SHIKE achieves state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets - CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist 2018, and Places-LT. In particular, it outperforms recent methods like NCL and PaCo which also use sophisticated contrastive or MoE-based training. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.- Compared to contrastive learning methods like PaCo, SHIKE does not require a specialized contrastive pre-training stage. The training process is more straightforward while still surpassing contrastive methods.- Overall, the introduction of DKF and DKT in the MoE framework appears to be an effective and novel approach for long-tailed recognition. The design of SHIKE seems superior to prior MoE architectures for this problem. The strong empirical results validate the design choices and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions at the end of the paper:- Test the proposed SHIKE method on more diverse long-tailed datasets such as face recognition, fine-grained classification, and few-shot learning. These are more challenging long-tailed problems where SHIKE could potentially help improve performance.- Explore more strategies for knowledge fusion and transfer in the SHIKE framework. The proposed DKF and DKT are initial attempts, but more advanced techniques may further enhance the effectiveness of SHIKE. - Investigate how to better utilize model capacity and computation resources under the SHIKE framework. The ablation studies show using more experts helps, but it increases computation. Exploring model compression or efficient expert architectures could be promising.- Study how to effectively combine SHIKE with semi-supervised, self-supervised, and active learning. These learning paradigms provide extra information that could complement the long-tailed data distribution and help improve SHIKE.- Theoretically analyze SHIKE to provide insights into why and how it helps alleviate long-tailed issues. This could guide further improvements to the method.- Explore extensions of SHIKE to other related problems such as class-imbalanced classification, open-set recognition, lifelong learning, etc. The ideas may transfer to handling data imbalance in those scenarios.In summary, the authors point out several interesting future directions to further validate, understand, and extend the proposed SHIKE method for handling long-tailed recognition problems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel method called Self-Heterogeneous Integration with Knowledge Excavation (SHIKE) for long-tailed visual recognition. SHIKE consists of two main components: Depth-wise Knowledge Fusion (DKF) and Dynamic Knowledge Transfer (DKT). DKF fuses intermediate features from different depths of the network with high-level features from each expert in the mixture of experts (MoE) framework. This provides more informative features for the experts to accommodate different parts of the long-tailed distribution. DKT exploits the non-target knowledge among the diverse experts to reduce the influence of the hardest negative class during training. Experiments on four benchmark datasets - CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist 2018, and Places-LT - demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SHIKE compared to existing methods. The key novelty is the heterogeneous integration of multi-level knowledge and dynamic knowledge transfer to boost performance on tail classes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel method called Self-Heterogeneous Integration with Knowledge Excavation (SHIKE) for long-tailed visual recognition. Long-tailed data refers to datasets where there is an imbalance between the number of samples per class, with a few head classes having many samples and a large number of tail classes having very few samples. This imbalance causes standard deep learning models to be biased towards the head classes. SHIKE consists of two main components: Depth-wise Knowledge Fusion (DKF) and Dynamic Knowledge Transfer (DKT). DKF fuses intermediate features from different depths of the network with the high-level features from each expert in the mixture of experts framework. This provides more informative features to help the experts specialize in different parts of the distribution. DKT transfers knowledge between the diverse experts while suppressing the hardest negatives, which are tail samples incorrectly classified with high confidence as head classes. Experiments on four benchmark datasets - CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist 2018, and Places-LT - demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, especially on tail classes.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:This paper proposes a novel mixture of experts (MoE)-based method called Self-Heterogeneous Integration with Knowledge Excavation (SHIKE) for long-tailed visual recognition. SHIKE contains two main components: Depth-wise Knowledge Fusion (DKF) and Dynamic Knowledge Transfer (DKT). DKF fuses intermediate features from different depths of a shared network with the high-level features of each expert to provide more informative and diverse representations. Based on the diverse features from DKF, DKT is proposed to address the issue of the hardest negative class during knowledge distillation among the experts. It dynamically chooses non-target logits with large values from all experts to reform the non-target predictions into one grand teacher. This grand teacher can then effectively suppress the hardest negative class through distillation, especially for tail classes. By integrating heterogeneous experts and effectively transferring knowledge with DKF and DKT, SHIKE is able to significantly improve the performance on long-tailed datasets.
