# [Long-Tailed Visual Recognition via Self-Heterogeneous Integration with   Knowledge Excavation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01279)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper addresses is: How to improve the performance of MoE-based methods for long-tailed visual recognition by better utilizing the intermediate features from different depths of the network?The key hypotheses are:1) Different parts of a deep neural network (shallow vs deep) may have different preferences in fitting the data from a long-tailed distribution. The shallow parts may be better at recognizing some tail classes.2) By fusing intermediate features from different depths with the high-level features in each expert branch of a MoE model, the experts can become more diverse and skilled at different parts of the distribution. 3) Knowledge distillation among diversified experts can help reduce the influence of hardest negatives, especially for tail classes, and improve overall performance.To validate these hypotheses, the authors propose two main components:- Depth-wise Knowledge Fusion (DKF): Fuses intermediate features from different depths with the high-level features of each expert to encourage feature diversity.- Dynamic Knowledge Transfer (DKT): Transfers knowledge among diversified experts by suppressing the hardest negative predictions to reduce their influence, especially on tail classes.The overall proposed method is called Self-Heterogeneous Integration with Knowledge Excavation (SHIKE). Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SHIKE compared to other state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel learning strategy called Self-Heterogeneous Integration with Knowledge Excavation (SHIKE) for long-tailed visual recognition. 2. It introduces Depth-wise Knowledge Fusion (DKF) to encourage feature diversity among experts in a mixture of experts framework by fusing intermediate features from different depths. This helps release the potential of MoE for long-tailed representation learning.3. It proposes Dynamic Knowledge Transfer (DKT) to address the issue of the hardest negative class during knowledge distillation between diverse experts in the MoE framework. This further exploits the diverse features enabled by DKF. 4. Extensive experiments show that SHIKE achieves state-of-the-art performance on four long-tailed recognition benchmarks, outperforming previous methods.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel MoE-based framework SHIKE that integrates heterogeneous experts and performs effective knowledge transfer to achieve superior performance on long-tailed visual recognition tasks. The key components are DKF for fusing multi-level features and DKT for handling the hardest negatives during distillation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel MoE-based method called Self-Heterogeneous Integration with Knowledge Excavation (SHIKE) that improves long-tailed visual recognition by fusing intermediate and high-level features within each expert (Depth-wise Knowledge Fusion) and conducting knowledge distillation to suppress the hardest negative class prediction (Dynamic Knowledge Transfer).
