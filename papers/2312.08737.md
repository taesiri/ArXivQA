## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes JPIS, a novel joint model for enhancing profile-based intent detection and slot filling. Profile-based intent detection and slot filling leverage supporting user profile information to reduce ambiguity in user utterances. While important, research in these tasks has been limited. JPIS incorporates the supporting profile information into its encoder and introduces a slot-to-intent attention mechanism to transfer slot label representations to guide intent detection. Experiments on the Chinese dataset ProSLU demonstrate JPISâ€™s effectiveness, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Specifically, JPIS achieves an absolute improvement of 3-5% in accuracy over previous models, reaching 86.7% overall accuracy. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of the slot-to-intent attention and integration of profile information. In summary, this paper makes notable progress in profile-based intent detection and slot filling by developing an innovative joint architecture that leverages dependencies between the two tasks and additional user profile information.
