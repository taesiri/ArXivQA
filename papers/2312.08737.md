# [JPIS: A Joint Model for Profile-based Intent Detection and Slot Filling   with Slot-to-Intent Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08737)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes JPIS, a novel joint model for enhancing profile-based intent detection and slot filling. Profile-based intent detection and slot filling leverage supporting user profile information to reduce ambiguity in user utterances. While important, research in these tasks has been limited. JPIS incorporates the supporting profile information into its encoder and introduces a slot-to-intent attention mechanism to transfer slot label representations to guide intent detection. Experiments on the Chinese dataset ProSLU demonstrate JPISâ€™s effectiveness, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Specifically, JPIS achieves an absolute improvement of 3-5% in accuracy over previous models, reaching 86.7% overall accuracy. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of the slot-to-intent attention and integration of profile information. In summary, this paper makes notable progress in profile-based intent detection and slot filling by developing an innovative joint architecture that leverages dependencies between the two tasks and additional user profile information.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Standard intent detection and slot filling models rely solely on plain text and fail to handle ambiguity in real-world user utterances. 
- Recently, profile-based intent detection and slot filling tasks were introduced to leverage supporting user profile information to reduce utterance ambiguity. However, research in these tasks is still underexplored.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes JPIS, a joint model to improve the accuracy of profile-based intent detection and slot filling.
- JPIS incorporates supporting user profile information into its encoder using multiplicative attention.
- It introduces a novel slot-to-intent attention mechanism to transfer slot label representations to enhance intent detection. 

Main Contributions:
- JPIS achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Chinese benchmark ProSLU, outperforming previous models by 2.5-3% absolute improvement across intent accuracy, slot F1 and overall accuracy.
- Ablation studies demonstrate the clear contribution of the slot-to-intent attention mechanism and the effective utilization of supporting user profile information.
- Analysis also shows that JPIS combined with pre-trained language models further pushes state-of-the-art overall accuracy to 86.67%.

In summary, the key novelty of this work is the introduction of the slot-to-intent attention and the demonstration of its effectiveness along with profile information integration in enhancing profile-based intent detection and slot filling.
