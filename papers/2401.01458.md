# [Concurrent Self-testing of Neural Networks Using Uncertainty Fingerprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01458)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks (NNs) are being deployed in safety-critical applications on hardware accelerators. However, these accelerators are susceptible to permanent and soft faults over time, which can lead to incorrect and uncertain predictions.

- Existing testing methods either interrupt NN operation, require many test vectors, only detect memory faults, or have high overhead. Hence they are unsuitable for continuously operating, resource-constrained applications.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an "uncertainty fingerprint" approach to concurrently self-test NNs using a lightweight fingerprint match during inference. 

- A dual-head NN topology is introduced with an "uncertainty head" to produce uncertainty fingerprints parallel to the primary prediction without needing extra computations.

- The uncertainty head is tuned to output a distribution centered at 1 using a custom loss function on fault-free data. 

- Online, the maximum uncertainty value (fingerprint) is checked against thresholds obtained offline to detect faults. If outside boundaries, a fault is detected.

Main Contributions:

- Introduction of a new uncertainty fingerprint concept for concurrent self-testing of NNs.

- Design of a dual-head topology tailored for producing fingerprints during inference.

- Development of a training strategy and loss function to obtain uncertainty fingerprints.

- Demonstration of high fault coverage (85-100%) on detecting permanent and soft faults in weights and activations with low false positive rates.

- The method tests NNs concurrently in a single pass without accuracy loss or needing extra computations, unlike prior art.

In summary, the paper enables lightweight concurrent self-testing of NNs by using uncertainty fingerprints from a specialized dual-head design to detect faults during inference. This allows continuous monitoring critical for reliable operation of NNs in safety applications without interrupting prediction serving.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a dual-head neural network topology and uncertainty fingerprint approach for concurrent self-testing of neural networks deployed on hardware accelerators, achieving up to 100% fault coverage with minimal overhead.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) The introduction of the "uncertainty fingerprint" approach and fingerprint matching-based online concurrent self-testing for neural network hardware accelerators (NN-HAs). 

2) The proposal of a specifically designed dual-head neural network topology that can produce uncertainty fingerprints and primary predictions in parallel in a single forward pass.

3) The development of a two-stage training strategy and accompanying "uncertainty fingerprint" matching loss function to train the dual-head model.

4) The establishment of a well-defined concurrent testing strategy using boundary checking on the uncertainty fingerprint and strategies to reduce false positives.

In summary, the paper proposes a new approach for concurrently self-testing NN-HAs by producing "uncertainty fingerprints" using a dual-head model. This allows continuous monitoring of the fault status of the NN-HA while it is performing its primary inference task, without needing to interrupt or pause operation. The approach is shown to achieve high fault coverage with low overhead.

It proposes a dual-head neural network architecture that produces both predictions and uncertainty fingerprints. This allows concurrent self-testing during online operation by matching the uncertainty fingerprints. The method is evaluated on detecting permanent and soft faults in binary neural networks across different datasets and topologies. Key performance metrics reported are fault coverage, false positive rate, and impact on inference accuracy. The paper demonstrates high fault coverage with low overhead.
