# [Establishing a leader in a pairwise comparisons method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14885)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Pairwise comparison (PC) methods for decision making are vulnerable to manipulation, where a decision maker deliberately distorts judgments to promote a selected alternative.  
- Prior work has focused on detecting or limiting manipulation, but less on understanding the underlying mechanisms. 

Proposed Solution:
- Present two algorithms (greedy and bubble) to launch a manipulation attack to make a chosen alternative the leader by minimally changing an additive PC matrix. 
- Define a new metric called Average Ranking Stability Index (ARSI) to measure the difficulty of manipulating rankings.
- Conduct Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the relationships between matrix size, inconsistency, and manipulation difficulty.

Key Contributions:
- An improved version of the EQ algorithm that equates weights of two alternatives by orthogonal projections.
- Greedy algorithm that iteratively runs EQ to equate the ranking of a promoted alternative with the current leader.  
- Bubble algorithm that slowly moves up the ranking of a promoted alternative using EQ.
- Definition and analysis of ARSI to quantify ranking manipulation difficulty. 
- Findings from simulations:
   - More alternatives makes manipulation harder.  
   - Inconsistency does not impact manipulation difficulty.
   - Each manipulation facilitates subsequent ones (ARSI decreases).

In summary, the paper presents two manipulation attack algorithms along with a new stability metric ARSI. Extensive experiments reveal how matrix parameters relate to the difficulty of ranking manipulation. The work provides novel insights into manipulation mechanisms for improving security of PC methods.
