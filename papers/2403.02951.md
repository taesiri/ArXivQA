# [Benchmarking the Text-to-SQL Capability of Large Language Models: A   Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02951)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential for text-to-SQL tasks, but there is no consensus on optimal prompt design or evaluation frameworks to assess LLM capabilities. 
- Existing benchmarks do not adequately test LLMs across the sub-tasks of the text-to-SQL pipeline, limiting optimization.
- Risk of overfitting poses reliability challenges for evaluations using open datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- Constructed a new text-to-SQL dataset "BigTable-0.2k" to mitigate overfitting risks.
- Formulated 5 tasks - Text2SQL, SQL Debugging, SQL Optimization, Schema Linking and SQL2Text - to comprehensively evaluate LLM performance.
- Tested 6 LLMs - coding-specific like SQLCoder and general-purpose like InternLM - across tasks.
- Analyzed optimal prompt design and few-shot learning strategies tailored to each task.

Main Contributions:
- Showed significant performance differences among LLMs, with tradeoffs between coding-specialized and general models.
- Identified optimal prompt templates, e.g "SimpleDDL-MD-Chat" for Text2SQL.  
- Demonstrated value of multi-round debugging, detailed error categorization for enhancing self-correction.
- Designed new evaluation metric "Retrieval Efficiency Score" and proposed "PreSQL" method to advance schema linking.
- Established specialized vs general LLM tradeoffs for SQL-to-Text.

The comprehensive benchmarking provides insights into optimal use of different LLMs and strategies to improve text-to-SQL systems.
