# [Predict the Next Word: &lt;Humans exhibit uncertainty in this task and   language models _____&gt;](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17527)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Language models (LMs) are trained to assign probabilities to human-generated text, aiming to represent the linguistic variability exhibited by the training data population(s). 
- However, due to data sparsity, most contexts are unique during training so models may not reliably approximate human variability at test time. 
- This paper investigates whether modern LMs are "calibrated to human uncertainty", i.e. whether they assign probabilities to next-word candidates that match the proportions those words are provided by humans.

Methodology
- Use the Provo dataset where humans provide multiple 1-word continuations for passage prefixes. 
- Compare probability distributions over next words from humans (estimated by relative frequencies) and various LMs.
- Assess calibration via total variation distance (TVD) between human and model distributions per context.
- Analyze calibration of GPT-2, BLOOM, ChatGPT with sampling.

Main Findings
- All LMs exhibit fairly low calibration to human uncertainty in next-word prediction, unlike expected calibration error might suggest. 
- This holds even after fine-tuning GPT-2 on Provo corpus, for larger LMs like BLOOM, and RLHF models like ChatGPT.
- The inability to capture variability is attributed to models not seeing much human variability per context during training.
- Confirmed that expected calibration error is unreliable for generative models.

Contributions
- Empirical evidence that modern LMs do not reliably reproduce human uncertainty
- Advice against using expected calibration error to assess language models
- Methodology and analysis to quantify calibration to human linguistic variability
- Insights into limitations of existing models regarding uncertainty

Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this summary. I aimed to capture the key technical details as well as highlight the main contributions of interest to researchers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates the ability of language models like GPT-2, BLOOM, and ChatGPT to reproduce the variability humans exhibit when predicting the next word given some context, finding that the models exhibit fairly low calibration to human uncertainty in this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

An analysis of the ability of language models (LMs) like GPT2, BLOOM, and ChatGPT to reproduce the variability that humans exhibit when predicting the next word given some context. This is framed as assessing the models' "calibration to human uncertainty". 

Specifically, the paper:

- Uses the Provo Corpus, which contains multiple human responses for next word prediction per context, to estimate target probability distributions representing human variability. 

- Compares these to probability distributions from the LMs using total variation distance (TVD) as the metric.

- Finds that the LMs exhibit fairly low calibration to human uncertainty, meaning they do not reproduce the variability in human responses well. 

- Shows that the commonly used expected calibration error (ECE) metric cannot be reliably used to assess calibration in this setting with inherent data uncertainty.

- Advises the NLP community not to rely on ECE when evaluating generative language models.

So in summary, the main contribution is an analysis and recommendations around evaluating how well LMs capture human linguistic variability in a next word prediction task, using an appropriate metric (TVD rather than the unreliable ECE).


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Language models - Statistical models trained to assign probabilities to human-generated text sequences. Key models analyzed are GPT2, BLOOM, and ChatGPT.

- Calibration - The property that a model's predicted probabilities of outcomes should match the actual frequencies of those outcomes. 

- Calibration to human uncertainty - When a model's predicted probabilities match the distribution of responses exhibited by humans for ambiguous inputs.

- Next word prediction - A task where humans are shown a context and asked to provide a plausible next word. Used to estimate human uncertainty.

- Expected calibration error (ECE) - A commonly used metric to assess calibration by comparing binned confidence to accuracy. Shown to be unreliable for language. 

- Total variation distance (TVD) - A metric used to compare the difference between two probability distributions. Used to compare model and human next-word distributions.

- Data uncertainty - Ambiguity in tasks like language modeling. Causes issues for simple accuracy-based evaluation.

- Multiple human annotations - Obtaining multiple human responses for the same input to better represent ambiguity.

The key finding is that current language models do not reliably match the production variability humans exhibit in next word prediction, i.e. they show poor calibration to human uncertainty.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper exploits the idea of using multiple human responses to a next word prediction task to estimate a target probability distribution representing human uncertainty. What are some limitations or challenges with relying on a small number of human responses per context to estimate this distribution? How could the methodology be adapted to account for potential biases?

2. The paper samples complete words from language models in order to compare their distributions to the human distributions over words. What are some alternative approaches for handling the mismatch between subword tokens used by models and complete words used by humans? What are the tradeoffs of the Monte Carlo approach used in the paper versus other options? 

3. The paper argues that expected calibration error (ECE) is an inadequate metric in this setting due to inherent ambiguity in language data. What modifications could be made to ECE to make it more suitable for assessing language model calibration in the presence of data uncertainty? Are there any scenarios in which vanilla ECE could provide meaningful information?

4. The analysis reveals that modern language models do not reproduce human variability well in a next word prediction task. What factors during or after training do you think contribute most to this gap? How might models be adapted to better capture human production variability? 

5. The paper performs a shallow syntactic analysis by comparing model and human distributions over part-of-speech tags. What are some ways this analysis could be expanded or improved to gain more insight? For example, are there any syntactic phenomena of particular interest that could be studied?

6. The semantic analysis clusters words based on word2vec embeddings before computing distributional divergences. What are some limitations of relying on fixed word embeddings? Would a contextualized representation better capture semantics for this task? What challenges would this introduce?

7. The fine-tuning experiment reveals similar trends before and after fine-tuning GPT-2 on in-domain data. What are some possible explanations for why the domain mismatch does not seem to fully explain the model's lack of calibration to humans?

8. The paper studies 3 models - GPT-2, BLOOM, and ChatGPT. Are there any other modern language models that you think should be included in the analysis? What insights might including them provide?

9. The paper analyzes calibration at the instance-level by computing total variation distance between model and human distributions for each specific context. What are some potential benefits and drawbacks of complementing this with aggregate population-level metrics?

10. One of the conclusions is that expected calibration error should not be relied upon to assess the predictive distributions of language models. However, ECE remains widely used. What evidence from this paper do you think is most compelling to convince the community that new calibration methodologies are needed? What open questions remain?
