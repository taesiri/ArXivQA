# [Fast, nonlocal and neural: a lightweight high quality solution to image   denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03488)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional model-based image denoising algorithms like non-local methods (NLM, BM3D) recover textures well but leave residual noise and cause blurring.  
- Deep learning based denoising CNNs (like DnCNN, FFDNet) outperform traditional methods but are computationally expensive and tend to over-smooth textures.
- Most CNN denoisers also require training for each noise level, limiting flexibility.

Proposed Solution:
- Combine a non-local denoising method (BM3D) with a lightweight residual CNN to get the best of both approaches.
- BM3D first reduces noise and recovers textures. The CNN then corrects artifacts, color distortion and residual noise from BM3D output.
- Using BM3D output as input allows the CNN to be very lightweight (10-16 layers vs DnCNN's 17).
- Add a noise level map input (like FFDNet) to make the model flexible to different noise levels.

Contributions:
- Show BM3D preprocessing reduces the CNN size for equal performance, cuts inference time and memory.
- Proposed combined method sets new state-of-the-art on benchmark datasets, especially for textured images.  
- Visual quality improved, with textures preserved and fewer artifacts compared to individual BM3D or CNNs.
- Very lightweight design (2.58% computation of FDnCNN) enables deployment on mobile devices.

In summary, intelligently combining BM3D and a compact CNN provides an efficient, flexible and high performance image denoising solution suitable for mobile use.
