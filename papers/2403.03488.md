# [Fast, nonlocal and neural: a lightweight high quality solution to image   denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03488)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional model-based image denoising algorithms like non-local methods (NLM, BM3D) recover textures well but leave residual noise and cause blurring.  
- Deep learning based denoising CNNs (like DnCNN, FFDNet) outperform traditional methods but are computationally expensive and tend to over-smooth textures.
- Most CNN denoisers also require training for each noise level, limiting flexibility.

Proposed Solution:
- Combine a non-local denoising method (BM3D) with a lightweight residual CNN to get the best of both approaches.
- BM3D first reduces noise and recovers textures. The CNN then corrects artifacts, color distortion and residual noise from BM3D output.
- Using BM3D output as input allows the CNN to be very lightweight (10-16 layers vs DnCNN's 17).
- Add a noise level map input (like FFDNet) to make the model flexible to different noise levels.

Contributions:
- Show BM3D preprocessing reduces the CNN size for equal performance, cuts inference time and memory.
- Proposed combined method sets new state-of-the-art on benchmark datasets, especially for textured images.  
- Visual quality improved, with textures preserved and fewer artifacts compared to individual BM3D or CNNs.
- Very lightweight design (2.58% computation of FDnCNN) enables deployment on mobile devices.

In summary, intelligently combining BM3D and a compact CNN provides an efficient, flexible and high performance image denoising solution suitable for mobile use.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a flexible and lightweight image denoising method that combines a nonlocal algorithm (BM3D or NLM) for preprocessing to recover textures and details, followed by a lightweight residual CNN to correct artifacts and remove residual noise.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a flexible and lightweight image denoising framework that combines a nonlocal denoising algorithm (BM3D or NLM) with a lightweight residual convolutional neural network. Specifically:

1) They show that using BM3D or NLM as a preprocessing step reduces the difficulty of the inverse problem for the CNN, allowing the use of a very shallow CNN (10-16 layers) that achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance. 

2) They design a flexible U-Net-like CNN architecture that can handle multiple noise levels through use of a noise level map input. This avoids having to train separate models for each noise level.

3) Together, the nonlocal algorithm + lightweight flexible CNN framework provides state-of-the-art denoising quality with 10-20x speedup compared to standard CNN denoisers. This makes the method feasible to deploy on mobile devices.

4) They demonstrate the framework provides improved texture/detail preservation compared to existing CNN methods.

In summary, the key innovation is the synergy between nonlocal methods and lightweight CNNs to achieve efficiency, flexibility, and high quality for image denoising. The method is designed to be practical for real-world applications on mobile devices.
