# [ProtoFL: Unsupervised Federated Learning via Prototypical Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12450)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a new federated learning framework called "ProtoFL" to address key challenges in federated learning for one-class classification, including high communication costs, limited representation power, and unstable learning processes. The central hypothesis is that by using prototype representation distillation and normalizing flows for local classifier learning, the proposed ProtoFL method can:1) Enhance the representation power of the global model and reduce communication costs by distilling prototype representations instead of directly transferring parameters between clients and server.2) Improve one-class classification performance with limited local data by using normalizing flows to estimate the density of the target class distribution.In summary, the central hypothesis is that ProtoFL with prototype distillation and normalizing flows can enable more efficient and effective federated learning for one-class classification compared to existing approaches. The experiments aim to validate whether ProtoFL achieves superior performance over previous methods on both image and tabular datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:- Proposing ProtoFL, a novel unsupervised federated learning framework that addresses challenges like insufficient local training data, high communication costs, and limited representation power. This is done through prototypical representation distillation and using normalizing flows for local classifier learning.- Introducing a prototype-based representation learning method that distills normal data representation from an off-the-shelf model and dataset. This allows scalability of the global model when adding new clients in federated learning based one-class classification. - Proposing new federated and centralized learning methods for one-class classification, which are evaluated on five widely used benchmarks. The experiments demonstrate superior performance over previous methods.In summary, the key contribution is developing ProtoFL, a new approach to unsupervised federated learning that enables efficient and effective global model updates through prototypical representation distillation and flow-based local classifier learning. This provides a novel solution to challenges in federated learning-based one-class classification.
