# [SoMeLVLM: A Large Vision Language Model for Social Media Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13022)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
General domain large language models (LLMs) and large vision language models (LVLMs) encounter challenges in understanding social media content due to (1) limitations in multimedia understanding, (2) informal language usage, and (3) the complexity of social media tasks. As a result, these models struggle to reliably perform automated social media processing tasks that are important for computational social science (CSS) research.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes SoMeLVLM, a large vision language model tailored for social media processing. The key aspects are:

1. A social media cognitive framework with 5 levels (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, evaluation, creation) is designed based on Bloom's Taxonomy to categorize social media tasks and cultivate cognitive abilities. 

2. A large-scale multimodal social media dataset with 654k instances encompassing 12 tasks is collected from existing datasets and social media data. The data is formatted into instructional prompts to enable instruction tuning.

3. A two-step instruction tuning method is used - first the base LM is tuned on textual data, then the vision-language connection module is tuned on multimodal data. The Vicuna LM and Blip connection module are chosen.

Main Contributions:

1. Proposes SoMeLVLM, an LVLM tailored for social media processing through comprehensive supervised fine-tuning. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse social media tasks.

2. Constructs a social media cognitive framework combining tasks and cognitive abilities to model varying levels of information processing demands. 

3. Contributes a large-scale high-quality multimodal social media dataset with 654k instances formatted into instructional prompts for model training.

In summary, the paper presents a specialized LVLM and dataset to enable reliable automated social media processing for computational social science research. The cognitive framework also allows evaluating model abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces SoMeLVLM, a large vision language model tailored for social media processing through comprehensive supervised fine-tuning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on various social media tasks by equipping the model with cognitive abilities derived from different types of users and information demands on social media platforms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing SoMeLVLM, a large vision language model specifically tailored for social media contexts, capable of high-quality text classification and interpretation under zero-shot conditions. This simplifies the computational social science workflow and improves reliability.

2. Constructing a comprehensive social media framework by combining cognitive abilities with traditional social media tasks to support different levels of demands in information processing.

3. Contributing a large-scale, high-quality multimodal social media dataset, encompassing both pure text and multimodal formats, with data from both open-source and self-collected sources, formatted into diverse instruction-tuning formats.

The paper introduces a large vision language model called SoMeLVLM that is tailored for social media processing. It constructs a cognitive framework with different levels of abilities based on Bloom's taxonomy. The model is trained on a large multimodal dataset using instruction tuning to equip it with capabilities for understanding and generating social media content across tasks like emotion recognition, humor detection, hate speech detection, etc. The key idea is to overcome limitations of general LVLMs when dealing with the nuances of social media data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a social media cognitive framework with 5 levels - knowledge & comprehension, application, analysis, evaluation, and creation. Can you expand more on the key differences between the application and analysis levels in terms of the model's capabilities?

2. In the multimodal social multimedia understanding limitation discussed, the paper states general domain LVLMs may not possess fine-grained recognition between images and captions. What modifications could be made to these models' architectures to improve this capability without requiring domain-specific tuning?  

3. For the informal language understanding limitation, what additional unlabeled textual corpora from social media sites could help the general domain models better capture these nuances without supervision?

4. In the complex cognitive demands limitation, you state that models struggle to comprehensively address multiple objectives like hate speech detection and content rewriting. How could a general reinforcement learning framework be incorporated to reward balancing different objectives?

5. In the related works, you discuss the benefits of instruction tuning for domain adaptation. What modifications could be made to the prompting methodology to further enhance the alignment of tasks prompts with the social media domain?  

6. The application level tasks require generating explanations for ground truth labels. What are some ways the diversity and depth of these explanations could be evaluated more rigorously?

7. For the analysis tasks performed without ground truth labels, how can we assess whether the model is truly analyzing versus simply guessing labels that fit a plausible rationale?

8. In the evaluation tasks like content detoxifying, what metrics could evaluate not just rewrite quality but also preservation of original post intent?

9. For the creation tasks, the paper utilizes a generative assistant to validate quality. What are alternatives that could work when such an assistant is unavailable? 

10. The cognitive framework is categorized into 5 levels. Are there any intermediate levels between the higher order tasks worth distinguishing to better assess capabilities?
