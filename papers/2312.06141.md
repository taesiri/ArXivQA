# [Survey on Memory-Augmented Neural Networks: Cognitive Insights to AI   Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06141)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on Memory-Augmented Neural Networks (MANNs). It explores various memory theories from psychology, linking them to AI architectures that integrate different memory mechanisms like sensory, short-term and long-term memory. The study delves into advanced models like Hopfield Networks, Neural Turing Machines, Memformer and Neural Attention Memory, analyzing their designs and capabilities in mimicking aspects of human memory. It discusses applications of MANNs across domains like natural language processing, computer vision and multimodal learning, demonstrating how memory components enhance neural networks on complex tasks requiring sequential reasoning, storage and recall of long-range information. The survey also examines limitations of current MANNs regarding trustworthiness, customizability and integration challenges between external memory and internal parameters. Overall, it offers an in-depth overview of memory-augmented neural networks, providing insights into progress made and open problems for future research towards building more cognitively-inspired AI systems.
