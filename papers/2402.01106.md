# [Learning Which Side to Scan: Multi-View Informed Active Perception with   Side Scan Sonar for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01106)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) use side scan sonar for search, detection and recognition of underwater objects. However, side scan sonar imagery is highly view-dependent based on the geometry of the object and viewing angle.  
- Typically, AUVs conduct an exhaustive survey from multiple angles to classify an object. This process called "reacquisition" is time consuming (30+ minutes per object).

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new framework called "Adaptive Surveying and Reacquisition (ASR)" to reduce survey time while maximizing classification accuracy. 
- Key ideas:
   - Represent multiple sonar views of a target as an "angular view graph" where nodes are view features and edges encode angular relations. 
   - Use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) on this graph for multi-view classification.
   - Train a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to choose the next best view to capture based on the graph.
   - Combine surveying and reacquisition stages to avoid redundant passes.

Main Contributions:
- Novel angular view graph representation for multi-view classification and next best view planning using GNNs
- DQN-based next best view policy to minimize number of views needed for accurate classification 
- Adaptive surveying algorithm that interleaves search and reacquisition to reduce total mission time
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in classification accuracy and efficiency over baselines in photorealistic simulations

The key insight is to leverage the angular relations between views in a graph structure to better aggregate information as well as determine which views are worth capturing next to improve classification with fewer redundant passes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a novel active perception framework using graph neural networks for efficient multi-view classification and next best view planning with side scan sonar imagery for autonomous underwater vehicles.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A novel perception framework called the "angular view-graph" for multi-view adaptive surveying and reacquisition in side scan sonar using graph neural networks.

2. A novel reward function that encourages a reinforcement learning agent to choose the minimum number of next best views necessary for an accurate classification.

3. An adaptive survey and reacquisition (ASR) algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that finds and classifies all targets in a search region without pre-survey knowledge of target locations. 

4. Extensive simulation results demonstrating that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art adaptive survey methods in classification accuracy, classification efficiency, and coverage rate.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed angular view-graph framework along with the associated reinforcement learning policy and ASR algorithm that enables more efficient and accurate surveying and classification with side scan sonar on AUVs.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Adaptive Surveying and Reacquisition (ASR) - The task of choosing the most informative views to minimize survey time while maximizing classifier accuracy.

- Next best view planning - A sub-problem in active perception concerned with finding optimal view parameters to achieve a desired goal. The paper introduces a View-Q function based on deep reinforcement learning to address this.

- Side scan sonar - An acoustic imaging technique used on autonomous underwater vehicles. Images are highly dependent on viewing angle and target geometry.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel angular view-graph (AVG) representation for the adaptive survey and reacquisition (ASR) task. How does this representation encode information between different sonar views and what are the key differences from prior multi-view graph formulations like View-GCN?

2. The paper uses a graph neural network (GNN) called GMVATR for multi-view classification on the angular view-graph. What are the specific architecture details of this network and how does it operate on the graph structure? 

3. The paper also uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent called View-Q Function (V-QF) to choose the next best view. What is the state, action space, and reward function formulation for this reinforcement learning agent?

4. The reward function for V-QF encourages choosing the minimum number of views for correct classification. Why is this an appropriate reward formulation and how does it differ from prior next best view planning reward functions?

5. The overall pipeline in Figure 2 shows how the angular view-graph, GMVATR, and V-QF components connect. Walk through the key steps of how the pipeline operates during an adaptive survey.

6. Algorithm 1 details the full adaptive survey and reacquisition (ASR) approach. Explain how this algorithm interleaves the surveying and reacquisition stages compared to traditional approaches. 

7. The photorealistic side scan simulator uses ray-tracing and procedurally generated terrain and targets. What are some of the key details and capabilities of this simulation environment?

8. What is the motivation behind using graph neural networks in this application and what specific inductive biases do they provide? How does the problem formulation satisfy these requirements?

9. The experiments compare against several multi-view classification and informed path planning baselines. Which one or two baselines posed the biggest challenge? What were their limitations?

10. The ablation studies analyze the impact of the next best view policy and angular view-graph specifically. What were the key conclusions from these ablation studies? How do they support the main claims of the paper?
