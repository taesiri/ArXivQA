# [Binary and Ternary Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01841)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we quantize both the weights and activations of transformer models down to very low bits (ternary or binary) while still maintaining good performance on natural language generation tasks like summarization and translation?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) A combination of statistics-based weight quantization and learned activation quantization can enable stable training of low-bit generative transformers, which was not previously possible.2) With this approach, they hypothesize they can quantize transformer encoder-decoder models down to fully ternary or binary while achieving reasonable accuracy on summarization and translation benchmarks.3) They further hypothesize their method can outperform prior work on mildly quantized (8-bit) generative transformers and set new state-of-the-art results.So in summary, the main research question is how to quantize generative transformers to very low bits, and the key hypotheses are around using a combined weight and activation quantization approach to achieve this effectively for the first time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a novel combination of statistics-based weight quantization and learning-based activation quantization to enable training transformer encoder-decoder models like BART in very low-bit settings (ternary and binary). This was not possible before.- It significantly advances the state-of-the-art for low-bit text generation models. The authors demonstrate the first non-trivial fully ternary and fully binary transformer models for summarization and translation. - For commonly used settings like ternary weights + 8-bit activations, their method outperforms prior SOTA by up to 2.3 ROUGE points on summarization and 1.2 BLEU points on translation.- Their binary weight models also exceed or match ternary weight SOTA, while being even more efficient.- Overall, the paper shows for the first time that transformer-based text generation models can be quantized to very low bits without catastrophic accuracy loss. This has implications for efficiently deploying large generative models.In summary, the key contribution is a novel quantization scheme that for the first time enables training competitive ultra low-bit (ternary/binary) transformer models for text generation tasks like summarization and translation. The proposed models significantly advance efficiency and accuracy over prior work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes a novel method to quantize weights and activations in transformer models down to very low bits (ternary/binary), enabling significant efficiency gains. By combining statistics-based weight quantization and learned activation quantization, they demonstrate the first competitive fully ternary and binary transformer models for text generation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in low-bit quantization for natural language processing:- This paper focuses on quantizing transformer-based text generation models like BART to very low bitwidths (ternary/binary), which has not been demonstrated before. Most prior work on quantizing NLP models focuses on BERT for classification tasks and only goes down to 4-8 bits. - The key innovations in this paper that enable successful ultra low-bit quantization are: 1) Statistics-based weight quantization that maximizes entropy and reduces gradient mismatch. 2) Learning-based quantization for activations. 3) Combining the two techniques to stabilize training.- For moderately low bitwidths like 8-bit activations, this paper achieves state-of-the-art results on summarization and translation, outperforming comparable methods.- The fully ternary and binary BART models demonstrated for the first time are significantly less accurate than full precision models. However, they establish non-trivial baselines and demonstrate the feasibility of such extremely quantized generative models.- Compared to BERT quantization papers, this presents unique challenges like the sensitivity of attention layers to quantization noise and error compounding during autoregressive decoding. The solutions developed here seem tailored to dealing with these issues.- An interesting finding is that their technique enables binary/ternary weight BART models to match or exceed the accuracy of prior works with 8-bit weights. This challenges the notion that more weight bits are always better.In summary, this paper pushes the envelope on quantizing generative transformer models to very low bitwidths, setting new state-of-the-art results. The techniques seem specifically designed to address challenges unique to quantizing text generation models. It will be interesting to see if these methods transfer to even larger pretrained language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few potential future research directions in the paper:- Testing whether their low-bit quantization approach will scale to larger generative transformer models like GPT-3. They note that quantization could help mitigate some of the scaling and computational challenges with very large models like GPT-3.- Evaluating the generalizability of their quantization method to other tasks beyond summarization and machine translation, such as computer vision and speech recognition. The paper only tests on NLP tasks.- Implementing specialized hardware and bit packing techniques to achieve actual memory savings and acceleration from the low-bit models proposed. The paper focuses on model accuracy but notes hardware implementation is needed for efficiency gains.- Testing generalizability to extremely long sequences or streaming data. The experiments in the paper are on datasets with sentences of finite length.- Exploring other model architectures besides the transformer encoder-decoder. The method is only validated on BART and mBART models currently.So in summary, the main future directions are testing on larger models, new tasks, specialized hardware implementation, longer sequences, and new model architectures. The core idea of combining weight and activation quantization seems promising but needs more extensive testing and implementation to understand the full potential.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel method for quantizing transformer models down to very low bit widths like ternary and binary for both weights and activations. Previous work has quantized transformers for classification tasks but generative transformers are more difficult due to output space sensitivity and error accumulation during decoding. The authors use a combination of statistics-based quantization for weights to maximize entropy and reduce gradient mismatch, along with learned quantization for activations. They evaluate on summarization and machine translation tasks, achieving the first non-trivial results for fully ternary and binary transformer models. Their ternary BART model gets within 4 Rouge points of the full model on XSUM while being 16x more efficient. The binary BART also achieves meaningful results. This could enable large gains in efficiency and expand use cases for generative transformers.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel approach for quantizing transformer-based natural language generation models to very low bitwidths, including ternary and binary weights and activations. Previous work has focused on mildly quantizing encoder-only models like BERT, but quantizing autoregressive decoder models is more challenging due to error accumulation during decoding. The key ideas are to use a statistics-based method to quantize weights while maximizing entropy and minimizing gradient mismatch, and a learning-based method to quantize activations by learning scaling factors through backpropagation. This combination allows training the models stably down to fully ternary and binary settings. Experiments on summarization and translation benchmarks demonstrate strong improvements over prior work, achieving close to full precision performance at 3-4x compression on XSum and WMT En-Ro with ternary models, and establishing first meaningful baselines for fully binary models. The efficiency gains could expand the applicability of large language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel combination of statistics-based weight quantization and learning-based activation quantization to enable training transformer encoder-decoder models with weights and activations quantized to very low bits (ternary or binary). For weight quantization, they use a statistics-based method that maximizes entropy of the quantized weights and reduces gradient mismatch during backpropagation. For activation quantization, they use a learning-based method with different quantization schemes for activations with positive vs negative values, and a learnable scaling factor. Together, these techniques allow them to train summarization and translation models with fully ternary or binary weights and activations, setting new state-of-the-art results compared to prior work. The method enables significant efficiency gains in computation and memory while maintaining accuracy close to the full-precision models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the problem of quantizing transformer-based generative models down to very low bits, like ternary (2-bit) or even binary (1-bit) for both weights and activations. Generative transformer models like BART and GPT have shown impressive capabilities but also have very high computational requirements. Quantizing to low bits can provide large efficiency gains if implemented on suitable hardware, but is very challenging especially for generative models. Previous work has mainly focused on encoder-only models like BERT for classification tasks, and achieved quantization down to 4-8 bits. For generative models, the previous best results are 2-bit weights with 8-bit activations. This paper tackles quantizing both weights and activations down to ternary and binary levels. This is challenging due to the sensitivity of attention layers and error accumulation during autoregressive decoding. The paper proposes a combination of statistics-based weight quantization and learned activation quantization to stabilize training.They demonstrate ternary and binary BART models for summarization with reasonable accuracy, as well as ternary and binary mBART models for machine translation. This is the first work to show useful fully ternary and binary generative transformer models.
