# [Towards Multimodal Human Intention Understanding Debiasing via   Subject-Deconfounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal intention understanding (MIU) models suffer from prediction bias due to subject variation problem. 
- Different subjects have distinct expression styles and behaviors which introduce spurious correlations between subject-specific semantics and labels.
- This limits the performance and generalizability of MIU models to new subjects.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate a causal graph to model the MIU procedure and identify subjects as confounders.
- Propose Subject Causal Intervention (SuCI) module to remove prediction bias via backdoor adjustment from causal theory.
- SuCI disentangles subject features, constructs confounder dictionary, and performs weighted aggregation to estimate the average causal effect.
- This intervenes the effect of subjects and achieves subject de-confounded training.

Main Contributions:
- First work to analyze subject variation problem in MIU via causal graph and identify subjects as confounders. 
- Propose generalizable SuCI module that can be integrated into various MIU models.
- Comprehensively evaluate on multiple benchmarks - SuCI brings consistent and considerable gains across different models.
- Ablation studies validate the rationality and effectiveness of each component in SuCI.
- Show both quantitative and qualitative improvements over baseline models via SuCI.

In summary, the paper identifies and addresses the prediction bias caused by subject variation in MIU tasks through a novel causal intervention perspective. The proposed SuCI module significantly improves performance and robustness across diverse MIU models and tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a subject causal intervention module (SuCI) to mitigate the prediction bias caused by subject-specific spurious correlations in multimodal intention understanding tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It is the first work to identify the subject variation problem in multimodal intention understanding (MIU) tasks, where subjects act as confounders that cause prediction bias due to subject-specific spurious correlations learned by models. 

2) It proposes a Subject Causal Intervention module (SuCI) to remove the prediction bias caused by subject confounders. SuCI implements causal intervention via backdoor adjustment to estimate the average causal effect and achieve subject de-confounded training.

3) Comprehensive experiments show SuCI can significantly and consistently improve the performance of various MIU models by removing subject-related prediction bias. It helps achieve new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in revealing and mitigating the prediction bias issue caused by subject variation in MIU via a novel causality-based module SuCI, which is model-agnostic and brings substantial performance improvements.
