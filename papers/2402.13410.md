# [Bayesian Neural Networks with Domain Knowledge Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13410)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) allow quantifying predictive uncertainty, but specifying good priors that incorporate domain knowledge is challenging. Existing BNN priors (e.g. Gaussian, Gaussian processes) cannot easily encode complex domain knowledge like physics rules, feature importance, fairness constraints. This makes BNNs susceptible to undesirable biases and suboptimal predictions.  

Solution:
The paper proposes a framework to incorporate broad forms of domain knowledge into BNN priors. The key ideas are:

1) Represent domain knowledge as a loss function $\phi(h,x)$ that measures how well a model $h$ aligns with the knowledge on input $x$. Many types of knowledge like physics rules, invariances, fairness can be expressed this way.

2) Learn an informative prior by optimizing a variational lower bound on the posterior $p(w|\phi,X')$ that incorporates the loss $\phi$ on unlabeled data $X'$. The learned prior assigns high probability to models with low domain knowledge loss. 

3) Use a low-rank Gaussian approximation for the informative prior to enable efficient posterior inference. The low-rank structure scales as $O(r \cdot n)$ where $r$ is the rank and $n$ is the number of parameters.

4) Transfer learned priors to new architectures by matching samples from old and new priors in function space using maximum mean discrepancy. This allows reusing informative priors when the loss $\phi$ is no longer accessible.

Contributions:

- General framework to incorporate diverse domain knowledge into BNN priors based on losses 

- Use of variational inference to learn priors encoding domain knowledge  

- Low-rank Gaussian prior enables tractable posterior inference

- Techniques to transfer learned priors across architectures

- Empirically demonstrates improved predictive performance and better satisfaction of domain knowledge constraints versus baselines

The paper makes BNNs more practical by developing methods to include complex and useful domain knowledge through priors. This can lead to models that are more reliable, fair and calibrated.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework for incorporating general forms of domain knowledge into Bayesian neural network priors through variational inference, enabling the learning of priors that assign higher probability to models satisfying the domain knowledge and improving downstream performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework for incorporating general forms of domain knowledge into the priors for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). Specifically:

1) The paper defines a notion of domain knowledge that can be represented as a loss function $\phi$ that measures how well a model aligns with the knowledge on unlabeled data. This is a flexible definition that allows capturing various types of prior information like physical rules, feature importance, fairness constraints, etc.

2) The paper proposes an approach to learn an informative prior that reflects the domain knowledge by using variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution over weights given the loss $\phi$ on unlabeled data. This results in learning a low-rank Gaussian prior that assigns higher probability to models that better satisfy the domain knowledge. 

3) The paper demonstrates that using these learned informative priors for BNNs improves performance and alignment with domain knowledge compared to standard BNNs with isotropic Gaussian priors across diverse tasks. The framework is also shown to outperform BNNs with more specialized priors based on Gaussian processes.

4) The paper presents techniques to transfer learned priors across model architectures based on moment matching and maximum mean discrepancy, increasing their applicability.

In summary, the key contribution is a general framework for flexibly incorporating broad notions of domain knowledge into BNN priors and demonstrating its benefits over standard practices.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper draft, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Bayesian neural networks (BNNs): The paper focuses on developing methods for BNNs, which place probability distributions over model weights to capture uncertainty.

- Informative priors: A major goal is incorporating diverse forms of domain knowledge into BNN priors to guide learning. This is in contrast to standard uninformative priors like isotropic Gaussians.  

- Variational inference: The method uses variational inference to approximate an intractable posterior distribution over weights that reflects alignment with domain knowledge. This results in a computationally efficient low-rank Gaussian prior.

- Domain knowledge losses: Central to the approach is representing domain knowledge via a loss function that measures a model's satisfaction of relevant constraints, rules, invariances etc. on unlabeled data.

- Prior transferring: Techniques based on moment matching and maximum mean discrepancy are introduced to transfer learned priors across model architectures.

- Improved uncertainty and performance: Experiments across vision, physics, and healthcare tasks demonstrate benefits of using domain knowledge priors in uncertainty estimation and predictive accuracy.

In summary, the key ideas focus on learning flexible BNN priors that align models with provided domain knowledge, using variational inference and transferable loss functions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The authors propose a framework for incorporating domain knowledge into Bayesian neural networks. What specific limitations of existing methods for incorporating knowledge into BNN priors does this approach aim to overcome?

2) The domain knowledge loss function is a key component of the proposed framework. What are some examples of types of knowledge or constraints that could be difficult to represent via existing approaches like a Gaussian process prior but could potentially be captured through a loss function?

3) The authors use variational inference to approximate the posterior over network weights reflecting the domain knowledge loss. What are the advantages of variational inference over sampling-based approximate inference methods in this application? How does the choice of a low-rank Gaussian approximation benefit computational efficiency?

4) How does the scaling factor β help control the tradeoff between fitting the training data versus adhering to the domain knowledge as encoded in the prior during downstream training? What are some guidelines provided in the paper for setting this hyperparameter?

5) The paper demonstrates transferring an architecture-specific learned prior to a different model architecture. What are some challenges in transferring priors across architectures? How do the proposed moment matching and MMD techniques help address these?

6) Banana relies on access to unlabeled data and the domain knowledge loss function φ during the prior learning stage. In what scenarios would it be beneficial to have techniques to transfer priors without access to φ, as studied in the paper? What are some settings where access could reasonably be maintained?

7) One could argue Banana optimizes a proxy loss function rather than directly optimizing metrics like accuracy. What are some potential downsides of this indirect optimization? When might directly encoding constraints on accuracy/performance be preferred?

8) The experiments study a diverse set of data sets and domain knowledge types. What are some of the key trends observed in terms of how the incorporation of domain knowledge impacts model performance across these experiments? When does it seem to provide clear benefits?

9) The paper mentions Banana could support developing open-source priors encoding desirable properties. What are some challenges still needing to be addressed to make this feasible? What are some types of generic knowledge likely easier or harder to encode in a reusable prior?

10) The proposed framework enables capturing quite general forms of domain knowledge. What are some examples of potentially relevant knowledge for real-world systems which seems beyond the capability of the current approach to encode or enforce? What extensions would be needed?
