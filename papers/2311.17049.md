# [MobileCLIP: Fast Image-Text Models through Multi-Modal Reinforced   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17049)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces MobileCLIP, a new family of efficient image-text models optimized for on-device deployment. The authors propose a novel training approach called multi-modal reinforced training that transfers knowledge from a pre-trained image captioning model and an ensemble of strong CLIP models into the target efficient models, avoiding extra compute overhead. They introduce two reinforced datasets, DataCompDR-12M and DataCompDR-1B, which incorporate synthetic captions and teacher embeddings. Experiments demonstrate 10x-1000x improved learning efficiency with the reinforced datasets. Leveraging this, the authors design MobileCLIP variants based on hybrid CNN-transformer architectures using techniques like structural reparameterization to optimize for accuracy and efficiency. Evaluations show MobileCLIP models achieve state-of-the-art latency-accuracy tradeoff on tasks like zero-shot classification and retrieval compared to previous CLIP models. For example, MobileCLIP-S2 is 2.3x faster than the best previous ViT-B/16 CLIP while being more accurate. Further analyses demonstrate advantages of the proposed training technique and architectures.
