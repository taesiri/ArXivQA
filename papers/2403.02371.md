# [NeuroVoz: a Castillian Spanish corpus of parkinsonian speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02371)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Parkinson's disease (PD) impairs speech in 89% of patients. Speech analysis shows promise as a biomarker for PD diagnosis and monitoring. 
- However, there is a lack of diverse public datasets of Parkinsonian speech limiting reproducibility and advancement of research, especially for Spanish language.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce NeuroVoz, the most comprehensive public corpus of Parkinsonian speech to date with 108 native Castilian Spanish speakers (55 PD and 53 controls).
- It features a wide variety of speech tasks including sustained vowels, diadochokinetic tests, 16 listen-and-repeat sentences, and free monologues describing an image. 
- Specialist manual transcriptions and metadata are provided for accuracy. Automated transcriptions are generated for the monologues.

Key Contributions:
- NeuroVoz is the first public corpus in Castilian Spanish for PD speech analysis.
- With 2,903 files and 3.77 hours of audio, it offers substantial data for exploration of PD's impact on speech.
- It has already enabled studies that can identify PD speech patterns with up to 89% accuracy.
- NeuroVoz addresses the lack of Parkinsonian speech data resources, setting new standards for the field. It enables further innovations in leveraging speech as a PD diagnostic.

In summary, NeuroVoz makes a significant contribution by releasing the most complete public corpus to date for Parkinsonian speech research, featuring native Castilian Spanish speakers. This dataset fills a critical gap, empowering the global research community to gain new insights into PD through speech analysis.
