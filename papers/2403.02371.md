# [NeuroVoz: a Castillian Spanish corpus of parkinsonian speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02371)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Parkinson's disease (PD) impairs speech in 89% of patients. Speech analysis shows promise as a biomarker for PD diagnosis and monitoring. 
- However, there is a lack of diverse public datasets of Parkinsonian speech limiting reproducibility and advancement of research, especially for Spanish language.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce NeuroVoz, the most comprehensive public corpus of Parkinsonian speech to date with 108 native Castilian Spanish speakers (55 PD and 53 controls).
- It features a wide variety of speech tasks including sustained vowels, diadochokinetic tests, 16 listen-and-repeat sentences, and free monologues describing an image. 
- Specialist manual transcriptions and metadata are provided for accuracy. Automated transcriptions are generated for the monologues.

Key Contributions:
- NeuroVoz is the first public corpus in Castilian Spanish for PD speech analysis.
- With 2,903 files and 3.77 hours of audio, it offers substantial data for exploration of PD's impact on speech.
- It has already enabled studies that can identify PD speech patterns with up to 89% accuracy.
- NeuroVoz addresses the lack of Parkinsonian speech data resources, setting new standards for the field. It enables further innovations in leveraging speech as a PD diagnostic.

In summary, NeuroVoz makes a significant contribution by releasing the most complete public corpus to date for Parkinsonian speech research, featuring native Castilian Spanish speakers. This dataset fills a critical gap, empowering the global research community to gain new insights into PD through speech analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces NeuroVoz, a comprehensive corpus of 108 Spanish speakers (55 healthy controls and 53 Parkinson's disease patients) featuring a variety of speech tasks, manual transcriptions, and metadata, aimed at advancing Parkinson's disease diagnosis through speech analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract and background sections, the main contribution of this paper is the introduction of NeuroVoz, a comprehensive corpus of speech recordings from 108 native Castilian Spanish speakers (55 healthy controls and 53 individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's disease). The paper emphasizes that NeuroVoz is the most complete public corpus of Parkinsonian speech to date and the first one in Castilian Spanish. Key aspects that highlight its contributions:

- It addresses the lack of publicly available and diverse language datasets for Parkinson's disease speech analysis, which has hindered research reproducibility and exploration. 

- It features a wide variety of speech tasks, including sustained vowels, diadochokinetic tests, listen-and-repeat utterances and free monologues.

- It provides manual transcriptions for the listen-and-repeat tasks and automated transcriptions for the monologues.

- It has already facilitated several studies on Parkinson's disease detection through speech analysis, with current benchmark accuracy of 89% in identifying speech patterns attributable to PD within the dataset.

- It sets a new standard for the global research community in leveraging speech as a diagnostic tool for neurodegenerative diseases.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and release of the most complete public corpus to date focused on Parkinsonian speech, called NeuroVoz, to promote further research and innovation in this domain.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using specialist manual transcriptions for the listen-and-repeat tasks. What was the rationale behind using manual instead of automated transcriptions for these tasks? What impact could this have on the quality and utility of the data?

2. For the free monologues, automatic transcription using Whisper was utilized. What motivated this choice? What are the tradeoffs of using automated vs manual transcription for spontaneous speech? 

3. The paper notes that the protocol order was designed to facilitate assessments of different speech capabilities (see Table 2). Can you expand on the rationale behind this order? How does it optimize the extraction of relevant speech features?

4. The dataset contains extensive metadata including occupational status, diagnosis details, symptoms assessments, etc. What is the utility of capturing such comprehensive metadata? How can it further enrich analysis of the speech data?

5. The exclusion criteria eliminates regular drinkers and smokers. What is the motivation behind this? Does it introduce any sampling bias into the dataset?

6. The paper mentions recording patients in their ON medication state 2-5 hours after taking it. Why was this protocol chosen? What impact could it have on capturing speech deficits associated with PD?

7. For the sustained vowel tasks, the mean duration varies between HC and PD groups. What could account for this difference? Does it limit comparative analysis in any ways?

8. The dataset provides precomputed voice quality features for sustained vowels only. What restricted the authors from extracting features across all speech tasks? What is the impact of having features for just one task type?

9. The technical validation achieves much lower accuracy than the benchmark set by prior work. What factors could explain this performance gap? What are some ways to improve validation results?

10. What value does a dataset like NeuroVoz add to the field of PD speech analysis research? What new research directions does it enable moving forward?
