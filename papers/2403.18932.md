# [Measuring Political Bias in Large Language Models: What Is Said and How   It Is Said](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18932)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown political biases which can lead to polarization and other harms in downstream applications. 
- Existing benchmarks focus on gender/racial biases but political bias exists and needs transparent, explainable measurement. 
- Political bias is complex - models may lean liberal on some issues (e.g. reproductive rights) but conservative on others (e.g. immigration).

Proposed Solution:
- A two-tiered framework to measure political bias in LLMs by analyzing both the content and style of generated text on political issues. 
- First tier analyzes the stance of the LLM on specific political topics by comparing distributions of generated text to two opposing reference distributions.
- Second tier does framing analysis by examining "what is said" (content bias) and "how it is said" (style bias) to reveal nuances.

Main Contributions:
- Granular, topic-specific analysis of political bias rather than just a generalized ideological measurement.
- Examination of actual generated text to see how biases appear to users.  
- Analysis of both the substance (content bias) and presentation style (style bias) of biased text.
- Applied framework to analyze and compare 11 LLMs, revealing insights like models focusing heavily on US-centric topics.
- Framework is interpretable, scalable to new topics, and can track evolution of biases during model development.

In summary, the paper presents an explainable framework to deeply analyze different facets of political bias in LLMs to promote safer, more reliable AI systems. The analysis also sets a precedent for future research into mitigating such biases.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework to measure political bias in large language models by analyzing both the content and style of their generated content regarding political issues, going beyond existing gender and racial bias benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an interpretable and granular framework for measuring political bias in large language models (LLMs). The key aspects of the framework are:

1) It provides a fine-grained, topic-specific analysis of political bias rather than just a generalized ideological leaning. This allows detecting nuanced issue-specific biases. 

2) It examines political bias along two dimensions: political stance (what position the LLM takes on topics) and framing bias (what information it focuses on and how it presents that information).

3) Framing bias is further analyzed in terms of content bias (what frames are selected) and style bias (sentiment polarity towards entities).

4) The framework facilitates comparative analysis across models to understand differences in how biases are manifested.

5) Analysis using this framework on 11 LLMs reveals insights like - models exhibit both liberal and conservative biases depending on topics, multilingual models have different geographical focuses, larger models don't necessarily show less bias.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing an interpretable framework to provide granular analysis of political biases in LLMs along multiple dimensions, paving the way for developing less biased and more reliable LLM-based applications.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Political bias - The paper focuses on measuring and analyzing political bias in large language models (LLMs). This includes exploring topic-specific stances and framing biases.

- Framing bias - The paper proposes examining framing bias in LLMs by looking at both content bias ("what is said") and style bias ("how it is said"). This involves analyzing frame selection and lexical polarity. 

- Stance analysis - The paper introduces a method to estimate the stance of LLMs on specific political topics by comparing their generated text to opposing "anchor" stances.

- Content analysis - The framework analyzes content bias using frame dimensions and entity-based frames to understand political perspectives and emphasis. 

- Style analysis - The paper examines style bias through media bias classifiers and sentiment analysis towards entities to study biased language and polarity.

- Interpretability - The paper advocates for interpretable, fine-grained measurement of political biases to provide model transparency.

- Topic specificity - The framework conducts topic-specific analyses of bias rather than generalized political orientation tests.

In summary, the key focuses are political bias, framing bias, stance/content/style analysis, interpretability, and topic-specific measurement in LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 suggested in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-tiered framework for measuring political bias, first looking at political stance and then examining framing bias. Could you elaborate on why this two-pronged approach is important for thoroughly evaluating bias? How do stance and framing provide complementary insights?

2. When analyzing political stance, the paper uses a method of comparing model outputs to two extreme anchor distributions representing opposing viewpoints. What are the advantages and potential limitations of using this comparative anchoring approach? 

3. For framing bias analysis, the paper examines both content bias and style bias by employing extractors to identify salient frames and analyze lexical polarity. What considerations and trade-offs went into the design choices for these extractors? How might they be improved?

4. The paper argues that larger model size does not necessarily correlate with reduced bias. Based on your framework's evaluations, what other factors beyond model size seem to contribute to differences in bias levels across models?

5. One interesting finding is that models within the same family can exhibit divergent political biases. To what extent can pre-training procedures account for these intra-family differences? How might data selection and fine-tuning choices play a role?

6. When analyzing framing bias, the paper opts to compare content and style variables across models rather than to predefined references. What are the strengths and limitations of this comparative approach? When would golden references be useful?

7. What implications does the observation about LLMs' predominant focus on US-related topics have for the generalizability of your framework? How might the methodology be adapted to evaluate geographical biases? 

8. Could you discuss any unique insights gained from applying the framework to multilingual models? How does language breadth interact with geographical focus and topic coverage?

9. In what ways could hallucination and factuality impact political bias measurements using your framework? How might false assertions skew results? Is there any way to account for this?

10. Beyond quantifying bias, how could your interpretability-focused framework actually help guide interventions to mitigate bias in LLMs? What are promising next steps for using these granular insights to improve model development?
