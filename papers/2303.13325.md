# [DARE-GRAM : Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression by Aligning   Inverse Gram Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13325)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is:

How can we effectively perform unsupervised domain adaptation for regression problems by aligning the inverse Gram matrices of the source and target domains? 

The key hypothesis is that aligning the inverse Gram matrices, rather than the original feature spaces, will lead to better domain adaptation for regression tasks. This is motivated by the presence of the inverse Gram matrix in the closed-form ordinary least squares (OLS) solution for linear regression.

Specifically, the paper proposes that even when the source and target feature distributions are close, aligning the original spaces may not lead to good alignment for the linear regressor. This is because the OLS solution contains the inverse Gram matrix term, so differences in this can still lead to differing solutions. By explicitly aligning the inverse Gram matrices, a shared linear regressor can more easily be learned for both domains.

The main contributions are:

- A new perspective on domain adaptation for regression based on the OLS solution 

- The proposal to align inverse Gram matrices rather than original feature spaces

- A method called DARE-GRAM that aligns the angle and scale of inverse Gram matrices 

- Empirical validation showing state-of-the-art performance on 3 benchmarks

In summary, the key idea is that aligning the inverse Gram matrices is more effective for domain adaptation in regression than aligning the original feature spaces directly. This is driven by analysis of the OLS solution.
