# [Comparing Importance Sampling Based Methods for Mitigating the Effect of   Class Imbalance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Many datasets exhibit class imbalance where some classes have far more examples than others. This leads models to perform worse on underrepresented classes.
- The Planet Rainforest dataset has a long-tail distribution where important classes like "slash_and_burn" and "artisanal_mining" have very few examples.
- Improving performance on these minority classes is crucial for detecting illegal activities in rainforests using satellite imagery.

Proposed Solution:
- Compare three importance sampling based methods to mitigate class imbalance:
   1) Loss reweighting: Scale the loss on minority classes during training
   2) Undersampling: Randomly subsample majority classes 
   3) Oversampling: Randomly oversample minority classes
- Use Planet dataset and supplemental ADE20K scene classification dataset
- Use two encoders: CLIP and ResNet-18
- Focus on Planet dataset since it offers a challenging multi-label classification task

Main Contributions:
- Loss reweighting has negligible effect on model performance across classes
- Undersampling roughly matches baseline performance on minority classes but reduces performance on majority classes
- Oversampling generally improves performance on minority classes
- Results suggest there may be redundancy in the Planet dataset
- Work provides foundation for future research on Planet dataset and insights on tackling class imbalance

The paper focuses on the Planet dataset since it involves fine-grained multi-label classification of satellite imagery, accentuating the effects of class imbalance. The work tests three intuitive methods to mitigate imbalance and finds oversampling to be most effective while underscoring surprising trends that highlight gaps in understanding of deep neural networks. It offers useful insights and tools for tackling class imbalance.
