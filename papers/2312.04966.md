## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Customizing Motion in Text-to-Video Diffusion Models":

Problem:
Existing text-to-video diffusion models are limited to generating motions seen in their training data. The paper aims to augment these models to generate novel motions specified by a few video examples, while retaining their ability to generate varied appearances as specified by text prompts. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an approach to fine-tune a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model using a small set of example videos depicting a novel motion (e.g. a dance). The method associates the new motion with a unique text token (e.g. "V* dance") that can be used at test time to make the model generate the motion. 

Specifically, the following components are proposed:
- Fine-tuning the temporal convolution and attention layers, and the key & value layers in the spatial attention - these are crucial for modeling temporal motion patterns and corresponding appearance changes over time.
- A video-based regularization approach during fine-tuning to retain information about related motions in the pretrained model and avoid overfitting. 
- A sampling strategy emphasizing early denoising steps that focus more on overall motion dynamics rather than fine appearance details.

Main Contributions:
1) Introduces an approach to augment an existing text-to-video model with custom motions depicted in a few example videos, while retaining text-controllable generation capabilities.
2) Demonstrates applications like invoking the custom motion for multiple people, combining custom motions, and customizing appearance alongside motion. 
3) Proposes quantitative evaluation protocols for generated motion quality and text-alignment, and shows significantly improved results over extending prior image customization techniques.

The method facilitates adding novel controllable motions to existing models without expensive retraining, enabling new creative applications.
