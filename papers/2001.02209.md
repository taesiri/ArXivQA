# [Correctness of Automatic Differentiation via Diffeologies and   Categorical Gluing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02209)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to give a formal semantic account of automatic differentiation (AD), particularly for higher-order functions, that can be used to prove the correctness of AD algorithms. 

Specifically, the paper aims to:

- Provide a denotational semantics for languages used in differentiable programming that can interpret higher-order functions, using diffeological spaces. 

- Use this semantics to prove the correctness of a simple forward-mode AD translation, by making a connection to logical relations proofs.

- Show how the semantic proof can be understood categorically, in terms of a "gluing" construction that builds new models.

- Extend the correctness proof to variant and inductive types like lists, not just base types like reals. 

- Demonstrate the generality of their semantic approach by also proving correctness of a reverse-mode AD algorithm.

The key challenge is that while differential geometry provides notions of derivatives for first-order functions, the derivatives of higher-order functions are not canonically defined. The paper proposes a way to interpret types as diffeological spaces in a way that provides semantics for AD at higher types.

In summary, the central research contribution is using categories of diffeological spaces and categorical gluing constructions to create models that can formally interpret AD algorithms and support proofs of their semantic correctness, for languages with features like higher-order functions and algebraic data types.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of the paper is to provide a semantic analysis of automatic differentiation using denotational semantics and diffeological spaces. Specifically:

- It gives a denotational semantics for a higher order typed language with real numbers, products, functions, variants, and inductive types like lists. The semantics interprets types as diffeological spaces and terms as smooth functions between these spaces.

- It defines a forward mode automatic differentiation transformation on the language as a syntactic macro. This macro transforms both types and terms.

- It shows the correctness of this automatic differentiation transformation with respect to the denotational semantics. The key idea is to interpret types not just as spaces but as triples (X, X', S) where X' serves as the "tangent bundle" and S relates curves in X to tangent curves in X'. This allows defining derivatives at higher types.

- It provides a categorical analysis of the correctness argument using gluing/logical relations. This also leads to a proof of correctness for first order types based on manifolds and tangent bundles.

- It shows the approach is flexible by also giving a semantics for a continuation-based reverse mode AD algorithm.

So in summary, the main contribution is using denotational semantics in diffeological spaces to model differentiation and prove the correctness of syntactic AD transformations, including at higher types, while retaining compositionality. The categorical perspective provides a deeper understanding of how this works.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading, here is a one sentence summary of the key points of the paper:

The paper presents semantic correctness proofs for automatic differentiation (AD) on a higher order language with algebraic data types, using diffeological spaces and categorical gluing to model differentiation and show that a forward-mode AD algorithm correctly computes derivatives.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points of comparison between this paper and other related work on formalizing and verifying automatic differentiation:

- The paper provides a denotational semantics for a higher-order functional programming language with automatic differentiation. This is in contrast to much work that focuses only on first-order languages or computation graphs. Providing semantics for higher-order AD is an open challenge.

- The semantics is based on diffeological spaces, which allow modeling smooth higher-order functions while still having a close connection to traditional differential geometry. Other categorical models of differentiation like synthetic differential geometry or differential Î»-calculi don't have this tight connection.

- The main correctness theorem connects syntactic forward-mode AD to taking derivatives of semantic interpretations. This is proved via an elegant "gluing" construction relating syntax, semantics, and differentiation. Other correctness proofs tend to be more syntactic in nature.

- The approach is shown to generalize beyond forward mode, e.g. to a continuation-passing style reverse mode algorithm. Most other formal verification has focused specifically on reverse mode.

- Inductive and coinductive data types like lists and trees are supported in the language and semantics. These pose challenges for differentiation and are not considered in much related work.

- The semantics is more abstract and mathematical than operational models relating eval and differentiation directly. But the proofs seem less automated/formalized than in some of those syntactic accounts.

- There is no treatment of effects like non-termination or probabilistic functions. Nor algorithms like gradient descent. Other work connects AD more directly to these practical concerns.

So in summary, this paper provides a quite broad denotational semantics for AD in a higher-order functional language, developed in a categorical style. It relates syntax and semantics through some elegantly structured proofs. The treatment of higher-order AD, inductive types, and the diffeological spaces semantics seems relatively novel. But it's arguably quite far from practical implementation concerns.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Adding support for partiality, iteration, and probabilities to their denotational semantics approach using diffeological spaces. They mention using standard categorical methods like monads for partiality/iteration, and building on existing work defining probability monads on diffeological spaces.

- Extending their semantic correctness proofs for automatic differentiation to reverse mode AD. They hope relating this to the syntactic proof by Brunel et al. could be complementary. They also suggest extending it to a more expressive language. 

- Investigating if/how the higher order semantic derivatives that can be defined in diffeological spaces could be related to the derivatives computed by AD algorithms.

- Adding support for full recursion and dynamically typed languages by building on prior work on diffeological predomains. This could enable handling of things like streams.

- Connecting their idealized language and semantics closer to AD implementations in practice by supporting arrays, optimizations like partial evaluation, and features like mutable state and control operators used in some AD implementations.

- Further exploring the relationship between the simple functional formulation of reverse mode AD they give and more advanced optimized implementations that rely on effects and control operators.

So in summary, they propose a range of extensions to make their semantics more expressive and better connected to practical AD implementations, as well as further exploring the theory relating semantics and syntax, especially for reverse mode AD.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents semantic correctness proofs for automatic differentiation (AD) methods. It focuses on forward-mode AD for a higher-order language with algebraic data types. The AD method is characterized as the unique structure-preserving macro that is determined once derivatives are chosen for basic operations. A denotational semantics for differentiable programming based on diffeological spaces is described, and it is shown to interpret the language. The paper defines what it means for the AD method to be correct with respect to this semantics. Using a gluing construction on diffeological spaces, an elegant semantic proof of correctness for forward-mode AD is presented, and this is connected back to a logical relations argument. The analysis is extended to sketch how it applies to other AD methods, such as a continuation-based reverse-mode approach. Overall, the paper provides a semantic account of AD using categorical and denotational techniques.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents semantic correctness proofs for Automatic Differentiation (AD). The authors consider a forward-mode AD method on a higher order language with algebraic data types. They characterize forward-mode AD as the unique structure preserving macro that is determined by the choice of derivatives for basic operations. A denotational semantics for differentiable programming languages is proposed using diffeological spaces. It is shown that this semantics interprets the language, and the correctness of AD is phrased in terms of the relationship between the semantics of a program and its automatically differentiated version. A key result is an elegant semantic proof of the correctness of AD based on a gluing construction on diffeological spaces. This proof can be understood as a logical relations argument. The authors also sketch how the analysis extends to other AD methods like reverse-mode by considering a continuation-based algorithm.

In summary, the main contributions are: 1) Characterizing AD as a canonical functor on syntax; 2) Providing a denotational semantics using diffeological spaces; 3) Establishing semantic correctness of forward-mode AD via a gluing argument; 4) Explaining the logical relations essence of this proof; 5) Generalizing to other AD methods like reverse-mode. The paper provides new semantic foundations for understanding differential programming languages and proving correctness of AD techniques.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents semantic correctness proofs of Automatic Differentiation (AD) using diffeological spaces and categorical gluing. The authors consider a forward-mode AD method on a higher order language with algebraic data types, and characterize it as the unique structure preserving macro given a choice of derivatives for basic operations. They provide a denotational semantics for the language based on diffeological spaces, which allows interpreting higher order functions while ensuring smoothness. They show this semantics interprets the language, and use it to prove correctness of the AD method based on a gluing construction on diffeological spaces. This gluing construction gives rise to an elegant semantic proof of correctness, which they explain is essentially a logical relations argument.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper presents semantic proofs of correctness for automatic differentiation (AD). Specifically, it considers forward-mode AD on a higher-order language with algebraic data types and characterizes it as the unique structure-preserving macro given a choice of derivatives for basic operations. The key contributions are:

- It gives a denotational semantics for the language in diffeological spaces, showing that every definable expression is smooth. 

- It shows correctness of the AD macro by a logical relations argument.

- It provides a categorical analysis of this correctness argument involving the canonicity of the macro and a notion of "glued space" that abstracts the logical relation. 

- It uses this analysis to state and prove a correctness argument at all first order types.

- It shows the approach is not specific to one AD method by also considering a continuation-based AD algorithm.

Overall, the paper provides a semantic account of AD, connecting it to differential geometry while retaining the compositionality of denotational semantics. A key challenge is dealing with higher-order functions, which have no direct counterpart in traditional differential geometry. The use of diffeological spaces and categorical gluing constructions provides an elegant solution.

In summary, the paper aims to formalize the connection between differential geometry and syntactic AD operations in a compositional, denotational way, while also proving correctness of AD with respect to this semantics. The treatment of higher-order functions is a notable aspect.
