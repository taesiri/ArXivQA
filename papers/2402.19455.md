# [Listening to the Noise: Blind Denoising with Gibbs Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19455)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Listening to the Noise: Blind Denoising with Gibbs Diffusion":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of blind denoising, where the goal is to recover a clean signal $\mathbf{x}$ from a noisy observation $\mathbf{y}$ that is a mixture of the signal and additive Gaussian noise $\mathbf{\varepsilon}$ with unknown parameters $\mathbf{\phi}$ (e.g. noise level, color). Recovering both the clean signal and noise properties is important in many applications but challenging. Prior diffusion model-based methods can denoise well but require knowing the noise parameters. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Gibbs Diffusion (GDiff), a novel methodology combining diffusion models and Gibbs sampling. The key idea is to iterate between:
1) Using a conditional diffusion model to sample signal realizations from $p(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{\phi})$. The model is trained on signal examples to model $p(\mathbf{x})$ and leverage that as a prior when sampling.
2) Running Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to sample noise parameters from $p(\mathbf{\phi} | \mathbf{y}, \hat{\mathbf{x}})$, where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ is the current signal estimate.

This builds a Markov chain that converges to the joint posterior $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{\phi} | \mathbf{y})$. Theoretical analysis establishes conditions for convergence, quantifies approximation errors, and guides diagnostics.

Main Contributions:
1) A general methodology for blind signal denoising and joint signal-noise inference based on diffusion model priors and Gibbs sampling.
2) Theoretical analysis quantifying inference errors caused by diffusion model inaccuracies and guiding convergence diagnostics. 
3) Demonstrated applications to image denoising with unknown noise color/amplitude and a cosmology problem inferring parameters governing universe evolution.
4) Strong empirical performance denoising natural images, outperforming non-blind and blind baselines in terms of PSNR and SSIM.

The method advances diffusion-based denoising to tackle blind settings through a principled Bayesian approach, with versatility showcased across very different applications. Analysis and diagnostics address approximation errors and aid practical usage.
