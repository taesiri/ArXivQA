# [Optimizing ADMM and Over-Relaxed ADMM Parameters for Linear Quadratic   Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00657)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is a versatile optimization algorithm used across many machine learning domains. It decomposes complex problems into simpler sub-problems that can be solved efficiently. However, the convergence rate of ADMM depends critically on the selection of two key parameters - the penalty parameter and the relaxation parameter. Incorrect parameter selection can significantly slow down convergence. Prior works have proposed methods to select good parameter values, but they make restrictive assumptions or depend too much on problem-specific insight. There is a need for more generalizable and automated techniques to select optimal ADMM parameters.

Proposed Solution:
This paper focuses on applying ADMM to solve linear quadratic problems (LQPs), which are common in imaging applications. The key ideas are:

1) Prove that ADMM applied to LQPs converges unconditionally, regardless of penalty parameter value. This is done by reformulating ADMM iterations as fixed-point iterations and showing the spectral radius of the iteration matrix is â‰¤ 1. 

2) Propose a numerical gradient descent method to optimize the penalty parameter by minimizing the spectral radius. This is more generalizable than prior analytical approaches.

3) Derive a novel closed-form formula to calculate the optimal relaxation parameter for any given penalty parameter. This converts the original two-variable optimization problem into a single-variable problem focused just on the penalty parameter.

Main Contributions:

- First convergence proof of ADMM for LQPs, showing unconditional convergence.

- A general numerical method to optimize the ADMM penalty parameter by minimizing spectral radius.

- A closed-form solution to compute the optimal over-relaxation parameter.

- Validation on both random problems and real imaging applications - diffeomorphic registration, deblurring and MRI reconstruction.

The proposed methods for automatically selecting optimal ADMM and over-relaxed ADMM parameters are more general, efficient and validated to work very well on different imaging problems. This can make adoption of these algorithms much easier.
