## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces the Deterministic Guidance Diffusion Model (DGDM) for probabilistic weather forecasting, which integrates the benefits of both deterministic and probabilistic approaches. DGDM consists of two branches: a deterministic branch for accuracy and a probabilistic diffusion-based branch for diversity. During training, both branches are trained end-to-end. During inference, the forecast from the deterministic branch serves as an intermediate starting point to truncate the reverse diffusion process of the probabilistic branch, allowing it to control the range of possible futures while retaining diversity. Experiments on the Moving MNIST, Pacific Northwest Windstorm-Typhoon, and WeatherBench datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, indicating DGDM's effectiveness for probabilistic weather forecasting from low-resolution global to high-resolution regional modeling. Key innovations include the integration of deterministic guidance into the diffusion process via truncated reverse diffusion, as well as the sequential variance schedule to allocate more diffusion steps for longer lead times to capture increasing uncertainty.
