# [Robust Graph Neural Network based on Graph Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06557)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture that is robust to perturbations or errors in the topology of the input graph. The key idea is to jointly estimate the weights of the GNN model along with the true (unknown) graph topology, rather than taking the observed perturbed topology as ground truth. Specifically, the optimization problem minimizes a loss function over the GNN outputs as well as discrepancies between the estimated and observed graph structures, balanced by a regularization term. This allows prior knowledge about the graph topology and types of perturbations to be incorporated. To handle the resulting challenging non-convex optimization problem, the authors develop an iterative block coordinate descent method that alternates between updating the GNN weights (via gradient descent) and estimating the graph topology (via proximal gradient). Experiments on node classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms standard GNN variants when the input graph contains an increasing number of perturbations, especially when additional information about the perturbation structure is included. The method provides a general framework to train GNNs robustly even when the graph topology is imperfectly observed.
