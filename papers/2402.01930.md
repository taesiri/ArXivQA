# [Reducing Optimism Bias in Incomplete Cooperative Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01930)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Specifying a cooperative game requires assigning values to all possible coalitions, which is exponential in the number of players
- Acquiring values is often resource-intensive (e.g. retraining ML models, rearranging teams in companies)
- But leaving coalition values uncovered creates ambiguity and leads to over-optimistic expectations from players about their contributions 
- This results in cumulative player claims exceeding the true grand coalition value, creating a gap the authors refer to as the "cumulative utopian gap"

Solution: 
- The paper introduces the concept of "superadditive utopian games" to model player optimism and analyzes properties of the resulting utopian gap
- A non-involved "principal" can select a limited number of coalitions to reveal and minimize this gap efficiently
- The paper formulates offline and online optimization problems for the principal, aiming to reduce the gap with a budget constraint 
- For the offline case, optimal and greedy algorithms are proposed along with heuristics
- For the online case, a reinforcement learning algorithm is developed 
- Experiments are run on practical cooperative game classes, including a simple "factory game" model and the broad class of supermodular games

Main Contributions:
- Formal analysis of the utopian gap arising from player optimism in incomplete cooperative games 
- Proof of fundamental characteristics like monotonicity and additivity
- Geometric interpretation of the gap as quantifying remaining uncertainty
- Algorithms for principals to minimize this gap, including offline optimal, greedy & online RL
- Empirical analysis showing significant reduction in gap with a small number of coalition revelations  
- Insight that for games like supermodular, gap can be largely eliminated by revealing only O(n) coalitions 

In summary, the paper provides a novel perspective on ambiguity in cooperative games by analyzing player optimism, together with principled methods to mitigate resulting disparities between expectations and outcomes. The empirical results also offer reassuring insights into the efficiency of the proposed techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a framework for efficiently reducing the discrepancy between achievable outcomes and inflated player expectations stemming from ambiguity in incomplete cooperative games by optimally sequencing the revelation of coalition values under a limited budget.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

(i) The paper studies the individual players' optimistic completions of incomplete cooperative games (with missing coalition values) and the resulting "utopian gap" between the players' expectations and achievable outcomes. It investigates analytical properties of this gap, such as monotonicity and additivity, that allow more efficient optimization. 

(ii) The paper develops methods to minimize this utopian gap over classes of games with a known prior distribution by selectively revealing additional coalition values, in both offline and online fashions. This helps reduce the ambiguity in incomplete games.

(iii) The paper empirically demonstrates the performance of the proposed algorithms in practical scenarios, together with an analysis of the typical order in which coalition values tend to be revealed by the algorithms. For certain classes of games like supermodular games, the gap can be nearly eliminated by revealing only O(n) coalition values out of the exponential number of possibilities.

In summary, the paper provides a novel framework for efficiently reducing ambiguity and over-optimism in cooperative games by strategic value revelation, with both theoretical analysis and empirical validation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Incomplete cooperative games - Cooperative games where only some coalition values are known, with the rest being unspecified. This introduces ambiguity and allows players to be overly optimistic about their contributions.

- Optimism bias - The tendency of players to overestimate their contributions in incomplete cooperative games, leading to inflated expectations and demands that exceed the true grand coalition value. 

- Utopian games - Games representing each player's most optimistic perspective on their contribution, resulting from their inherent optimism bias.

- Cumulative utopian gap - The total discrepancy between the optimistic expectations of all players (their utopian games) and the actual grand coalition value. Represents the surplus in collective demands over achievable outcomes.

- Principal - An external party who can sequentially reveal additional coalition values, with the goal of minimizing the cumulative utopian gap.

- Online vs. offline revelation - The principal can reveal new coalition values either in an online fashion utilizing past revelations, or offline without that information.

- Lower/upper games - Games providing worst-case and best-case bounds on the values of missing coalitions in an incomplete cooperative game.

- Superadditive games - Class of cooperative games satisfying a logical superadditivity constraint. Utopian gap properties leverage superadditivity.

So in summary - incomplete cooperative games, optimism bias, utopian gap minimization, revelation strategies, superadditivity etc. are some of the central concepts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of the "utopian gap" to quantify the disparity between players' optimistic expectations and the actual feasible outcomes in cooperative games. How is this gap formally defined and what are its key properties?

2. The paper aims to efficiently minimize the utopian gap by strategically revealing additional coalition values. What optimization problems are formulated for the principal to achieve this, both in offline and online settings? 

3. What algorithms are proposed to solve the offline and online principal's problems? Discuss their complexity, optimality guarantees if any, and how they estimate expectations over the prior distribution of games.

4. The paper indicates the utopian gap is supermodular only for games with at most 4 players. Construct a detailed counterexample for 5 players and explain why supermodularity fails to hold.  

5. Empirically, the greedy algorithms seem to perform on par with the optimal methods despite the lack of supermodularity guarantees. Speculate on why this might be the case even though theoretical worst-case examples exist.  

6. For the experiments in the paper, analyze the choice of cooperative game distributions used. What key properties do they have and what insights do the results provide about minimizing the utopian gap?

7. The paper demonstrates the utopian gap can be significantly reduced for supermodular games by revealing only O(n) coalition values. Intuitively explain why the largest coalitions provide sufficient information in this case.  

8. Discuss the significance of normalization used during the PPO training process. How does it impact learning and in what way does it maintain equivalence in terms of the utopian gap?

9. From a practical standpoint, discuss plausible real-world scenarios where the proposed methods could be applied to efficiently minimize ambiguity in cooperative games.  

10. The paper leaves open the problem of providing guarantees for the online greedy approach. Suggest ways in which regret minimization frameworks could potentially be leveraged to derive such guarantees.
