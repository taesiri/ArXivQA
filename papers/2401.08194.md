# [End-to-End Optimized Image Compression with the Frequency-Oriented   Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08194)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Image compression is important for efficient transmission and storage of image data, but traditional image codecs have incremental progress and lack interpretability.
- Recent learning-based methods show superior performance but also lack interpretability. 
- It is important to design an interpretable learning-based image compression model that aligns with properties of the human visual system.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose an end-to-end optimized image compression model with a frequency-oriented transform that disentangles the image into frequency bands.
- The model has four main components:
   1) Spatial sampling to downsample the input image
   2) Frequency-oriented transform to decompose into low, mid and high frequency bands
   3) Separate quantization and entropy estimation for each frequency band
   4) Frequency-aware fusion at the decoder to reconstruct the image from selected frequency bands
- Attention mechanisms are used to capture spatial correlations. The model supports scalable coding by transmitting selected frequency bands based on bandwidth constraints.

Main Contributions:
- Propose an interpretable frequency-oriented transform for learning-based image compression.
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing traditional codecs like H.266/VVC on MS-SSIM metric.
- Provide both quantitative analysis and visualizations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the frequency decomposition.
- Show the model retains semantic information - supports tasks like detection and segmentation better than H.266/VVC.
- Demonstrate scalable coding capabilities by incremental transmission of frequency bands while preserving quality.

In summary, the paper proposes an interpretable learning-based image compression model using a frequency-oriented transform that aligns with human perception, achieves superior performance over traditional standards, and supports scalable coding as well as retains semantic information.
