# [FedCompetitors: Harmonious Collaboration in Federated Learning with   Competing Participants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11391)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of establishing collaboration among participants (FL-PTs) in federated learning (FL) when some of the FL-PTs are competitors with conflicting interests. Prior works on FL do not address the issue of competition among FL-PTs. Selecting appropriate collaborators while avoiding conflicts of interest is important for building trustworthy and scalable FL ecosystems.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an approach called \methodname{} that extends the principle of "the friend of my enemy is my enemy" from balance theory to determine collaborations in FL. This principle is used to guarantee no direct or indirect conflicts of interest. The relationships among FL-PTs are modeled using graphs - a competing graph representing competition, a benefit graph capturing data heterogeneity, and a data usage graph showing actual collaborations. An integer linear programming formulation and a polynomial-time algorithm are proposed to find the data usage graph that maximizes utility of FL-PTs while preventing conflicts based on the competing and benefit graphs.

Main Contributions:
- Formally defines and solves the problem of establishing collaboration among competing FL-PTs to avoid any conflicts of interest
- Extends a principle from balance theory and applies graph theory to model relationships and constraints
- Proposes an efficient algorithm that runs in polynomial time to determine collaborations that maximize utility  
- Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over baselines
- Allows competing FL-PTs to collaborate in FL without conflicts, enhancing scalability and trustworthiness of the ecosystem

The main novelty of the paper is in addressing competition in FL collaborations and guaranteeing absence of conflicts of interest, which has not been studied previously. The graph-based modeling and algorithm design contribute towards making FL amenable even with competing participants.
