# [FedCompetitors: Harmonious Collaboration in Federated Learning with   Competing Participants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11391)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of establishing collaboration among participants (FL-PTs) in federated learning (FL) when some of the FL-PTs are competitors with conflicting interests. Prior works on FL do not address the issue of competition among FL-PTs. Selecting appropriate collaborators while avoiding conflicts of interest is important for building trustworthy and scalable FL ecosystems.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an approach called \methodname{} that extends the principle of "the friend of my enemy is my enemy" from balance theory to determine collaborations in FL. This principle is used to guarantee no direct or indirect conflicts of interest. The relationships among FL-PTs are modeled using graphs - a competing graph representing competition, a benefit graph capturing data heterogeneity, and a data usage graph showing actual collaborations. An integer linear programming formulation and a polynomial-time algorithm are proposed to find the data usage graph that maximizes utility of FL-PTs while preventing conflicts based on the competing and benefit graphs.

Main Contributions:
- Formally defines and solves the problem of establishing collaboration among competing FL-PTs to avoid any conflicts of interest
- Extends a principle from balance theory and applies graph theory to model relationships and constraints
- Proposes an efficient algorithm that runs in polynomial time to determine collaborations that maximize utility  
- Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over baselines
- Allows competing FL-PTs to collaborate in FL without conflicts, enhancing scalability and trustworthiness of the ecosystem

The main novelty of the paper is in addressing competition in FL collaborations and guaranteeing absence of conflicts of interest, which has not been studied previously. The graph-based modeling and algorithm design contribute towards making FL amenable even with competing participants.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method called FedCompetitors to enable harmonious collaboration in federated learning among participants who may compete against each other in business, by extending the principle from balance theory of "the friend of my enemy is my enemy" to partition participants into independent groups without conflicting interests.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called \methodname{} to establish collaboration among federated learning participants (FL-PTs) when some of them are competitors. Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

1) Extending a principle from balance theory - "the friend of my enemy is my enemy" to guarantee no conflict of interest among FL-PTs, even if some of them are competitors. 

2) Formulating the resulting problem using graph theory and integer linear programming, and proposing a polynomial-time algorithm to determine the collaboration relationships among the FL-PTs.

3) The proposed framework jointly considers data heterogeneity and competition among FL-PTs. It allows competing FL-PTs to smoothly join the federated learning ecosystem without conflict of interest, thus ensuring high scalability.

4) Conducting extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework compared to several baselines. The experiments validate its ability to establish efficient collaboration networks among FL-PTs, even in the presence of competing relationships.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a practical framework that can enable harmonious federated learning collaboration involving competing participants, which has not been sufficiently addressed in prior federated learning research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Federated learning (FL) - The collaborative machine learning approach that allows multiple parties to jointly train a model while keeping data decentralized. The paper focuses on establishing collaboration in FL.

- Competing participants - The paper considers the scenario where some of the participants (FL-PTs) in federated learning compete against each other, such as hospitals serving the same population.

- Conflict of interest - The goal is to avoid any conflicts of interest within the FL ecosystem, so that no participant indirectly aids a competitor.

- Balance theory - The paper extends the principle of "the friend of my enemy is my enemy" from balance theory to ensure absence of conflicting interests.  

- Graph theory - Graph representations like the competing graph, benefit graph and data usage graph are used to formulate the problem.

- Integer linear programming - An integer linear program is set up to determine the collaboration relationships that avoid conflicts of interest.

- Polynomial-time algorithm - The paper proposes an efficient, polynomial-time algorithm to solve the integer program and select collaborators for each participant.

In summary, the key focus is on establishing harmonious federated learning collaboration between participants who may compete, using principles from balance theory and mathematical optimization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper extends a principle from balance theory to address competition among participants in federated learning. Could you elaborate on this principle and explain how you adapted it to ensure absence of conflicting interests? 

2. You formulate the problem using graph theory concepts such as competing graph, benefit graph, and data usage graph. Could you walk through the precise definitions and roles of each of these graphs?

3. Assumption 1 is key to avoiding conflicts of interest by preventing contributors from helping the friends of their competitors. Walk through the rationale behind this assumption and why it is reasonable. 

4. Proposition 1 provides an equivalent mathematical constraint to Assumption 1. Explain the logic behind why satisfying this constraint guarantees that Assumption 1 also holds.

5. The proposed algorithm greedily adds edges to the data usage graph based on benefit scores. Explain why adding edges based on this greedy criterion preserves feasibility according to Proposition 1.

6. Could you analyze the time complexity of the overall algorithm and the key subroutines like finding $\mathcal{B}_i$, $\mathcal{S}^-_{i,j}$, etc.? Where does the $O(n^4)$ complexity come from?

7. How did you generate the synthetic data for your experiments? Walk through the data generation process and how you simulated non-IIDness and competing relationships.  

8. For the eICU experiments, how did you select the 10 hospitals and define the tasks? What practical insights do the learned benefit graph and data usage graph provide?

9. How exactly do the baseline approaches based on min clique cover differ from the proposed approach in how they construct collaborator groups? What are limitations of the baselines?

10. The paper focuses on cross-silo FL for organizations. How might the ideas extend to other FL settings like mobile or IoT devices? What new challenges might arise in those decentralized settings?
