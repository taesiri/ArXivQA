# [SketchINR: A First Look into Sketches as Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SketchINR: A First Look into Sketches as Implicit Neural Representations":

Problem:
- Existing sketch representations like raster images, vector sequences, and learned models have limitations in fidelity, scalability, speed, and flexibility. 
- Raster images lose temporal stroke information. Raw vector sequences scale linearly in storage with sketch complexity. Learned sequential models like SketchRNN have quadratic compute costs and fail to accurately reconstruct complex sketches.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes SketchINR, the first implicit neural representation for sketch modelling. 
- A sketch is modeled as a continuous function $f_\theta(t,s)$ that outputs sketch coordinates given time $t$ and stroke number $s$ inputs. $f_\theta$ is parameterized by a neural network.
- Multiple sketches are encoded into a latent space. Decoder $f_\theta$ conditioned on per-sketch latent code can reconstruct that sketch. 
- SketchINR is trained with a combination of MSE and visual losses to ensure decoding flexibility and rasterization quality.
- A variational autoencoder model allows sampling new sketches.

Main Contributions:
- Compact storage: Entire sketch dataset encoded into small latent codes, providing 60x and 10x compression over raster and vector sketches.
- High fidelity: Reconstruction quality surpasses state-of-the-art learned sketch models like SketchRNN, especially for complex sketches.
- Flexible decoding: Varying number of time/stroke samples allows variable level of detail and abstraction.
- Novel applications: Smoother latent space than RNNs enabling interpolation; inversion allows sketch completion. 
- Parallel decoding: 100x faster than SketchRNN for long sketches.

In summary, SketchINR provides the first high fidelity, scalable and flexible learned representation for vector sketches with novel applications in compression, interpolation, completion and abstraction. The compact yet accurate representation will empower future sketch modelling.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It presents the first implicit neural representation approach to vector sketch modelling, extending implicit neural representations (INRs) as a function of time and strokes, and defining a training objective for learning them. 

2) It introduces SketchINR, which provides the first learned representation capable of representing complex sketches compactly and with high-fidelity.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes modeling sketches as implicit functions of time and strokes. How does this differ from prior work on sketch representations, and what advantages does it provide?

2. The visual loss term matches reconstructed sketches to ground truth sketches in pixel space. Why is this necessary in addition to the MSE loss between predicted and ground truth coordinate values? 

3. The paper demonstrates sketch compression results. What factors contribute to the improved compression over alternative sketch representations? How might compression be further improved?

4. Sketch interpolation results suggest SketchINR has a smoother latent space than autoregressive models like SketchRNN. What causes the discontinuities in the SketchRNN latent space? How does SketchINR avoid this?

5. The method supports controllable sketch abstraction by varying the number of reconstructed strokes. How is this achieved technically? Why is it difficult for other representations?

6. Sketch completion results are shown, including "a-temporal" completion given only later strokes. How does this work, since the model relies on sequential stroke inputs?

7. What modifications were made to adapt implicit neural representations from 3D shapes to 2D sketches? How was the representation generalized to multiple sketches?

8. The paper argues that time should be modeled "globally" across strokes rather than "locally" per stroke. Why does local modeling result in jittery outputs?

9. How was the Intensity Smoothing factor Î³ determined? What tradeoffs exist in setting it higher or lower?

10. What are some limitations of SketchINR? What future work could address these limitations or build on this representation?
