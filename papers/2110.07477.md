# RecInDial: A Unified Framework for Conversational Recommendation with   Pretrained Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a novel framework called RecInDial for conversational recommendation. The main research question it aims to address is how to effectively integrate item recommendation into dialogue generation in a conversational recommender system. The key hypothesis is that by finetuning large pretrained language models (PLMs) and introducing a vocabulary pointer mechanism, they can unify the response generation and item recommendation into a single unified framework. This would allow the model to generate fluent responses while seamlessly recommending relevant items.Specifically, the main hypotheses tested in this work are:- Finetuning PLMs on conversational recommendation data can help generate more fluent and diverse responses compared to training neural models from scratch, addressing the issue of overfitting on small datasets. - Introducing an item vocabulary and vocabulary pointer into the PLM can effectively integrate recommendation and generation, overcoming limitations of prior loose integration techniques like copy mechanisms.- Incorporating knowledge graph information to bias the PLM finetuning can further improve recommendation performance by encoding relational knowledge about items.- Evaluating recommendation performance by checking if target items occur in final responses (end-to-end) better captures overall system performance compared to separate evaluation.Through experiments on the ReDial dataset, the paper shows support for these hypotheses, demonstrating improved performance over prior state-of-the-art baselines on both recommendation and dialogue generation metrics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a new unified framework called RecInDial for conversational recommendation. RecInDial integrates item recommendation into the dialogue generation process by finetuning pretrained language models (PLMs) and using a vocabulary pointer mechanism. - It addresses the low-resource challenge in conversational recommendation by finetuning large-scale PLMs and incorporating knowledge from a relational graph convolutional network on an item-oriented knowledge graph. This allows the model to generate more fluent and diverse responses compared to prior work.- It unifies the item recommendation and response generation components into a single PLM-based framework, overcoming limitations of prior work that uses separate modules for recommendation and generation. - Extensive experiments show RecInDial significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on both dialogue generation and recommendation metrics. The model is evaluated in an end-to-end manner which reflects the overall performance.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a unified PLM-based framework RecInDial that integrates recommendation seamlessly into dialogue generation and outperforms previous models that have separate recommendation and generation modules. The use of PLMs and knowledge graphs helps address data scarcity issues.
