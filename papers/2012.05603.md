# [Equivalent Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05603)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Addressed:
The paper aims to develop a formal definition of when two causal models that share only a subset of variables should be considered "equivalent". The goal is to capture when two models agree on all the essential causal relations between their common variables, so that conclusions drawn about those variables will be the same regardless of which model is used. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper develops a notion of "causal equivalence" based on two key aspects of causal models:

1) Structural relations: Captured by ancestral/parenthood relations in the causal graph. The paper generalizes these to relations between specific values of variables, sets of variables, and to potential vs actual (context-specific) relations. 

2) Functional relations: Captured by relations of causal sufficiency between variable values. The paper develops a notion of "sufficiency" based on transitive chains of direct sufficiency relations.  

Two models are defined to be causally equivalent if they have identical structural and functional relations between their common variables, for some setting of the extra variables in the larger model.

Main Contributions:

- Offers the first systematic exploration of causal model equivalence when models do not share the same variables
- Identifies and formalizes key aspects of causal models: structural relations and functional relations
- Develops generalized notions of ancestral relations and causal sufficiency relations to enable comparing models
- Defines causal equivalence based on requiring identical structural and functional relations between common variables
- Compares to prior work on "conservative extension", argues why causal equivalence is more appropriate
- Lays groundwork for future work on generalizing to approximate equivalence, applying ideas to actual causation, etc.
