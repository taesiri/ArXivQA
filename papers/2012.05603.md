# [Equivalent Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05603)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Addressed:
The paper aims to develop a formal definition of when two causal models that share only a subset of variables should be considered "equivalent". The goal is to capture when two models agree on all the essential causal relations between their common variables, so that conclusions drawn about those variables will be the same regardless of which model is used. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper develops a notion of "causal equivalence" based on two key aspects of causal models:

1) Structural relations: Captured by ancestral/parenthood relations in the causal graph. The paper generalizes these to relations between specific values of variables, sets of variables, and to potential vs actual (context-specific) relations. 

2) Functional relations: Captured by relations of causal sufficiency between variable values. The paper develops a notion of "sufficiency" based on transitive chains of direct sufficiency relations.  

Two models are defined to be causally equivalent if they have identical structural and functional relations between their common variables, for some setting of the extra variables in the larger model.

Main Contributions:

- Offers the first systematic exploration of causal model equivalence when models do not share the same variables
- Identifies and formalizes key aspects of causal models: structural relations and functional relations
- Develops generalized notions of ancestral relations and causal sufficiency relations to enable comparing models
- Defines causal equivalence based on requiring identical structural and functional relations between common variables
- Compares to prior work on "conservative extension", argues why causal equivalence is more appropriate
- Lays groundwork for future work on generalizing to approximate equivalence, applying ideas to actual causation, etc.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper defines and explores notions of equivalence between causal models that agree on causal relations between their common variables, focusing on equivalences based on preserving structural (ancestral) relations and functional (sufficiency) relations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is formally defining a notion of "causal equivalence" between two causal models that share only a subset of variables. Specifically:

- The paper develops definitions of "structural equivalence" and "functional equivalence" between causal models, capturing equivalence in terms of the models' ancestral/structural relations and functional/sufficiency relations respectively. 

- It argues that two causally equivalent models should agree on all "essential" causal information expressible in their common variables, and that numerical properties like the number of paths between variables should not be considered essential for equivalence.

- Causal equivalence is then defined as the combination of structural and functional equivalence - two models are causally equivalent if they are both structurally and functionally equivalent with respect to the same setting of their non-shared exogenous variables. 

- This notion of equivalence is intended to be used in contexts where we want to draw "stable" conclusions about causal relations between variables of interest, irrespective of what other variables exist in extended models. The paper argues this definition satisfies certain intuitive equivalence-preserving properties.

So in summary, the main contribution is a formally defined notion of causal equivalence tailored to contexts where models share only some of their variables, arguing this captures equivalence with respect to the "essential" causal information expressible in the common variables.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Causal models - The paper focuses on defining equivalence between causal models, specifically structural equation models.

- Equivalence - The main goal is to define when two causal models can be considered equivalent, even when they do not share exactly the same variables.

- Structural relations - Relations in a causal model having to do with the causal graph structure, like ancestry/parenthood. Preservation of potential and actual structural relations is part of the equivalence definition.  

- Functional relations - Relations in a causal model having to do with how variable values are determined by other variable values. Preservation of sufficiency relations is part of the equivalence definition.

- Sufficiency - A key functional relation, generalizing direct sufficiency. Defining an appropriate notion of sufficiency is a major focus.

- Conservative extension - A type of model extension that preserves certain causal information about the original model. Related to Halpern's notion of conservative equivalence.

- Structural/functional/causal equivalence - The main equivalence definitions proposed in the paper. Causal equivalence combines structural and functional equivalence.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper defines several notions of equivalence between causal models, including structural, functional, and causal equivalence. What is the motivation behind defining multiple notions rather than just one? How do they relate to and build upon one another?

2. Structural equivalence preserves relations about potential and actual joint ancestors between models. Why is it important to preserve both potential and actual ancestral relations? Provide an example illustrating their differences. 

3. Functional equivalence is defined using the notion of sufficiency between variable value sets. What were some alternatives considered for defining sufficiency and why were they rejected in favor of the chosen definition?

4. Causal equivalence combines both structural and functional equivalence. Why is it insufficient to only preserve one or the other? Provide examples where models are structurally but not functionally equivalent and vice versa. 

5. The paper argues causal equivalence gives the "right" outcome for model pairs with identical signatures, reducing to identity. What would be examples of unsatisfactory outcomes for such model pairs, and how does causal equivalence avoid them?

6. How exactly does causal equivalence for models relate to the stability of actual causation judgments across models? What are some limitations of using equivalence for understanding actual causation?

7. Conservative extension is shown to be a weaker notion than functional equivalence. What aspect of causality does conservative extension fail to capture, which functional equivalence preserves? Give an intuitive example.

8. The method relies heavily on comparing models based on their common variables. What are some challenges in extending the approach to compare models with more complex relationships between their variable sets? 

9. Actual joint ancestry is proposed to formalize context-specific ancestral relations. How does this concept improve over traditional graphical notions of ancestry when analyzing model equivalence?

10. The paper focuses only on recursive, deterministic causal models. What difficulties arise in expanding the equivalence notions developed here to cyclic or probabilistic models?
