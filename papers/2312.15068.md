# [Refining GPT-3 Embeddings with a Siamese Structure for Technical Post   Duplicate Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15068)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Duplicate questions are very common on technical forums like Stack Overflow, accounting for over 50% of posts. This causes issues such as confusing users searching for solutions, increasing moderation efforts, and reducing engagement from experts tired of answering the same questions repeatedly. However, the current voting-based system for identifying duplicate questions on Stack Overflow is inefficient and unable to keep up with the number of new posts. Many duplicates also remain unidentified. There is a need for an accurate, robust, and scalable automated approach to detect duplicate questions.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using GPT-3 embeddings with a Siamese neural network structure to create refined embeddings that can accurately capture semantic similarity and duplicate relations between forum posts. Specifically:

- GPT-3 embeddings are generated for the title and body of each post to encapsulate semantic meaning. 

- A Siamese network takes these embeddings as input and is trained on existing duplicate annotations from Stack Overflow to learn a latent contrastive embedding space. This supervision from duplicate labels helps refine the embeddings specifically for duplicate detection.

- Two loss functions, triplet loss and multiple negative ranking (MNR) loss, are used to train the Siamese network. MNR loss considers multiple negative samples and is found to work better.

- For a given post, candidate posts are ranked by their similarity in the learned embedding space instead of needing pairwise comparisons. This makes the approach scalable.

Main Contributions:

- The paper constructs a dataset of 723k duplicate post pairs from a recent Stack Overflow data dump. Analysis provides insights into duplicate characteristics.

- The proposed approach outperforms baselines by 22-35% on Top-30 accuracy using a benchmark dataset and achieves 23% Top-1 accuracy on the full dataset. Stability across topics is superior.

- Ablations show that the Siamese refinement significantly boosts performance over just using GPT-3 embeddings, especially with MNR loss. Larger batch size further helps.

- Models trained on topic-specific data outperform the model trained on all data, indicating variability in duplicate characteristics across topics.

- Manual examination reveals the potential to identify currently unlabelled duplicates. 21 unlabelled duplicates are found among 100 candidates.

The paper provides an effective approach leveraging recent advances in language models to help automatically detect duplicate questions on technical forums. The dataset, code, and insights support further research. Overall, this has the potential to greatly assist with the pressing issue of duplicate posts.
