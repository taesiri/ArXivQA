# [The Turking Test: Can Language Models Understand Instructions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11982)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:- Can language models learn to follow natural language instructions to perform new tasks, without relying solely on input-output examples? - How well does a large language model like GPT-2 perform when evaluated on the proposed "Turking Test" instruction following tasks of varying complexity?- Is instruction following a viable paradigm for enabling language models to generalize to new tasks, and how does it compare to the prevailing few-shot learning paradigm?In particular, the authors propose the "Turking Test" which examines a model's ability to follow natural language instructions to create examples for datasets like SNLI and SQuAD, as well as simpler instructions like retrieving words/characters by index. They test GPT-2 on these instruction tasks and find poor performance, indicating limitations in its instruction following abilities. The authors suggest instruction following could be a more expressive paradigm than few-shot learning, but that current LMs may need grounding beyond just the linguistic form to succeed at it. Overall, the main focus seems to be assessing and analyzing the instruction following capabilities of language models as an alternative path to generalization and multi-task learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing and evaluating the "Turking Test" - a series of tasks and benchmarks to assess a language model's ability to understand and follow natural language instructions. The key ideas are:- Instruction understanding is proposed as an alternative to few-shot learning for enabling models to generalize to new tasks. Instructions can provide more explicit guidance than just input-output examples.- The Turking Test consists of tasks like annotating datasets (SNLI, SQuAD, NewsQA), listing nouns from sentences, and retrieving words/characters by index. The instructions are based on real crowdsourcing tasks. - The large pretrained GPT-2 model performs very poorly on these instruction following tasks, even simple ones like retrieving the nth word. This suggests current LMs struggle to understand and follow instructions.- The instruction understanding paradigm is more expressive than few-shot learning. Instructions can provide negative signals on what not to do, unlike examples. But language models may need grounding beyond just the linguistic form to succeed at following instructions.So in summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating instruction understanding as an alternative paradigm to few-shot learning, using the new Turking Test benchmarks. The results demonstrate current LMs are far from succeeding at this task.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes the Turking Test to evaluate language models on their ability to follow natural language instructions of varying complexity, and finds that a large pretrained language model performs poorly across simple tasks like retrieving the nth word of a sentence.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:- The paper focuses on assessing language models' ability to understand and follow natural language instructions. This is an important direction, as being able to follow instructions flexibly is a key aspect of intelligence.- The proposed "Turking Test" is a nice way to benchmark instruction following across a variety of tasks, from simple to complex. Using crowdsourcing task instructions is clever, as these are designed for human understanding. - However, benchmarking instruction following itself is not entirely novel. There has been some prior work on evaluating models on instruction following, such as by Branavan et al. (2009) and Hu et al. (2019). The uniqueness here is in the breadth of tasks considered.- The findings reaffirm that existing language models still struggle at deeper language understanding beyond surface pattern matching. This aligns with other recent studies showing limitations of large pretrained LMs (Bender et al. 2021, Elazar et al. 2022).- The idea of instruction conditioned generation is related to work on few-shot learning, but the authors make a good point that instructions can provide richer conditioning than just a few input-output examples.- Proposing instruction following as an alternative paradigm to few-shot learning is insightful, but not entirely new either, as the idea of instruction-based learning has been explored before too (e.g., Hill et al. 2020).Overall, while not entirely groundbreaking, I think this is a thorough contribution to an important research direction. The emphasis on instructions and proposed benchmark are valuable for continued progress on language understanding in AI systems. The paper also clearly outlines the limitations of current methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Developing models that can better understand and follow natural language instructions. The authors found that the large language model they tested struggled to follow even simple instructions, indicating more work is needed in this area.- Exploring whether traditional language models like the one tested are capable of instruction understanding, or if different model architectures/objectives are needed. The poor performance on the Turking Test raises questions about the capabilities of current language models.- Training models on more data containing instructions paired with inputs/outputs, which may help models learn to follow instructions better. The authors suggest performance could improve if models saw more examples of instructions and corresponding solutions during training.- Developing models that are "grounded" in more than just linguistic inputs, perhaps through visual perception or physical interaction. The authors cite prior work suggesting language models may need grounding beyond text to achieve instruction understanding.- Applying the instruction paradigm to a wider range of tasks to further assess models' capabilities. The Turking Test explored a limited set of tasks, so expanding to more tasks could reveal more about instruction understanding.In summary, the key directions are developing models that better understand instructions, determining if current language models can achieve this, exploring grounded and multi-modal models, training on more instructional data, and comprehensive benchmarking of models' instruction following abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes the Turking Test, a series of benchmarks to assess a language model's ability to follow natural language instructions of varying complexity. The tasks range from simple linguistic exercises like writing the nth word of a sentence, to more complex tasks like generating examples for popular NLP datasets (SNLI, SQuAD, NewsQA) to simulate crowdsourcing annotations. The authors test GPT-2 on these tasks and find poor performance across the board, even on simple instructions like retrieving the nth word which only had 2% accuracy. Error analysis reveals the model tends to ignore explicit restrictions in the instructions and generate outputs unrelated to the task. The authors conclude that while traditional language models may struggle at instruction following, being able to follow instructions could greatly extend the range of tasks we can get models to perform without needing large labeled datasets. Overall the paper makes a case for instruction understanding as an appealing learning paradigm thatgeneralizes few-shot learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes the Turking Test, a series of benchmarks to evaluate a model's ability to follow natural language instructions. The tasks range from simple, such as retrieving the nth word of a sentence, to complex turking tasks like generating SNLI and SQuAD examples. Despite using a large pretrained language model (GPT-2) and a lenient evaluation methodology, the authors find poor performance across all tasks. For example, accuracy on the simple nth word task is only 2%. Analyzing the model outputs reveals several issues. The model often ignores explicit restrictions in the instructions and generates invalid outputs. It struggles with tasks that have well-defined answers compared to more open-ended tasks. The model also frequently repeats parts of the input instead of producing a valid response. While few-shot learning shows promise for quickly adapting models to new tasks, instruction following appears to be more challenging. The expressivity of instructions makes them an appealing alternative, but may require different methods like grounding in perception and interaction.
