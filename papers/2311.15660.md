# [Technical Report for Argoverse Challenges on 4D Occupancy Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15660)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a solution called Le3DE2E_Occ for 4D occupancy forecasting on the Argoverse 2 sensor dataset. The goal is to predict the evolution of the surrounding environment in the next 3 seconds based on lidar observations from the past 3 seconds. The proposed method first encodes the lidar point clouds into a 2D bird's eye view (BEV) feature map using a voxel feature encoder. It then employs a transformer-based module called OccFormer to generate voxel-wise occupancy forecasts for multiple future frames. Specifically, OccFormer uses self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to model interactions between the BEV features and learned instance queries over time. To further refine the predictions, a UNet decoder is applied on top of OccFormer's outputs. Finally, a voxel rendering step converts the 4D occupancy outputs to expected depth values along specified ray directions for evaluation. Experiments show this approach reduces the L1 error by 18% compared to the baseline on the Argoverse forecasting benchmark. Key components leading to its effectiveness are the BEV representation, Temporal fusion of frames, and the two-stage decoding strategy with OccFormer and UNet.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a LiDAR-based solution with a voxel feature encoder, DETR head, UNet decoder, and voxel rendering for 4D occupancy forecasting in autonomous driving that achieves 18% lower L1 Error than the baseline on the Argoverse 2 sensor dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a method for 4D occupancy forecasting that consists of:

1) A strong LiDAR-based Bird's Eye View (BEV) encoder with temporal fusion to encode spatial-temporal features from LiDAR point clouds.

2) A two-stage decoder that combines a DETR head and a UNet decoder to predict voxel-wise future occupancy and refine the results. 

3) Evaluating the proposed method on the Argoverse 2 sensor dataset and showing improved performance over the baseline method, with 18% lower L1 Error for 4D occupancy forecasting.

In summary, the key contribution is developing and evaluating an end-to-end learnable system Le3DE2E_Occ for lifting LiDAR to 4D occupancy forecasting that outperforms prior work. The technical novelty lies in the design choices of the BEV encoder, two-stage decoder, and method for supervising the model using rendered point clouds.
