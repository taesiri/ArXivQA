# [3D Object Visibility Prediction in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03681)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In autonomous driving, 3D bounding box (Bbox) prediction from sensors is common for object perception. Attributes like size, orientation etc. are predicted.  
- Visibility/occlusion is useful extra info but lacks clear definition and usage in 3D prediction models. Typically visibility is based on 2D image IOU, which has limitations.

Proposed Solution:
- Authors propose a new visibility definition by projecting 3D Bbox on a unit sphere centered at the ego-vehicle origin. Visibility is the unoccluded solid angle ratio.
- An algorithm is presented to calculate this visibility metric among Bboxes. Complexity is O(N^2).
- Via multi-task learning, visibility prediction is integrated into 3D detection models like PointPillars and SECOND to enhance accuracy and efficiency.

Key Contributions:
- Novel visibility definition that relies only on 3D Bbox, sensor-agnostic, more perceptually aligned.
- Algorithm to compute new visibility metric among Bboxes. 
- Multi-task learning integration shows negligible impact on detection accuracy but significantly boosts visibility prediction accuracy.
- Runtime experiments demonstrate visibility as almost "free lunch", unlike slow O(N^2) algorithm.

In summary, the paper introduces and validates a new 3D visibility attribute via an algorithm and efficient multi-task learning, providing highly useful extra info for autonomous driving systems with minimal overhead.
