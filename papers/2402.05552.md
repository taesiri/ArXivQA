# [Learning quantum Hamiltonians at any temperature in polynomial time with   Chebyshev and bit complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05552)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper considers the problem of learning local quantum Hamiltonians (specifically k-local Hamiltonians), given access to copies of their thermal Gibbs states at known inverse temperatures. The goal is to estimate the Hamiltonian parameters/coefficients, which is challenging due to the non-commutativity and non-convexity of quantum systems. 

Prior Work: 
Recent work has looked at using polynomial approximations of the matrix exponential to formulate this as a polynomial optimization problem that can be solved via semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. However, prior analyses using Taylor expansions have limitations, and the bit complexity which impacts runtime has not been fully addressed.

Key Technical Contributions:

1) The paper proposes a novel "flat" polynomial approximation of the matrix exponential based on Chebyshev series expansion, which strictly improves upon using Taylor series. This approximation satisfies boundedness properties needed for the overall algorithm.

2) Leveraging this approximation, the paper formulates the problem of learning local Hamiltonians as a polynomial optimization problem amenable to SDP relaxations. Bounds are derived on the dimensions of the SDP relaxations. 

3) The paper carefully analyzes the bit complexity for solving the SDP relaxations, highlighting challenges that arise in proving polynomial runtimes for such algorithms in general. Sufficient conditions are discussed to ensure polynomial bit complexity. 

4) Under reasonable assumptions, the paper shows that their overall algorithm for learning local Hamiltonians runs in polynomial time and sample complexity, with concrete bounds provided based on parameters of the Hamiltonian.

In summary, the key innovation is a new Chebyshev-based approximation technique for the matrix exponential that ultimately leads to an efficient algorithm for the problem of interest. Careful analysis of bit complexity and runtime is a notable contribution, motivated by limitations of prior work.
