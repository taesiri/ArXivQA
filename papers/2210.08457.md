# [Scratching Visual Transformer's Back with Uniform Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08457)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper seeks to address is: What is the role of the density of attention in Vision Transformers (ViTs)? 

Specifically, the authors examine whether ViT models learn dense or sparse attention maps, and hypothesize that ViTs have a preference for dense spatial interactions despite the difficulty of learning dense attention maps via gradient descent. To test this, they propose a simple module called Context Broadcasting (CB) that manually inserts uniform attention to supply additional dense interactions and observe if this helps ViT performance and learning.

The key hypothesis is that ViTs benefit from additional dense spatial interactions, even though dense attention maps are hard to optimize. By manually inserting uniform attention with the CB module, the authors aim to test if:

1) This reduces the density of the original attention maps, suggesting ViTs are trying hard to learn dense maps themselves. 

2) This increases model capacity and generalization ability, implying the extra dense interactions are beneficial.

In essence, the paper investigates the role of attention density in ViTs and hypothesizes dense interactions are vital yet difficult to learn, so manually adding them via the CB module should improve performance. The experiments aim to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple method called Context Broadcasting (CB) to inject dense spatial interactions into Vision Transformer (ViT) models. The key points are:

- The paper first analyzes the spatial interactions in ViT models and finds that they tend to learn dense attention maps, which are difficult to optimize. 

- The paper proposes to manually inject dense interactions by broadcasting the globally averaged token to every token. This Context Broadcasting (CB) module is very simple - just one line of code.

- Adding the CB module to ViT models is shown to reduce the density of the original attention maps. This allows the model to divert resources from learning dense attention and improves optimization and generalization.

- The CB module brings consistent gains across image classification on ImageNet and semantic segmentation on ADE20K with negligible computational overhead.

So in summary, the main contribution is a very simple and effective CB module to inject dense spatial interactions into ViTs, which improves their optimization, generalization, and performance. The simplicity and efficacy of the method is the key novelty.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:

The paper proposes a simple method called Context Broadcasting (CB) that improves Vision Transformers by explicitly supplying uniform attention to provide dense interactions between tokens, which reduces the model's need to learn dense attention maps that are difficult to optimize.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper studies the role of the density of attention in Vision Transformers (ViTs), which is a novel perspective compared to prior work. Some key differences from related work:

- Prior work has focused on the effectiveness of the long-range spatial interactions enabled by multi-head self-attention (MSA) in ViTs compared to CNNs. This paper instead looks at the density of interactions, which is orthogonal to the range. 

- It provides both empirical and theoretical motivation that ViTs have a preference for learning dense attention maps, even though they are harder to optimize. This preference has not been identified before.

- To address this mismatch between preference and difficulty of optimization, the paper proposes a simple method to explicitly provide the densest form of attention (uniform attention) to ViT models via context broadcasting. 

- This is a very lightweight and efficient way to incorporate dense interactions, requiring just 1 line of code change. Prior work on infusing dense interactions are more complex and parameter/computation heavy.

- The proposed context broadcasting module is shown to improve ViT performance across image classification and segmentation tasks. It also appears to reduce the density that the original MSA modules need to learn.

In summary, this paper provides a new view on the role of density in attention maps for ViTs, identifies the preference for dense interactions, and proposes an extremely simple and efficient way to provide them to complement the built-in MSA. The results demonstrate clear benefits across tasks. The analysis and approach are novel compared to prior work focused on interaction range or other types of architectural modifications to ViTs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other methods for infusing dense interactions into vision transformers besides their proposed Context Broadcasting (CB) module. The paper showed CB was effective, but there may be even better ways to provide transformers with dense spatial interactions.

- Studying in more depth the relationship between density and long-range dependencies in attention. The authors made a distinction between these two properties, but more work could be done to disentangle their effects. 

- Applying the ideas around providing dense interactions and uniform attention to other modalities like natural language processing, not just computer vision. The authors focused on vision transformers, but the concepts could potentially transfer.

- Developing new benchmark tasks or datasets to better analyze model robustness, especially robustness to occlusions or missing context. The paper did some initial robustness experiments, but more thorough benchmarks could be useful.

- Exploring whether CB or similar modules could help improve efficiency and reduce model size. The paper argued CB improves model generalization, but it may also have benefits for model compression or distillation.

- Studying how the CB module affects the optimization and learned representations of vision transformers in more detail via techniques like loss landscape analysis or representation similarity analysis.

- Investigating other lightweight modules like CB that could provide complementary abilities to transformers with minimal cost.

In summary, the main high-level suggestions are to further analyze dense interactions and global context in transformers, apply the ideas to new modalities and tasks, and develop complementary modules like CB that augment transformers in affordable ways.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper studies the role of density in the spatial attention of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Through analysis, the authors find that ViTs prefer to learn dense attention maps, even though they are more difficult to optimize. To address this, the paper proposes a simple module called Context Broadcasting (CB) that explicitly inserts uniform attention, the densest form of attention, into ViTs by averaging and broadcasting a context token to all spatial locations. Experiments show CB reduces the density of learned attention maps and improves generalization of ViT models on image classification and segmentation with negligible computational overhead. Overall, the module seems to allow ViTs to divert resources from learning dense attention and improve performance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper studies the role of density in the spatial attention maps learned by Vision Transformers (ViTs). The authors first analyze the entropy of attention maps in pretrained ViT models and find they tend to learn dense interactions, even though dense maps are harder to optimize. They show the gradient magnitude is greatest around uniform attention maps, making them difficult to learn. Based on this, the authors propose a simple module called Context Broadcasting (CB) to manually inject uniform attention into ViTs by adding the average pooled token to every token. Experiments show CB reduces the density of original attention maps, improves optimization, and boosts performance on image classification and segmentation with negligible cost. The module seems to allow ViTs to divert resources from learning dense maps to other signals.

In more detail, the authors first motivate the need for dense interactions by showing ViTs benefit more from extra spatial connections than channel connections. Analysis of attention map entropy reveals a preference for high density, with values nearing the maximum possible entropy. To explicitly provide dense interactions, CB is proposed, which simply broadcasts the averaged context token back to all tokens. This is shown to improve ImageNet accuracy and robustness for ViT models. Ablations demonstrate CB reduces attention density and maintains interaction range. The simplicity yet effectiveness of CB suggests ViTs favor dense interactions but struggle to learn them, so manually providing uniform attention via broadcasting helps optimize and improve ViTs.
