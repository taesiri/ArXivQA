# [Benchmarking of Query Strategies: Towards Future Deep Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05751)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep active learning (DAL) aims to reduce annotation costs by selectively querying informative samples to label. However, existing DAL research has two main problems:
   1) Experimental settings are not standardized, making performance comparison of methods difficult.  
   2) Most experiments only use CIFAR or MNIST datasets which are homogeneous, while practical uses need methods that work on more complex real-world datasets.

Proposed Solution: 
- Develop standardized experimental settings for DAL to enable fair benchmarking of methods.
- Evaluate various query strategies on 6 datasets, including medical images and visual inspection images, which are more complex, imbalanced and contain noisy labels. 
- Use pre-training with self-supervised learning (SimSiam) to improve DAL performance.
- Conduct verification experiments using a fully-trained model for querying to analyze effectiveness of current DAL approaches on different datasets.

Key Contributions:
- First standardized experimental settings and benchmark results for comparing DAL methods.
- Showed several query strategies are effective for medical images and visual inspection images, not just CIFAR/MNIST.
- Demonstrated self-supervised pre-training boosts DAL performance, except for visual inspection images.
- Verification experiments indicate current DAL methods have little room for improvement on homogeneous datasets like CIFAR, but significant potential for improving performance on complex real-world datasets.
- Showed need to design query strategies tailored to characteristics and purpose of target dataset.

The paper demonstrates DAL can effectively reduce annotation costs on various complex real-world datasets, not just simple homogeneous datasets, if query strategies are designed appropriately. The standardized benchmark and analyses provide a strong baseline for advancing DAL research.
