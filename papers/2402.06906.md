# [ROSE: Rotation-based Squeezing Robotic Gripper toward Universal Handling   of Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06906)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing robotic grippers have limitations in handling diverse objects with uncertainties in shape, size, surface texture, etc. 
- Soft grippers offer better adaptability but face challenges in dexterity, durability, and ease of control.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ROSE, a novel soft gripper inspired by a blooming rose. 
- It has a funnel-like deformable thin membrane that can embrace objects of various shapes and sizes. 
- By simply rotating the base, the membrane buckles around the object, squeezing and grasping it gently.

Design and Fabrication:
- ROSE has a simple symmetrical structure with customizable rigid parts and a soft silicone skin.
- It can be easily fabricated using 3D printing and molding. The gripper is highly scalable in size.

Working Principle:
- Approaching the target object -> Rotating the base to deform the skin -> Squeezing and lifting the object
- Large contact area leads to low grip pressure, protecting fragile objects.

Experiments and Results:  
- Lifting capacity of 33 kgf, payload-to-weight ratio of 6812%
- Successfully manipulated various objects like fruits, cans, raw eggs etc.
- Picked up egg submerged in olive oil showcasing adaptability
- Withstood 400,000 open-close trials showing exceptional durability

Contributions:
- Novel soft gripper design with rotation-based squeezing mechanism
- High customizability, durability, universal grasping ability
- Analytical models to estimate grip pressure and skin strain
- Concept for integrating tactile sensing using skin markers 

The paper demonstrates a novel, practical and high-performance soft gripper for potential applications in various manipulation tasks. Key highlights are the bio-inspired design, gentle grasping and exceptional durability.
