# [Emergent Correspondence from Image Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03881)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question this paper aims to address is whether image diffusion models can learn correspondences between images without any explicit supervision. Specifically, the paper investigates whether the features learned by diffusion models during the image generation process contain implicit knowledge about correspondence that can be extracted and applied to matching real images. The key hypothesis is that the denoising process of diffusion models requires implicitly modeling correspondences between noisy and clean images in order to generate high-quality results. To test this hypothesis, the authors propose a simple strategy called DIFT (Diffusion Features) to extract features from pre-trained diffusion models and use them for correspondence tasks on real images, without any fine-tuning or task-specific training. Through experiments on semantic, geometric, and temporal correspondence benchmarks, they demonstrate that the proposed DIFT features establish accurate correspondences, outperforming prior self-supervised and weakly supervised methods.In summary, the central question is whether correspondence emerges in diffusion models without explicit supervision, and the key hypothesis is that the denoising process requires modeling correspondences, allowing extraction of DIFT features that enable correspondence on real images despite no correspondence-based training. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.
