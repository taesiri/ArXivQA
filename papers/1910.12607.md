# [Generative Pre-Training for Speech with Autoregressive Predictive Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12607)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can autoregressive predictive coding (APC) serve as an effective generative pre-training approach for learning general and transferable speech representations?The authors propose using APC, a self-supervised learning technique, to pre-train representations from unlabeled speech data. They hypothesize that the representations learned by APC will be:1) General - containing diverse information about various speech characteristics like phonetic content, speaker traits, etc.2) Transferable - applicable to a wide range of downstream speech tasks, even if the tasks require different aspects of speech information.They test this hypothesis by pre-training APC models and then fine-tuning them on three different speech tasks: speech recognition, speech translation, and speaker identification. Their goal is to demonstrate that APC pre-training can improve performance across all three very different tasks compared to baselines, indicating the generality and transferability of the learned representations.In summary, the central research question is whether APC can serve as an effective generative pre-training technique for learning general and transferable speech representations, which is tested through transfer learning experiments on diverse speech tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing autoregressive predictive coding (APC) as an effective generative pre-training approach for learning transferable speech representations. Specifically:- They show that APC can be used to pre-train features extractors on large amounts of unlabeled speech data. The learned representations capture meaningful information about speech and are transferable to various downstream tasks.- They demonstrate the effectiveness of APC pre-training on three important speech tasks - speech recognition, speech translation, and speaker identification. APC outperforms other representation learning methods like CPC and PASE on all three tasks.- They explore using Transformers to model APC and find it works better than RNNs.- They analyze APC under low-resource scenarios and show it is effective at reducing the amount of labeled data and model parameters needed for downstream tasks.- Overall, the paper provides comprehensive experiments highlighting the strengths of APC as a flexible, generative pre-training approach for learning reusable speech representations. The transferability and data/model efficiency make APC appealing for many speech applications.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and thoroughly evaluating APC as an effective self-supervised pre-training framework for learning general speech representations that transfer well to various downstream tasks.
