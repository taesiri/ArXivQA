# [Generative Pre-Training for Speech with Autoregressive Predictive Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12607)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can autoregressive predictive coding (APC) serve as an effective generative pre-training approach for learning general and transferable speech representations?The authors propose using APC, a self-supervised learning technique, to pre-train representations from unlabeled speech data. They hypothesize that the representations learned by APC will be:1) General - containing diverse information about various speech characteristics like phonetic content, speaker traits, etc.2) Transferable - applicable to a wide range of downstream speech tasks, even if the tasks require different aspects of speech information.They test this hypothesis by pre-training APC models and then fine-tuning them on three different speech tasks: speech recognition, speech translation, and speaker identification. Their goal is to demonstrate that APC pre-training can improve performance across all three very different tasks compared to baselines, indicating the generality and transferability of the learned representations.In summary, the central research question is whether APC can serve as an effective generative pre-training technique for learning general and transferable speech representations, which is tested through transfer learning experiments on diverse speech tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing autoregressive predictive coding (APC) as an effective generative pre-training approach for learning transferable speech representations. Specifically:- They show that APC can be used to pre-train features extractors on large amounts of unlabeled speech data. The learned representations capture meaningful information about speech and are transferable to various downstream tasks.- They demonstrate the effectiveness of APC pre-training on three important speech tasks - speech recognition, speech translation, and speaker identification. APC outperforms other representation learning methods like CPC and PASE on all three tasks.- They explore using Transformers to model APC and find it works better than RNNs.- They analyze APC under low-resource scenarios and show it is effective at reducing the amount of labeled data and model parameters needed for downstream tasks.- Overall, the paper provides comprehensive experiments highlighting the strengths of APC as a flexible, generative pre-training approach for learning reusable speech representations. The transferability and data/model efficiency make APC appealing for many speech applications.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and thoroughly evaluating APC as an effective self-supervised pre-training framework for learning general speech representations that transfer well to various downstream tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes using autoregressive predictive coding (APC) as a self-supervised pre-training objective for learning general speech representations that transfer well to downstream tasks like speech recognition, translation, and speaker identification.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on using autoregressive predictive coding (APC) for speech representation learning compares to other related work:- It proposes using APC as a generative pre-training approach for learning general speech representations for transfer learning. Most prior work has focused on objectives aimed at removing certain variabilities like noise or speaker characteristics. The APC objective retains more information and is more flexible.- It shows APC representations outperform other popular self-supervised objectives like contrastive predictive coding (CPC) and problem-agnostic speech encoder (PASE) on a diverse set of tasks - speech recognition, translation, and speaker ID. This demonstrates the generality of APC.- It experiments with both RNN and Transformer architectures for modeling APC, finding the Transformer more effective. Much prior speech representation learning work uses RNNs as the backbone.- It shows APC can reduce the amount of labeled data and size of downstream models needed for competitive performance on speech recognition. This demonstrates the data and parameter efficiency provided by pre-trained APC representations.- The scale of pre-training data used (360 hours) is relatively small compared to more recent representation learning work in NLP that uses orders of magnitude more unlabeled data. Larger pre-training data would likely further improve APC.Overall, this paper makes a strong case for APC as an effective general speech representation learning approach via comprehensive experiments on diverse speech tasks. The results support the potential of generative pre-training objectives like APC for transfer learning in speech compared to prior discriminative objectives.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest several interesting directions for future work on autoregressive predictive coding (APC) for speech representation learning:- Fine-tuning techniques: The authors found that keeping APC weights frozen works better than updating them when training on downstream tasks. But they believe adapting the representations to the target task is more ideal. They suggest exploring more sophisticated techniques for fine-tuning APC, such as methods proposed in recent NLP research.- Architecture improvements: The Transformer model can potentially be improved for APC by modifying how positional information is injected. The authors suggest ideas from recent work on Transformers in other domains.- More pre-training data: The authors believe training APC on more unlabeled speech data could improve transfer learning results, as hinted by recent NLP models like BERT.- Other speech applications: The authors are interested in exploring APC for speech synthesis, where pre-training and transfer learning have shown promise. They suggest applying APC in speech synthesis and other speech applications.- Quantifying significance: The authors state APC outperforms other methods "significantly" in some cases. They suggest quantifying the significance in future work. In summary, the main future directions are: fine-tuning techniques, architecture improvements, using more pre-training data, applying APC to other speech tasks, and quantifying the significance of improvements. The authors are particularly interested in adapting APC better to downstream tasks and scaling up pre-training.
