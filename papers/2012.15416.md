# [Directed Beam Search: Plug-and-Play Lexically Constrained Language   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15416)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we control large transformer-based language models to generate text that meets hard lexical constraints in a plug-and-play manner, without needing to retrain the models?

Specifically, the paper proposes a method called "Directed Beam Search" (DBS) that can guide language generation models like GPT-2 to include specified words in the generated text. The key goals are for DBS to:

- Be plug-and-play, meaning it can work with pre-trained models without retraining them
- Work with large transformer models like GPT-2
- Allow controlling text generation to meet hard lexical constraints (require certain words) 
- Be suitable for general free-form text generation tasks, not just narrow domains

The paper hypothesizes that DBS can achieve these goals through its directed beam search algorithm that modifies the models' logits to encourage generating words similar to the target words, and ranks beam search candidates based on a quality score rewarding target word occurrence and fluency.

So in summary, the central research question is how to control transformer language models to meet lexical constraints in a plug-and-play manner suitable for general text generation. DBS is proposed and evaluated as a method to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Directed Beam Search (DBS), a plug-and-play method for lexically constrained language generation. Key points about DBS:

- It is a beam search method that guides language generation towards meeting lexical constraints (containing certain words). 

- It modifies the logits of a language model to increase the probability of generating words similar to the target word. 

- It uses a quality score to select beams that contain the target word while maintaining fluency.

- It is model-agnostic and can be combined with any language model without training or fine-tuning.

- It is evaluated on keyword-to-phrase generation and story generation using GPT-2, showing it can successfully guide a large pre-trained model to meet lexical constraints.

- Compared to existing methods, DBS works with transformer models, is suitable for general language generation (not just restricted domains like machine translation), and is efficient since it effectively reduces the search space.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Directed Beam Search, a simple yet effective plug-and-play method for guiding language models to generate text that contains specific words.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Directed Beam Search, a plug-and-play method for lexically constrained language generation that directs beam search towards keywords by increasing the logits of semantically similar words and selecting sequences containing the keywords while maintaining fluency.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points about how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper presents a new method called Directed Beam Search (DBS) for lexically constrained text generation. Other recent methods like CGMH and GeDi achieve similar goals, but are focused on RNN models rather than transformer models like GPT-2 which are now state-of-the-art. So DBS fills an important gap.

- Compared to other beam search methods like Grid Beam Search and Constrained Beam Search, DBS is able to handle more general language generation tasks rather than just tasks with small output spaces like machine translation. The key difference is that DBS prunes the search space more aggressively by using semantic similarity to guide towards target words.

- DBS is a plug-and-play method that can guide generation from any pre-trained language model without needing to retrain the model. This is an advantage compared to training-based methods like CTRL and SeqGAN which require expensive model training. Other plug-and-play methods like Plug and Play Language Models have focused more on soft constraints at the document level rather than hard lexical constraints.

- The authors demonstrate strong performance of DBS on GPT-2 for keyword-to-phrase generation and story generation benchmarks. The results are competitive with state-of-the-art trained models like Megatron-CTRL despite using a much smaller GPT-2 model. This shows the effectiveness of the method.

- One limitation is that DBS has only been applied to a single language model (GPT-2) so far. Testing on other models like BERT could reveal more about the general applicability. The story generation comparison is also informal - a more robust comparison on benchmark datasets would add strength.

So in summary, DBS makes an important contribution as an effective plug-and-play method for lexically constrained generation with state-of-the-art models like GPT-2. The results are very promising and compare favorably to related techniques. More rigorous testing on diverse models and datasets could further demonstrate the capabilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Evaluating DBS more formally on story generation and other language generation tasks, and comparing to other state-of-the-art methods. The authors mention deferring a more formal evaluation to future work.

- Combining DBS with other plug-and-play guidance methods for language generation. The authors suggest DBS could potentially be combined with methods that provide soft constraints.

- Applying and evaluating DBS on other large pre-trained language models besides GPT-2, such as T5, BART or GPT-3.

- Studying how the performance of DBS changes for different model sizes. The authors only experiment with the 774M parameter GPT-2 model.

- Developing methods to automatically tune the hyperparameters of DBS based on the constraints instead of manual tuning.

- Extending DBS to handle constraints beyond single word lexical constraints, such as multi-word expressions or semantic constraints.

- Comparing DBS to other beam search methods and analyzing the search space of DBS more formally.

- Developing improved techniques for dealing with out-of-vocabulary words in the language model's vocabulary.

- Evaluating the human perception of fluency and coherence of text generated by DBS compared to unconstrained text.

So in summary, the main suggestions are to conduct more thorough evaluations, explore combining DBS with other methods, apply it to other models, and extend the method to handle more complex constraints and provide more automated tuning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Directed Beam Search (DBS), a method for lexically constrained language generation that can guide large pre-trained language models like GPT-2 to generate text containing specific words, without the need to retrain the models. DBS modifies the logits of the language model to increase the probability of generating words similar to target "guide" words. It then uses a beam search to generate multiple candidate sequences which are scored based on fluency and occurrence of the guide words. DBS is evaluated on keyword-to-phrase generation and story generation tasks. Results show it can successfully guide GPT-2 to meet lexical constraints with minimal impact on fluency compared to unconstrained GPT-2, and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art non-plug-and-play models for constrained story generation. Overall, DBS provides an effective plug-and-play approach for directing language models towards hard lexical constraints for general language generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a plug-and-play method called Directed Beam Search (DBS) for controlling language generation models to produce text that contains given target keywords. DBS modifies the logits output of the language model to increase the probability of sampling words similar to the target word. It then uses beam search to generate multiple candidate sequences that are scored based on the occurrence of the target word and fluency. DBS is model-agnostic and does not require retraining. It is applied to the GPT-2 model in the paper. 

Experiments are conducted on keyword-to-phrase generation and story generation tasks. For keyword-to-phrase, DBS obtains high success rates in incorporating target words while maintaining fluency, for different hyperparameter settings. Qualitative examples comparing DBS with the Megatron-CTRL model on story generation indicate DBS can produce coherent text meeting the lexical constraints despite using a much smaller model. The proposed method provides an effective and easy way to steer language generation towards desired keywords without expensive retraining.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents Directed Beam Search (DBS), a plug-and-play method for lexically constrained language generation. DBS can guide any language model to generate text containing specific words, without needing to retrain the model. It works by first modifying the logits produced by the language model to increase the probability of generating words similar to a target word. Then it uses a beam search procedure to generate candidate sequences, ranking them based on a quality score that rewards occurrence of the target word and fluency. Guidance towards each target word is applied sequentially. DBS is evaluated on keyword-to-phrase generation using GPT-2, showing it can meet lexical constraints while maintaining fluency. It is also compared to Megatron-CTRL for story generation, producing comparable results despite using a smaller model. Overall, DBS provides an effective and general way to direct language generation models to meet hard lexical constraints in a plug-and-play manner.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of controlling large transformer-based language models to generate text that contains specific words (lexical constraints), without having to retrain or fine-tune the models. The key questions/challenges it focuses on are:

- How to guide language generation to include certain words in a plug-and-play manner, without modifying or retraining the underlying language model.

- How to apply such lexical control to large autoregressive transformer models like GPT-2, which generate text only in the forward direction.

- How to make this approach work for general free-form language generation tasks, not just constrained domains like machine translation.

- How to make the method efficient and scale to the very large search spaces of general text generation.

The main contribution is proposing a new method called Directed Beam Search (DBS) that addresses these challenges. DBS modifies the internal logits of the language model to nudge it towards generating words similar to target keywords. It uses a modified beam search to efficiently search over candidates and score them based on fluency and inclusion of keywords.

The key novelty is in adapting techniques like logit modification and beam search to work effectively for guiding large transformer models in general free-form text generation. The paper shows DBS can successfully control a 774M parameter GPT-2 model without retraining it.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Directed Beam Search method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that stochastic search methods like CGMH and Gradient-Guided Generation have shown promising results on keyword-to-phrase generation tasks using bidirectional RNN models. However, it is unclear if these methods can be successfully applied to transformer models which generate text autoregressively. Could the stochastic search strategies used in CGMH and GGG be adapted to work with transformer models? What modifications would need to be made?

2. The logit modification mechanism in Directed Beam Search increases the logits of tokens similar to the target word in the GloVe embedding space. What is the rationale behind using GloVe embeddings versus contextual representations from the transformer model itself? Could contextual representations also capture semantic similarities adequately?

3. The quality score used for ranking beam hypotheses rewards occurrence of the target word and fluency. But it does not explicitly account for semantic coherence or topicality. Could the quality score be improved by incorporating semantic similarity between the generated text and target words/topic? 

4. The ablation study shows that success rate drops significantly for lower values of the guidance strength hyperparameter lambda. What is the explanation for this sharp drop-off? Is there a way to make the performance more robust to changes in lambda?

5. The paper demonstrates DBS on open-ended generation tasks like keyword-to-phrase and story generation. Could this method work for more constrained tasks like data-to-text generation where the output space is more limited? Would adjustments to the beam search procedure be needed?

6. DBS uses a simple grid search to find optimal values of hyperparameters like lambda, beams, concurrent sequences, etc. Could more sophisticated hyperparameter optimization approaches like Bayesian optimization further improve the results?

7. The comparison between DBS+GPT-2 and Megatron-CTRL is done informally through example generations. What would a more rigorous quantitative evaluation reveal about the tradeoffs between both methods?

8. How does the computational overhead of DBS scale with the number of input keywords and length of generated text? Could optimizations like parallel beam search help improve efficiency for long text generation?

9. The paper focuses on meeting hard lexical constraints. Could DBS be extended to also handle soft constraints like sentiment, style, etc? 

10. An interesting extension would be to apply DBS for controllable generation in dialog systems. How would the beam search procedure need to be modified to maintain dialog context and consistency across multiple turns?
