# [Solving Long-run Average Reward Robust MDPs via Stochastic Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13912)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper considers the problem of solving robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) with polytopic uncertainty sets under the long-run average reward objective. RMDPs are a generalization of Markov decision processes (MDPs) where instead of precise transition probabilities, each state-action pair is assigned an uncertainty set capturing multiple possible transition probability distributions. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the worst-case expected long-run average reward over all possible choices of distributions from the uncertainty sets. Prior works on long-run average RMDPs mostly focus on RMDPs with specific types of uncertainty sets and do not provide complexity bounds or policy iteration methods.

Proposed Solution:
The key contribution is a polynomial-time reduction from long-run average polytopic RMDPs to long-run average turn-based stochastic games (TBSGs). This allows translating results on complexity and algorithms for TBSGs to the RMDP setting. Specifically:

1. The reduction shows the threshold problem for long-run average polytopic RMDPs is in NP ∩ coNP.

2. It yields a randomized sub-exponential time algorithm for solving these RMDPs by reduction to simple stochastic games.

3. It enables a policy iteration method called Robust Polytopic Policy Iteration (RPPI) for solving these RMDPs, based on policy iteration for discounted TBSGs. RPPI does not require structural assumptions like unichain or aperiodicity.

Experiments show RPPI achieves significant efficiency gains compared to value iteration baselines from prior work. RPPI can also solve multichain RMDPs to which prior methods are not applicable.

Overall, the reduction to TBSGs allows translating a range of existing complexity and algorithmic results to the long-run average polytopic RMDP setting. This leads to new insights on the complexity of these RMDPs and more efficient solution methods compared to the state-of-the-art.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel perspective on solving long-run average reward robust Markov decision processes with polytopic uncertainty sets by establishing a polynomial-time reduction to turn-based stochastic games, allowing the transfer of complexity and algorithmic results from stochastic games to robust MDPs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel perspective on solving long-run average reward robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) with polytopic uncertainty sets. Specifically, the paper shows that this problem can be reduced in polynomial time to solving long-run average reward turn-based stochastic games (TBSGs). 

The key benefits of this reduction are:

1) It allows leveraging the extensive literature on TBSGs to establish new complexity and algorithmic results for long-run average reward polytopic RMDPs. In particular, the paper shows for the first time that the threshold decision problem for these RMDPs is in NP ∩ coNP and that they admit a randomized algorithm with sub-exponential expected runtime. 

2) The reduction enables designing the first policy iteration algorithm, called Robust Polytopic Policy Iteration (RPPI), for solving long-run average reward polytopic RMDPs. Experiments demonstrate significant gains in efficiency compared to value iteration baselines.

3) RPPI does not impose structural restrictions on the RMDP, unlike prior algorithms, making it widely applicable. Experiments show it can solve multichain RMDPs, to which existing methods do not apply.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel perspective that reduces a class of RMDPs to TBSGs, enabling transfer of complexity and algorithmic results as well as design of new efficient algorithms for the RMDP setting.
