# [RCA-NOC: Relative Contrastive Alignment for Novel Object Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06299)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach called Relative Contrastive Alignment (RCA) for learning vision-language alignment to improve novel object captioning. The key idea is to leverage relative semantic relevance in a loose contrastive learning framework. Specifically, given an image, augmented tags are first extracted using CLIP to capture high-level visual concepts. Then the rank of each tag is utilized as a relevance label to contrast top-ranked relevant tags against lower-ranked irrelevant tags. This encourages compatibility between an image's regions and its relevant tags compared to irrelevant tags. To handle noisy contrastive tags, an Uncertainty-Aware Selection and Re-weighting method is introduced to filter false positives/negatives and enhance reliable samples. Experiments on Nocaps and Held-Out COCO datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach is model-agnostic and provides an effective way to achieve vision-language alignment for improving novel object captioning as well as general image captioning. Key advantages include properly leveraging relative semantics and handling noise in contrastive learning.
