# [Untangle the KNOT: Interweaving Conflicting Knowledge and Reasoning   Skills in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03577)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have limited ability to reconcile supplemental knowledge that conflicts with the knowledge in their parameters. 
- Existing benchmarks focus only on extracting conflicting knowledge, but do not test reasoning skills with conflicting knowledge.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors construct a new dataset called KNOT to test reasoning with conflicting knowledge at different levels - direct extraction (KNOT-S), explicit reasoning (KNOT-E), and implicit reasoning (KNOT-I).

- KNOT contains questions, documents with conflicting facts, and human annotations. Questions require coordinating conflicting knowledge from documents and reasoning to deduce answers.

- Experiments compare various LLMs on KNOT using prompting, decoding, and fine-tuning strategies to establish guidelines for best resolving knowledge conflicts.

Key Contributions:  
- Extend task of knowledge conflict resolution by incorporating reasoning skills at different levels.

- Construct dataset KNOT to specifically test reasoning with conflicting knowledge.

- Experiments provide empirical guidelines for selecting appropriate solutions for knowledge conflict resolution in LLMs.

In summary, this paper identifies limitations in testing knowledge conflict reconciliation in LLMs, constructs a novel benchmark to address this, and provides insights into best strategies for handling conflicting knowledge.
