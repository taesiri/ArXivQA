# [BlendFilter: Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models via   Query Generation Blending and Knowledge Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11129)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs) face challenges with complex inputs and encounter difficulties due to noisy knowledge retrieval, which hinders their effectiveness. 
- Current query augmentation methods rely on a single source of augmentation (either LLM internal knowledge or an external knowledge base). This can lead to insufficient augmentation for complex inputs.
- Existing methods also exclude the original input query and solely rely on the augmented query, which can exacerbate information loss.
- Retrieved knowledge often contains irrelevant or misleading information which can misdirect the LLM. Existing methods to mitigate this require training an extra model, which adds computational costs.

Proposed Solution - BlendFilter:
- A novel framework to enhance retrieval-augmented LLMs by integrating query generation blending and knowledge filtering.

Key Components:
1) Query Generation Blending 
     - Enriches input queries through diverse augmentation strategies to handle complex questions.
     - Incorporates both external knowledge base and internal LLM knowledge to augment the query.

2) Knowledge Filtering 
     - Aims to eliminate irrelevant retrieved knowledge, without needing an extra model.
     - Leverages the innate filtering capabilities of the LLM itself.

3) Answer Generation
     - LLM integrates the filtered knowledge with original query to generate final answer.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a query blending technique using multiple knowledge sources to enrich queries.
- Presents an effective knowledge filtering module utilizing the LLM's own capabilities. 
- Conducts extensive experiments validating performance gains over state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.
- Demonstrates generalization across various LLM backbones like GPT-3.5 Turbo, Vicuna 1.5 and Qwen-7b.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative framework, BlendFilter, that advances retrieval-augmented LLMs through integrating query blending and knowledge filtering to effectively handle complex questions and noisy knowledge.
