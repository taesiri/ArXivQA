## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method called Calibrated Adaptive Teacher (CAT) to improve the quality of pseudo-labels for self-training. The main innovation is introducing post-hoc calibration of the teacher network's predictions on target samples throughout training to address the common issue of poor calibration under domain shift. CAT consists of a teacher-student architecture with domain-adversarial feature alignment. The teacher provides calibrated confident pseudo-labels on target samples to supervise the student training. Four calibration techniques are explored, with temperature scaling and CPCS being the most effective. Extensive experiments are conducted on fault diagnosis using the challenging Paderborn University benchmark dataset. By improving calibration and, consequently, pseudo-label accuracy in target domain, CAT significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on domain adaptation tasks between different operating conditions. The proposed calibration framework is widely applicable to other self-training based UDA methods.
