# [Domain Incremental Lifelong Learning in an Open World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06555)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we build lifelong learning (LL) models that can continuously learn new tasks in an open world setting, where the model needs to handle samples from unseen tasks during testing? 

Specifically, the key hypotheses tested in this paper are:

1. Using hierarchically organized prompts to capture knowledge at different granularities (global, format-level, task-level, instance-level) can help build effective LL models.

2. Maintaining separate prompts to explicitly model unseen tasks, along with prompt keys to facilitate knowledge sharing, can improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen tasks. 

3. Combining task-specific and instance-specific components allows the model to achieve both high LL performance and the ability to handle unseen tasks.

The authors propose Diana, a dynamic architecture that uses soft prompts in a hierarchy to test these hypotheses. Diana is evaluated on two benchmark LL task sets and shown to outperform prior state-of-the-art methods, especially on unseen tasks. The central contribution is a new LL model design that can continuously learn in a more realistic open world setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new lifelong learning model called Diana for the domain incremental learning scenario. The key aspects are:

1. Diana uses a hierarchical prompt structure with four types of prompts (general, format, task, and meta prompts) to capture knowledge at different granularities. 

2. It introduces task prompt keys and meta prompt keys to facilitate knowledge sharing between tasks. The space of these keys is learned with distance-based losses.

3. Diana allocates separate task prompts to explicitly model unseen tasks. This improves the model's ability to handle samples from unseen tasks.

4. Extensive experiments show Diana outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning models, especially on unseen tasks. The ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components.

In summary, the main novelty is using the hierarchical prompt structure and dedicated modeling of unseen tasks to achieve strong lifelong learning performance, especially on unseen tasks, in the domain incremental setting. The introduction of prompt keys for knowledge sharing is also a notable contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper: 

The paper proposes Diana, a dynamic architecture-based lifelong learning model that uses hierarchically organized prompts to capture knowledge from different granularities, handles unseen tasks through dedicated prompts, and introduces prompt keys to facilitate knowledge sharing - achieving strong performance on benchmark NLP tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key things to consider when comparing this paper to other related work in domain incremental lifelong learning:

- This paper focuses specifically on the problem of domain incremental lifelong learning in an open world scenario. Many previous lifelong learning papers assume a closed world and only test on previously seen tasks. Testing on unseen tasks is more realistic but also more challenging. 

- The proposed model Diana uses a hierarchical prompt structure to capture task knowledge at different granularities. Other prompt-based lifelong learning methods like ProQA use prompts, but Diana's hierarchical design is novel. The combination of task prompts and instance prompts helps performance on both seen and unseen tasks.

- Diana explicitly handles unseen tasks by allocating separate prompts to model unseen domains. Most prior lifelong learning work does not consider unseen tasks. The ability to detect and handle unseen tasks is important for real-world application.

- Experiments show strong performance on benchmark datasets, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods on seen and unseen tasks. The gains are especially notable on unseen tasks.

- The code and data are released to facilitate reproducibility. This is an important contribution as lifelong learning research builds upon prior work.

Overall, this paper makes excellent progress on an important problem - domain incremental lifelong learning in an open world. The hierarchical prompt design and explicit handling of unseen tasks help achieve strong results that advance the state-of-the-art. Releasing code/data also enables future work to build on these contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Explore open and domain incremental lifelong learning across modalities beyond just text. The paper notes that their method is currently limited to textual inputs, but multimodal contexts (e.g. vision, audio) could provide more information for lifelong learning models. They suggest using multi-modal pre-training models to obtain robust cross-modal features for future work.

- Develop better approaches for generating pseudo out-of-distribution (OOD) samples to help models handle unseen tasks. The paper mentions allocating separate prompts to model OOD tasks, but suggests exploring improved OOD sample generation in the future. 

- Apply the model to more realistic and challenging scenarios with more tasks. The experiments in the paper cover limited numbers of tasks in each setting. Testing the approach on larger scales of tasks could better demonstrate its capabilities.

- Explore more advanced schemes to balance the properties of diversity and locality for the prompt keys. The paper analyzes the distributions quantitatively, but there is room to further improve balancing these properties.

- Investigate alternate training schemes like prompt tuning instead of full tuning of the model. The authors show full tuning works better but suggest prompt tuning may be more efficient.

- Evaluate the model on a wider range of dataset sizes and model capacities. The paper includes some analysis on model size but more extensive tests could be done.

In summary, the main future directions focus on extending the model to multimodal and more open-world scenarios, improving prompt engineering and training schemes, and more rigorous testing on diverse tasks at scale.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Diana, a novel lifelong learning model based on hierarchical prompts for the domain incremental learning scenario. Diana converts different NLP tasks into a unified sequence generation format and learns them using a prompt-enhanced pre-trained language model. Four types of prompts are used to capture knowledge at different granularities: a general prompt for all tasks, format prompts for similar formats, task prompts for each task, and meta prompts that are dynamically combined for each instance. Keys are associated with the task and meta prompts to facilitate sharing knowledge between prompts. Dedicated prompts are allocated to handle unseen tasks. Experiments on benchmark NLP datasets show Diana outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning models, especially on unseen tasks. The hierarchical prompt design enables capturing knowledge in different scopes while maintaining high lifelong learning performance and the ability to generalize to new tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper proposes Diana, a dynamic architecture-based lifelong learning model for natural language processing tasks. Diana uses a pre-trained language model and organizes four types of prompts in a hierarchical structure to capture knowledge at different granularities - a general prompt for global knowledge, format prompts for knowledge shared between tasks of the same type, task prompts for task-specific knowledge, and meta prompts that are dynamically combined for each input instance. Separate task prompts are used to handle unseen tasks. Prompt keys are introduced and optimized to determine the appropriate prompts to use for a given input. A two-stage learning process trains the prompt keys and the model. 

Paragraph 2: Diana is evaluated on two sets of NLP benchmark tasks - one using decaNLP datasets over three formats, and one using question answering datasets over three formats. Experiments show it outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning models on seen tasks for both average performance and average forgetting, especially when task IDs are not provided at test time. Diana also achieves strong performance on unseen tasks, even exceeding a multi-task learning upper bound. Ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of the hierarchical prompts and training strategies. Diana provides an effective approach for domain incremental lifelong learning in an open world setting.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Diana, a dynamic architecture-based lifelong learning model for domain incremental learning scenarios. Diana converts different NLP tasks into a unified sequence generation format and learns them using a prompt-enhanced pre-trained language model (PLM). It maintains four types of hierarchically organized prompts to capture knowledge at different granularities - a general prompt shared globally, format prompts shared between tasks of the same type, task prompts unique to each task, and meta prompts combined dynamically for each input instance. Keys are associated with task and meta prompts to facilitate prompt selection. The prompt keys are learned using distance-based losses to enforce diversity and locality properties. Scheduled sampling is used during training to alleviate exposure bias. Separate prompts are allocated to model unseen tasks and adaptive decision boundaries used during inference. Overall, the hierarchical prompt structure allows knowledge sharing while retaining task specificity, enabling high performance on both seen and unseen tasks.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes Diana, a novel lifelong learning model for natural language processing tasks. Diana uses a pre-trained language model enhanced with hierarchical prompts to incrementally learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Four types of soft prompts are utilized: a general prompt, format prompts for each task format, task prompts for each task, and meta prompts that are dynamically combined for each input instance. These prompts capture knowledge at different granularities to retain prior knowledge while learning new tasks. Task prompt keys are learned using distance-based losses to select the appropriate task-specific prompt. Scheduling sampling is used during training to mitigate exposure bias.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the Diana model proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a hierarchical prompt structure with general, format, task, and meta prompts. Why is it beneficial to represent knowledge at different levels of granularity in this way? How does this differ from other prompt-based continual learning methods?

2. The paper introduces several losses for learning good representations for the task and meta prompt keys (Eq 1, 2, 3). Explain the motivation and intended effect of each of these losses. How do they help learn useful prompt key spaces?

3. The scheduled sampling approach is used during training to transition from ground truth to inferred task identities (Eq 4). Explain why this helps prevent exposure bias. How does the schedule balance using the correct identities and those inferred from the keys?

4. The paper argues that the model can handle unseen tasks better than existing methods. What specific components allow it to do this, such as the extra format-level prompts? How do these capture knowledge about potential unseen tasks? 

5. Memory replay is commonly used in continual learning. Explain how the memory buffer is constructed in Diana and why it may be more effective than naive replay. How do the prompt keys help select diverse and useful samples?

6. The adaptive decision boundaries help detect samples from unseen tasks. How are these boundaries learned? Why is it better to learn these adaptively rather than use a fixed threshold?

7. During inference, the model constructs the prompt in a particular order (general, format, task, meta). Why is this order used? How would changing the order impact what knowledge is represented?

8. The model is evaluated on two different task sets covering multiple formats. What differences might you expect in how well it handles these different types of tasks and formats? How could it be adapted if one type was significantly worse?

9. Prompt tuning rather than full tuning of the model parameters resulted in worse performance. Why might this occur? What factors likely make full tuning necessary for good results?

10. The model assumes access to the task format as an annotation. How could the format be inferred automatically instead? What challenges would this introduce and how might the model need to be adapted?
