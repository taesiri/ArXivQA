# [Benchmarking Multi-Domain Active Learning on Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00364)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper demonstrates that traditional single-domain active learning strategies often fail in multi-domain scenarios, where the same algorithm can perform drastically differently depending on the domain composition. To facilitate research on more robust multi-domain active learning (MDAL) methods, the authors introduce a new large-scale image dataset called CLIP-GeoYFCC with natural domains based on geographical locations. Through comprehensive benchmarking on CLIP-GeoYFCC and Domainnet, another multi-domain dataset, they evaluate various domain allocation strategies integrated with standard active learning techniques. The benchmarking reveals major open challenges for MDAL: 1) there exists no strategy that consistently outperforms across diverse datasets and metrics, emphasizing the need to test algorithms on different types of multi-domain data, and 2) strategies excelling on one evaluation metric suffer significant performance compromise on other metrics, underscoring the trade-off between metrics that needs to be addressed in future work. Overall, this paper demonstrates via thorough experimentation that multi-domain data introduces new difficulties for active learning, and calls for more research attention on this practical problem.
