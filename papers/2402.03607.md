# [Improving Contextual Congruence Across Modalities for Effective   Multimodal Marketing using Knowledge-infused Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03607)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language and vision models struggle to capture holistic meaning and cross-modal semantic relationships between text and images. They miss essential contextual cues across modalities.
- Existing visual language models like LLaVA, BLIP2, GPT-4 can suffer from hallucinations by making non-existent connections. 
- They are unable to assess the effectiveness of multimodal marketing campaigns.

Proposed Solution:
- Incorporate external commonsense knowledge from knowledge graphs like ConceptNet while learning representations of multimodal (text and image) content. 
- Use this knowledge-infused learning to enhance contextual congruence - the association between cues from different modalities that facilitates interpretation.
- Apply it to predict success of Kickstarter campaigns based on their multimodal content.

Key Contributions:
- Designed a framework to couple explicit commonsense knowledge with large visual language models using knowledge graphs and knowledge graph embeddings.
- Showed that incorporating knowledge reduces the semantic distance between modalities, improving contextual congruence.
- Knowledge helps models form accurate cross-modal connections, reducing hallucinations.
- Knowledge-infused models outperform baseline models in predicting success of multimodal Kickstarter campaigns.
- Provided analysis of multimodal persuasiveness and marketing campaign success using commonsense knowledge and visual language models.

In summary, the paper demonstrates an effective way to improve multimodal understanding using external knowledge. This knowledge infusion enhances contextual congruence across modalities and enables more reliable predictions for downstream applications like analyzing marketing campaign effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework to improve multimodal representations by incorporating external commonsense knowledge for more reliable prediction of effective multimodal marketing campaigns.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is developing a computational approach to capture the environmental context and congruence in multimodal online marketing content by incorporating external knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs). Specifically:

- They introduce the notion of "multimodal congruence" which measures the semantic distance between image and text representations. They show that incorporating concepts from ConceptNet as external knowledge helps reduce this distance, improving contextual congruence. 

- They design a framework that couples explicit commonsense knowledge in the form of ConceptNet with large visual language models (VLMs) to learn more contextually congruent multimodal representations.

- They demonstrate that these knowledge-infused multimodal representations help improve performance on a downstream task - predicting the success of multimodal marketing campaigns on a crowdfunding platform.

In summary, the main contribution is using external knowledge to improve contextual congruence across modalities in multimodal content, and showing this leads to better performance on a practical prediction task related to multimodal marketing campaign success.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Multimodal learning - Learning from multiple modalities like text, images, etc. The paper focuses on learning from image and text pairs.

- Knowledge graphs - External structured knowledge sources like ConceptNet that provide additional commonsense information to augment the models.

- Contextual congruence - The association or relatedness between cues from different modalities that helps capture holistic meaning. Improving contextual congruence is a goal of the paper.

- Visual language models (VLMs) - Models that jointly process vision and language inputs like LLaVA, BLIP2.

- Knowledge fusion - The technique used to integrate the external knowledge from knowledge graphs with the learned multimodal representations.

- Crowdfunding campaigns - The application domain focused on is predicting success of crowdfunding campaigns from multimodal content like images and text.

- Semantic search - Technique to identify relevant concepts from the knowledge graph given the multimodal input using sentence similarity.

So in summary - multimodal learning, knowledge graphs, contextual congruence, knowledge fusion, and application to crowdfunding campaign prediction seem to be the key terms and concepts. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "contextual congruence" to measure the association between multiple cues from different modalities. How is contextual congruence quantitatively measured in this work and what metrics are used to demonstrate that incorporating external knowledge improves contextual congruence?

2. The knowledge retrieval component in Figure 2 extracts relevant concepts from the ConceptNet knowledge graph. What technique does the paper use for efficient and semantically meaningful knowledge retrieval from the knowledge graph and why was this technique chosen?

3. The knowledge fusion layer in Figure 2 fuses the multimodal and knowledge representations using a linear layer and multi-head cross-attention. What is the motivation behind using attention mechanisms for fusing representations in this framework?

4. What were some of the key observations from the exploratory analysis in Section 4 regarding incorporating external knowledge and how did that analysis motivate the overall technical approach proposed in this work?  

5. The paper conducts error analysis in Section 6. What were some of the key sources of errors identified for the baseline models versus the knowledge-infused models? How do those error analyses shed light on the limitations of this approach?

6. What metrics were used to evaluate the predictive performance of the knowledge-infused multimodal models in Table 1? What performance improvements were observed over the baseline models without knowledge infusion?

7. The application domain in this work is predicting the success of multimodal marketing campaigns. What characteristics of this domain make it well-suited for evaluating contextual congruence of multimodal content?

8. How does the framework incorporate both implicit knowledge (from data) and explicit knowledge (from knowledge graphs) for learning multimodal representations? What is the motivation behind combining both?

9. The paper argues that incorporating external knowledge helps mitigate hallucinations in large language and vision models. Based on the examples in Table 2, how does external knowledge address the hallucination issue?

10. What are some ways the technical approach proposed in this paper could be extended or improved in future work, for example, using different knowledge retrieval methods or evaluating on additional application domains?
