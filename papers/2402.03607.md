# [Improving Contextual Congruence Across Modalities for Effective   Multimodal Marketing using Knowledge-infused Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03607)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language and vision models struggle to capture holistic meaning and cross-modal semantic relationships between text and images. They miss essential contextual cues across modalities.
- Existing visual language models like LLaVA, BLIP2, GPT-4 can suffer from hallucinations by making non-existent connections. 
- They are unable to assess the effectiveness of multimodal marketing campaigns.

Proposed Solution:
- Incorporate external commonsense knowledge from knowledge graphs like ConceptNet while learning representations of multimodal (text and image) content. 
- Use this knowledge-infused learning to enhance contextual congruence - the association between cues from different modalities that facilitates interpretation.
- Apply it to predict success of Kickstarter campaigns based on their multimodal content.

Key Contributions:
- Designed a framework to couple explicit commonsense knowledge with large visual language models using knowledge graphs and knowledge graph embeddings.
- Showed that incorporating knowledge reduces the semantic distance between modalities, improving contextual congruence.
- Knowledge helps models form accurate cross-modal connections, reducing hallucinations.
- Knowledge-infused models outperform baseline models in predicting success of multimodal Kickstarter campaigns.
- Provided analysis of multimodal persuasiveness and marketing campaign success using commonsense knowledge and visual language models.

In summary, the paper demonstrates an effective way to improve multimodal understanding using external knowledge. This knowledge infusion enhances contextual congruence across modalities and enables more reliable predictions for downstream applications like analyzing marketing campaign effectiveness.
