# [Hoechst Is All You Need: Lymphocyte Classification with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04388)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether it is possible to accurately identify CD3, CD8 and CD20 expressing lymphocytes from common and inexpensive stains like Hoechst 33342, rather than requiring more expensive and time-consuming protocols like multiplex immunofluorescence. Specifically, the authors investigate whether a deep convolutional neural network can learn to differentiate between lymphocyte subtypes expressing these different proteins, based only on morphological features visible in Hoechst stained tissue. The key hypothesis is that there exist previously unknown morphological features in Hoechst stained cells associated with the expression of CD3, CD8 and CD20, which can be used by a neural network to accurately classify lymphocyte subtypes.
