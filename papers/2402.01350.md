# [pFedMoE: Data-Level Personalization with Mixture of Experts for   Model-Heterogeneous Personalized Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Federated learning (FL) faces challenges related to heterogeneous data distributions across clients (data heterogeneity), diverse system capabilities of clients (system heterogeneity), and clients having different model structures (model heterogeneity). Existing model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning (MHPFL) methods have limitations in ensuring data/model privacy, achieving high model performance, and keeping communication/computation costs low. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new MHPFL method called pFedMoE that achieves personalized federated learning through a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach. The key ideas are:

1) Each client's local model comprises a small global feature extractor (global expert), the feature extractor of a large local model (local expert), and a gating network. Together they form an MoE to extract both global and personalized features. 

2) The gating network produces personalized weights for the representations from the two experts, enabling adaptive fusion of global and local features based on each sample.

3) The mixed representation is fed to the local model's classifier to make predictions. The MoE and classifier are trained jointly.

4) Only the small global feature extractors are exchanged between clients and the server to share knowledge while preserving privacy.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a new method pFedMoE that achieves personalization at a fine-grained data level to address various heterogeneities in federated learning.

- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while keeping communication and computation costs low. Improves accuracy by up to 2.8% over best existing method.

- Enhances local model personalization through the personalized gating network in the MoE, while supporting client model heterogeneity.

- Provides theoretical analysis to prove the convergence guarantee of the algorithm.

In summary, pFedMoE introduces an innovative MoE approach to model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning to adapt models to local data distributions, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a personalized federated learning approach called pFedMoE that uses a mixture of experts model to balance generalization and personalization by mixing representations from a shared small feature extractor and heterogeneous large feature extractors adapted to each client's local data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new federated learning algorithm called pFedMoE that enhances personalization at the data level to address data heterogeneity and support model heterogeneity. Specifically:

- pFedMoE assigns a shared homogeneous small feature extractor (global expert) and a local heterogeneous large model's feature extractor (local expert) to each client, along with a local gating network. These form a local mixture of experts (MoE) that fuses generalized and personalized features.

- The localized MoE extracts both global generalized and local personalized representations on each local data sample. The gating network produces personalized weights to mix these representations. This achieves data-level personalization.

- Only the small homogeneous feature extractors are shared between clients and the server to enable knowledge transfer while preserving privacy. The heterogeneous large models remain localized.

- Theoretical analysis proves the convergence of pFedMoE. Experiments show it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with lower computation and acceptable communication overhead.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a personalized federated learning approach using a localized mixture of experts to achieve fine-grained, data-level personalization while supporting model heterogeneity across clients.
