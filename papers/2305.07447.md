# [Universal Source Separation with Weakly Labelled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07447)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to build a universal audio source separation system that can separate arbitrary sounds using only weakly labeled training data. The key points are:- Most prior work focuses on separating specific sound sources like speech or music. This paper proposes a framework for universal source separation that can handle hundreds of sound classes using a single model.- Previous methods rely on clean source data for training. This paper proposes using only weakly labeled data like AudioSet where the recordings have tags but no isolated sources.- The paper proposes an approach with 1) a sound event detection model to locate anchor segments likely to contain target sounds, 2) an audio tagging model to generate embedding vectors that indicate the desired source to separate, and 3) a conditional separation model that takes the mixture and embedding as input to output the target source waveform.- The system is evaluated on separating sounds from AudioSet and also tested on various tasks like music separation and speech enhancement without being trained on those specific datasets. This demonstrates the generalization of the universal separation approach.So in summary, the key hypothesis is that a universal source separation system can be trained on weakly labeled data alone and generalize to separating a wide variety of sounds, which is validated through the experiments in the paper.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a universal source separation (USS) framework that can be trained using only weakly labeled audio data such as AudioSet. Previous source separation systems typically require clean source audio data for training. 2. Using a sound event detection (SED) system to mine "anchor segments" from weakly labeled audio clips that likely contain the target sound event. These segments are then mixed to create training data for the USS system.3. Investigating different choices for the "query net" that produces the conditioning signal for the USS system, including audio tagging predictions and embeddings.4. Proposing a hierarchical USS strategy to automatically detect and separate sound events present in an audio clip using the ontology structure of AudioSet.5. Evaluating the proposed USS framework on a diverse range of source separation tasks including sound event separation, music source separation, and speech enhancement. The USS system achieves competitive performance on these tasks despite being trained only on weakly labeled web audio data.6. Providing comprehensive ablation studies analyzing the impact of different design choices such as query nets, anchor mining strategies, segment durations, architectures, and training data.In summary, the key innovation is developing a USS framework that can leverage weakly labeled audio at scale to separate a wide variety of sound sources without needing cleanly labeled data. The proposed techniques help overcome the limitations of previous source separation systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a universal audio source separation framework that uses a weakly labeled dataset to train an audio tagging model to detect anchor segments likely containing target sounds, extracts embeddings from the anchor segments as conditions, and separates arbitrary sounds from mixtures using a conditional source separation model.
