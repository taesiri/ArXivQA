# [A Group Theoretic Metric for Robot State Estimation Leveraging Chebyshev   Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17463)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of a unified metric to evaluate the accuracy of state estimation algorithms that take into account all aspects of the state vector, including pose, velocity, etc. Existing metrics focus mainly on pose accuracy from visual SLAM and don't consider velocity estimates.

- obtaining ground truth velocity data from hardware experiments is difficult. Common methods like finite differences of motion capture positions are prone to noise.

Proposed Solutions:

1. Absolute State Error (ASE) metric:
- Leverages the SE2(3) Lie group to define a metric that encapsulates rotation, translation and linear velocity errors into a single value.

- Computed in a similar form to the existing Absolute Trajectory Error metric, allowing easy integration with current libraries.

- Can accurately capture performance differences between state estimation approaches.

2. Computing ground truth velocities:  
- Proposes using interpolation with Chebyshev polynomials for computing velocity from motion capture positions. 

- Leverages differentiation via interpolation and spectral methods to get accurate velocity estimates.

- Experimentally validated to have lower errors compared to finite differences, and the pseudospectral representation provides trajectory compression.

Main Contributions:

- First unified metric to evaluate overall accuracy of state estimators on hardware.

- Method to accurately obtain ground truth linear velocities from motion capture data using function approximation concepts.

- Experimental validation of both contributions on autonomous driving and legged robot platforms.

The key novelty is a practical metric and method to better benchmark robot state estimation algorithms by considering all components of the typically used state vector.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new metric called Absolute State Error for evaluating robot state estimation that considers pose, linear velocity, and angular velocity jointly by leveraging the SE2(3) Lie group and computes linear velocity ground truth via Chebyshev polynomial interpolation for trajectory differentiation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new metric called the Absolute State Error (ASE) for evaluating robot state estimation algorithms. The key aspects of this metric are:

1) It takes into account all components of the generalized state vector - orientation, position, and linear velocity. This provides a more comprehensive evaluation compared to prior metrics like ATE and RPE that only consider pose. 

2) It leverages the SE_2(3) Lie group structure to represent the state. This makes the metric computation elegant and easy to incorporate into existing libraries.

3) The paper also proposes using Chebyshev polynomial interpolation to compute the ground truth linear velocity from motion capture position data. This facilitates collection of all components of ground truth state for metric calculation.

In summary, the paper provides a singular, easy-to-compute metric to evaluate overall state estimation performance, while also addressing the issue of acquiring ground truth velocity data. This enables more standardized benchmarking of state estimation algorithms.
