# [CDGP: Automatic Cloze Distractor Generation based on Pre-trained   Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10326)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Manually designing cloze tests (fill-in-the-blank questions) with good wrong answer options (distractors) is very time-consuming. Finding good distractors is a major challenge.
- Previous automatic distractor generation methods have limitations in quality and generalization.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new framework called CDGP for automatic distractor generation using pre-trained language models (PLMs). 
- The framework has two main stages - Candidate Set Generator (CSG) and Distractor Selector (DS).
- CSG generates distractor candidates using PLMs fine-tuned on cloze questions. Explore two fine-tuning strategies (naive and answer-relating).
- DS ranks the candidates using confidence scores from CSG and other similarity features.

Key Contributions:
- Show that PLM-based CSG significantly outperforms prior knowledge-based methods for candidate generation.
- Achieve new state-of-the-art results on two cloze test benchmarks, improving NDCG@10 by 77% on one dataset. 
- Experiments show domain-specific PLMs like SciBERT perform best when domains match between pre-training and end task.
- Ablation studies demonstrate the efficacy of both modules of the proposed CDGP framework.
- Human evaluation shows quality of generated distractors is close to human-authored ones.

In summary, the paper presents a novel PLM-based framework for automatic high-quality distractor generation for cloze questions, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Both algorithmic evaluations and human studies demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an automatic cloze distractor generation framework called CDGP which incorporates pre-trained language models and ranking strategies to generate high-quality distractors for cloze questions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Showing that PLM-based methods bring significant performance improvement over knowledge-driven methods for generating cloze test distractors. The experiments demonstrate that using PLMs as an alternative for candidate distractor generation substantially outperforms prior knowledge-based approaches.

2) Conducting evaluation on two benchmarking datasets (DGen and CLOTH) and advancing the state-of-the-art results. Specifically, the proposed CDGP model improves the NDCG@10 score on the DGen dataset from 19.31 to 34.17, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 77%.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing a PLM-based framework (CDGP) for automatic cloze distractor generation and demonstrating through experiments that it significantly improves performance over prior methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results on two datasets.

It compares against previous knowledge-based methods, and demonstrates improved performance on cloze test datasets. The key focus is on leveraging recent PLMs for the distractor generation task.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Cloze Distractor Generation framework called CDGP. What are the two key components of this framework and what role does each component play?

2. The Candidate Set Generator (CSG) component uses pre-trained language models (PLMs) to generate distractor candidates. The paper explores two different fine-tuning strategies - naive and answer-relating. Can you explain the difference between these two strategies and which one was found to work better?  

3. The paper experiments with different PLMs like BERT, SciBERT, RoBERTa and BART for the CSG component. Which PLM was found to work the best on the CLOTH dataset? Why do you think this is the case?

4. The Distractor Selector (DS) component uses four different scoring factors to select the final distractors - confidence score, word embedding similarity, contextual sentence similarity and POS match score. Can you explain what each of these scoring factors capture in selecting good distractors? 

5. The paper conducts an ablation study by removing different components of the framework. What was the impact on performance when only CSG or only DS was used? What does this indicate about the contribution of each component?

6. One finding from the DGen dataset experiments was that SciBERT performs the best, even better than BERT. What is SciBERT and why does it make sense that SciBERT would work better for the DGen dataset?

7. The human evaluation reveals that the answering correct rate is higher for CDGP generated questions compared to human authored ones. What could be some reasons for why the CDGP distractors seem easier for humans?

8. What automatic evaluation metrics are used in the paper for evaluating distractor quality? Can you think of any limitations of relying only on such automatic metrics? 

9. The paper compares CDGP against previous state-of-the-art methods that use knowledge bases like WordNet and Probase to generate candidates. Why is using PLMs a better alternative? What unique advantages do PLMs provide?

10. Can you think of some ways the CDGP framework can be extended or improved further? What experiments would you suggest to establish the efficacy of those improvements?
