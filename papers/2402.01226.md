# [HW-SW Optimization of DNNs for Privacy-preserving People Counting on   Low-resolution Infrared Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01226)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- People counting in public/private spaces is important for monitoring occupancy and flows. Video-based solutions raise privacy concerns due to capturing visual details. Low-resolution infrared (IR) arrays enable privacy-preserving counting but optimizing DNNs for them is challenging. Prior work relies on manual and coarse-grain search, leading to suboptimal accuracy vs hardware cost tradeoffs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an automated full-stack optimization flow, from neural architecture search (NAS) to hardware-software co-design of a novel IR sensor prototype with DNN acceleration support.

Key Contributions:
- Complexity-aware differentiable NAS to automatically explore DNN architectures for the IR-based counting task, using a seed model from prior work. Achieves up to 89x parameter reduction at iso-accuracy.
- Mixed-precision quantization, down to 4-8 bits, of Pareto-optimal NAS models. Further improves accuracy and reduces model size up to 2.3x. 
- Majority vote post-processing to exploit temporal correlation and improve accuracy by up to 6.7% with negligible overhead.
- A novel IR sensor, MAUPITI, with a customized RISC-V core supporting 4x4 and 8x8 SIMD instructions to accelerate low-precision DNNs. Reduces code size by 23.8x and energy by 15.38x versus prior work.

- Overall, the proposed optimization flow generates a rich set of DNN solutions from NAS to hardware deployment, achieving up to 4.2x model size reduction, 23.8x code size reduction, 15.38x energy reduction at iso-accuracy over the state-of-the-art.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a full-stack optimization flow from neural architecture search down to hardware deployment. What are the key components of this flow and how do they connect together? 

2. The paper utilizes a mask-based differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) method called PIT. How does this method work compared to other DNAS techniques? What are the main benefits of using a mask-based approach?

3. The paper explores mixed-precision quantization with 4-bit and 8-bit integers. What is the motivation behind using a mixed-precision scheme instead of a uniform low precision across all layers? How is the precision assignment done in this work?

4. The paper introduces a simple yet effective post-processing technique called mode inference or majority voting. What is the intuition behind this method and how does it provide benefits in terms of accuracy? What are the memory and computational overheads?

5. The customized RISC-V core called MAUPITI adds support for 4x4-bit and 8x8-bit vector MAC operations. What modifications were done to the decoder, register file, and arithmetic pipeline compared to the baseline IBEX core?

6. What simplifications were made in the MAUPITI ISA extensions compared to state-of-the-art solutions like pulp-nn to minimize area overheads? What is the area overhead reported for these extensions?

7. The paper compares deployment results on the MAUPITI core against an unmodified IBEX and a commercial ARM Cortex M4 core. What benefits does MAUPITI provide in terms of code size, memory usage and energy efficiency?

8. When comparing the accuracy-memory Pareto front with prior state-of-the-art, where does the method proposed in this paper do better and where does it fall slightly short? What are possible reasons?

9. If the resolution of the infrared sensor array was increased from 8x8 to 16x16, how would you expect the exploration results to change? Would the benefits of the proposed flow be higher or lower?

10. The current hardware prototype operates at 20 MHz clock frequency. If the target frequency was increased to 100 MHz, what types of modifications would need to be made to sustain the throughput requirements?
