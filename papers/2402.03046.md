# [Open RL Benchmark: Comprehensive Tracked Experiments for Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03046)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Reproducing reinforcement learning (RL) experiments is challenging due to limited data access and code sharing. Minor implementation details significantly impact results. 
- Inconsistent presentation of results (e.g. for learning curves) makes interpretation difficult and can lead to incorrect conclusions.
- There is insufficient availability of raw learning data, despite some positive efforts.
- Method reproducibility faces challenges like evolving codebases and dependencies.

Proposed Solution - Open RL Benchmark:
- Provides a vast collection of over 25,000 tracked RL experiments spanning algorithms, libraries and benchmarks.
- Captures comprehensive metrics and raw data to enable precise reproduction, including method-specific losses, system metrics etc.
- Comes with command-line interface (CLI) to easily generate paper-ready figures from the data.
- Is community-driven allowing contributions and access.

Main Contributions:
- Extensive dataset with over 8 years of tracked experiments. Sets new norm of relying on existing data.  
- Standardization through consistent metrics tracked across libraries.
- Reproducibility by providing all dependencies and command lines.
- Resource for research through easy data access and contribution.
- Facilitates exploration and evaluation of new methods.

The paper also examines current practices regarding result presentation, data sharing and reproducibility in RL research. It identifies critical gaps such as inconsistent learning curve presentation practices and limited raw data availability. The proposed Open RL Benchmark intends to address these gaps through its comprehensive dataset and tools. Two case studies demonstrate the benchmark's usefulness in comparing methods and presenting results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

Open RL Benchmark introduces a large, community-driven collection of over 25,000 fully tracked RL experiments spanning multiple algorithms and libraries, with comprehensive metrics and tools to enhance reproducibility, analysis, and collaborative research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is introducing Open RL Benchmark, which is a large and comprehensive dataset of tracked reinforcement learning experiments. The key aspects of Open RL Benchmark highlighted in the paper are:

- It offers an extensive collection of RL runs, covering various algorithms, libraries, and environments, with over 25,000 runs tracked so far.

- It establishes a new standard by encouraging reliance on existing data rather than rerunning baselines, thus saving time and resources. 

- It provides comprehensive metrics beyond just episodic returns, including method-specific metrics, configuration parameters, and system metrics. This allows detailed analysis.

- It emphasizes reproducibility by providing all necessary details like dependencies and commands to accurately replicate experiments.

- It comes with a CLI and API access for easy data fetching and visualization.

- It is a community-driven and collaborative benchmark that anyone can contribute to and enhance. 

In summary, the main contribution is introducing this large, comprehensive, reproducible and community-driven RL benchmark dataset to facilitate and accelerate RL research. The paper also demonstrates its usefulness through case studies.
