# [Satellite Imagery and AI: A New Era in Ocean Conservation, from Research   to Deployment and Impact](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03207)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents novel computer vision models for detecting vessels in real-time using publicly available satellite imagery from NASA and ESA. The goal is to provide a scalable platform called Skylight to monitor illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing worldwide. Three specialized models are introduced - using synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1), optical imagery (Sentinel-2), and nighttime imagery (VIIRS) - each addressing the unique challenges of different imaging modalities. Hybrid approaches combining classical computer vision and deep learning are employed to optimize performance under constraints like limited spatial resolution. The models exhibit strong offline performance but required additional tuning when deployed in a real-time setting. Best practices are provided for developing production-ready computer vision services, emphasizing the importance of transparency, continual upgrading, and reliability to build user trust. By providing the models and Skylight platform openly and freely, the authors aim to promote ocean conservation and sustainability for all countries.
