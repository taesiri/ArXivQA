# [SVFAP: Self-supervised Video Facial Affect Perceiver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00416)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Video-based facial affect analysis aims to automatically detect and understand human emotions from facial videos. It has great potential for human-computer interaction systems. However, supervised deep learning methods suffer from overfitting due to limited labeled training data and label noise. Besides, collecting large-scale high-quality labeled facial video data is extremely difficult and expensive. These issues severely hinder the development of video-based facial affect analysis.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a self-supervised learning method called Self-supervised Video Facial Affect Perceiver (SVFAP) to address the dilemma faced by supervised methods. SVFAP utilizes masked facial video autoencoding as a pretext task to perform self-supervised pre-training on a large amount of unlabeled facial videos. An asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture is adopted to enable efficient pre-training. To reduce spatial and temporal redundancy, a novel Temporal Pyramid and Spatial Bottleneck Transformer (TPSBT) is designed as the encoder. After pre-training, the lightweight decoder is discarded and the high-capacity encoder is fine-tuned on downstream facial affect analysis tasks.

Main Contributions:
1) Introduces self-supervised learning to video-based facial affect analysis and shows its effectiveness.
2) Proposes a TPSBT model to reduce spatiotemporal redundancy in facial videos, enabling both efficient pre-training and fine-tuning.
3) Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 9 datasets over 3 downstream tasks, including expression recognition, emotion regression/classification, and personality recognition. Demonstrates the strong generalization ability of SVFAP.

In summary, this paper presents an effective self-supervised video facial affect analysis framework to overcome the data scarcity issue faced by supervised methods. Both model design and comprehensive experiments verify its efficiency and effectiveness.
