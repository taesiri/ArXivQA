# [Uncertainty-Aware Relational Graph Neural Network for Few-Shot Knowledge   Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04521)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge graphs (KGs) suffer from incompleteness, with many missing facts (triples). The knowledge graph completion task aims to infer these missing triples.
- However, many relations in KGs have insufficient triples, making traditional completion methods ineffective. Therefore, the few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) task has gained attention, which predicts missing triples given only a few reference triples of a relation.
- Existing FKGC methods neglect the inherent uncertainty of entities and triples, which limits their capability to fully utilize the few available reference triples. Modeling uncertainty is vital for FKGC but still underexplored.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper proposes a novel uncertainty-aware framework for FKGC (UFKGC) to model uncertainty for better understanding and leveraging of limited data. 
- Uncertainty representation uses Gaussian distributions to model uncertainty of entities/relations. Uncertainty estimation further quantifies uncertainty scope based on variance.
- An uncertainty-aware relational graph neural network (UR-GNN) integrates entity features using convolution over Gaussian distributions. Variance-based attention assigns varied neighbor weights.  
- Uncertainty optimization employs multiple sampling for references, and jointly optimizes completion loss, uncertainty mutual information loss and KL divergence loss.

Main Contributions:
- First work to model inherent uncertainty of entities/triples in FKGC, enabling better exploitation of limited reference triples.
- Novel UR-GNN to integrate entity features and neighborhood uncertainty information.
- Uncertainty optimization strategy, using sampling and custom loss terms, to improve robustness.  
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark FKGC datasets, demonstrating efficacy of modeling uncertainty.
