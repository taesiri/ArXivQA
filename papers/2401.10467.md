# [Learning Backdoors for Mixed Integer Programs with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10467)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Finding high-quality backdoors, small sets of variables in mixed integer programs (MIPs) that lead to faster solve times when prioritized for branching, remains an open challenge. Previous work either uses random sampling which is inconsistent or relies on expensive methods like Monte-Carlo tree search. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel contrastive learning framework to predict effective backdoors for MIPs. The key ideas are:

1) Use Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) to collect higher quality backdoor training data compared to random sampling. MCTS balances exploration and exploitation to find better backdoors.

2) Represent MIP instances as bipartite graphs with variables and constraints as nodes. Use a graph attention network (GAT) to score each variable as the policy network.

3) Train the GAT with a contrastive loss that brings embeddings for good backdoors (positive samples) closer and bad backdoors (negative samples) farther apart in the embedding space. Good backdoors are those with fast solve times and bad ones look similar but have worse solve times.

4) At test time, greedily pick variables with top scores from GAT to form the predicted backdoor.

Main Contributions:

- First application of contrastive learning for predicting backdoors for MIPs

- Use of MCTS for improved quality of training data collection

- Consistent performance improvements over baselines like Gurobi and prior supervised learning model on multiple MIP domains

- Good generalizability to larger problem instances than those used during training

The contrastive learning framework is more sample efficient, less expensive to train and also reduces randomness compared to prior approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a contrastive learning framework using a graph attention network to predict effective backdoors for mixed integer programs, where backdoors are small sets of variables that can speed up solving when prioritized in branching.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel learning framework to predict effective backdoors for mixed integer programs (MIPs) using contrastive learning. Specifically:

1) It utilizes a Monte-Carlo tree search method to collect higher quality training data of backdoors compared to previous random sampling methods. 

2) It adapts a contrastive learning framework, where backdoors with faster solving times are treated as positive samples and those with slower times that are similar to the positive ones are treated as negative samples. A graph attention network is trained with a contrastive loss to predict backdoors.

3) Empirical evaluation on four common MIP problem domains shows the proposed method achieves faster solve times than both the Gurobi solver and previous learning-based methods for predicting backdoors. The method also generalizes well when trained on small instances and tested on larger instances.

In summary, the key innovation is using contrastive learning and higher quality training data to effectively predict good backdoors that can speed up solving MIPs. This provides a new direction for learning to find good heuristics to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems.

It utilizes MCTS to collect higher quality training data compared to previous approaches. The method represents MIPs as bipartite graphs and uses a graph attention network model trained with a contrastive loss. Experiments are conducted on GISP, SC, CA, and MIS benchmark instances.
