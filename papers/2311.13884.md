# [Controlling Large Language Model-based Agents for Large-Scale   Decision-Making: An Actor-Critic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13884)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel framework called LLaMAC that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance coordination and decision-making in complex multi-agent systems (MAS). As the number of agents increases, challenges like the exponential growth of joint action spaces, hallucinations in LLMs, and efficient token utilization become more pronounced. LLaMAC addresses these through a modular actor-critic structure consisting of decentralized LLM-based actors and a centralized critic coordinator. The critic incorporates a TripletCritic mechanism with internal feedback for robust policy suggestions. An external feedback loop between actors and critic further refines suggestions. Evaluated on system resource allocation and multi-step grid transportation tasks, LLaMAC demonstrates superior performance over existing methods in success rate, planning steps, feedback iterations, and token efficiency. Key capabilities exhibited include long-term planning, mathematical reasoning, spatial reasoning, and learning from mistakes. By effectively augmenting LLM reasoning and coordination, LLaMAC advances the state-of-the-art in large-scale multi-agent decision making.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel framework called LLaMAC (Large Language Model-based Actor-Critic) to enhance the collaborative performance of large-scale multi-agent systems based on Large Language Models. Specifically:

1) It proposes a TripletCritic structure with internal feedback mechanism to coordinate multiple critics and mitigate hallucination issues of LLMs. This enhances the feasibility and robustness of the initial policy suggestions.

2) It establishes a comprehensive external feedback mechanism from actors to the critic to further improve the suggestions and reduce access costs of LLMs in large-scale scenarios. 

3) It incorporates mechanisms like redundant memory deletion and external feedback judgement to construct a token-efficient planning framework.

4) It evaluates LLaMAC on system resource allocation and grid transportation tasks, showing superior performance over existing methods in terms of success rate, steps to completion, feedback iterations and token utilization efficiency.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a stable, efficient and modular framework LLaMAC that effectively enhances the reasoning, planning and coordination capabilities of large-scale multi-agent systems based on LLMs.
