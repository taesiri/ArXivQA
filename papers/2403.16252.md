# [Legged Robot State Estimation within Non-inertial Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16252)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
This paper tackles the problem of state estimation for legged robots operating inside non-inertial environments such as ships, underwater vehicles, and public transit vehicles. These environments exhibit continuous multi-directional motion which breaks the common assumption of a static ground made by existing state estimation approaches. Further, these environments are typically GPS-denied and enclosed, preventing access to environmental landmarks. Therefore, the paper focuses on real-time state estimation to enable legged robot navigation inside a GPS-denied, enclosed, dynamically moving environment without relying on knowledge of the environment's motion.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) for estimating the robot's orientation, velocity and position relative to the non-inertial dynamic environment it is operating in. The process model underlying the filter explicitly models the unknown movement of the non-inertial environment without needing to know this movement in inertial space or rely on GPS or environmental landmarks. Further, it is shown that the process model obeys the group-affine property, leading to an exactly log-linear error dynamics independent of state trajectories. The measurement model fuses proprioceptive sensing from the robot's IMU and leg encoders with an IMU attached to the moving environment. Observability analysis confirms observability of all estimated states during environment motion.

Main Contributions:
1) Analytically extends standard leg odometry measurement model to non-inertial environments using kinetic characteristics of robot movement on an accelerating ground.
2) Formulates a group-affine process model to enable fast error convergence and exact logarithmic error dynamics of the proposed InEKF.
3) Renders the relative robot pose and velocity observable by fusing measurements from proprioceptive sensors and an IMU attached to the dynamic environment, without reliance on exteroceptive sensing.  
4) Validates the approach through real robot experiments on a pitch and sway treadmill, demonstrating high accuracy and convergence speed even under significant ground motion and large initial errors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an invariant extended Kalman filter approach for real-time estimation of a legged robot's relative pose and velocity with respect to a non-inertial environment with unknown motion, using proprioceptive sensors and an IMU attached to the environment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper include:

1) Proposing a new state estimation approach to estimate the relative pose and velocity of a legged robot moving inside a non-inertial environment. The proposed approach relaxes the common assumption that the ground is static and explicitly models the movement of the non-inertial environment in the process and measurement models without requiring knowledge of the environmental motion.

2) Formulating the process model of the proposed invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) to be group affine. This leads to log-linear error dynamics that are independent of state trajectories and exactly linear in the absence of noise.

3) Showing through observability analysis that fusing leg odometry, inertial odometry from the robot, and IMU data from the dynamic environment renders the robot's relative position, orientation, and velocity observable without relying on exteroceptive sensors like cameras.

4) Validating the proposed approach through hardware experiments on a humanoid robot moving on a rotating and translating treadmill. The results demonstrate fast error convergence and high accuracy of the proposed InEKF even under significant estimation errors and treadmill movements.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new state estimation method that can reliably estimate a legged robot's motion relative to a non-inertial, GPS-denied environment with unknown movement, using only proprioceptive sensors.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The process model in Equation (4) models the dynamics of the robot's relative orientation, position, and velocity with respect to the dynamic ground frame. How would you modify this model if the robot was walking or running instead of standing still? What additional terms would need to be incorporated?

2. In deriving the measurement model in Equations (16)-(18), the assumption is made that the stance foot has no slippage. How could the measurement model be adapted to explicitly account for foot slippage? What challenges might arise?

3. In Proposition 1, it is shown that the deterministic part of the process model is group affine. Why is this property important? How does it lead to the error dynamics in Equation (19) having desirable properties?

4. What are the specific advantages of using an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) formulation rather than a standard EKF for this problem?

5. The observability analysis in Section V shows that all states become observable during ground translation and rotation. However, certain states like position become unobservable if the ground is stationary. How might you modify the system to ensure observability of all states even when the ground is stationary?  

6. In the experiment, the filter relies on having an IMU rigidly attached to the moving ground to provide the angular velocity and linear acceleration of the dynamic ground frame. How would you modify the approach if this external IMU was not available?

7. The update matrix H(t) in Equation (14) results from linearizing a non-invariant measurement model. How might the measurement model be reformulated to make it right-invariant? What challenges would arise in doing so?

8. How might the accuracy of the state estimates produced by the filter be improved? What additional sensing modalities could be incorporated?

9. The current experiments are conducted with a robot standing on a treadmill. How would you expect the performance to change if the robot was walking/running? What modifications might be needed?

10. How could the concepts proposed in this paper be extended to estimating the state of a team of legged robots operating on a ships deck or other dynamic environments? What additional considerations would come into play?
