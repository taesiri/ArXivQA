# [MBot: A Modular Ecosystem for Scalable Robotics Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00962)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
There is a growing demand for robotics courses in higher education due to advancements in robotics and AI as well as increased industry needs. Incorporating real robot platforms into courses is effective for teaching embodied system concepts and motivating students. However, commercially available robots are often too expensive while open-source options require significant development and maintenance effort, making adoption challenging.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper presents the Michigan Robotics MBot, a modular, low-cost mobile robot platform designed for robotics education. The key principles guiding the platform's design are:

- Low cost with a basic version under $100
- Accessibility for students and instructors 
- Modular and configurable hardware
- Compatibility with advanced software tools like ROS

The MBot consists of:

- A configurable hardware design with different sensor configurations to meet cost and capability needs
- A custom control board for interfacing motors, sensors and computation
- Firmware solutions in C and MicroPython for accessibility
- A full software stack including drivers, mapping, localization and planning  
- A synchronous API and web app for simplified interaction

Over 10 years, the platform has served over 1,400 students across 6 courses, spanning introductory to advanced curricula. It has proven adaptable as both an introductory programmable robot and a platform for advanced autonomy.

Main Contributions:

- Design of a modular, configurable and low-cost mobile robot tailored for education
- Custom hardware and software solutions balancing advanced capability with accessibility
- Demonstration of using the platform to effectively teach a wide spectrum of robotics curricula 
- A platform enabling hands-on robotics instruction across multiple institutions

The work addresses the growing need for real robot platforms in higher education that are affordable, customizable and span all levels of curricula. The MBot demonstrates an effective approach for scalable hands-on robotics teaching.
