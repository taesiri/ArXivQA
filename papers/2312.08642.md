# [Metacognition-Enhanced Few-Shot Prompting With Positive Reinforcement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08642)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel metacognition-enhanced few-shot prompting (MCeFS) method to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks using only a few demonstration examples. The key idea is to guide the LLM to reflect on its own thought process in analyzing each demonstration example one-by-one, inspired by the role of metacognition in enhancing human learning. This prompts the model to gain a deeper understanding of the examples rather than just passively observing input-output pairs. Additionally, the method incorporates positive reinforcement by praising the LLM's correct analyses to further motivate its learning, like how teachers use rewards to motivate students. Experiments on two real-world aspect-based sentiment classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed MCeFS method with positive reinforcement achieves better accuracy and F1 than traditional few-shot prompting that provides all examples simultaneously. By eliciting autonomous reflection, the approach not only enhances model performance but also allows peeking into the LLM's reasoning process to uncover cognitive errors.
