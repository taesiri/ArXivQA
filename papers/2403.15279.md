# [Fundus: A Simple-to-Use News Scraper Optimized for High Quality   Extractions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15279)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing news scraping libraries rely on generic content extraction methods based on heuristics or machine learning models. This allows them to scale across many online newspapers, but comes at the cost of extraction quality and completeness.
- There is a lack of libraries that optimize for extracting high-quality, complete news articles rather than quantity across many sources. 

Proposed Solution - Fundus:
- Implements bespoke, manually crafted content extractors for each supported online newspaper. This is more work, but allows optimizing specifically for that newspaper's formatting style.
- Combines crawling (identifying article URLs) and content extraction in one library. Provides easy pre-defined configurations for each newspaper.
- Extracts not just text content, but also meta information like article structure (paragraphs, summaries), topics, authors etc.
- Supports extracting articles both from live news sites as well as large archived corpus like CommonCrawl's CC-News.

Main Contributions:
- Presentation of Fundus library for optimized news scraping focused on quality over quantity.
- Comparative evaluation showing Fundus achieves significantly higher extraction quality than prior generic approaches.
- Analysis of data potential, showing ability to extract over 2 million high quality articles from CC-News.
- Open source release to allow community to contribute support for more newspapers.

In summary, Fundus optimizes news scraping for quality over scale by using tailored extractors per newspaper. Evaluations confirm this yields more complete and clean extractions compared to prior work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Fundus, a Python library for scraping high-quality and complete news articles from a predefined set of online newspapers, which combines crawling and content extraction in a simple pipeline and outperforms existing generic scrapers in terms of extraction accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution is:

The introduction of \textsc{Fundus}, a user-friendly news scraper that enables users to obtain millions of high-quality news articles with just a few lines of code. Unlike existing news scrapers, \textsc{Fundus} uses manually crafted, bespoke content extractors that are specifically tailored to the formatting guidelines of each supported online newspaper. This allows optimization for quality such that retrieved articles are textually complete and without HTML artifacts. The paper presents an overview of the framework, discusses design choices, and shows through evaluation that \textsc{Fundus} yields significantly higher quality extractions compared to prior work.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- News scraping/crawling
- Content extraction
- Web archives
- Article quality
- Bespoke extractors 
- Metadata extraction
- Attribution preservation (e.g. paragraphs, headlines)
- Ease of use
- Comparative evaluation
- Forward vs backward crawling
- CommonCrawl

The paper introduces Fundus, a news scraping library focused on high quality extractions using manually crafted, publisher-specific extractors. It offers both forward crawling of live news sites and backward crawling of web archives like CommonCrawl. The library is designed to be easy to use even for non-technical users. A comparative evaluation shows Fundus achieves higher article quality compared to generic scraping approaches.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues that existing news scraping libraries prioritize quantity over quality. What evidence does the paper provide to support this argument? How could the trade-off between quantity and quality be quantified?

2. The paper proposes using manually crafted, bespoke extractors for each online newspaper. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to more generic extractors? How feasible is it to scale this approach to cover a large number of news sites?

3. The content extractors in Fundus aim to optimize extraction accuracy. What metrics are used to evaluate accuracy? What are some challenges in defining the ground truth for news article content? 

4. The paper distinguishes between forward and backward crawling. What is the difference between these two concepts? What are the tradeoffs when using live web crawling versus static web archives?

5. How extensible and maintainable is the parser-based extraction approach used in Fundus? What abstractions are provided to simplify adding support for new publishers? How easy is it to update extractors when formatting changes?

6. The paper argues Fundus is easy to use even for non-technical users. What aspects of the API design aim to improve usability? How could the API be extended to support more complex use cases?

7. Fundus extracts more metadata than just article text content. What additional attributes can be extracted from news articles? How useful are these for downstream applications?

8. The paper does not provide runtime performance benchmarks. What factors affect scraping throughput and scalability? How does Fundus performance compare to other scraping libraries?

9. The evaluation relies primarily on the ROUGE-LSum metric. What are the limitations of this metric for evaluating content quality? Are there other metrics that could supplement it?

10. The paper is aimed at news scraping, but could the approach generalize to other domains? What challenges would there be in applying bespoke extractors more broadly across different website genres?
