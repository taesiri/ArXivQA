# [Fundus: A Simple-to-Use News Scraper Optimized for High Quality   Extractions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15279)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing news scraping libraries rely on generic content extraction methods based on heuristics or machine learning models. This allows them to scale across many online newspapers, but comes at the cost of extraction quality and completeness.
- There is a lack of libraries that optimize for extracting high-quality, complete news articles rather than quantity across many sources. 

Proposed Solution - Fundus:
- Implements bespoke, manually crafted content extractors for each supported online newspaper. This is more work, but allows optimizing specifically for that newspaper's formatting style.
- Combines crawling (identifying article URLs) and content extraction in one library. Provides easy pre-defined configurations for each newspaper.
- Extracts not just text content, but also meta information like article structure (paragraphs, summaries), topics, authors etc.
- Supports extracting articles both from live news sites as well as large archived corpus like CommonCrawl's CC-News.

Main Contributions:
- Presentation of Fundus library for optimized news scraping focused on quality over quantity.
- Comparative evaluation showing Fundus achieves significantly higher extraction quality than prior generic approaches.
- Analysis of data potential, showing ability to extract over 2 million high quality articles from CC-News.
- Open source release to allow community to contribute support for more newspapers.

In summary, Fundus optimizes news scraping for quality over scale by using tailored extractors per newspaper. Evaluations confirm this yields more complete and clean extractions compared to prior work.
