# [Paying Attention to Deflections: Mining Pragmatic Nuances for   Whataboutism Detection in Online Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09934)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Whataboutism is a tactic used to derail conversations by deflecting criticism through counter-accusations. It can sow distrust and disorder but remains understudied in NLP. 
- Prior work conflates whataboutism with propaganda and does not distinguish its valid uses from propagandist intent. For example, "what about" phrases can be used to provide context rather than propaganda.  
- Existing models struggle to capture the pragmatic nuances needed to differentiate valid argumentation tools like suggestions from propagandist whataboutism.

Methodology:
- The authors introduce two new datasets from YouTube and Twitter to study whataboutism, containing over 10 times more labeled instances than prior datasets.
- They conduct a thematic analysis revealing modern whataboutism differs from classical "tu quoque" fallacies and serves purposes beyond just propaganda.
- They demonstrate that transfer learning models, while good at propaganda detection, struggle at whataboutism detection. Models based on semantic similarity also perform poorly.
- They propose a novel method called MINA that uses attention weights to pick negative samples that are pragmatically different, in order to better capture nuanced distinctions.

Contributions:
- Rigorous framework to distinguish valid argumentation from propagandist whataboutism based on pragmatic rather than just semantic differences.
- Empirical demonstration that semantic similarity measures are ineffective for detecting whataboutism.
- Introduction of MINA method that uses cross-attention weights to model pragmatic dissimilarity more effectively.
- New datasets that can enable further study of related fallacies beyond whataboutism.
- Significant performance gains over prior state-of-the-art in whataboutism detection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces new datasets and methods to detect whataboutism in online discourse by modeling pragmatic nuances, finding that while overlapping with propaganda, whataboutism also serves other valid functions, thus requiring more complex models going beyond semantics to capture real-world challenges.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The introduction of two new datasets (TQ$^{\plus}_{\textsc{yt}}$ and TQ$^{\plus}_{\textsc{tw}}$) focused specifically on detecting whataboutism in YouTube comments and Twitter posts. These are larger and more granularly annotated datasets compared to previous whataboutism corpora.

2) A rigorous analysis distinguishing whataboutism from valid argumentation tools and figurative language like irony. This includes both a thematic scrutiny as well as an empirical demonstration that semantic similarity measures struggle to capture the pragmatic nuances in this distinction.

3) The proposal of a novel method called MINA that uses cross-attention weights to mine negative samples and better capture pragmatic differences. Experiments show MINA achieves significant improvements over strong baselines in whataboutism detection.

4) Broader implications about the limitations of current NLP methods in modeling pragmatics and understanding complex discourse, especially surrounding misinformation and propaganda. The paper argues for going beyond syntax and semantics to capture pragmatic variations.

In summary, the main contribution is advancing the computational understanding and automatic detection of whataboutism through new datasets, analysis, and methods that surface the role of pragmatics.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Whataboutism - The practice of deflecting criticism by raising a different issue or making a counter-accusation. A key focus of the paper.

- Pragmatic flexibility - The idea that linguistically similar statements can serve very different pragmatic functions based on context. The paper argues that whataboutism exhibits high pragmatic flexibility. 

- Tu quoque fallacy - The classical fallacy of attacking an opponent's inconsistent behavior or arguments. Related to but distinct from modern whataboutism.

- Information disorder - Umbrella term encompassing disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation. Whataboutism contributes to information disorder.  

- Question under discussion (QUD) - The implicit question or topic that a statement is intended to address. Shifting the QUD is a tactic of whataboutism.

- Attention weights - Used in the paper's MINA model to identify pragmatically dissimilar instances when mining negative samples.

- Contrastive learning - Approach for bringing semantically similar instances closer while pushing apart dissimilar ones. Paper argues for limitations in capturing pragmatic nuances.

- Social media discourse - The paper introduces new labeled datasets from YouTube and Twitter to study whataboutism in modern social media contexts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel method called MINA (Mining Negatives with Attention) for detecting whataboutism. Can you explain in detail how MINA works and how it is different from existing methods? 

2. One key idea in MINA is to use cross-attention scores to select the most pragmatically dissimilar sample from the context to contrast with the input text. Why is modeling pragmatic differences important for detecting whataboutism?

3. The authors argue that semantic similarity measures are ineffective for detecting whataboutism. What evidence do they provide to support this claim? Can you think of reasons why semantic similarity may fail to capture pragmatic nuances?

4. Context tuples are constructed in MINA by combining the input text with comments from the whataboutism and not-whataboutism classes. How does the choice of context comments enable capturing subtle shifts in discourse pragmatics?

5. Attention mechanisms have proven powerful for NLP tasks. How does the use of cross-attention in MINA aid in distinguishing valid argumentation tools from propaganda?

6. An ablation study is conducted in the paper to determine the optimal configuration of hyperparameters like encoder layers, attention heads etc. for MINA. What insights do the results provide regarding the model's working?

7. The authors introduce two new datasets - TQ+YouTube and TQ+Twitter for studying whataboutism. What are some key properties and analysis of these datasets? How do they advance research in this area?

8. Can you think of some limitations of the proposed MINA method? What enhancements do you suggest to make it more robust and widely applicable?

9. TheMINA architecture uses SBERT embeddings as input to the Transformer encoder. Do you think other contextual embeddings like BERT and RoBERTa would also work? Why/why not?

10. The paper demonstrates superior performance of MINA over baselines. In your opinion, what other discourse analysis tasks can this method of using cross-attention for capturing pragmatic differences be useful for?
