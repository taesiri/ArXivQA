# [Control-A-Video: Controllable Text-to-Video Generation with Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13840)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a controllable text-to-video diffusion model that generates high-quality, consistent videos with additional control over the structure and motion?The key hypotheses proposed in the paper are:1. By incorporating spatial-temporal self-attention and trainable temporal layers into a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, the model can efficiently generate consistent video frames. 2. Introducing a residual-based noise initialization strategy can help incorporate motion priors from the input video, leading to less flickering and more coherent motion in the generated videos.3. A first-frame conditioning strategy allows the model to generate arbitrary-length videos in an auto-regressive manner, while also transferring knowledge from the image domain to generate the first frame.4. With these proposed techniques, the model can achieve superior video generation quality and consistency compared to previous methods, while being more computationally efficient.In summary, the central goal is developing a controllable text-to-video diffusion model that leverages spatial-temporal modeling, motion priors, and first-frame conditioning to achieve high-quality, consistent, and customizable video generation. The hypotheses focus on how specific architectural and technical innovations can enable this goal.
