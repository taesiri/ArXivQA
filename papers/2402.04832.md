# [Structured d-DNNF Is Not Closed Under Negation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04832)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge compilation aims to provide useful representations of Boolean functions that balance three aspects: succinctness, support for efficient transformations, and support for efficient queries. Two popular representations are ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs) and deterministic decomposable negation normal form (d-DNNF).
- Structured d-DNNF and sequential decision diagrams (SDDs) are representations that lie between OBDDs and d-DNNFs. They can be exponentially more succinct than OBDDs while supporting more tractable transformations than d-DNNFs.
- An open question is whether structured d-DNNFs are more succinct than SDDs, which are closed under more transformations like negation, disjunction, and existential quantification.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper shows structured d-DNNF is not closed under negation, disjunction or existential quantification, unlike SDDs.
- This is done by establishing connections between knowledge compilation and communication complexity. A function is constructed that has a small structured d-DNNF but requires large structured d-DNNFs for the negated, disjoined or existentially quantified function.
- The result for negation directly separates structured d-DNNF from SDDs, showing the latter can be exponentially more succinct.

Main Contributions:
- Answers two open questions by showing structured d-DNNF is not closed under key logical operations like SDDs are, and SDDs can be exponentially more succinct than structured d-DNNFs.
- Provides new insights into the succinctness and tractability tradeoffs for key knowledge compilation languages.
- Establishes limitations of structured d-DNNF while highlighting advantages of representations like SDDs.
- Showcases the power of using communication complexity lower bounds to prove knowledge compilation upper bounds.

In summary, the paper advances our understanding of expressiveness and succinctness for key knowledge compilation formalisms by separating structured d-DNNF from SDDs.
