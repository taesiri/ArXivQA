# [Secure Navigation using Landmark-based Localization in a GPS-denied   Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14280)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Reliance on GPS for navigation makes troops vulnerable in modern battlefield scenarios where adversaries employ GPS denial/deception tactics. Alternatives like SLAM and visual odometry have limitations in computational requirements and multiple sensor dependencies.  
- Existing range-free localization methods for wireless sensor networks like DV-Hop struggle with accuracy and stability in dynamic, sparse topologies.

Proposed Solution: 
- A framework integrating landmark-based localization (LanBLoc) system with Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to predict future state of moving entities along secure battlefield trajectories.

- LanBLoc utilizes physical landmarks for localization, identified by fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Stereo images calculate distance to landmarks. Better accuracy than traditional anchor nodes.

- EKF with nonlinear battlefield motion model handles uncertainty due to terrain, obstacles. Predicts future state for maneuver decisions.

- Convex hulls of trajectory segments checked for safety. Ensure entity stays on secure path.

Key Contributions:

1. Nonlinear battlefield motion model capturing uncertainty in position, heading and velocity.

2. EKF adaptation using motion model and LanBLoc for precise state prediction.

3. Algorithm for safe maneuver decisions based on convex hulls of trajectory segments. Ensures obstacle/hazard avoidance.  

4. Evaluation shows 6.51% trajectory length error, 2.97m Average Displacement Error, and 3.27m Final Displacement Error. Validates accuracy and safety.

5. Addresses GPS vulnerability for troops. Enhances navigation accuracy and operational effectiveness in GPS-denied environments.
