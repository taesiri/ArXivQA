# [ADAPT: Efficient Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14187)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be how to efficiently and accurately predict future trajectories of multiple agents in a dynamic scene. The key hypotheses proposed are:1. Using dynamic weight learning in an adaptive prediction head can allow efficiently adapting the model to each agent's viewpoint in a scene-centric multi-agent setting without needing to iterate over agents.2. Separating and detaching the training of the endpoint prediction and full trajectory prediction modules using gradient stopping leads to better performance with a small and fast decoder architecture. 3. Modeling interactions between agents and map elements explicitly using different attention types improves accuracy.4. Conditioning the trajectory prediction on estimated future endpoint locations helps capture diversity and multimodality.5. The proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both single-agent and multi-agent trajectory forecasting settings with high efficiency.In summary, the central research question is around efficiently and accurately predicting multi-agent trajectories, which is addressed through the key hypotheses around using dynamic weights, detached training, interaction modeling, endpoint conditioning, and demonstrating strong performance on benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a novel approach called ADAPT for efficiently predicting trajectories of multiple agents in a scene using a scene-centric representation. - Achieving state-of-the-art performance on both single-agent and multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks with high efficiency. Their model is one of the smallest and fastest among existing methods.- Introducing an adaptive prediction head with dynamic weight learning that can adjust to each agent's situation without having to transform the scene representation for every agent. This allows adapting a scene-centric representation to each agent efficiently.- Validating design choices like endpoint conditioning, gradient stopping, iterative attention blocks through extensive experiments and ablation studies.- Creating a unified prediction framework that works for both single-agent and multi-agent settings just by changing the prediction head. Previous methods tend to focus on one setting.- Demonstrating accurate and efficient multi-agent forecasting in a scene-centric representation, which was previously shown to be inefficient compared to agent-centric approaches.In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing an efficient and accurate approach for multi-agent trajectory forecasting by adapting a scene-centric representation to each agent using dynamic weight learning, while also achieving strong performance on single-agent forecasting. The unified architecture, design validation through ablations, and state-of-the-art performance further strengthen the contributions.
