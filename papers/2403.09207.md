# [TaxoLLaMA: WordNet-based Model for Solving Multiple Lexical Sematic   Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09207)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Applying large language models (LLMs) to classical lexical semantic tasks like hypernym discovery, taxonomy enrichment, taxonomy construction, and lexical entailment is still understudied. 
- Recent LLMs have not been extensively tested on these tasks across different domains and languages.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes TaxoLLaMA, an LLM fine-tuned on WordNet hypernym relations to bring implicit lexical knowledge to the forefront. 
- A taxonomy-focused instruction tuning dataset sourced from WordNet is used. 
- Two adaptation approaches are introduced - generative (predicting hypernyms directly) and ranking (assessing hypernymy relation through perplexity).

Main Contributions:
- TaxoLLaMA achieves state-of-the-art results on 11 out of 16 benchmark tasks and secures 2nd rank on 4 tasks.
- Thorough error analysis using manual review and ChatGPT is conducted, showing most errors are from predicting overly broad concepts.
- TaxoLLaMA demonstrates strong zero-shot transfer on lexical entailment and taxonomy construction.
- The model is lightweight via 4-bit quantization and LoRA for easy usage.
- An instructive hypernym dataset, definitions for test words, code and model weights are released.

In summary, the paper demonstrates LLMs can effectively capture taxonomic knowledge from WordNet and adapt to solve a range of lexical semantics tasks after suitable instruction tuning. The analysis also provides insights into LLM challenges on these tasks to guide future work.
