## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Retrieval-Augmented Score Distillation for Text-to-3D Generation":

Problem:
- Text-to-3D generation aims to create 3D scenes from text prompts. Recent approaches leverage powerful 2D generative models through score distillation, but lack 3D geometric knowledge, often resulting in artifacts and inconsistencies. 
- Approaches that fine-tune 2D models on 3D data face problems due to the limited scale and quality of 3D datasets compared to 2D.

Proposed Solution: 
- This paper proposes a retrieval-augmented framework called RetDream that integrates a retrieval module to exploit both the capabilities of 2D generative models and the geometric robustness of retrieved 3D assets.
- Given a text prompt, relevant 3D assets are first retrieved from a database. These assets are used to initialize the variational distribution of the 3D scene representation to incorporate geometric priors.
- The retrieved assets are also used to adapt the 2D generative model to balance view probabilities, reducing viewpoint bias. This lightweight adaptation mostly maintains the original model while enhancing view consistency.

Main Contributions:
- Novel retrieval-based quality enhancement framework for text-to-3D generation that leverages both high-fidelity 2D priors and geometric robustness of 3D assets
- Method to initialize variational distribution with retrieved assets to integrate geometric priors into text-to-3D optimization
- Lightweight strategy to adapt 2D models using retrieved assets to mitigate viewpoint bias and enhance view consistency  
- Demonstrates improved visual quality, geometry consistency and robustness over state-of-the-art text-to-3D approaches through extensive experiments

The key insight is that retrieved 3D assets can provide an effective minimal reference for geometry without requiring full fine-tuning, advancing text-to-3D generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a retrieval-augmented framework for text-to-3D generation that leverages retrieved 3D assets to provide geometric prior and adapt the 2D diffusion model to mitigate viewpoint bias, achieving improved geometric consistency and fidelity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Presenting a novel retrieval-augmented framework, RetDream, that effectively integrates a retrieval module with score distillation based frameworks for text-to-3D generation. This allows leveraging both the geometric information of 3D assets and the capability of text-to-image models to synthesize high-fidelity images without full training.

2) Introducing a lightweight approach that significantly reduces viewpoint bias in 2D prior models, which has been a major issue plaguing text-to-3D generation. 

3) Conducting extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed methods consistently improve the generation quality in terms of geometric consistency and fidelity. The experiments analyze how the retrieval-augmentation affects the 3D generation process.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a retrieval-augmented framework for text-to-3D generation that can exploit 3D assets to enhance geometric consistency and fidelity without full training, while also reducing viewpoint bias in 2D prior models through lightweight adaptation. The experiments validate the effectiveness of this framework.
