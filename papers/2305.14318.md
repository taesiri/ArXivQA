# [CREATOR: Disentangling Abstract and Concrete Reasonings of Large   Language Models through Tool Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14318)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is exploring and evaluating the potential of enabling large language models (LLMs) to create their own tools for solving problems, rather than just using existing tools. 

Specifically, the central hypothesis appears to be that by disentangling the abstract reasoning involved in tool creation from the concrete reasoning required for execution, LLMs can achieve improved performance and flexibility in problem-solving across diverse tasks. 

The authors propose a novel framework called Creator that aims to harness LLMs as tool creators. The framework consists of four main stages - Creation, Decision, Execution, and Rectification. The Creation stage involves generating reusable tools tailored to the problem, while the Decision stage determines how to apply those tools. Execution runs the tools and Rectification tweaks them if errors occur. 

By separating tool creation from execution, the hypothesis is that Creator can reduce the reasoning burden on LLMs and promote clearer logic, leading to higher accuracy. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated by testing Creator on math (MATH dataset) and tabular (TabMWP dataset) reasoning tasks, where it outperforms baselines. The authors also introduce a new Creation Challenge benchmark to specifically assess tool creation skills.

In summary, the central research question is whether enabling LLMs as tool creators through the proposed Creator framework can enhance their reasoning abilities and problem-solving performance across diverse tasks compared to existing methods. The effectiveness of tool creation is empirically evaluated across benchmarks relevant to math, tables, and general reasoning.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Creator that enables large language models to create their own tools for solving problems through documentation and code realization, which disentangles abstract reasoning for tool creation from concrete reasoning for execution and achieves better performance compared to existing methods on math and tabular reasoning tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is my analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the field of empowering large language models through tool creation:

The key contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called Creator that enables large language models (LLMs) to create their own tools for solving problems, instead of just using existing tools. This represents an innovative approach compared to prior work on augmenting LLMs with external tools, which has focused on having the models learn to utilize predefined APIs and resources. 

Specifically, the Creator framework disentangles the model's abstract reasoning involved in tool creation from the concrete reasoning required for executing decisions using the tools. This differs from methods like program-of-thought and chain-of-thought prompting which try to elicit the complete reasoning process from the model implicitly. By separating tool creation, Creator reduces the model's reasoning burden.

The concept of tool creation itself has not been extensively explored before for empowering LLMs. Prior relevant work includes LEVER which trains a neural verifier to check LLM-generated programs, and Chameleon-LLM which incorporates a Python interpreter for executing LLM code. However, these do not focus on getting the LLM to create reusable tools. Creator represents the first dedicated framework for realizing and assessing LLMs' tool creation abilities.

Through comprehensive experiments on mathematical and tabular reasoning datasets, the authors demonstrate Creator's superior performance over existing CoT, PoT, and tool-using methods. The new Creation Challenge dataset designed to necessitate tool creation further highlights the value of this capability. Overall, enabling tool creation appears to be a very promising direction for stretching the boundaries of what LLMs can accomplish.

By proposing both the novel idea of tool creation for LLMs and an effective implementation through the Creator framework, this work makes important contributions to the field. It opens up an interesting new research direction for empowering LLMs in more creative and adaptable ways. The analysis of the tool creation process and LLM capacities provides useful insights as well.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel perspective on augmenting LLM capabilities through tool creation, substantiated via comprehensive experiments. The proposed Creator framework outperforms previous methods and demonstrates the potential of this approach. By elucidating this new capability of LLMs, this work expands the scope of research on empowering large language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

1. Exploring and harnessing the full extent of LLMs' tool creation capabilities. The authors note that their study provides only a preliminary glimpse into this domain, so more work is needed to fully understand and leverage the tool creation potential of LLMs across a wider range of tasks and complex scenarios.

2. Investigating methods to enhance the efficiency of the tool creation process and better align it with user intentions. The authors suggest future work could focus on streamlining and optimizing the tool creation framework to make it more user-friendly.

3. Validating the approach on more tasks beyond math/tabular problems. The authors acknowledge their framework was evaluated primarily on math and tabular reasoning tasks, so testing it on a broader variety of domains would be beneficial.

4. Examining other important aspects of LLMs' tool creation abilities beyond the disentanglement of reasoning. The authors note their work emphasized unraveling abstract vs concrete reasoning, but many other facets of tool creation warrant further analysis.

5. Pushing towards more sophisticated AI systems that effectively harness LLMs' tool creation skills. The authors position their work as a first step, and hope it will inspire more advanced models that fully leverage LLMs as tool creators.

6. Investigating methods to transfer tools created for one problem to new scenarios. The authors demonstrate the potential for tool transfer, and suggest more research on enabling LLMs to repurpose tools flexibly.

In summary, the authors call for a deeper investigation into LLMs' tool creation capabilities, their efficiency and alignment, applications beyond math/tables, other facets beyond reasoning disentanglement, and integration into more advanced systems. Advancing research across these fronts could further unlock the promise of LLMs as tool creators.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Creator that enables large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to create their own tools for solving problems, instead of just using existing tools. The framework has four main stages - Creation, Decision, Execution, and Rectification. In the Creation stage, the LLM generates documentation and code to create a reusable tool tailored to the problem. The Decision stage involves determining how to apply the tool to solve the specific problem. The Execution stage runs the code and provides results. If errors occur, the Rectification stage allows the LLM to modify the tool or decision. A key benefit is that tool creation disentangles the LLM's abstract reasoning ability used for creating generalizable tools from its concrete reasoning ability used for decision making with details. Experiments show Creator significantly outperforms baselines like chain-of-thought and tool-using methods on math (MATH dataset) and table reasoning (TabMWP dataset) problems. A new Creation Challenge dataset highlights the necessity of tool creation for novel problems. Further analyses reveal tool creation also enables knowledge transfer and LLMs have varying tool creation abilities to flexibly adapt. Overall, enabling LLMs as tool creators is a promising direction to enhance their reasoning, accuracy, and adaptability.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem and question addressed in this paper are:

- Recent large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, Codex, PaLM etc have shown impressive capabilities, but still face limitations in providing accurate mathematical results, long-chain reasoning, and handling novel tasks without suitable APIs. 

- Existing methods equip LLMs with external tools like search engines, QA systems, etc. But they are limited by availability of suitable APIs, complexity of implicit reasoning over planning and calculations, and lack of error-handling mechanisms.

- The core question is how to enhance LLMs' ability to handle these challenges, go beyond just using existing tools, and solve problems more accurately and flexibly. 

The main problem this paper tries to address is the limitations of current LLMs in reasoning accuracy and flexibility when using existing external tools. The key question is how to improve LLMs' capabilities by enabling them to create their own tools instead of just using available tools. The paper proposes a framework called "Creator" that allows LLMs to generate tools through documentation and code realization, in order to solve problems with disentangled reasoning and increased accuracy.

In summary, this paper focuses on empowering LLMs to create their own tools to overcome limitations in reasoning accuracy and flexibility when relying solely on existing external tools. The core question is how tool creation can enhance LLMs' problem-solving abilities.
