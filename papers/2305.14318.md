# CREATOR: Disentangling Abstract and Concrete Reasonings of Large   Language Models through Tool Creation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is exploring and evaluating the potential of enabling large language models (LLMs) to create their own tools for solving problems, rather than just using existing tools. Specifically, the central hypothesis appears to be that by disentangling the abstract reasoning involved in tool creation from the concrete reasoning required for execution, LLMs can achieve improved performance and flexibility in problem-solving across diverse tasks. The authors propose a novel framework called Creator that aims to harness LLMs as tool creators. The framework consists of four main stages - Creation, Decision, Execution, and Rectification. The Creation stage involves generating reusable tools tailored to the problem, while the Decision stage determines how to apply those tools. Execution runs the tools and Rectification tweaks them if errors occur. By separating tool creation from execution, the hypothesis is that Creator can reduce the reasoning burden on LLMs and promote clearer logic, leading to higher accuracy. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated by testing Creator on math (MATH dataset) and tabular (TabMWP dataset) reasoning tasks, where it outperforms baselines. The authors also introduce a new Creation Challenge benchmark to specifically assess tool creation skills.In summary, the central research question is whether enabling LLMs as tool creators through the proposed Creator framework can enhance their reasoning abilities and problem-solving performance across diverse tasks compared to existing methods. The effectiveness of tool creation is empirically evaluated across benchmarks relevant to math, tables, and general reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The key contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing the concept of tool creation for large language models (LLMs) and designing a novel framework called Creator that enables LLMs to create their own tools to solve problems more effectively. 2. Demonstrating the benefits of tool creation over existing methods like chain-of-thought and program-of-thought prompting on two established benchmarks - MATH and TabMWP. The Creator framework achieved significantly higher accuracy compared to these baselines.3. Introducing a new dataset called Creation Challenge comprising novel problems that require tool creation to be solved adequately. Experiments on this dataset further validate the necessity and advantages of enabling LLMs to create tools.4. Conducting analysis and case studies to provide insights into how tool creation promotes knowledge transfer and how LLMs exhibit varying levels of tool creation abilities. This allows them to adapt better to diverse situations.5. Overall, this work represents the first comprehensive study focused on empowering LLMs as tool creators. By disentangling abstract and concrete reasoning abilities, the proposed Creator framework unlocks the potential of LLMs and advances progress towards more intelligent AI systems. The concept of tool creation opens promising avenues for future research.In summary, the core innovation is enabling LLMs to create their own tools instead of just using existing tools. This is shown through both system design and experiments to significantly enhance LLMs' reasoning and problem-solving capabilities. The paper makes both conceptual and empirical contributions around the idea of tool creation for LLMs.
