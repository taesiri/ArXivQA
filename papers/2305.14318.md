# [CREATOR: Tool Creation for Disentangling Abstract and Concrete Reasoning
  of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14318)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is exploring and evaluating the potential of enabling large language models (LLMs) to create their own tools for solving problems, rather than just using existing tools. 

Specifically, the central hypothesis appears to be that by disentangling the abstract reasoning involved in tool creation from the concrete reasoning required for execution, LLMs can achieve improved performance and flexibility in problem-solving across diverse tasks. 

The authors propose a novel framework called Creator that aims to harness LLMs as tool creators. The framework consists of four main stages - Creation, Decision, Execution, and Rectification. The Creation stage involves generating reusable tools tailored to the problem, while the Decision stage determines how to apply those tools. Execution runs the tools and Rectification tweaks them if errors occur. 

By separating tool creation from execution, the hypothesis is that Creator can reduce the reasoning burden on LLMs and promote clearer logic, leading to higher accuracy. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated by testing Creator on math (MATH dataset) and tabular (TabMWP dataset) reasoning tasks, where it outperforms baselines. The authors also introduce a new Creation Challenge benchmark to specifically assess tool creation skills.

In summary, the central research question is whether enabling LLMs as tool creators through the proposed Creator framework can enhance their reasoning abilities and problem-solving performance across diverse tasks compared to existing methods. The effectiveness of tool creation is empirically evaluated across benchmarks relevant to math, tables, and general reasoning.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Creator that enables large language models to create their own tools for solving problems through documentation and code realization, which disentangles abstract reasoning for tool creation from concrete reasoning for execution and achieves better performance compared to existing methods on math and tabular reasoning tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is my analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the field of empowering large language models through tool creation:

The key contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called Creator that enables large language models (LLMs) to create their own tools for solving problems, instead of just using existing tools. This represents an innovative approach compared to prior work on augmenting LLMs with external tools, which has focused on having the models learn to utilize predefined APIs and resources. 

Specifically, the Creator framework disentangles the model's abstract reasoning involved in tool creation from the concrete reasoning required for executing decisions using the tools. This differs from methods like program-of-thought and chain-of-thought prompting which try to elicit the complete reasoning process from the model implicitly. By separating tool creation, Creator reduces the model's reasoning burden.

The concept of tool creation itself has not been extensively explored before for empowering LLMs. Prior relevant work includes LEVER which trains a neural verifier to check LLM-generated programs, and Chameleon-LLM which incorporates a Python interpreter for executing LLM code. However, these do not focus on getting the LLM to create reusable tools. Creator represents the first dedicated framework for realizing and assessing LLMs' tool creation abilities.

Through comprehensive experiments on mathematical and tabular reasoning datasets, the authors demonstrate Creator's superior performance over existing CoT, PoT, and tool-using methods. The new Creation Challenge dataset designed to necessitate tool creation further highlights the value of this capability. Overall, enabling tool creation appears to be a very promising direction for stretching the boundaries of what LLMs can accomplish.

By proposing both the novel idea of tool creation for LLMs and an effective implementation through the Creator framework, this work makes important contributions to the field. It opens up an interesting new research direction for empowering LLMs in more creative and adaptable ways. The analysis of the tool creation process and LLM capacities provides useful insights as well.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel perspective on augmenting LLM capabilities through tool creation, substantiated via comprehensive experiments. The proposed Creator framework outperforms previous methods and demonstrates the potential of this approach. By elucidating this new capability of LLMs, this work expands the scope of research on empowering large language models.

3. Validating the approach on more tasks beyond math/tabular problems. The authors acknowledge their framework was evaluated primarily on math and tabular reasoning tasks, so testing it on a broader variety of domains would be beneficial.

4. Examining other important aspects of LLMs' tool creation abilities beyond the disentanglement of reasoning. The authors note their work emphasized unraveling abstract vs concrete reasoning, but many other facets of tool creation warrant further analysis.

5. Pushing towards more sophisticated AI systems that effectively harness LLMs' tool creation skills. The authors position their work as a first step, and hope it will inspire more advanced models that fully leverage LLMs as tool creators.

6. Investigating methods to transfer tools created for one problem to new scenarios. The authors demonstrate the potential for tool transfer, and suggest more research on enabling LLMs to repurpose tools flexibly.

In summary, the authors call for a deeper investigation into LLMs' tool creation capabilities, their efficiency and alignment, applications beyond math/tables, other facets beyond reasoning disentanglement, and integration into more advanced systems. Advancing research across these fronts could further unlock the promise of LLMs as tool creators.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel framework called Creator that enables large language models (LLMs) to create their own tools for solving problems. However, how does Creator ensure that the tools created by the LLMs are actually useful and applicable to the problems at hand? Does it provide any verification or validation of the created tools?

2. The paper emphasizes the importance of disentangling abstract and concrete reasoning in the LLM through the separate stages of tool creation and decision making/execution. But how much does the performance improvement stem from this disentanglement versus other factors like the inclusion of a rectification stage? Are there any ablation studies done to quantify the impact of disentanglement specifically?

3. The paper shows Creator outperforming baselines like chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) on existing datasets. However, these datasets are not designed specifically to test tool creation abilities. So in what ways are they limited in evaluating Creator's full capabilities? Are there plans to construct more comprehensive benchmarks tailored to tool creation?

4. The Creation Challenge dataset seems more suited to demonstrate the advantages of tool creation. How was this dataset constructed to ensure the problems could not be easily solved by existing tools? What measures were taken to guarantee novelty and diversity? Are there limitations to the generalizability of results on this dataset?

5. The concept of tool creation levels is introduced to categorize LLMs' capabilities. But the three proposed levels appear to be presented more as examples rather than a systematic taxonomy. What are other potential levels or facets that can more comprehensively describe the tool creation abilities of LLMs? Is there a plan for a more rigorous classification?

6. The paper emphasizes the knowledge transfer facilitated by tool creation, but the experiment uses a relatively small dataset of only 300 data points. Are there plans to conduct experiments on a larger and more diverse dataset to further establish the knowledge transfer benefits? What are the limitations of the current experimental design?

7. The paper focuses on mathematical problems and tables for evaluating Creator, but how well would it extend to other domains like text, images, videos etc.? What adaptations would need to be made to generalize the framework?

8. The tool creation process seems heavily dependent on effective prompting and instructions for the LLM. How sensitive is the performance of Creator to the quality and details provided in the prompts? How can the prompting be standardized to ensure more consistent tool creation?

9. The paper utilizes ChatGPT as the sole LLM for experimentation. Would the proposed approach work as effectively for other LLMs? Is there evidence that the tool creation ability exhibited by ChatGPT also transfers to models like GPT-3, PaLM, LLaMA etc? 

10. The paper provides initial evidence for awakening the tool creation skills of LLMs. However, the created tools appear to be specialized solutions for specific problems. What further research could be done to enable LLMs to create more generic and versatile tools applicable to a wide range of problems?
