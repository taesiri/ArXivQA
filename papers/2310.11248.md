# [CrossCodeEval: A Diverse and Multilingual Benchmark for Cross-File Code   Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11248)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a diverse and multilingual benchmark to effectively evaluate code language models' ability to leverage cross-file context for accurate code completion? 

The key hypothesis seems to be that existing code completion benchmarks are limited because they focus only on single-file context, whereas real-world code often relies heavily on cross-file dependencies and interactions. Therefore, the authors hypothesize that a benchmark requiring cross-file contextual understanding will be better able to assess code language models' capabilities for practical code completion tasks.

To test this, the paper introduces CrossCodeEval, a new benchmark dataset spanning four programming languages that is intentionally constructed to require cross-file context for completion. The paper then conducts experiments showing that models struggle without cross-file context but improve significantly when it is provided, validating their hypothesis. Overall, the central research question is how to build an effective benchmark for cross-file code completion, which this paper addresses through the development and analysis of CrossCodeEval.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing CrossCodeEval, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating code completion models' ability to leverage cross-file context. 

2. The dataset contains 10k examples across 4 programming languages (Python, Java, TypeScript, C#) that require cross-file context for accurate completion.

3. The examples are carefully constructed from real-world open source repositories using static analysis to identify cross-file dependencies. Steps are taken to avoid overlap with existing model training data.

4. Comprehensive experiments show current code models struggle without cross-file context but improve significantly when it is provided, demonstrating the value of CrossCodeEval.

5. Analysis of different cross-file context retrieval techniques establishes CrossCodeEval as a benchmark for both code completion and code retrieval tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is the new CrossCodeEval benchmark that pushes code completion evaluation to require and assess understanding of cross-file software context, better reflecting real-world programming.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes CrossCodeEval, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating code completion models on their ability to leverage cross-file context, as real-world software often relies on information across multiple files.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on the CrossCodeEval benchmark compares to other research on evaluating code completion models:

- Focus on cross-file code completion: This paper introduces a new benchmark, CrossCodeEval, specifically designed to test code completion models' ability to leverage cross-file context. Many existing benchmarks focus only on completing code based on in-file context. CrossCodeEval helps fill an important gap.

- Multilingual: CrossCodeEval contains code completion examples in four programming languages - Python, Java, TypeScript, and C#. This allows for evaluating and comparing models across multiple languages. Other benchmarks tend to focus on just one language. 

- Real-world repositories: The examples in CrossCodeEval come from recent real-world open source repositories on GitHub. Many benchmarks synthetically generate examples or draw from competitive programming problems, which may not fully reflect real code.

- Avoiding overlap with training data: The authors took care to collect repositories likely not seen in training by large language models to reduce issues with memorization. Other benchmarks don't necessarily account for training data overlap.

- Static analysis based generation: They use static analysis like compilers and linters to automatically identify locations requiring cross-file context. This provides a scalable approach to generating examples vs hand-crafted ones.

- Benchmark for retrieval: The paper shows CrossCodeEval can also benchmark cross-file context retrieval methods, not just completion. This provides another axis for evaluation.

So in summary, CrossCodeEval makes unique contributions as a cross-file, multilingual, real-world code completion benchmark focused on avoiding training data overlap and benchmarking retrieval too. The static analysis based generation is also novel. Overall it addresses important limitations in prior benchmarks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing better methods for retrieving relevant cross-file context. The paper shows that current retrieval methods like BM25 still have limitations, so more advanced techniques tailored for code could further improve performance.things like incorporating identifiers and API names into retrieval.

- Enhancing code language models to make better use of extensive context from multiple files for completion. Even with retrieved cross-file context, model performance remains imperfect indicating room for improvement. 

- Extending the dataset to more programming languages beyond the current 4. The proposed methodology could generalize.

- Training code models in a few-shot way to handle cross-file context format during finetuning/prompting. The zero-shot setting in the paper is limited.

- Mitigating potential memorization issues by explicitly excluding the benchmark data from future model pre-training.

- Developing better evaluation metrics tailored for cross-file code completion tasks.

- Applying the dataset as a benchmark for other related tasks like code summarization, retrieval, clone detection etc. that require cross-file understanding.

In summary, the key opportunities are around improving cross-file context modeling for code in various ways, extending the benchmark, and developing better evaluation methodologies. The dataset provides a solid foundation to drive progress.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces CrossCodeEval, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating code language models on cross-file code completion tasks. The key ideas are:

- Existing code completion benchmarks focus on single-file contexts, which is insufficient to represent real-world software development with cross-file dependencies. CrossCodeEval fills this gap by providing examples strictly requiring cross-file context for accurate completion. 

- The dataset contains 10k examples in 4 languages (Python, Java, TypeScript, C#) derived from 1k real-world open source repositories using static analysis to identify cross-file context usages. Quality filters are applied to ensure minimal overlap with existing LM training data.

- Experiments show current LMs struggle with only in-file context but improve significantly when cross-file context is provided, demonstrating CrossCodeEval effectively assesses cross-file completion capability. Performance gaps indicate room for better leveraging extensive context. 

- CrossCodeEval can also benchmark code retrieval methods, as retrieved cross-file context is shown crucial for code LMs. The dataset highlights needs for advancing context modeling and retrieval to enhance code completion.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces CrossCodeEval, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating code language models' ability to leverage cross-file context for code completion. The dataset consists of 10,000 examples across four programming languages - Python, Java, TypeScript, and C# - that are derived from real-world open source repositories. A key property of the examples in CrossCodeEval is that they require reference to code definitions or usages in other files within the repository in order to accurately complete the code snippet. 

The authors evaluate several state-of-the-art code language models on CrossCodeEval, including CodeGen, StarCoder, and GPT-3.5-turbo. The results demonstrate that performance is significantly lower when only provided in-file context versus when relevant cross-file context is incorporated into the prompt. This highlights the limitations of existing benchmarks that focus solely on single-file code completion. However, even when cross-file context is provided, model performance remains imperfect, indicating room for advancement. Overall, CrossCodeEval represents an important new benchmark for assessing and driving progress in code language models' ability to leverage broader contextual understanding for code completion.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a dataset called CrossCodeEval for evaluating code language models on their ability to leverage cross-file context for code completion. The key steps are:

1) Collect recent GitHub repositories in Python, Java, TypeScript, and C# that do not overlap with existing pretraining datasets to avoid data leakage. 

2) Use static analysis to modify each file by replacing imported classes with empty classes. Compile the modified files to identify compiler errors pointing to cross-file dependencies. These errors indicate locations in the original source files where the code requires cross-file context.

3) Construct dataset examples by treating the code preceding the location of the cross-file dependency as the prompt and the code tokens until the end of the statement as the reference completion.

4) Perform quality control via rule-based filtering and use of a base code LM to remove examples predictable from just the in-file context.

5) Evaluate state-of-the-art code LMs on the dataset in a zero-shot setting, with and without retrieved cross-file context. Show significant improvements when cross-file context is provided, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness.

In summary, the key novelty is the use of static analysis to automatically construct a high-quality benchmark that specifically tests code LMs' ability to leverage cross-file context for code completion.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces CrossCodeEval, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating code completion models on their ability to leverage cross-file context. The dataset contains 10K examples across Python, Java, TypeScript, and C# that require resolving identifiers/APIs defined in other files in the codebase to generate the correct code completion.
