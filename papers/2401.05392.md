# [AT-2FF: Adaptive Type-2 Fuzzy Filter for De-noising Images Corrupted   with Salt-and-Pepper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05392)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Images inevitably get corrupted with salt-and-pepper (SAP) noise during acquisition, transmission, and storage. SAP noise adversely affects subsequent image processing tasks like segmentation, recognition, etc. Existing filters like median filter, adaptive median filter, etc. are unable to preserve edges and details while removing high density SAP noise.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a two-stage Adaptive Type-2 Fuzzy Filter (AT-2FF) to remove SAP noise even at high densities while preserving edges and details. 

The first stage categorizes each pixel as lightly corrupted, medium corrupted or heavily corrupted using an adaptive threshold computed from type-2 fuzzy logic. This adaptive threshold is computed using upper and lower membership functions derived from the maximum absolute luminance difference (M-ALD) of pixels in the window. 

The second stage replaces the corrupted pixels by computing a weighted average of uncorrupted pixels in the window, where the weights are determined by a Gaussian membership function. The mean and variance for this Gaussian function are calculated using only the uncorrupted pixels.

Main Contributions:

1. An adaptive threshold to categorize noise level using type-2 fuzzy logic and M-ALD, making it robust to high density noise.

2. Weighted averaging in second stage using only uncorrupted pixels, with data-driven weights from Gaussian membership function. This preserves edges better.

3. Experiments show the filter works very well at low and extremely high noise densities of 90-95%, outperforming state-of-the-art filters in PSNR and visual quality while keeping computational time low.

In summary, the key novelty is the adaptive threshold for noise level estimation using type-2 fuzzy logic, and use of only uncorrupted pixels with adaptive weights for replacing noisy pixels. This allows the filter to handle a wide range of noise levels effectively.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a two-stage adaptive type-2 fuzzy filter for removing salt-and-pepper noise from images that categorizes pixels as lightly, medium or heavily corrupted based on an adaptive threshold and then eliminates the corrupted pixels by computing appropriate weights for the uncorrupted pixels to estimate the original pixels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The first stage categorizes images as lightly, medium, and heavily corrupted based on an adaptive threshold by comparing the M-ALD of processed pixels with the upper and lower MF of the type-2 fuzzy identifier.

2. The second stage eliminates corrupted pixels by computing the appropriate weight using GMF with the mean and variance of the uncorrupted pixels in the filter window.

So in summary, the key contributions are:

- An adaptive threshold for identifying corrupted pixels using type-2 fuzzy logic and maximum absolute luminance difference (M-ALD)

- A two-stage approach for removing salt-and-pepper noise - first identifying the corrupted pixels, then replacing them by computing weights for uncorrupted pixels using a Gaussian membership function.

The proposed filter shows improved performance in removing high density salt-and-pepper noise while preserving image details compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
