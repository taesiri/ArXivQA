# [Guiding Large Language Models with Divide-and-Conquer Program for   Discerning Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05359)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT have limited reasoning ability for tasks requiring long chained reasoning, such as math problems. This is due to the parallelism tradeoff - Transformers sacrifice reasoning depth for parallelizability.
- Existing prompting strategies like chain-of-thought help but are still limited as they intertwine sub-task generation and resolution steps, making models prone to intermediate errors. This issue is worse for inputs with deception or tasks needing repetitive sub-tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Divide-and-Conquer (DaC) prompting strategy that disentangles the sub-task generation, resolution, and assembly processes.  
- DaC first prompts the LLM to decompose the task into parallel sub-tasks, then solve each sub-task separately, and finally assemble the solutions. This avoids intermediate errors.
- Two variants proposed - Single-level DaC for simple tasks, Multi-level DaC using recursion for complex tasks needing hierarchical decomposition.

Main Contributions:
- Prove theoretically that DaC expands the expressive power of transformers to solve harder problems like the NC1-complete 2-BSI problem.
- Experimentally show DaC outperforms baselines on tasks with repetitive sub-tasks or deception - large integer multiplication, hallucination detection, fact checking.
- Highlight the paradigm shift enabled by DaC where sub-task generation, resolution and assembly are disentangled, avoiding interruption and intermediate errors.
- Demonstrate the first prompting strategy to unlock LLM's ability to handle long inputs with deception, an ability even humans struggle with.

In summary, the key insight is that disentangling the sub-processes helps LM reasoning, especially for complex and deceitful inputs. DaC shows promise in expanding LM capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel Divide-and-Conquer program-guided problem solving strategy to guide large language models (LLMs) to better handle tasks with repetitive sub-tasks or deceptive content. 

Specifically, the key ideas proposed are:

1) Disentangling the process of task decomposition, sub-task resolution, and solution assembly into three distinct stages, avoiding them from interrupting each other. 

2) Decomposing the task into parallel sub-tasks instead of sequential ones, making the LLM less prone to being misled by deceptive content.

3) Providing theoretical analysis to show the proposed strategy can expand the expressive power of LLM beyond standard input-output prompting.

4) Empirically demonstrating improved performance over representative baselines on tasks like large integer multiplication, hallucination detection, and fact verification that involve repetitive reasoning steps or deception.

In summary, the main contribution is a new prompting paradigm that makes LLMs more discerning and robust when handling complex reasoning or deception-prone tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel Divide-and-Conquer program-guided problem solving strategy. Can you explain in more detail how this strategy works and how it breaks down tasks into sub-tasks compared to prior methods? 

2. The paper theoretically proves that the proposed strategy expands the expressive power of fixed-depth log-precision Transformers. Can you summarize the key aspects of this proof and why it is significant?

3. The paper evaluates the method on tasks like large integer multiplication, hallucination detection, and fact verification. Why are these good tasks for evaluating the benefits of the proposed approach? What characteristics do they have that make existing methods struggle?

4. How exactly does the proposed approach avoid the issue of intermediate errors that existing prompting strategies struggle with? Explain the disentangled-sub-process principle and how it helps.  

5. Compare and contrast in detail the differences between the sequential sub-task handling of methods like Least-to-Most Prompting and the parallel sub-task handling proposed in this paper. What are the tradeoffs?

6. The prompts provided for decomposition, sub-task resolution, and solution merging are critical components. What makes an effective prompt design for each of these stages? What factors need to be considered?  

7. The paper evaluates performance on two models - GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. What differences would you expect in applying this approach to even larger future models? Would changes be needed?

8. What limitations still exist with the Divide-and-Conquer approach proposed in the paper? What kinds of tasks would not be suitable? Why?

9. The paper focuses on textual tasks. Could this Divide-and-Conquer prompting strategy be applied effectively to other modalities like images, video, speech, etc? Why or why not?

10. The method guides LLMs with an explicit program. How could the approach be adapted to learn such Divide-and-Conquer decomposition and reassembly in a more automated, end-to-end manner? What challenges exist there?
