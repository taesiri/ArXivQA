# [Rethinking the Domain Gap in Near-infrared Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00627)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper rethinks the common belief that there exists a large domain gap between visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) face images that needs to be bridged for effective heterogeneous face recognition (HFR). Through experiments, the authors find that large neural networks pre-trained on large-scale VIS data alone demonstrate remarkable zero-shot HFR performance, suggesting the domain gap may be less pronounced than previously thought. They introduce a straightforward HFR framework involving comprehensive pre-training on VIS data followed by a regularized fine-tuning strategy on target NIR-VIS data. Pre-training strategies to improve downstream transferability are presented, including a novel color channel augmentation technique. The fine-tuning methodology transfers knowledge through fixed classifier weights and simultaneous optimization on VIS source data. Without complex synthetic data generation or model architectures, this simple approach matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four public HFR benchmarks. The methodâ€™s effectiveness highlights the crucial insight that large-scale VIS data carries ample information to tackle the HFR problem.
