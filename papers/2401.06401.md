# [DevEval: Evaluating Code Generation in Practical Software Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06401)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Existing code generation benchmarks differ from real-world software projects in three key ways: 
1) They have an unrealistic distribution of standalone vs non-standalone programs (most focus only on standalone programs)
2) They provide insufficient dependencies compared to what's seen in practice 
3) They lack large-scale project contexts that developers rely on

As a result, the capabilities of language models on practical software projects are unclear. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a new benchmark, DevEval, collected through a rigorous pipeline from 119 practical open-source projects across 10 domains. The key features are:

1) Realistic distribution: 73.8% non-standalone programs, aligning with real projects
2) Sufficient dependencies: Includes intra-class, intra-file and cross-file dependencies, averaging 2.17 per sample - close to real projects. Much more than prior benchmarks.  
3) Large-scale contexts: On average 243 code files and 45,941 lines of context per sample. Far more than previous benchmarks.

The benchmark provides high-quality natural language requirements (avg 91 tokens) and test cases for evaluation as well.

Key Results/Contributions:

1) Assess 6 popular LLMs on DevEval, revealing actual limitations in practical settings (e.g. GPT-3.5 Pass@1 drops from 73 on prior benchmark down to 42 on DevEval)  

2) Show crucial role of project contexts for generation, but also difficulties of LLM's in understanding long heterogeneous contexts

3) Identify future directions such as better context compression and understanding techniques to aid code generation in real projects

Overall, DevEval pushes code generation research closer to practical software development through its advances in benchmark quality and analysis of LLM weaknesses in this domain.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes DevEval, a new code generation benchmark with 2,690 samples that closely aligns with practical software projects in dimensions like real-world program distributions, sufficient dependencies, and large-scale project contexts, and uses it to evaluate popular LLMs, revealing their weaknesses in comprehending lengthy heterogeneous contexts in code generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Identifying gaps between existing code generation benchmarks and practical software projects, including differences in program distributions, insufficient dependencies, and inadequate project contexts. 

2. Proposing a new benchmark named DevEval with 2,690 samples that addresses these gaps and more closely aligns with practical projects. Key advances include having a real program distribution, sufficient dependencies, and enough-scale project contexts.

3. Evaluating several popular large language models on DevEval, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses in practical project settings, and discussing future directions for code generation.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the DevEval benchmark that better aligns with real-world software development and using it to analyze state-of-the-art code generation models. The goal is to facilitate advancements in code generation for practical projects.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- DevEval - The name of the proposed benchmark for evaluating code generation models.

- Code generation - The task of automatically generating source code based on natural language descriptions. A key focus of the paper. 

- Large language models (LLMs) - The models, such as GPT-3 and Codex, that are used for code generation and evaluated on DevEval.

- Program distributions - The distributions of different types of programs, like standalone vs non-standalone functions. DevEval matches real-world distributions.

- Dependencies - The functions/methods invoked within a program. DevEval contains more dependencies than prior benchmarks.  

- Project contexts - The existing codebase and files that provide context for new code being written. DevEval contains large project contexts.

- Functional correctness - Measured through test cases and metrics like Pass@k. One evaluation dimension.

- Recall of dependencies - Measured through Recall@k metric. Another evaluation dimension.

- Gaps to practical projects - Prior benchmarks differ from real code in multiple ways, which DevEval addresses.

So in summary, key terms cover the proposed benchmark, code generation task, models evaluated, and dimensions along which the benchmark aligns better with practical software projects.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that existing benchmarks have gaps compared to practical software projects. What are the specific gaps identified in the paper and how does the proposed benchmark, DevEval, address these gaps?

2. DevEval contains 2,690 samples collected from 119 practical projects. What was the rigorous pipeline used to collect these samples? What were the criteria for including/excluding functions during this pipeline?  

3. The paper proposes two new evaluation metrics - Pass@k and Recall@k. Explain in detail what these metrics measure and how they are computed. What are the advantages of using these metrics over metrics used in prior benchmarks?

4. The requirements in DevEval were manually written by developers. What were the criteria established for writing high-quality requirements? On average, how many tokens do the requirements in DevEval contain and how does this compare to previous benchmarks?

5. What are the different types of dependencies analyzed in the paper (intra-class, intra-file etc.)? How does the distribution of these dependency types in DevEval compare to real-world projects?

6. When using project contexts as inputs, the full contexts are too large for current LLMs. What strategies were used to compress the contexts into smaller representations that can be consumed by the LLMs?

7. Analyze in depth the results obtained by different LLMs on the baseline setting (no contexts) and context-based setting. What inferences can be drawn about the importance of contexts and the abilities of current LLMs?

8. Even with project contexts, the results are not very high. Analyze some reasons behind why existing LLMs struggle to effectively utilize long, heterogeneous contexts. 

9. The paper analyzes results across different program types (standalone vs non-standalone) and dependency types. Summarize the key observations from these analyses. What do they reveal about current capabilities?

10. Based on the findings, what potential future directions are outlined at the end of the paper to advance code generation using large language models?
