# [When does word order matter and when doesn't it?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18838)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent studies have found that language models (LMs) can still perform well on natural language understanding (NLU) tasks even when the word order in sentences is scrambled. This raises questions about whether word order is necessary for LMs to compute meaning.

- The paper hypothesizes that linguistic redundancy allows LMs to be insensitive to word order changes. Specifically, word order and other linguistic cues like case markers can provide overlapping/redundant information. 

Solution - Redundancy Effect Hypothesis:
- The paper proposes the "redundancy effect" - LMs may not rely on word order when it provides redundant information. 

- To measure redundancy, the mutual information (MI) between scrambled and unscrambled sentences is used. The intuition is that higher MI means word order is less crucial for LMs to solve NLU tasks.

- Since MI is intractable to compute directly, the paper uses a variational lower bound estimated using a reordering model and a language model.

Key Contributions:
- Provides computational evidence that linguistic redundancy explains why LMs can be insensitive to word order changes. The regression analysis shows a significant redundancy effect.

- Finds that the redundancy effect varies across sentences and tasks. Tasks like SST-2 are insensitive to word order changes even with lower MI, while tasks like RTE rely more on correct word order.

- The analysis is representation and processing agnostic - focused on information overlap between inputs rather than how LMs are trained or how scrambling is done.

- Case studies on difficult negative PMI sentences show models can still reconstruct sensible outputs, demonstrating inductive bias.

In summary, the paper introduces the redundancy effect concept to account for LMs' word order insensitivity, and provides empirical analysis revealing variability across tasks and sentences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes that language models may appear insensitive to word order changes in natural language understanding tasks because linguistic redundancy allows models to rely on overlapping information from word order and other cues, with the degree of insensitivity varying across tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing the "redundancy effect" to explain why language models can be insensitive to word order changes in natural language understanding tasks. Specifically:

- The paper proposes that linguistic redundancy, where word order and other cues like case markers provide overlapping/redundant information, can explain why models exhibit insensitivity to word order changes. 

- The paper quantifies how informative word order is using mutual information between scrambled and unscrambled sentences. It hypothesizes that when the mutual information is high, word order is less crucial for models to solve NLU tasks.

- The paper estimates the mutual information using a variational approximation method and analyzes how an NLU model's (RoBERTa's) performance on various tasks changes based on the pointwise mutual information.

- The key findings are: 1) Models face difficulty handling certain low pointwise mutual information sentences, but can solve most NLU tasks that are easier to reorder. 2) The size of the "redundancy effect" varies across tasks, indicating different sensitivity levels to word order.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and providing computational evidence for the "redundancy effect" to explain model insensitivity to word order changes.

The paper examines the insensitivity of language models to word order in NLU tasks. It introduces the "redundancy effect" concept which posits that word order may not matter when it provides redundant information. Mutual information and pointwise mutual information are used to quantify the redundancy between scrambled and unscrambled sentences. A reordering model is trained to estimate the mutual information. The paper then analyzes how the consistency of language model predictions between scrambled and unscrambled sentences depends on the pointwise mutual information, finding significant variability across different NLU tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using mutual information (MI) to measure the statistical dependence between scrambled and unscrambled sentences. What are some potential limitations or challenges with using MI for this purpose? For example, how accurately can MI capture semantic similarities between scrambled and unscrambled variants?

2. The paper uses a variational lower bound on MI that relies on a reordering model (RM) and a language model (LM). What are some ways the RM and LM could be improved or adapted to provide a tighter lower bound on MI? Could other types of models be used?

3. The RM is trained on a dataset of Wikipedia sentences and their scramblings. How might the choice of training data impact the RM's ability to reorder more complex and diverse sentences from other domains? Could the RM be fine-tuned or adapted to different genres? 

4. The paper finds that the RM leverages other linguistic cues like animacy and agreement to compensate for missing word order. Could the RM's reliance on these cues become a limitation? When might these cues not be present or useful?

5. The paper argues linguistic redundancy explains models' insensitivity to word order. But could there be other explanations, like models not fully capturing compositionality? How could the redundancy account be tested more directly?

6. The paper explores redundancy's effect varying across tasks and sentences. But what specific properties of tasks and sentences modulate this effect? Could certain syntactic constructions or semantics be more redundant?  

7. For low PMI sentences, the paper shows the LM prefers declarative orders. What other strong biases might the LM have that shape its reorderings? How could we test if biases improve or hurt reordering?

8. The regression model reveals variability in tasks' sensitivity to word order. What other analysis methods could better explain these differences? Could syntactic properties be used?

9. The paper focuses on word-level scrambling. How might the findings change for morpheme or character-level scrambling? Could subword reorderings reveal more about compositionality?

10. The paper argues redundancy explains human language processing. But are direct empirical tests of this account in humans needed? Could redundancy play a different role in humans versus models?
