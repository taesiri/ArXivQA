# [Large Language Models Offer an Alternative to the Traditional Approach   of Topic Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16248)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional topic modeling approaches like LDA have limitations such as lack of semantic understanding, overlapping topics, inability to handle unseen documents without full retraining, etc.
- Closed-set topic classification requires high annotation costs and pre-defined topics that may overlap.

Proposed Solution: 
- Investigate large language models (LLMs) as an alternative approach for unsupervised topic extraction to address the limitations of previous methods.
- Develop a framework to prompt LLMs to generate topics from documents and evaluate their capability to adhere to human guidelines for refining topics.

Key Contributions:
- Show LLMs can reliably extract topics with appropriate prompting constraints and manual rules.
- LLMs can condense and summarize a large set of extracted topics into a small, interpretable set of final topics. 
- Propose evaluation metrics to assess LLM-generated topic quality for labeled and unlabeled data.
- Demonstrate LLMs can perform temporal analysis to uncover shifting topics over time in a Twitter dataset.

In summary, the paper pioneers using LLMs exclusively for unsupervised topic extraction as an alternative to classic topic modeling, guides prompt engineering to improve LLM topic quality, develops novel evaluation protocols, and shows applicability for temporal analysis - highlighting the potential of LLMs in this space.
