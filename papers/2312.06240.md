# [UIEDP:Underwater Image Enhancement with Diffusion Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06240)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called UIEDP for underwater image enhancement (UIE) that combines a pre-trained diffusion model with an existing UIE algorithm to perform conditional image generation. UIEDP treats UIE as a posterior sampling process to generate clear images given degraded inputs. Specifically, it leverages the generative priors learned by a diffusion model pre-trained on natural images to enhance the quality of images produced by an UIE algorithm, which provides pseudo-label guidance. UIEDP allows the diffusion model to compensate for inferior synthetic training data often used by UIE algorithms. Experiments demonstrate UIEDP's versatility in both supervised and unsupervised settings. By introducing diffusion priors, UIEDP consistently improves image quality over the baseline UIE algorithm across various metrics, especially no-reference metrics. The generated images also exhibit more natural characteristics. The core insight is that combining conditional guidance with pre-trained generative priors enables generating enhanced results.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Enhancing underwater images is challenging due to the unavailability of paired data (underwater image and corresponding clear image). 
- Existing methods rely on synthetic paired data which may lack realism.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate underwater image enhancement (UIE) as a conditional image generation problem - sample from the posterior p(enhanced image | underwater image).  
- Leverage a pre-trained diffusion model to capture the prior distribution of natural images.
- Use any existing UIE method to generate a pseudo-label (enhanced) image to guide the sampling from the posterior.
- The diffusion prior counters unrealism of synthetic paired data.

Key Contributions:
- Propose UIEDP - a novel diffusion-based framework for UIE that combines a pre-trained diffusion model with any UIE method.
- Diffusion prior ensures high-quality enhanced images while UIE method provides conditional guidance.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performances across metrics on standard datasets. 
- Applicable in both supervised and unsupervised settings showcasing versatility.
- Visual results demonstrate more natural enhanced images compared to other methods.
- Ablation studies validate the impact of key components of UIEDP.

In summary, this paper presents a new perspective for UIE by formulating it as conditional image generation, and demonstrates how leveraging diffusion models in this context can effectively counter the drawbacks of synthetic paired data. The versatility and consistent performance improvements of UIEDP are the main highlights.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel framework called UIEDP that combines a pre-trained diffusion model capturing natural image priors with any existing underwater image enhancement (UIE) algorithm to perform conditional generation of enhanced images from degraded underwater inputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are twofold:

1. The paper proposes UIEDP, a novel diffusion-based framework for underwater image enhancement (UIE) that approaches UIE as a conditional image generation problem. Specifically, UIEDP combines a pre-trained diffusion model that captures natural image priors with any existing UIE algorithm to guide the conditional sampling process. This allows leveraging the strengths of both the diffusion model and the UIE algorithm.

2. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed UIEDP framework. It is shown that by introducing the natural image prior through the pre-trained diffusion model, UIEDP can consistently generate enhanced images of higher quality compared to the images produced by the UIE algorithm alone that is used to guide the sampling. This holds true across various quantitative metrics as well as visually. Moreover, UIEDP is versatile as it can work in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and empirical validation of the UIEDP framework for diffusion-based conditional image generation for underwater image enhancement. UIEDP effectively harnesses the natural image prior for higher-quality enhancement.

- Image quality assessment losses

The paper proposes a new framework called UIEDP for underwater image enhancement, which combines a pre-trained diffusion model that captures natural image priors with an existing UIE algorithm to guide conditional generation. Key aspects include using the UIE algorithm to generate pseudo-label images, formulating a matching/similarity loss between the pseudo-labels and diffused images, employing image quality losses, and sampling from the posterior distribution of enhanced images conditioned on the input underwater image. The diffusion prior is leveraged to improve enhancement quality over just using the pseudo-labels. Both supervised and unsupervised settings are discussed. So the core focus is on diffusion-based conditional generation for underwater image enhancement.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a pre-trained diffusion model to introduce natural image priors. Why is capturing natural image priors important for underwater image enhancement? What benefits does this provide over other generative models?

2. The paper treats underwater image enhancement (UIE) as posterior sampling conditioned on the input degraded image. Explain the rationale behind this perspective and why it is suitable for UIE.

3. Four different guidance methods are explored in Figure 3, with guidance on the predicted image $\tilde{x}_0$ in the natural image domain found to be optimal. Analyze the relative merits and drawbacks of the other three guidance methods.  

4. The loss function contains five different terms (MAE, MSSSIM, perceptual, URanker, MUSIQ). Provide an in-depth discussion on the roles of each loss term and how they collectively guide the sampling process.

5. The variance term Σ predicted by the diffusion model is omitted during conditional sampling. Elaborate on the impact of Σ on the sampling process and the rationale behind omitting it.

6. The paper demonstrates consistent improvements over the pseudo-labeled images used for guidance. Speculate on why this occurs and the factors that contribute to UIEDP's superior performance.

7. The diffusion model is fixed while the UIE algorithm providing guidance can vary. Discuss how the choice of UIE algorithm impacts overall performance and situation where performance may degrade.  

8. Compare and contrast the relative advantages and limitations of supervised vs. unsupervised implementations of UIEDP. In what scenarios would one be preferred over the other?

9. The sampling method leverages DDPM over DDIM for diffusion. Provide an in-depth analysis on their differences and why DDPM was selected within UIEDP.

10. The paper focuses exclusively on underwater image enhancement. Discuss how UIEDP could be extended to other conditional generation tasks and the associated challenges.
