# [UIEDP:Underwater Image Enhancement with Diffusion Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06240)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called UIEDP for underwater image enhancement (UIE) that combines a pre-trained diffusion model with an existing UIE algorithm to perform conditional image generation. UIEDP treats UIE as a posterior sampling process to generate clear images given degraded inputs. Specifically, it leverages the generative priors learned by a diffusion model pre-trained on natural images to enhance the quality of images produced by an UIE algorithm, which provides pseudo-label guidance. UIEDP allows the diffusion model to compensate for inferior synthetic training data often used by UIE algorithms. Experiments demonstrate UIEDP's versatility in both supervised and unsupervised settings. By introducing diffusion priors, UIEDP consistently improves image quality over the baseline UIE algorithm across various metrics, especially no-reference metrics. The generated images also exhibit more natural characteristics. The core insight is that combining conditional guidance with pre-trained generative priors enables generating enhanced results.
