# [UIEDP:Underwater Image Enhancement with Diffusion Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06240)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called UIEDP for underwater image enhancement (UIE) that combines a pre-trained diffusion model with an existing UIE algorithm to perform conditional image generation. UIEDP treats UIE as a posterior sampling process to generate clear images given degraded inputs. Specifically, it leverages the generative priors learned by a diffusion model pre-trained on natural images to enhance the quality of images produced by an UIE algorithm, which provides pseudo-label guidance. UIEDP allows the diffusion model to compensate for inferior synthetic training data often used by UIE algorithms. Experiments demonstrate UIEDP's versatility in both supervised and unsupervised settings. By introducing diffusion priors, UIEDP consistently improves image quality over the baseline UIE algorithm across various metrics, especially no-reference metrics. The generated images also exhibit more natural characteristics. The core insight is that combining conditional guidance with pre-trained generative priors enables generating enhanced results.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Enhancing underwater images is challenging due to the unavailability of paired data (underwater image and corresponding clear image). 
- Existing methods rely on synthetic paired data which may lack realism.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate underwater image enhancement (UIE) as a conditional image generation problem - sample from the posterior p(enhanced image | underwater image).  
- Leverage a pre-trained diffusion model to capture the prior distribution of natural images.
- Use any existing UIE method to generate a pseudo-label (enhanced) image to guide the sampling from the posterior.
- The diffusion prior counters unrealism of synthetic paired data.

Key Contributions:
- Propose UIEDP - a novel diffusion-based framework for UIE that combines a pre-trained diffusion model with any UIE method.
- Diffusion prior ensures high-quality enhanced images while UIE method provides conditional guidance.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performances across metrics on standard datasets. 
- Applicable in both supervised and unsupervised settings showcasing versatility.
- Visual results demonstrate more natural enhanced images compared to other methods.
- Ablation studies validate the impact of key components of UIEDP.

In summary, this paper presents a new perspective for UIE by formulating it as conditional image generation, and demonstrates how leveraging diffusion models in this context can effectively counter the drawbacks of synthetic paired data. The versatility and consistent performance improvements of UIEDP are the main highlights.
