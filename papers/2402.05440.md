# [Improving Agent Interactions in Virtual Environments with Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05440)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In collaborative AI systems, there is a need for effective communication between different roles such as the architect (giving instructions) and builder (following instructions) for successful task completion.
- Previous efforts aimed at developing an automated building assistant in Minecraft have struggled with ensuring the assistant thoroughly understands instructions and uses them correctly.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using advanced language understanding techniques and language modeling to significantly improve language comprehension for this building task. 
- Specifically, masked language modeling is used to train the language model on the text instructions to refine and enhance understanding relevant to the building task.

Contributions:
- Presents an innovative application of state-of-the-art language models tailored to instruction comprehension for a collaborative building scenario.
- Introduces a two-step methodology involving:
   1) Fine-tuning a language model on textual building instructions to boost language abilities relevant to task
   2) Using the updated model as a foundation to then train advanced task-specific models  
- Results demonstrate proposed approach leads to substantially improved performance in following building instructions compared to previous baseline models.
- Provides analysis of model training behavior through loss metrics and learning rate evolution.
- Overall showcases promising direction in enhancing AI communication abilities for human-AI collaboration.

In summary, the key innovation is using language modeling to significantly improve an AI system's language understanding for a collaborative building task, with strong experimental results demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed solution.
