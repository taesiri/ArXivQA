## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a learning-based control strategy to regulate the density of a bacterial population inside a bioreactor. Controlling the density of microbial populations is critical for using microorganisms as efficient bio-factories for producing useful chemicals. 

The control problem is formulated as regulating the optical density (OD) of the bacterial culture, measured as absorbance, to track a desired setpoint representing the target population density. The control input is the pump flow rate of fresh media into the bioreactor. Discrete-time dynamics with piecewise constant control inputs are considered based on the hardware constraints. 

A Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm with a neural network is proposed to learn the optimal control policy in a sim-to-real manner. First, a simple mathematical model is calibrated using limited experimental data to capture the microbial growth dynamics. This model is used to generate synthetic data to train the DQN controller. Then, the trained policy is validated experimentally in vivo with an E. coli population inside a Chi.Bio bioreactor.

Performance tests demonstrate effective OD regulation to varying setpoints within 10 minutes. Robustness is verified under temperature variation affecting microbial growth rates. Comparisons to builtin PI control and model predictive control confirm competitive performance, validating the sim-to-real transferability despite uncertainties in the simple model.  

The key contributions are: 1) Experimental validation of a sim-to-real learning-based strategy for density control of microbial populations using a small data-driven model, addressing data efficiency challenges. 2) Demonstrated feasibility of transferring policies learnt in simulation to real bioreactors like Chi.Bio for precise regulation. 3) Performance matching traditional model-based methods while avoiding complex system modeling.

The proposed approach enhances the toolbox for external control of bio-reactors and sets the stage for extension to more complex co-culture regulation.
