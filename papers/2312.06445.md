# [Towards a Unified Naming Scheme for Thermo-Active Soft Actuators: A   Review of Materials, Working Principles, and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06445)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a unified naming scheme for thermo-active soft actuators to enhance clarity and searchability of research in this emerging field. The naming scheme consists of the working principle, material, and application (e.g. "Phase-Change Elastomers for Artificial Muscles"). This combines the key attributes that differentiate soft actuator technologies. The paper reviews current materials like shape memory polymers, liquid crystal elastomers, and phase change fluids as well as working principles including electrothermal, phase change, and shape memory. It evaluates soft actuator metrics like efficiency, bandwidth, power density, etc. and compares capabilities to natural muscle. Challenges like improving speed and implementing active cooling are discussed. The paper scrapes IEEE papers in the field to quantify clarity versus impact of titles using a Flesch reading score and citations per year. It finds that optimization of both clarity and impact is needed, through descriptive naming and highlighting novelty. The hope is that standardizing naming conventions will organize this complex, multidisciplinary field and enhance discoverability of innovations.
