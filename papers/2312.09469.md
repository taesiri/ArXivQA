# [Clinical Text Deduplication Practices for Efficient Pretraining and   Improved Clinical Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09469)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Clinical notes contain a lot of duplicated content due to copy-paste practices and use of templates/standardized text. This duplication leads to redundancy and inefficient use of compute resources when training clinical language models (LMs).

- While large LMs have shown ability to learn medical knowledge, they still require domain adaptation on large clinical corpora to perform well on downstream tasks. This is computationally expensive.

- There is a need to characterize duplicates in clinical text and analyze impact of deduplication on LMs and downstream tasks.

Methods & Contributions
- Identified 3 types of duplicates: within-note, between-note clinically relevant, between-note not clinically relevant.

- Developed a classifier (precision 0.98) to automatically identify not clinically relevant sentences for removal.

- Showed deduplication does not increase perplexity of clinical LMs, suggesting less redundant info and efficient knowledge encoding.

- Agnostic deduplication led to 16% perplexity decrease without harming performance on a smoking status classification task, highlighting potential for computational savings.

- Selective removal of not clinically relevant sentences also did not reduce performance on classification task, while retaining relevant medical knowledge.

Main Conclusions
- Deduplication, especially removal of not clinically relevant content, can help reduce redundancy and improve efficiency of clinical LMs without sacrificing performance on downstream tasks.

- There is potential for developing clinical LMs with less data but more efficient and specialized medical knowledge encoding through selective deduplication.
