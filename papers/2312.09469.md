# [Clinical Text Deduplication Practices for Efficient Pretraining and   Improved Clinical Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09469)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Clinical notes contain a lot of duplicated content due to copy-paste practices and use of templates/standardized text. This duplication leads to redundancy and inefficient use of compute resources when training clinical language models (LMs).

- While large LMs have shown ability to learn medical knowledge, they still require domain adaptation on large clinical corpora to perform well on downstream tasks. This is computationally expensive.

- There is a need to characterize duplicates in clinical text and analyze impact of deduplication on LMs and downstream tasks.

Methods & Contributions
- Identified 3 types of duplicates: within-note, between-note clinically relevant, between-note not clinically relevant.

- Developed a classifier (precision 0.98) to automatically identify not clinically relevant sentences for removal.

- Showed deduplication does not increase perplexity of clinical LMs, suggesting less redundant info and efficient knowledge encoding.

- Agnostic deduplication led to 16% perplexity decrease without harming performance on a smoking status classification task, highlighting potential for computational savings.

- Selective removal of not clinically relevant sentences also did not reduce performance on classification task, while retaining relevant medical knowledge.

Main Conclusions
- Deduplication, especially removal of not clinically relevant content, can help reduce redundancy and improve efficiency of clinical LMs without sacrificing performance on downstream tasks.

- There is potential for developing clinical LMs with less data but more efficient and specialized medical knowledge encoding through selective deduplication.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper demonstrates that deduplicating clinical text by removing redundant and irrelevant content allows clinical language models to encode information more efficiently without harming performance on downstream classification tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The conceptualization of three sources of duplication in clinical text: within-note duplicates, between-note clinically relevant duplicates, and between-note clinically not relevant duplicates. 

2) A classifier that can remove clinically not relevant duplicated text with high precision (0.98).

3) An intrinsic evaluation showing that deduplicating clinical text allows clinical language models to encode less redundant information more efficiently (16% perplexity decrease) while retaining medical knowledge.

4) An extrinsic evaluation showing that deduplication does not harm performance on a downstream smoking status classification task via prompt-based learning. In fact, removing not relevant sentences slightly improves performance (0.15% F1 score increase).

So in summary, the main contributions relate to characterizing and removing different types of duplicates from clinical text to create more efficient datasets for pretraining clinical language models, without harming performance on downstream tasks. The key innovation is distinguishing and removing clinically not relevant duplicates.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Clinical notes
- Language models (LMs) 
- Duplication/deduplication
- Within-note duplicates
- Between-note duplicates
- Clinically relevant vs not relevant duplicates
- Perplexity (PPL)
- Downstream classification task
- Prompt-based learning
- Pretraining and fine-tuning
- Information redundancy
- Computational efficiency

The paper focuses on analyzing duplication in clinical notes and the impact of different deduplication strategies on clinical language model pretraining and performance on a downstream smoking status classification task. Key ideas include distinguishing different types of duplicates based on clinical relevance, removing duplicates to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency without harming model performance, and showing that models pretrained on deduplicated text can still retain medical knowledge for prompt-based classification.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a classifier to identify clinically not relevant duplicated sentences. What features of the sentences does this classifier use - is it based solely on the content of the sentences or does it also utilize metadata? How robust is it to variations in writing style across notes?

2. The authors distinguish between within-note, between-note clinically relevant, and between-note clinically not relevant duplicates. What criteria do they use to categorize sentences into these groups? Is there potential for ambiguity or disagreement on categorization?  

3. The authors use perplexity (PPL) to evaluate the impact of deduplication on clinical language models. Why is PPL an appropriate metric in this context? What are its limitations? Could other metrics like accuracy on a downstream task be more informative?

4. For the smoking status classification task, the performance of models tuned on deduplicated datasets varies significantly. What explanations are provided for cases when performance increases or decreases? Are these fully convincing?

5. Could the higher perplexity on more duplicated datasets indicate that duplication leads to more diverse language rather than purely redundant information? If so, how would this affect the interpretation of results?

6. The clinically not relevant classifier is validated on n2c2 notes which have a different distribution to MIMIC/MSDW. Is this validation sufficient or should additional in-domain validation be performed?  

7. The authors suggest the classifier could help improve summarization and temporal information extraction. What modifications would need to be made to apply it in these contexts?

8. What mechanisms in transformer-based language models enable them to encode redundant information efficiently? Do the authors' findings challenge assumptions about these mechanisms?

9. For real clinical deployment, what safeguards would be needed to ensure critical information is not accidentally removed via deduplication? Is human validation required?

10. The paper focuses on English notes - would the categorization of duplicate types and the classifier transfer successfully to other languages or would significant reworking be required?
