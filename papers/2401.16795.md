# [Performance Insights-based AI-driven Football Transfer Fee Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16795)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately predicting football player transfer fees is challenging but valuable for clubs to make better recruitment decisions. 
- Player performance contributes significantly to transfer values but is difficult to quantify effectively.
- Existing methods have limitations in comprehensively evaluating player actions that contribute to scoring opportunities.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a Bayesian framework to evaluate player performance based on their actions in possession chains leading to shots on goal. 
- Compute player scores by analyzing changes in goal scoring probability before and after each action.
- Build models to predict expected goals (xG) and goal scoring likelihood from player actions.
- Integrate player scores from proposed models into algorithm to forecast transfer fee value changes.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces possession chain concept to assess player actions towards scoring opportunities in a long-term context.  
- Provides a unified algorithm combining xG, scoring probability, and economic models to predict transfer values.
- Demonstrates practical applications in analyzing real player transfer values and selecting all-tournament teams.
- Establishes interpretable and accurate models for quantifying player performance and dynamics of transfer economics.
- Offers valuable framework for data-driven decision making in recruitment and transfers for teams.

The paper makes notable contributions in holistically evaluating player effectiveness and integrating these insights into predictive models for transfer values. The proposed solution and its real-world applications demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for key decision makers in football clubs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops an AI approach to predict football players' transfer fees based on their on-pitch performance and contribution to goal-scoring opportunities, leveraging event-stream data and Bayesian modelling within possession chains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of an artificial intelligence approach to predict the transfer fee of a football player. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes a Bayesian framework to evaluate a player's performance and contribution within possession chains that culminate in a shot on goal. This allows for assessing a player's effectiveness in contributing to goal-scoring opportunities. 

2) The paper develops supplementary models for computing an expected goals (xG) metric and a goal-scoring probability predictor. These models play an essential role in evaluating a player's performance score.

3) The paper introduces an algorithm that leverages the computed performance scores to predict potential gains or losses in a player's transfer fee value over time. This algorithm serves as a valuable resource for coaches and club managers in decision-making.

4) The paper showcases applications of the algorithm on real-life data from the European Football Championship 2020. This includes predicting transfer value changes for selected players and forming a symbolic best team of the tournament based on computed performance scores.

In summary, the main contribution is a unified framework for evaluating player performance, quantifying their contribution, and subsequently using these insights to forecast transfer fee value dynamics. This provides a data-driven approach to guide decision-making in the domain of football.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions a Bayesian approach that was established in previous work and then reconstructed in this paper. Can you explain in more detail how the Bayesian approach was reconstructed and what modifications were made? 

2. Section 2.1 discusses the development of an expected goals (xG) model. What were the key features and algorithms explored for developing this xG model? What were the limitations identified with using metrics like YouTube views to capture player popularity?

3. The goal-scoring predictor plays an essential role in evaluating player performance scores. What were some of the key features and algorithm choices that enabled the goal-scoring predictor to achieve high accuracy?

4. The method computes a normalized player score to enable comparison between players (equation 8). What is the intuition behind normalizing by the number of games played? How does this ensure a fair comparison?

5. Possession chains are represented as sequences of actions culminating in a shot on goal. How exactly is a player's contribution within a possession chain formulated mathematically in equations 5-7?

6. How does the method account for differences in player positions and pitch locations when evaluating performance? Why is this an important consideration?  

7. Section 3 discusses applications to real tournament data. What were some of the practical insights and usages demonstrated through these examples? How did the method enable things like constructing a symbolic best team?

8. The paper mentions scope for enhancements by incorporating optical tracking data. What additional analyses would this enable? How could it lead to a more comprehensive modeling of actions?

9. What are some ways the transfer value forecasting model could be enhanced further? What additional parameters could be incorporated and how might they improve predictions?

10. How can managers, coaches and scouts benefit from applying these models for decision making? What kinds of decisions would be optimized?
