# [Fish-inspired tracking of underwater turbulent plumes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06091)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Oceans are under-explored and underwater vehicles have limited range/speed to accomplish widespread sampling. Targeted sampling strategies are needed where vehicles actively seek areas of scientific interest.
- Bio-inspired flow sensing could enable vehicles to autonomously track features like hydrothermal vents or phytoplankton patches, but interpreting flow signals for navigation remains an open challenge.

Proposed Solution: 
- Developed CARL, a low-cost palm-sized autonomous underwater robot with distributed pressure sensors for flow sensing.
- Used reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to learn a policy for CARL to find turbulent jet plumes, as an analogy for tracking vent plumes.
- Discovered the policy depends on the transverse velocity gradient between side sensors. Turning towards higher velocity located the plume center.  

Contributions:
- Showed a simple but effective flow gradient-following policy for navigation, learned in simulation and deployed to a physical robot.  
- Demonstrated autonomous navigation in a 13,000 liter tank - CARL located turbulent plumes over 2x more often compared to random search.
- Found performance depends greatly on sensor spacing. Wider spacing enables better gradient signal relative to sensor noise.
- Showed simulated training plus physical validation is an effective paradigm for designing bio-inspired navigation strategies.

In summary, this pioneering work makes progress towards utilising flow-gradients for robotic navigation. The results highlight design considerations like sensor spacing, signal-to-noise ratio, and overcoming simulation-to-reality gaps. This bio-inspired, learning-based approach could significantly extend the reach of autonomous underwater vehicles.
