# [Rethinking Positional Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02561v3)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can non-Fourier embedding functions be effectively used for positional encoding, and if so, what governs their performance compared to Fourier embeddings?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Positional encoding can be accomplished via systematic sampling of shifted continuous basis functions, where the shifts are determined by the coordinate positions. This allows for more flexibility compared to just using Fourier bases.

2) The performance of such an encoding scheme is governed by two main factors:

(a) The approximate rank of the embedding matrix sampled across different positions. This correlates with the ability to memorize the training data.

(b) The distance preservation between embedded coordinates, which correlates with generalization ability.  

3) Fourier embeddings are a special case that balance these two factors, but other non-Fourier functions like Gaussians can also achieve effective positional encoding with the right tradeoff.

In summary, the paper aims to provide a more general theory and understanding of positional encodings beyond just Fourier bases, analyzing the key factors that determine performance. The experiments then validate that the theoretical insights hold true empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Developing an alternative and more comprehensive understanding of positional encoding. The authors show that positional encoding can be accomplished via systematic sampling of shifted continuous basis functions, providing a more interpretable and less restrictive formulation compared to standard Fourier frequency mapping.

2. Deriving theoretical formulae to show that the performance of the proposed encoding scheme relies on two key factors - the approximate rank of the embedding matrix and the distance preservation between embedded coordinates. This provides new insight into the trade-off between memorization and generalization with positional encodings. 

3. Demonstrating that non-Fourier embedding functions like Gaussians can be used for positional encoding, with performance determined by the same trade-off. The Gaussian embedder is shown to deliver comparable or better performance than Fourier embeddings.

4. Providing impressive empirical reconstruction results on 1D and 2D signals using the proposed Gaussian embedding with coordinate MLPs. This verifies the theoretical claims in practice.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be developing a more general theory and understanding of positional encoding beyond Fourier features, supported by theoretical analysis and experimental validation. The introduction of the Gaussian embedder as a viable alternative also seems notable.
