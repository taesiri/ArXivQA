# [YAYI-UIE: A Chat-Enhanced Instruction Tuning Framework for Universal   Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15548)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional information extraction (IE) methods require building isolated models for each task and domain, limiting generalization. 
- Existing unified IE models like UIE, USM, and InstructUIE have deficiencies - UIE requires fine-tuning for each task/schema; USM has training/inference inefficiency; InstructUIE only supports English.
- There is a lack of comprehensive Chinese IE benchmarks to evaluate universal IE capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- An end-to-end chat-enhanced instruction tuning framework called YAYI-UIE that supports both Chinese and English IE.
- Two-step instruction tuning process:
   1) Dialogue instruction tuning: Fine-tune large language model (LLM) on dialogue data to obtain common sense abilities
   2) IE instruction tuning: Fine-tune the chat LLM on combined Chinese (16 datasets) and English IE benchmark to get the universal IE model
- Formulate IE tasks in a text-to-text format with instruction, input text, output structured information  
- Training involves negative sampling to improve generalization

Main Contributions:
- Propose chat-enhanced instruction tuning framework YAYI-UIE for universal IE supporting both Chinese and English
- Construct most comprehensive Chinese IE benchmark with 16 datasets across domains
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Chinese IE datasets under supervised and zero-shot settings, while maintaining good English capabilities
- Ablation study verifies effectiveness of chat-based instruction tuning for universal IE

In summary, the paper proposes a novel instruction tuning framework to address limitations of prior universal IE methods. By leveraging both dialogue and IE data, it achieves excellent performance on Chinese IE without sacrificing English capabilities. The construction of a large-scale Chinese benchmark also facilitates IE research for Chinese language.
