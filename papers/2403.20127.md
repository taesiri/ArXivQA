# [The Impact of Prompts on Zero-Shot Detection of AI-Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20127)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates the impact of prompts on the accuracy of zero-shot detectors for AI-generated text. As large language models (LLMs) have advanced, there are growing concerns about potential misuse. Detectors evaluate if a text is human or AI-generated as a defense. 

Zero-shot detectors rely on likelihood scores and do not require additional training data. However, they typically analyze texts in isolation, without considering the original prompts used to generate them. This may lead to discrepancies in likelihood assessments between the text generation and detection phases. 

The paper introduces an evaluation framework to analyze the impact of prompts on detection accuracy. It proposes white-box detection (uses prompts) and black-box detection (no prompt info). Experiments reveal a significant influence of prompts, with white-box methods improving AUC by at least 0.1 across all zero-shot detectors tested compared to black-box.

The analysis also shows the robustness of sampling-based detectors (FastDetectGPT, FastNPR) depends on sample size and replacement ratio. However, the accuracy plateaus around 10 samples for DetectGPT and NPR which rely on a separate mask model.  

Overall, the failure to reproduce likelihood used during text generation undermines zero-shot detection accuracy. The paper demonstrates the significant impact prompts have in exacerbating this issue across common likelihood-based zero-shot detectors. Combining with other robust methods could lead to more resilient zero-shot detectors.
