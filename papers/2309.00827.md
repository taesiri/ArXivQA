# [Few shot font generation via transferring similarity guided global style   and quantization local style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00827)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop an automatic few-shot font generation (AFFG) method that can capture both global style features as well as fine-grained local style details from very limited font examples?The key points are:- Existing AFFG methods using global style representations cannot capture diverse local details of fonts. - Component-based AFFG methods require pre-defined components/radicals, which is infeasible for new scripts.- This paper proposes an AFFG approach combining global and local style representations without needing predefined components. - The global style captures intra-style consistent properties like stroke thickness and spacing. - The local style focuses on inter-style inconsistent details like stroke shapes.- Local styles are transferred to self-learned components via cross-attention. - Global styles are aggregated with content similarity guidance.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that combining global style aggregation and local style transfer to self-learned components can enable effective AFFG from very few examples, without predefined components.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a font generation method that combines global and local style representations. The key contributions are:- It proposes to use a similarity-guided global style aggregator (GSA) to capture overall font characteristics like stroke thickness and spacing. The style features of reference glyphs are weighted by their content similarity with the input glyph before aggregation.- It introduces a local style aggregator (LSA) to transfer fine-grained styles to self-learned components from vector quantization, without requiring predefined components. A cross-attention module is used to efficiently transfer styles to all components in one forward pass. - The global and local representations are combined with the content features for font generation. This allows capturing both the intra-style consistent properties and intra-style inconsistent details.- Experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art results for few-shot font generation on Chinese characters. It also demonstrates good generalization to other scripts like English and Japanese.In summary, the key contribution is a hybrid global and local style transfer approach for few-shot font generation, which achieves strong results by leveraging complementary representations. The self-learned components and efficient style transfer via cross-attention are also notable features.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of few-shot font generation:- This paper focuses on developing a hybrid global and local style representation for few-shot font generation. Many recent papers have explored component-based local style representations, but this paper argues that both global and local styles are needed to fully capture a font's characteristics. The hybrid representation is a novel contribution compared to other work.- The use of vector quantization and a discrete latent space to learn glyph components in an unsupervised way is a unique aspect of this method. Other component-based approaches often rely on manual definition of components like radicals, which limits generalization to new scripts. The unsupervised learning of components is more flexible.- Transferring local styles to all components via cross-attention, instead of recomputing per input glyph, is an optimization over methods that require input-specific attention. This could make the approach more efficient.- Guiding global style aggregation using content feature similarity has been explored before, but is not as common as unconditioned global style encoding. The similarity guidance is a useful way to leverage correlations between content and style.- The training methodology using GANs, reconstruction loss, and contrastive loss for style is fairly typical for recent few-shot font generation work. The contributions are more in the architecture design than the training process.- Experiments demonstrate strong performance on Chinese fonts, and the method appears to generalize well to other scripts like Japanese. Flexibility to different character systems is an advantage over approaches tuned just for Chinese.Overall, the hybrid style representations and unsupervised component learning seem to be the major distinguishing factors of this work compared to other recent few-shot font generation papers. The results are state-of-the-art, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Here are the key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more sophisticated methods for aggregating global and local style representations. The authors mention that their current approaches for combining global and local styles are relatively simple, and more advanced techniques could be explored.- Extending the approach to other types of visual content beyond fonts, such as general image style transfer. The authors suggest the global-local framework could potentially work for other image generation tasks.- Exploring different self-supervised objectives for learning local styles instead of the contrastive loss used in this paper. Other objectives may be able to learn richer local style representations.- Applying the approach to very challenging font generation cases like highly decorative fonts. The current method still struggles with some very complex font styles.- Evaluating the approach on a larger diversity of linguistic scripts and glyph sets. The authors demonstrate it on Chinese, Japanese and English but want to test it on more writing systems.- Developing extensions to generate animated/dynamic fonts instead of just static glyphs. This could open up new application areas.- Exploring different neural architectures like transformers for the various components of the model. The authors use CNNs and VAEs but think transformers may offer advantages.In summary, the main future directions are around developing more advanced techniques for global-local style modeling, applying the approach to new data modalities and generation tasks, scaling up the evaluation, and exploring different neural architectures.
