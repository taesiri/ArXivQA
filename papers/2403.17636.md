# [Mix-Initiative Response Generation with Dynamic Prefix Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17636)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Most dialogue systems train a holistic response generation model without distinguishing responses based on initiative (i.e. whether the system is passively following or proactively leading the conversation). This leads to the cross-contamination problem where the model confuses different initiatives and generates inappropriate responses.  
- Obtaining initiative labels for training data can be expensive. Existing methods either require complex prompts or fine-tuning separate models per initiative, which is computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a mix-Initiative Dynamic Prefix Tuning (IDPT) framework to decouple initiatives into different prefix parameters. 
- In the supervised setting, IDPT recognizes initiatives and applies hard attention over prefixes to generate responses. 
- In the unsupervised setting, it applies soft attention over prefixes to consider various initiatives during generation.
- Through joint training, IDPT learns to select proper prefixes to combine with the language model for mix-initiative response generation.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes to study mix-initiative in neural response generation to improve accuracy and flexibility.
- Introduces a general prefix-based model to inject initiative factors into separate parameters for better generality and efficiency.  
- Works in both supervised (low labeled data) and unsupervised settings.
- Outperforms baselines on both automatic metrics and human evaluations. Also able to generate proper responses with specified initiatives.

In summary, the paper underscores the importance of modeling initiative in dialogue systems and proposes an effective and efficient framework to incorporate initiative signals for improved response generation.
