# [Boosting Long-Delayed Reinforcement Learning with Auxiliary   Short-Delayed Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03141)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) in delayed environments is challenging but common in real-world applications. Existing methods either suffer from the curse of dimensionality as delay steps increase (augment-based methods) or performance degradation in stochastic environments (belief-based methods).

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel Auxiliary-Delayed Reinforcement Learning (AD-RL) framework. The key idea is to introduce an auxiliary short-delayed task to help learn the original long-delayed task. Specifically, AD-RL learns the value function or policy in the short-delayed task, and uses that to bootstrap and improve learning in the original long-delayed task. This is done by defining a "delayed belief" to map information between the short and long delayed tasks.

The authors adapt AD-RL to propose AD-DQN and AD-SAC algorithms for discrete and continuous tasks. They also theoretically analyze AD-RL and show superiority in terms of (1) sample efficiency, (2) bounded performance gap to optimal, and (3) convergence guarantees.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a novel AD-RL framework to address limitations of prior augment-based and belief-based delayed RL methods
- Develop AD-DQN and AD-SAC algorithms under this framework for discrete and continuous tasks 
- Provide theoretical analysis to demonstrate superior sample efficiency, near-optimal performance gap bound, and convergence guarantees
- Empirically show state-of-the-art results on both deterministic and stochastic benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior approaches

Key Strengths:
- Flexibly addresses trade-off between efficiency and approximation accuracy using changeable auxiliary delay
- Remains near-optimal performance in deterministic cases and outperforms in stochastic cases
- Enhanced sample efficiency while achieving convergence guarantees
- State-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, especially in long-delayed stochastic environments
