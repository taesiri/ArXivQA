# [Multi-Contact Whole Body Force Control for Position-Controlled Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16465)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many humanoid and multi-legged robots are controlled in positions rather than torques. This prevents direct control of contact forces and hampers their ability to create multiple contacts to enhance balance and reach. Torque-controlled robots that enable force regulation are sensitive to model errors.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces SEIKO (Sequential Equilibrium Inverse Kinematic Optimization), a control pipeline to regulate contact forces on position-controlled robots. It models joint flexibility to link position commands to force distribution, formulating the relation as a Quadratic Program (QP) to leverage fast solvers. 

The two main components are:

1) SEIKO Retargeting: Optimizes desired whole-body configuration within feasibility limits. Handles contact transitions.

2) SEIKO Controller: Adjusts joint position commands to achieve desired contact forces and prevent torque limit violations, using the joint flexibility model. Solves a QP with objectives for force tracking, torque limits, and robustness.

Contributions:

- Formulation linking joint commands to force distribution through joint flexibility model 

- Multi-contact control architecture for position-controlled robots with smooth contact transitions

- Validation on real Talos robot for various multi-contact scenarios like pushing, far reaching, sloped surfaces

- Robustness against model errors, able to carry substantial unmodeled loads

The method extends multi-contact capabilities to position-controlled robots traditionally lacking force regulation. It is also robust to model inaccuracies, safely exploiting the robot's balance and reaching potential. This enables more capable and adaptable multi-contact behaviors on real-world deployed systems.
