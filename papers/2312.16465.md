# [Multi-Contact Whole Body Force Control for Position-Controlled Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16465)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many humanoid and multi-legged robots are controlled in positions rather than torques. This prevents direct control of contact forces and hampers their ability to create multiple contacts to enhance balance and reach. Torque-controlled robots that enable force regulation are sensitive to model errors.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces SEIKO (Sequential Equilibrium Inverse Kinematic Optimization), a control pipeline to regulate contact forces on position-controlled robots. It models joint flexibility to link position commands to force distribution, formulating the relation as a Quadratic Program (QP) to leverage fast solvers. 

The two main components are:

1) SEIKO Retargeting: Optimizes desired whole-body configuration within feasibility limits. Handles contact transitions.

2) SEIKO Controller: Adjusts joint position commands to achieve desired contact forces and prevent torque limit violations, using the joint flexibility model. Solves a QP with objectives for force tracking, torque limits, and robustness.

Contributions:

- Formulation linking joint commands to force distribution through joint flexibility model 

- Multi-contact control architecture for position-controlled robots with smooth contact transitions

- Validation on real Talos robot for various multi-contact scenarios like pushing, far reaching, sloped surfaces

- Robustness against model errors, able to carry substantial unmodeled loads

The method extends multi-contact capabilities to position-controlled robots traditionally lacking force regulation. It is also robust to model inaccuracies, safely exploiting the robot's balance and reaching potential. This enables more capable and adaptable multi-contact behaviors on real-world deployed systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a control pipeline called SEIKO that enables position-controlled humanoid robots to perform robust multi-contact tasks by modeling joint flexibility and optimizing joint position commands to indirectly regulate contact forces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. An SQP formulation that computes posture deflection and joint command correction, accounting for joint flexibility in multi-contact quasi-static conditions.

2. A multi-contact retargeting and control architecture for position-controlled robots with contact switch and pushing capabilities, designed to be robust against model errors. 

3. Validation on the hardware Talos humanoid robot with several multi-contact tasks, including the validation of their prior retargeting work, which was previously tested only in simulation for humanoid robots.

In summary, the paper introduces a control pipeline called SEIKO that enables position-controlled robots like the Talos humanoid to perform multi-contact behaviors such as pushing against surfaces and switching contacts. The key idea is to model joint flexibility and use it to indirectly control contact forces. The method is shown to work on real hardware despite model errors.
