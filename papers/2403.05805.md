# [And Then the Hammer Broke: Reflections on Machine Ethics from Feminist   Philosophy of Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05805)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Technologies of machine vision (surveillance systems, drones, iPhone cameras, etc.) are often seen as intrusive, alienating and enabling an oppressive "all-seeing" vision. They appear to enact a "god trick" - seeing everything from an impossible "nowhere", claiming infinite vision and objectivity. The paper argues that while critical analyses rightly identify harms, they have not fully appreciated machine vision technologies as material instances of embodied, situated seeing. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper offers a nuanced, materially-informed feminist reading of machine vision, drawing on computer vision research and feminist philosophy of science. It makes two key arguments:

1) Contemporary machine vision systems, unlike earlier technologies, now aim to both perceive and cognize, not just provide perceptual data to humans. Thus any "god trick" now lies in the system's own functioning, not in humans interpreting its outputs. As material systems, machines are bad at playing god, exposing their own partiality and situatedness.

2) Building machine vision directs human labor towards mapping moral reality through diverse perspectives ("quality" and "diversity"). Machine vision's workings remain transparent, resisting distorted or obscure moral vision. This opens possibilities for ethical reflection.

Main Contributions:  
- Updates Donna Haraway's landmark analysis of disembodied scientific vision using current computer vision research paradigms
- Provides an original materialist feminist reading of contemporary machine vision systems  
- Reconceptualizes the "god trick" in relation to intelligent vision systems 
- Links machine vision to Iris Murdoch's concept of "moral vision", arguing it can direct labor towards moral clarity
- Overall, argues for understanding machine vision technologies as ethically and epistemologically complex objects, not just symbols of oppression, and for focusing more philosophical attention on them.

The paper does not aim to redeem machine vision ethically or trivialize criticisms, but rather to build a richer philosophical understanding of these rapidly-developing technologies. It pushes Haraway's landmark situated knowledge concept into a contemporary machine learning context.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper argues that while machine vision technologies may appear to embody an all-seeing "god trick", their material limitations actually undermine this illusion and direct human labor in ethically significant ways.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be arguing for a more nuanced understanding of contemporary machine vision technologies. Specifically:

1) The paper analyzes how machine vision has advanced from simply an instrument used by humans (in Haraway's examples) to a technology that perceives and cognizes on its own. In this sense, the machine is now playing the "god trick" rather than humans. 

2) However, the author argues that as material technologies, machines are "bad at playing god" - they cannot actually achieve the illusion of "seeing everything from nowhere." So contemporary machine vision may undermine the notion of the god trick.

3) Further, by exposing their internal workings, machine vision directs human labor in ways that encourage ethical reflection. Even if we cannot ascribe a particular ethical orientation to machines, building and improving them requires grappling with moral realities in the world.

So in summary, the main contribution is using perspectives from philosophy, computer science, and other fields to argue for a more nuanced, materially-informed understanding of contemporary machine vision - one that sees both its potential issues as well as possible positive effects on human moral cognition. The goal is not to "redeem" machine vision ethically, but to further advance thinking on it.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the keywords or key terms associated with it appear to be:

machine ethics - This term is explicitly listed as a keyword after the abstract. The paper discusses machine vision from an ethical perspective.

feminist philosophy of science - Also explicitly listed. The paper draws heavily on feminist philosopher Donna Haraway's concept of "situated knowledges".

computer vision - The paper focuses its analysis specifically on technologies and research in computer vision.

phenomenology - The author references phenomenological concepts and thinkers like Husserl when discussing vision and perception. 

epistemology - The paper touches on themes of knowledge and knowing, especially with regards to the "god trick" of seeming objectivity.

ontology - Relatedly, there is discussion of what it means for machine vision systems to "see" the world.

surveillance - One example the author gives of problematic machine vision technology is state surveillance systems.

war - Another example given is the use of computer vision in autonomous weapons/drones.

vision - Central metaphor that grounds the author's analysis.

perception - Key aspect of vision that the paper distinguishes from cognition.

cognition - The author describes vision as a perceptual-cognitive process. 

embodiment - The paper contrasts disembodied vision with situated, embodied knowledge.

objectivity - Concept that the author critically analyzes, especially the notion of "seeing everything from nowhere."

morality - In the later sections, the author relates machine vision to moral perception and reflection.

labor - The paper concludes by focusing on how machine vision directs human labor in particular ways.

Let me know if any important keywords seem to be missing from this list!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The author argues that by understanding machine vision technologies as "Heideggerian hammers" that can break, we can better see and understand these technologies. What are some examples of how contemporary machine vision systems "break" in ways that expose their material limitations? How might we study or document those moments of breakdown?

2. The author suggests contemporary machine vision directs human labor in ethically significant ways, specifically by encouraging mapping the world through scale, diversity and quality. Can you elaborate on how this process of world-mapping encourages ethical reflection? What tensions arise in pursuing scale, diversity and quality simultaneously?  

3. The author borrows Iris Murdoch's concept of "moral vision" to argue machine vision makes its workings transparent in ways that reveal moral reality. Can you explain Murdoch's notion of moral vision in more detail? What are some examples where machine vision systems reveal moral features of a situation that may have been previously obscured?

4. How does the author's argument relate to other philosophical perspectives on technology, such as Heidegger's notions of "enframing" or Borgmann's concept of "device paradigm"? What does this feminist, materialist perspective offer that those do not?

5. The author suggests contemporary machine vision aspires to "play god" in a way earlier technologies did not. What evidence from machine vision research supports this claim? What risks or ethical issues arise from this aspiration?   

6. The author claims machine vision research has shifted from a focus on better algorithms to better mapping the world. What motivated this shift? What philosophical assumptions or beliefs underlie this world-mapping approach? What alternative approaches exist?  

7. The author argues the notion of "seeing everything from nowhere" is contradictory for material technologies. Why is this the case? Can you think of examples that challenge this claim or nuance our understanding of it?

8. How does the author's argument engage with or critique Donna Haraway's original analysis of machine vision and the "god trick"? Where do they diverge in their perspectives? Where do they align?

9. The author suggests contemporary machine vision "directs human labor" in particular ways. What ethical obligations follow from this for researchers and builders of machine vision systems? Can you elaborate on what "directing labor" means here?

10. The author claims "we cannot directly ascribe an ethical orientation" to machine vision systems. Why does the author make this argument? Do you agree? How might we ascribe or evaluate the ethics of machine vision systems if not directly?
