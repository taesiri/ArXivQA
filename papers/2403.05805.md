# [And Then the Hammer Broke: Reflections on Machine Ethics from Feminist   Philosophy of Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05805)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Technologies of machine vision (surveillance systems, drones, iPhone cameras, etc.) are often seen as intrusive, alienating and enabling an oppressive "all-seeing" vision. They appear to enact a "god trick" - seeing everything from an impossible "nowhere", claiming infinite vision and objectivity. The paper argues that while critical analyses rightly identify harms, they have not fully appreciated machine vision technologies as material instances of embodied, situated seeing. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper offers a nuanced, materially-informed feminist reading of machine vision, drawing on computer vision research and feminist philosophy of science. It makes two key arguments:

1) Contemporary machine vision systems, unlike earlier technologies, now aim to both perceive and cognize, not just provide perceptual data to humans. Thus any "god trick" now lies in the system's own functioning, not in humans interpreting its outputs. As material systems, machines are bad at playing god, exposing their own partiality and situatedness.

2) Building machine vision directs human labor towards mapping moral reality through diverse perspectives ("quality" and "diversity"). Machine vision's workings remain transparent, resisting distorted or obscure moral vision. This opens possibilities for ethical reflection.

Main Contributions:  
- Updates Donna Haraway's landmark analysis of disembodied scientific vision using current computer vision research paradigms
- Provides an original materialist feminist reading of contemporary machine vision systems  
- Reconceptualizes the "god trick" in relation to intelligent vision systems 
- Links machine vision to Iris Murdoch's concept of "moral vision", arguing it can direct labor towards moral clarity
- Overall, argues for understanding machine vision technologies as ethically and epistemologically complex objects, not just symbols of oppression, and for focusing more philosophical attention on them.

The paper does not aim to redeem machine vision ethically or trivialize criticisms, but rather to build a richer philosophical understanding of these rapidly-developing technologies. It pushes Haraway's landmark situated knowledge concept into a contemporary machine learning context.
