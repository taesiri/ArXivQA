# [Exploring the Benefits of Visual Prompting in Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12247)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can visual prompting (VP) with a pre-trained model (trained on non-private data) improve the privacy-accuracy tradeoff in off-the-shelf differentially private (DP) training mechanisms?

The authors aim to explore whether incorporating visual prompting, which allows efficient adaptation and sample-efficient learning with pre-trained models, can help construct better neural network classifiers under differential privacy constraints. 

Specifically, the paper investigates whether visual prompting can allow pre-trained models to be reused more effectively in DP training frameworks like PATE, without compromising on privacy guarantees but improving model accuracy and utility under a privacy budget. 

The central hypothesis appears to be that by leveraging visual prompting, one can attain improved privacy-utility tradeoffs in existing DP training methods like PATE, demonstrating new benefits of prompt engineering for constructing compelling differentially private classifiers.

In summary, the key research question is whether visual prompting with frozen pre-trained models can improve the privacy-accuracy tradeoff of existing DP training mechanisms for neural network classifiers. The authors hypothesize and aim to validate that VP can in fact lead to such improvements in privacy-utility.
