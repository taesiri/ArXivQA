# [$\widetilde{O}(T^{-1})$ Convergence to (Coarse) Correlated Equilibria in   Full-Information General-Sum Markov Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07890)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- No-regret learning algorithms with $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees can find approximate correlated/coarse correlated equilibria in normal-form games. However, establishing fast $O(1/T)$ convergence rates for such equilibria in Markov games is still an open problem. 

- The best known rates for correlated equilibria (CE) and coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) in general-sum Markov games are $\widetilde{O}(1/T^{1/4})$ and $\widetilde{O}(1/T^{3/4})$ respectively. Achieving $\widetilde{O}(1/T)$ convergence for CE/CCE in Markov games has been posed as an important open question.

Proposed Solution:
- For CE: 
  - Use optimistic follow-the-regularized leader (OFTRL) with log-barrier regularization, external-to-swap regret reduction, and smooth incremental value updates.
  - Establish a recursive relationship between swap regrets and best-response CE value gaps.
  - Show the non-negativity of swap regrets allows bounding maximum regret by the sum of regrets.
  - Derive a weighted per-state swap regret bound using the Regret bounded by Variation in Utilities property.
  
- For CCE:
  - Use OFTRL with negative entropy regularization and stage-based value updates.
  - Show stage-based updates induce a no-average regret problem in each stage.
  - Apply existing individual regret bounds for normal-form games within each stage.

Main Contributions:
- Established the first $\widetilde{O}(1/T)$ convergence rates to CE and CCE in general-sum Markov games, matching the best known rates for normal-form games.

- For CE, established a recursive relationship between swap regrets and CE value gaps by using the policy output method from certified policies. Showed a key property of non-negativity of swap regrets.  

- For CCE, proposed a stage-based value update method to reduce the problem to no-average regret over stages. This allows applying regret bounds from normal-form games.

- Provided numerical results to demonstrate the $\widetilde{O}(1/T)$ convergence. Showed stage-based OFTRL converges faster than smooth OFTRL for CCE.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops no-regret learning algorithms with accompanying value update procedures and establishes their fast $\widetilde{O}(T^{-1})$ convergence to (coarse) correlated equilibria in full-information general-sum Markov games.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is closing the gap in understanding the fast convergence rates of no-regret learning algorithms in general-sum Markov games to find approximate correlated equilibria and coarse correlated equilibria. 

Specifically, the paper shows that:

1) An optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader (OFTRL) algorithm with log-barrier regularization, integrated with smooth value function updates, achieves an Õ(T^{-1}) convergence rate to approximate correlated equilibria in general-sum Markov games. 

2) A stage-based OFTRL algorithm achieves an Õ(T^{-1}) convergence rate to approximate coarse correlated equilibria in general-sum Markov games.

These match the best known rates in normal-form games and improve upon prior work in Markov games that achieved slower convergence rates. The paper also provides supporting numerical results.

In summary, the main contribution is closing the gap between understanding of fast no-regret learning convergence rates in normal-form vs Markov games by developing algorithms that achieve Õ(T^{-1}) convergence to approximate correlated and coarse correlated equilibria in general-sum Markov games.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes using optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader (OFTRL) with a log-barrier regularizer for learning correlated equilibria. How does the choice of this regularizer enable obtaining the Regret bounded by Variation in Utilities (RVU) property that is key to the analysis?

2) The paper utilizes the external-to-swap-regret reduction technique of Blum and Mansour (2007) together with OFTRL. What is the intuition behind why this reduction technique can transform no-regret algorithms to no-swap-regret algorithms? 

3) The proof of the convergence rate to correlated equilibria relies on bounding the second-order path lengths of the learning dynamics. How does the non-negativity of swap regrets simplify this analysis compared to prior work on other equilibrium concepts?

4) For learning coarse correlated equilibria, the paper proposes a stage-based value update scheme. Why is this approach preferred over smooth/incremental value updates, and how does it connect the Markov game setting to analysis for normal-form games?

5) Could the stage-based updates idea be extended to also attain fast convergence to correlated equilibria? What challenges would need to be addressed?

6) The convergence rates match the best known rates for normal-form games. What aspects of the Markov game setting make the analysis more challenging?

7) What practical implementation challenges arise from the assumptions of full-information feedback and common source of randomness for coordination? How could the method be extended?  

8) Can the techniques be applied to establish fast convergence guarantees for other equilibrium concepts like Nash equilibria? What modifications would be needed?

9) How do the regret bounds compare for the different equilibrium concepts (correlated versus coarse correlated)? Why are they similar or different?

10) What insights from this analysis could guide the development of no-regret learning algorithms for more complex settings like partial information Markov games?
