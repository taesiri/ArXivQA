# [The ObjectFolder Benchmark: Multisensory Learning with Neural and Real   Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00956)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: how can we collect multisensory data from real-world objects and use it to enable research in multisensory object-centric learning? The key contributions are:1. Introducing the ObjectFolder Real (OFR) dataset, which contains multisensory measurements of 100 real household objects, including 3D meshes, videos, impact sounds, and tactile data. 2. Designing a pipeline to systematically collect high-fidelity visual, acoustic, and tactile data for real objects.3. Proposing the ObjectFolder Benchmark, a suite of 10 tasks centered around object recognition, reconstruction, and manipulation using multiple senses. 4. Conducting experiments on the neural objects from ObjectFolder V2 and real objects from OFR to analyze the distinct roles of vision, audio, and touch for different object-centric tasks.5. Demonstrating the value of OFR for transfer learning and sim2real, achieving improved performance by pretraining on OFR compared to other datasets.In summary, the central hypothesis is that multisensory modeling of real objects can enable more robust perception for various object-centric tasks, which is validated through the systematic data collection, benchmarking, and analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces the ObjectFolder Benchmark, which consists of two main contributions:1. The ObjectFolder Real dataset: This contains multisensory data (3D meshes, videos, impact sounds, tactile readings) collected from 100 real-world household objects. It represents the first dataset with comprehensive real-world visual, acoustic, and tactile measurements. 2. A benchmark suite of 10 tasks for multisensory object-centric learning: The tasks cover object recognition (e.g. cross-sensory retrieval), reconstruction (e.g. 3D shape reconstruction), and manipulation (e.g. grasp stability prediction). Experiments are conducted on both the neural objects from ObjectFolder v2 and the real objects from ObjectFolder Real.The key novelty is providing a standardized benchmark for multisensory perception research, including both simulated and real data. By releasing the dataset and benchmark tasks, the work aims to enable and catalyze new research directions in multisensory object modeling.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new multisensory dataset of real objects called ObjectFolder Real and a benchmark suite of 10 tasks for multisensory object-centric learning involving vision, sound, and touch modalities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key comparisons between this paper and other related research in multisensory object-centric learning:- Datasets: This paper introduces the ObjectFolder Real dataset, which contains multisensory data (3D meshes, videos, impact sounds, tactile readings) collected from 100 real household objects. This is the first dataset to contain all three sensory modalities for real objects to enable multisensory research. Prior multisensory datasets either use only simulated data (e.g. ObjectFolder CVPR) or are collected for a specific task. - Tasks: The paper presents a suite of 10 diverse tasks (recognition, reconstruction, manipulation) to systematically benchmark multisensory perception. In contrast, most prior work focused on a single task like 3D reconstruction or material recognition. The large task suite enables studying the distinct roles of vision, audio, and touch.- Approaches: The paper develops baseline models for each task by adapting state-of-the-art techniques like transformers. Prior work often used CNNs/MLPs for feature extraction. The systematic benchmarking reveals that combining multisensory data consistently improves performance across nearly all tasks.- Real vs Simulated: A key contribution is benchmarking on real data, in addition to the simulated neural objects from ObjectFolder CVPR. This allows quantifying the sim-to-real gap. The results demonstrate the value of real measurements for multisensory learning.- Applications: The multisensory modeling of real objects could benefit diverse applications in computer vision, robotics, VR/AR, and graphics. In contrast, most prior multisensory research focused on a single application area.In summary, the large-scale and systematic benchmarking of multisensory perception in this paper advances the state-of-the-art in object-centric learning across multiple dimensions like tasks, datasets, approaches, and applications.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Further exploration of sim2real transfer for the robotic manipulation tasks in the benchmark suite, including grasp stability prediction, contact refinement, surface traversal, and dynamic pushing. The authors provide some initial guidelines for optical calibration and elastic deformation calibration to enable sim2real transfer, but note that more work is needed in this area.- Collection of additional real-world datasets tailored for sound generation of dynamic objects and visuo-tactile cross-generation. The authors note that these two tasks cannot currently be evaluated with real data from the ObjectFolder Real dataset due to the large sim-real gap. New real datasets could help close this gap.- Development of new models and techniques to improve performance on the benchmark tasks, leveraging the datasets and standardized evaluation provided. The authors present initial baseline results but note there is significant room for improvement across many of the tasks.- Exploration of additional multisensory object-centric learning tasks that could benefit from multisensory modeling. The authors focus on 10 core tasks related to recognition, reconstruction, and manipulation, but other potential tasks could be integrated into the benchmark suite in the future.- Extension of the multisensory simulation framework to incorporate dynamics and interactions. The current ObjectFolder dataset focuses on static object properties, but modeling dynamics like sounds of interactions and physics of manipulations could be valuable future directions.- Investigation of learned multisensory representations for transfer learning and downstream tasks. The authors demonstrate some initial transfer learning results, but this could be explored further to understand what multisensory representations generalize best.In summary, the authors point to a range of promising research avenues to build upon their multisensory dataset, benchmark tasks, and baseline results in order to advance multisensory object modeling and perception. The publicly released dataset and code aims to catalyze progress in this emerging research area.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper introduces the ObjectFolder Benchmark, a new benchmark suite consisting of 10 tasks for multisensory object-centric learning using sight, sound, and touch. The benchmark tasks focus on object recognition, reconstruction, and manipulation. The paper also presents the ObjectFolder Real dataset, containing multisensory measurements of 3D meshes, videos, impact sounds, and tactile readings collected from 100 real household objects. Experiments are conducted on both the 1,000 simulated neural objects from ObjectFolder CVPR and the real objects from ObjectFolder Real. The results demonstrate the distinct value of different sensory modalities for various object-centric tasks. Vision and audio tend to be more informative for recognition while touch provides precise local geometry. Fusing multiple modalities achieves the best reconstruction, and it is possible to hallucinate one modality from another. For manipulation, vision offers global information but suffers from occlusion, while touch captures accurate local contact geometry. By releasing the new dataset and benchmark suite, the work aims to advance multisensory object-centric learning research in computer vision and robotics.

Overall, the multisensory dataset and benchmark suite provide a solid foundation to advance research in this area.
