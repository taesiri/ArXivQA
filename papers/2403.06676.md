# [CAM Back Again: Large Kernel CNNs from a Weakly Supervised Object   Localization Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06676)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recently, CNNs with large kernels have shown good performance on image classification and downstream tasks. This is attributed to their large effective receptive field (ERF). However, there is insufficient validation that larger ERFs improve downstream task performance.

- This paper revisits large kernel CNN performance on the weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) task. WSOL is more challenging as it requires discriminative localization from only image labels. 

- The paper tests if larger ERFs are indeed the main driver behind the strong performance of large kernel CNNs on downstream tasks.

Methodology:
- Compare latest large kernel CNNs - ConvNeXt, RepLKNet, SLaK - on the CUB-200 WSOL dataset using the CAM method. CAM tends to activate small discriminative object regions, making it suitable to evaluate feature maps.

- Analyze the relationship between kernel size, ERF size and WSOL performance. Also analyze feature map activations and weight distributions to understand why the CNNs perform well.

Key Findings:
- Large kernel CNNs can generate high-quality CAMs that activate entire objects, unlike traditional CAM's tendency for small region activation.

- RepLKNet and ConvNeXt, despite smaller ERFs than SLaK, produce better CAMs. Larger ERF size alone does not explain downstream task performance.  

- The architectures facilitate generation of feature maps with large activation areas. This avoids the problem of small activation regions corresponding to large weights, which improves CAMs.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a new perspective that for downstream tasks, ERF size is not the sole explanatory factor behind large kernel CNNs' strong performance. 

- Shows that RepLKNet and ConvNeXt's inherent capability to produce global activation feature maps is more crucial to performance.

- Reveals that improved feature maps in modern CNNs can avoid known CAM problems in WSOL of small discriminative region activation.

- Achieves state-of-the-art 91% CUB-200 WSOL performance by simply combining RepLKNet, data augmentation and CAM, without complex training or post-processing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper re-examines the performance of large kernel CNNs in weakly supervised object localization tasks and finds that improved feature maps, rather than larger effective receptive fields, are the main driver behind their strong performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It presents a new perspective by testing the common but little tested conjecture that large effective receptive fields (ERFs) are the main factor behind the high performance of modern large kernel CNNs like ConvNeXt and RepLKNet. Through experiments on the weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) task, the paper shows that it is difficult to position ERF size as the main driver of performance improvement.

2) It finds that the high performance of these CNNs is due to improved feature maps, which are effective at avoiding the problem of CAMs only activating small discriminative regions of objects. 

3) Experiments show that simply combining the latest large kernel CNNs with the classic CAM method and simple data augmentation can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the CUB-200-2011 dataset, outperforming more complex CNN-based WSOL methods.

4) It provides analysis and insights into the architectural properties and training dynamics that facilitate the generation of high-quality globally activated feature maps in the latest CNNs.

In summary, the main contribution is providing a new perspective and analysis that high performance stems from improved feature maps rather than large ERFs, supported by WSOL experiments and analyses of the CNN architectures.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts associated with it:

- Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) - The paper focuses on analyzing CNN performance on this downstream computer vision task which uses only image-level labels for training.

- Class activation maps (CAMs) - A classic method for generating localization maps that the paper re-evaluates using modern CNNs. The paper shows CAMs can achieve strong performance with the right CNN backbone.

- Effective receptive field (ERF) - A concept related to how much spatial context a CNN can capture. The paper questions whether larger ERFs in modern CNNs are key to their strong downstream task performance.  

- Kernel size - The paper analyzes CNNs with large kernel sizes like ConvNeXt and RepLKNet. It finds kernel size alone does not determine ERF size or downstream performance.

- Feature maps - The paper argues improvements in modern CNN feature maps, like more global activations, avoid issues like CAMs highlighting small discriminative regions. This is key to performance rather than just ERF size.

- Architecture design - The paper analyzes how architectural choices impact properties like tendency for feature maps to activate globally. It suggests architecture itself plays a bigger role than augmentation schemes.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper finds that simply combining latest large kernel CNNs with CAM can achieve state-of-the-art performance in WSOL. Why do you think the latest CNN architectures are able to overcome the limitations of CAM that have been discussed extensively in prior work?

2. The paper argues that effective receptive field (ERF) size alone cannot explain the strong performance of methods like RepLKNet and ConvNeXt on the WSOL task. What other factors do the authors identify as being important for the models' ability to generate globally activated CAMs?

3. How does RepLKNet address the problem of feature maps corresponding to negative weights (F_neg) causing localization to be narrowed down to discriminable areas? Are ConvNeXt and SLaK also able to address this issue effectively based on the authors' analysis? 

4. The authors identify two key problems that have traditionally caused CAMs to activate only local regions - relate these problems to Figure 2 in the paper. How do modern CNN architectures like RepLKNet and ConvNeXt overcome these two problems?

5. The paper identifies differences in the quality of CAMs generated by RepLKNet versus ConvNeXt - analyze the possible reasons behind this based on properties of the feature maps produced by the two models.

6. Discuss the impact of factors such as training data, pixel size, use of data augmentation etc. on the WSOL performance based on Figure 11. How can this further demonstrate that ERF size alone does not determine performance?

7. Analyze Figure 5 and relate the pattern seen for RepLKNet versus the other models to the "activation area size and weight size" problem identified for CAMs. How is RepLKNet inherently resistant to this?

8. How can analysis of the GAP values and weights for random features (Figure 12) provide insights into why ConvNeXt and RepLKNet produce more globally activated CAMs?

9. The paper proposes a simple but new WSOL method based on using the first principal component (PC1) of the feature maps instead of CAM. Analyze how this is able to achieve even higher performance than CAM for RepLKNet.

10. What architectural properties should models aim for in order to achieve the desired characteristics of producing feature maps leading to globally activated CAMs based on the analysis in this paper?
