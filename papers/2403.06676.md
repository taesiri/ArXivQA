# [CAM Back Again: Large Kernel CNNs from a Weakly Supervised Object   Localization Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06676)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recently, CNNs with large kernels have shown good performance on image classification and downstream tasks. This is attributed to their large effective receptive field (ERF). However, there is insufficient validation that larger ERFs improve downstream task performance.

- This paper revisits large kernel CNN performance on the weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) task. WSOL is more challenging as it requires discriminative localization from only image labels. 

- The paper tests if larger ERFs are indeed the main driver behind the strong performance of large kernel CNNs on downstream tasks.

Methodology:
- Compare latest large kernel CNNs - ConvNeXt, RepLKNet, SLaK - on the CUB-200 WSOL dataset using the CAM method. CAM tends to activate small discriminative object regions, making it suitable to evaluate feature maps.

- Analyze the relationship between kernel size, ERF size and WSOL performance. Also analyze feature map activations and weight distributions to understand why the CNNs perform well.

Key Findings:
- Large kernel CNNs can generate high-quality CAMs that activate entire objects, unlike traditional CAM's tendency for small region activation.

- RepLKNet and ConvNeXt, despite smaller ERFs than SLaK, produce better CAMs. Larger ERF size alone does not explain downstream task performance.  

- The architectures facilitate generation of feature maps with large activation areas. This avoids the problem of small activation regions corresponding to large weights, which improves CAMs.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a new perspective that for downstream tasks, ERF size is not the sole explanatory factor behind large kernel CNNs' strong performance. 

- Shows that RepLKNet and ConvNeXt's inherent capability to produce global activation feature maps is more crucial to performance.

- Reveals that improved feature maps in modern CNNs can avoid known CAM problems in WSOL of small discriminative region activation.

- Achieves state-of-the-art 91% CUB-200 WSOL performance by simply combining RepLKNet, data augmentation and CAM, without complex training or post-processing.
