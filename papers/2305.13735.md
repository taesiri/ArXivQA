# [Aligning Large Language Models through Synthetic Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13735)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we align large language models to human values with minimal human effort and without reliance on pre-aligned models?The key points related to this question seem to be:- Alignment learning typically requires large amounts of human feedback/demonstrations, which is costly.- Recent approaches rely on distilling data from already aligned models like InstructGPT or ChatGPT, but this still depends heavily on those teacher models. - The authors propose a new framework to align LLMs using only synthetic data, without human feedback or pre-aligned models.So in summary, the main research question is how to align LLMs efficiently using synthetic data only, reducing the dependency on human effort and pre-aligned models. The authors introduce techniques like reward modeling with synthetic comparisons and reinforcement learning from synthetic feedback to address this question.
