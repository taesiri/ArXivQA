# [Aligning Large Language Models through Synthetic Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13735)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we align large language models to human values with minimal human effort and without reliance on pre-aligned models?The key points related to this question seem to be:- Alignment learning typically requires large amounts of human feedback/demonstrations, which is costly.- Recent approaches rely on distilling data from already aligned models like InstructGPT or ChatGPT, but this still depends heavily on those teacher models. - The authors propose a new framework to align LLMs using only synthetic data, without human feedback or pre-aligned models.So in summary, the main research question is how to align LLMs efficiently using synthetic data only, reducing the dependency on human effort and pre-aligned models. The authors introduce techniques like reward modeling with synthetic comparisons and reinforcement learning from synthetic feedback to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel framework for alignment learning of large language models (LLMs) that requires minimal human labor and has no dependency on pre-aligned LLMs. 2. The key ideas are using synthetic feedback to automatically construct high-quality comparison and demonstration datasets, and training the alignment model on this synthetic data.3. Specifically, it first trains a reward model using synthetically generated comparisons between different vanilla LLM responses. 4. Then it generates synthetic demonstrations via self-play dialogues guided by the reward model. 5. The resulting aligned model called ALMoST outperforms other recent open-sourced aligned LLMs like Alpaca, Dolly, and OpenAssistant in various alignment benchmarks, while using a smaller model size.6. ALMoST does not require human feedback or distillation from pre-aligned models like InstructGPT or ChatGPT, making it more cost-effective and autonomous for alignment learning.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a novel automated framework for aligning LLMs using synthetic feedback, without human labor or dependency on external aligned models. The key ideas are automatic synthesis of comparison and demonstration data, and training the alignment model directly on this synthetic data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new framework for aligning large language models with human values that relies on synthetic training data generated from model comparisons and guided by reward modeling, rather than expensive human feedback or dependency on pre-aligned models.
