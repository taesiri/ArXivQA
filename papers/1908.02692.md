# [Approximating the Convex Hull via Metric Space Magnitude](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02692)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main research goal is to investigate how the magnitude of finite metric spaces, and related concepts like magnitude functions and weight vectors, can be used to approximate convex hulls of point sets in Euclidean space. Some key aspects include:- Defining a "moment" quantity for each point in a finite metric space that captures geometric information about that point's importance in the space. - Showing how the magnitude of a set changes when you remove points, specifically that removing points with low moment values does not affect the magnitude much.- Using this to develop an algorithm that removes low-moment points from a dataset and takes the convex hull of the remaining high-moment points to approximate the overall convex hull.- Analyzing the algorithm's complexity and testing it on some sample datasets to see how quickly it can recover a large percentage of the true convex hull volume.So in summary, the main hypothesis seems to be that magnitude and related concepts can be exploited in clever ways to efficiently approximate convex hulls, and the paper explores this idea both theoretically and experimentally. The notion of point "moments" and their use in guiding point removal seems to be a novel contribution for convex hull approximation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents an approach for approximating the convex hull of a finite set of points in Euclidean space using the concept of magnitude from algebraic topology. The key ideas and contributions are:- It investigates the weight vector of a finite metric space in more detail, and defines the "zeroth moment" of a point which captures relevant geometric information about the point's location relative to the other points. - It provides an explicit formula for calculating the magnitude of a set after removing a subset, in terms of the original weight vector. This shows that removing points with low zeroth moment does not affect the magnitude much.- It proposes using the zeroth moment to order the points, and shows experimentally that keeping just the points with highest zeroth moment provides a good approximation to the convex hull. An algorithm is presented for approximating the convex hull by removing points below a zeroth moment threshold.- Theoretical analysis is provided on how the volume of the convex hull changes after removing points ordered by their zeroth moment. This gives a bound on how much the convex hull volume can change based on properties of the removed points.- Experiments demonstrate the convex hull approximation on sample datasets in 2-5 dimensions, showing the volume estimated vs number of points kept. In low dimensions, the full convex hull is recovered using very few points.In summary, the main contribution is introducing the zeroth moment as a tool for approximate convex hull computation, providing supporting theory, an algorithm, complexity analysis, and experimental demonstration of its effectiveness. The results suggest this could be useful for accelerating convex hull calculations on large datasets.
