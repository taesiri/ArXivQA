# [TP-Aware Dequantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04925)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- As large language models (LLMs) like Llama-70B and Granite-20B continue to grow in size, efficiently deploying them for fast inference is becoming increasingly challenging. Strategies like quantization and tensor parallelism help, but have limitations in terms of latency and throughput.   

- Specifically, existing quantization schemes that optimize for accuracy via weight reordering (e.g. GPTQ with 'act_order' enabled) incur overhead from unoptimized memory access patterns and extra communication in a tensor parallel setting.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new "TP-Aware Dequantization" method that works with accuracy-optimized quantization to reduce inference latency of large LLMs deployed with tensor parallelism. 

- The key idea is to reorder the weight matrices before tensor parallel splits while preserving locality for the first layer. This avoids extra global communication between the first and second layer, a major bottleneck.

- Mathematical analysis and algorithms are provided to formally define the weight reordering and decomposition strategy.

Main Contributions:
- Up to 1.81x lower latency for Llama-70B and up to 1.78x for Granite-20B MLP layers by reducing communication overhead of existing schemes.

- Scalability improvements from optimized data access patterns that become even more significant as number of tensor parallel ranks grows.

- Applicable to transformer architectures with minimal code changes by exploiting properties of interleaved column/row parallelism and GEMM operations.

In summary, the paper delivers an efficient way to deploy accuracy-optimized quantized LLMs for fast parallel inference while preserving representational quality. The methods help address growing latency and throughput challenges as model size continues to scale up.
