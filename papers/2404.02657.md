# [Rethinking Kullback-Leibler Divergence in Knowledge Distillation for   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02657)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge distillation (KD) is used to compress large language models (LLMs) by training a smaller student model to mimic a larger teacher model. 
- Recent works argue that reverse KL divergence (RKL) is better than forward KL divergence (FKL) for KD because RKL is mode-seeking while FKL is mean-seeking. 
- However, the assumptions behind mode/mean-seeking behaviors do not hold for discrete outputs and non-Gaussian student models in LLM KD.

Key Findings:
- Empirically and theoretically demonstrate that neither mode nor mean-seeking properties manifest in LLM KD.
- FKL and RKL share the same optimization objective and converge after sufficient epochs. 
- In early epochs, FKL focuses on aligning the head while RKL focuses on the tail of teacher/student distributions.

Proposed Solution - Adaptive KL (AKL):
- Adaptively combines FKL and RKL based on distribution alignment gaps.
- Assigns larger FKL weight if head gap is larger, else assigns larger RKL weight.
- Outperforms baselines on various benchmarks and metrics.
- Improves diversity and quality of generated responses measured by GPT-4 scores.

Main Contributions:
- Revisit assumptions behind FKL/RKL behaviors in LLM KD.
- Identify early epoch alignment differences between FKL and RKL.
- Propose AKL to adaptively combine FKL and RKL for better knowledge transfer.
- Empirically demonstrate AKL's effectiveness over strong baselines on multiple tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an Adaptive Kullback-Leibler divergence method for knowledge distillation of large language models that adaptively combines forward and reverse KL divergence based on the head and tail distribution gaps to improve performance over traditional divergence approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It demonstrates empirically and theoretically that the mean-seeking behavior of forward KL (FKL) divergence and the mode-seeking behavior of reverse KL (RKL) divergence do not hold in the context of knowledge distillation for large language models (LLMs). Instead, FKL and RKL share the same optimization objective and both converge after sufficient epochs.

2. It finds that FKL focuses on the head part of the teacher distribution while RKL focuses on the tail part in the initial epochs. Based on this observation, the paper proposes a novel Adaptive KL (AKL) divergence to better align the distributions by adaptively combining FKL and RKL.

3. It evaluates AKL on various benchmarks and shows improved performance over baselines without extra parameters. GPT-4 based evaluation also indicates that AKL can improve the diversity and quality of generated responses.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the Adaptive KL divergence for knowledge distillation of LLMs, which is shown to be more effective than using FKL or RKL alone.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Knowledge distillation (KD) - The method of training a smaller "student" model to mimic a larger "teacher" model. A core concept that the paper focuses on.

- Large language models (LLMs) - The type of large neural network models that the paper looks at compressing through KD.

- Forward Kullback-Leibler (FKL) divergence - A type of divergence measure used in KD. The paper analyzes its theoretical properties.

- Reverse Kullback-Leibler (RKL) divergence - Another type of divergence. Also analyzed.

- Mean-seeking vs mode-seeking - behaviors that FKL and RKL divergence are claimed to have, which the paper challenges.  

- Adaptive Kullback-Leibler (AKL) divergence - The new divergence measure proposed in the paper to better distill knowledge from teacher to student model.

- Evaluation metrics - Accuracy metrics used such as Rouge-L scores, metrics from GPT-4 model to assess quality and diversity.

So in summary, the key terms cover knowledge distillation, the specific divergence measures, theoretical properties ascribed to them, the new proposed AKL measure, and evaluation metrics/datasets used. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper claims that the mean-seeking behavior of forward KL (FKL) and mode-seeking behavior of reverse KL (RKL) do not manifest in knowledge distillation for large language models (LLMs). What evidence and analysis do they provide to support this claim both empirically and theoretically?

2. The paper states that FKL and RKL share the same optimization objective in LLM knowledge distillation - forcing the student model to generate the same logits as the teacher model. Can you explain the sufficiency and necessity proof provided in Appendix A to demonstrate this claim mathematically? 

3. The key insight of the proposed Adaptive KL (AKL) method is to assign larger weights to FKL or RKL based on the gaps in the head vs tail parts of the distributions. Can you walk through how the head/tail gaps and weighting scheme are defined, particularly the indicate mask M?

4. One of the benefits claimed for AKL is improved diversity in generated responses. What specifically about adaptively combining FKL and RKL is hypothesized to improve diversity compared to using either divergence alone?

5. The GPT-4 based evaluation involves scoring for both diversity and quality. What do you think the limitations are of using another large language model for evaluation versus human evaluation?  

6. The paper evaluates performance on a variety of subtasks from the Dolly dataset. What pattern do you notice in terms of FKL vs RKL performance on different subtask types? How does AKL compare?

7. What ablation study did the authors perform to validate the weighting scheme used in AKL, and what can be concluded from this ablation?

8. In the case study examples, what benefits do you notice in the responses generated by AKL compared to other methods, in terms of inheriting knowledge from the teacher model?

9. The paper claims AKL improves performance without any extra parameters. Do you think AKL could be extended to incorporate additional parameters, and if so, what might be some ways to do that? 

10. How do you think the AKL method could perform in a setting with a larger discrepancy between teacher and student model size or a noisier teacher model? What adjustments might help improve robustness?
