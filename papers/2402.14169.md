# [A Temporal Bias Correction using a Machine Learning Attention model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14169)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Climate models are biased compared to real-world observations, affecting impact studies and policy-making. 
- Existing bias correction (BC) methods cannot adjust for temporal biases related to long-range climate statistics like heatwave duration. They disregard temporal dependencies by collapsing time series data into histograms.

Proposed Solution:
- Recast BC as a probability model instead of just an algorithmic procedure. This allows combining it with state-of-the-art machine learning attention models.
- Propose a time-series probability model that considers dependencies of past observations and future climate model outputs to enable temporal BC.  
- Implement the model using the Taylorformer, an attention-based deep learning architecture adapted for sequential real-valued data.

Experiments:
- Case study correcting heatwave duration statistics in Abuja and Tokyo using IPSL climate model data and reanalysis tools as observations. 
- Achieved much lower RMSE compared to alternative BC methods.
- Accurately corrected the number of heatwaves for various thresholds compared to raw climate model outputs and other BC methods. Ensemble average differed by â‰¤1% from observations.

Main Contributions:
- First methodology to extract long-range temporal climate statistics like heatwave duration for bias correction.
- Key idea of reformulating BC as a probability model to harness state-of-the-art ML models.
- Demonstrated significantly improved performance over previous BC methods for heatwave duration correction.
- Opens up ability to do temporal bias correction to enable more precise climate impact studies.

In summary, the paper offers a novel machine learning approach to solve the problem of bias correcting temporal climate statistics by recasting bias correction as a probabilistic time series model and using attention-based deep learning models. This is demonstrated through a case study of accurately correcting heatwave duration distributions.
