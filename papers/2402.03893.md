# [Prediction Horizon Requirements for Automated Driving: Optimizing   Safety, Comfort, and Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03893)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates the impact of different prediction horizons on the safety, comfort, and efficiency of automated vehicles (AVs) in scenarios involving crossing pedestrians. 

Problem:
Most trajectory prediction methods do not consider the impact of the chosen prediction horizon on the AV's behavior. Hence, requirements regarding necessary and optimal prediction horizons remain undefined.

Proposed Solution:
The authors simulate an ideal prediction model with varying horizons up to 20 seconds. These predictions are integrated into a risk-based trajectory planner that considers predicted pedestrian trajectories. By analyzing resulting AV behavior across different prediction horizons, they quantify the relationship between prediction horizon and AV performance.

Based on their analysis, the authors introduce a framework to derive application-specific prediction horizon requirements tailored to AV performance goals and intended operational design domains.

Main Contributions:
- Impact analysis exploring the relationship between prediction horizons and AV safety, comfort and efficiency.
- A versatile methodology to determine required and optimal prediction horizons based on targeted AV performance metrics and scenarios.
- Recommended horizons for AVs in environments with crossing pedestrians: 1.6 seconds minimum to prevent collisions, 7-8 seconds for optimal efficiency, 10-15 seconds for comfort. Overall optimal horizon of 11.8 seconds suggested.

The framework enables catering predictions to intended AV applications. For instance, for a driverless taxi application emphasizing passenger comfort over efficiency, longer prediction horizons would be recommended compared to an application focused on minimizing delivery times.

Limitations include perfect prediction assumptions, limited scenarios considered so far, and reliance on a single trajectory planner.
