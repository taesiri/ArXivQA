# [MolTC: Towards Molecular Relational Modeling In Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03781)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Molecular relational learning (MRL), which aims to understand interactions between molecular pairs, plays a pivotal role in advancing biochemical research. 
- Current LLM-based methods for MRL rely predominantly on textual data and do not fully exploit the structural information in molecular graphs. 
- Absence of a unified LLM-based framework exacerbates insufficient data exploitation as it hinders sharing of interaction mechanisms learned across datasets. This is especially problematic for tasks with limited labeled pairs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes MolTC, a novel LLM-based multi-modal framework for molecular interaction modeling based on the chain-of-thought (CoT) theory.
- MolTC employs graph neural networks (GNNs) to explicitly gather graphical information of molecular pairs and integrates them into the LLM's input space using two projectors. 
- To enable unified learning, MolTC develops a dynamic parameter sharing strategy to promote cross-dataset information exchange.
- A multi-hierarchical CoT theory is introduced to refine MolTC's training - broad-grained CoT for understanding individual molecules, and fine-grained CoT for predicting precise interactions.
- The paper also constructs MoT-instructions, a comprehensive instruction dataset for enhancing biochemical LLMs for MRL.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes MolTC, the first unified LLM-based multi-modal framework for molecular interaction modeling.
- Introduces multi-hierarchical CoT theory to enhance MolTC's training process.
- Constructs MoT-instructions, the first instruction dataset tailored for LLM-based molecular relational learning.
- Experiments over 4 million molecular pairs across 12 datasets demonstrate MolTC's superiority over GNN and LLM baselines.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed MolTC solution and its main components, strategies like multi-hierarchical CoT and dynamic parameter sharing, the new MoT-instructions dataset, and the experimental evaluation. It highlights the main contributions - the novel unified framework, training refinements, and new dataset.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes MolTC, a novel LLM-based multi-modal framework for molecular interaction modeling that effectively integrates graphical information of molecular pairs using GNNs and introduces strategies like dynamic parameter sharing and multi-hierarchical chain-of-thought training to enable efficient learning across datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It identifies the issue of insufficient data exploitation in current LLM-based molecular relational learning (MRL), and takes the first attempt to develop a unified multi-modal framework for LLM-based MRL, named MolTC.

2. It introduces the multi-hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT) theory to enhance MolTC's training process, especially for quantitative interaction tasks. 

3. It constructs MoT-instructions, the first comprehensive instruction dataset in the MRL domain, to enhance the development of biochemical LLMs involving MRL.

4. Experiments across over 4 million molecular pairs in various domains like drug-drug interaction and solute-solvent interaction demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over current graph neural network and LLM-based baselines.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel unified framework MolTC that integrates graphical information and language models for molecular relational learning, along with enhancements like multi-hierarchical CoT and the MoT-instructions dataset to improve performance. The effectiveness is shown through extensive experiments.
