## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates the impact of ground truth quality on the performance of deep learning models for handwritten text recognition (HTR). The authors focus on systematic alignment errors between text line images and transcriptions in the Bullinger historical handwriting dataset, such as wrongly hyphenated words across lines. They propose methods to automatically detect typical errors and manually correct parts of the test set. Experiments with state-of-the-art HTR models PyLaia and TrOCR show a significant difference in performance when evaluating on the original erroneous test set versus the corrected version, indicating that recognition accuracy is underestimated. Attempts to filter the training set for higher-quality samples lead to a trade-off between quantity and quality, where keeping more data generally works better. The study demonstrates how error analysis and correction are crucial for reliable benchmarking of HTR systems. It also shows the difficulty of automating cleanup for historical handwritten documents. The authors plan to expand the analysis to more datasets and language types, invest in better tools to support manual error correction, and explore synthetic data generation to complement real training data.
