# [Efficient Fine-Tuning with Domain Adaptation for Privacy-Preserving   Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05126)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Using encrypted images for training and testing deep neural networks (DNNs) helps protect privacy. However, it degrades the model performance compared to using plain images.
- Traditional encryption methods like homomorphic encryption have high computational costs, making them difficult to apply to state-of-the-art DNNs.
- Federated learning protects privacy during training but not during inference on test data.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a domain adaptation method to efficiently fine-tune the Vision Transformer (ViT) using encrypted images, avoiding performance degradation.

- Images are encrypted using block scrambling (permuting image blocks) and pixel shuffling (permuting pixels within each block) based on secret keys.

- The model is first pre-trained on plain images. Before fine-tuning on encrypted images, domain adaptation is applied:
    - The position embedding matrix is transformed based on the block scrambling matrix to match the block permutations.  
    - The patch embedding matrix is transformed based on the pixel shuffling matrix to match the pixel permutations.

- This adapted model is then fine-tuned on encrypted images. Test images are encrypted using the same keys and tested on the fine-tuned model.

Main Contributions:
- The proposed method maintains nearly the same classification performance as models trained on plain images, even when using encrypted images.

- It avoids the performance degradation caused by encryption that other methods suffer from. 

- It achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art encrypted learning methods on CIFAR and Imagenette datasets.

- Fine-tuning on encrypted images with domain adaptation is as efficient as training on plain images regarding convergence time and loss.

In summary, the paper presents an effective domain adaptation approach to enable privacy-preserving fine-tuning of Vision Transformers without degrading performance or efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a domain adaptation method to efficiently fine-tune a Vision Transformer with encrypted images for privacy-preserving image classification while avoiding performance degradation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a domain adaptation method to reduce the performance degradation of privacy-preserving Vision Transformer (ViT) models trained on encrypted images. Specifically:

- The paper proposes adapting the position and patch embeddings of ViT to match the transformations done by the image encryption method. This allows fine-tuning a pre-trained ViT model on encrypted images with minimal performance drop.

- Experiments show that with the proposed domain adaptation, ViT models fine-tuned on encrypted images can achieve comparable accuracy to models trained on plain images on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Imagenette datasets. 

- The adapted ViT model with encrypted images outperforms prior privacy-preserving image classification methods in terms of accuracy, while protecting the visual information in the images.

In summary, the key contribution is an effective domain adaptation approach to enable privacy-preserving fine-tuning of Vision Transformers without significant degradation in accuracy, through matching the embeddings to the image encryptions.
