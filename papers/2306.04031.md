# [Certified Reasoning with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04031)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop methods that combine the flexibility of language models with the reliability of formal logical reasoning? More specifically, the paper is investigating how to integrate language models like GPT-3 with formal theorem proving tools in order to perform more reliable and verifiable multi-step reasoning. The key ideas explored are:- Developing "guide" tools that language models can invoke to constrain generation to valid outputs according to logical rules. - Implementing a specific guide called LogicGuide that interfaces with an external theorem prover and allows a language model to make certifiably sound inferences.- Evaluating LogicGuide on question answering and reasoning tasks to see if it improves accuracy and mitigates issues like content bias. - Using LogicGuide for safer self-improvement of models by training only on certified reasoning chains.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that guide tools like LogicGuide can make language model reasoning more accurate and trustworthy by integrating symbolic logical guarantees while retaining the flexibility of natural language generation. The experiments aim to validate whether LogicGuide actually achieves those goals in practice.
