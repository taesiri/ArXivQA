# [Certified Reasoning with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04031)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can language models perform logical reasoning in a way that is more reliable and verifiable, by leveraging external theorem proving tools?

The key ideas presented are:

- Introducing "guide" tools that can constrain the generation of language models to valid outputs determined by an external system.

- Implementing a guide called LogicGuide that allows language models to formalize assumptions, set proof goals, and make sound inferences validated by an external theorem prover.

- Showing empirically that using LogicGuide significantly improves the reasoning accuracy of models like GPT-3 and reduces undesirable effects like content bias.

- Demonstrating that LogicGuide allows more effective self-improvement of reasoning abilities through learning from the model's own certified solutions.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that integrating language models with formal logical tools through "guides" like LogicGuide can lead to more reliable and verifiable reasoning compared to language models alone. The experiments and results provided seem intended to validate this overall hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be introducing a framework of "guide" tools for language models to perform more reliable reasoning. Specifically, it presents LogicGuide, which allows language models to leverage an external theorem prover to make logically certified inferences. The key ideas are:

- Guides are tools that constrain the language model's generation to a valid set of outputs at certain points during decoding. This allows integrating external knowledge to guide the model. 

- LogicGuide is implemented using the Peano theorem prover. It allows models to formalize assumptions, set proof goals, and make sound inferences in between natural language text.

- LogicGuide is shown to significantly improve the accuracy of GPT-3, GPT-3.5 and LLaMA on reasoning datasets like PrOntoQA and ProofWriter. It also helps reduce content bias and makes models abstain rather than make unsupported guesses.

- LogicGuide enables effective self-improvement of LLaMA via training only on its certified solutions, avoiding learning from accidental correctness.

Overall, guides like LogicGuide seem to be a promising approach to combine the reliability of formal logical reasoning with the flexibility of language models for more robust text generation. The main novelty is leveraging constrained decoding to integrate external knowledge into language models in a more declarative way during inference.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related work in natural language reasoning and language model reasoning:

- This paper introduces a new method for improving language model reasoning by using "guide" tools to constrain generation. Other related work has focused on improving reasoning through prompt design, training objectives, or model architectures. The use of external tools to guide reasoning is a novel approach.

- The LogicGuide tool allows language models to leverage formal logical reasoning to certify inference steps. Other work integrating language models and logic has focused more on translating natural language into logical forms or proving theorems, rather than using logic to guide free-form reasoning. 

- The paper shows LogicGuide improves reasoning accuracy across multiple datasets like PrOntoQA, ProofWriter, and Syllogistic Reasoning. Other work has tended to focus evaluation on a single benchmark. Showing broad improvements highlights the generality of the approach.

- For mitigating content bias, LogicGuide is compared to prior analysis on the Syllogistic Reasoning dataset. The significant reduction in content bias demonstrates advantages over unmodified language models.

- For self-improvement, LogicGuide enables more effective learning from the model's own solutions compared to prior work like STaR. The ability to distinguish certified vs. guessed solutions allows more robust learning.

- The exploration of logic-guided reasoning is more in-depth compared to prior work introducing tool use in language models. The framework of "guide" tools is more general than input-output based tools.

In summary, this paper presents a novel approach to language model reasoning, demonstrates broad improvements across several reasoning benchmarks, analyzes the approach from multiple angles, and develops more general tool interaction paradigms. It significantly advances the state-of-the-art in language model reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper discusses several future research directions and opportunities:

- Developing additional guide tools beyond LogicGuide, such as tools for tracking variables and state, generating trusted quotes from a knowledge base, mathematical reasoning, etc. The framework of guide tools provides a rich space for integrating symbolic and neural methods.

- Further exploring the theoretical computational capabilities of Transformers augmented with guides, as they provably expand what can be modeled compared to unaugmented Transformers. There is an opportunity for more formal analysis of these hybrid systems.

- Improving the robustness of guide tools like LogicGuide, for example by handling ambiguity and vagueness in natural language when translating to logic, and by improving the planning abilities of models so they can make useful chains of inferences.

- Exploring self-improvement methods like STaR that leverage guide tools to avoid learning from possibly incorrect rationales. The paper shows this is a promising direction.

- Developing guides as tools for language model agents, for example to improve reliability and interpretability when reasoning about which actions are permissible in a given context.

- Using guides to collect high-quality reasoning data from language models, which can then be used to improve unaugmented models.

Overall, the authors point to guides as a way to combine the complementary strengths of neural and symbolic methods, in order to build more reliable and transparent language-based reasoning systems. They suggest many promising research avenues in developing new guide tools, analyzing their capabilities, and leveraging them to improve reasoning in language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces the concept of guide tools for language models. Guide tools constrain the generations of a language model within delimited blocks to be one of a set of valid outputs determined by the tool. The authors propose a general framework for defining guide tools and implementing them using constrained semantic decoding. As a key example, they introduce LogicGuide, which allows language models to perform sound logical reasoning by formalizing assumptions, setting proof goals, and making inferences that are certified by an external theorem prover (Peano). Experiments demonstrate that guide tools and LogicGuide significantly improve the accuracy of language models like GPT-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and LLaMA 13B on multi-step reasoning datasets including ProofWriter, PrOntoQA, and a newly introduced dataset called DeontiQA. Using LogicGuide is also shown to reduce content effects that lead models to make unsound inferences based on prior beliefs. Additionally, the authors find that certifying reasoning steps enables effective self-improvement of LLaMA's reasoning abilities through the Self-Taught Reasoner method. Overall, guide tools provide a promising approach to combine the flexibility of language models with the reliability of formal logical reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a class of tools called "guides" that can be invoked by language models like GPT-3 to constrain their own generation to a set of valid statements provided by the tool. The key idea is that the guide computes a space of valid generations based on the context so far, and the language model uses its own probabilities to sample one of these valid options. This allows the model to leverage external logical reasoning while retaining the flexibility of natural language generation. 

The authors focus on a tool called LogicGuide which allows models to formalize assumptions as axioms, set proof goals, and make sound inferences using an external theorem prover. Experiments on reasoning datasets like PrOntoQA and ProofWriter show LogicGuide significantly improves the accuracy of GPT-3, reducing faulty reasoning and mitigating issues like content bias. The tool also enables effective self-improvement, allowing a model like LLaMA to bootstrap reasoning skills from its own certified solutions. Overall, guides provide a promising approach to combine trustworthy symbolic reasoning with flexible neural models in an interpretable text interface.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces the idea of "guide" tools for language models. A guide is a tool that can be invoked by a language model during generation to constrain its output to a valid set defined by the guide. The key example explored is the LogicGuide, which allows a language model to perform logical reasoning steps that are formally certified by an external theorem proving environment (specifically Peano). The LogicGuide lets the model formalize assumptions and goals, and make inference steps using special delimiters during generation. The inference steps are constrained to match valid deductions in the theorem prover's state given the assumptions, ensuring sound reasoning. Overall, guide tools allow combining the flexibility of language models with constraints and state from more rigid but reliable external systems. The LogicGuide demonstrates improving reasoning accuracy and reducing biases like content effects by grounding language model inferences.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is addressing is how to improve the reliability and interpretability of reasoning by large language models (LLMs). 

Specifically, the paper notes that LLMs often achieve higher accuracy on complex reasoning tasks when prompted to reason step-by-step. However, their reasoning can still suffer from issues like being unsound, inconsistent, or relying on undesirable assumptions. 

To address these issues, the paper introduces the idea of "guide" tools that can constrain and guide an LLM's generation during reasoning. The main guide tool introduced is LogicGuide, which allows an LLM to leverage formal logic tools to ensure its reasoning steps are sound.

The overall goals seem to be:

- Improving the accuracy and reducing failures in LLM reasoning by enforcing logical soundness

- Mitigating "content effects" where an LLM's reasoning is unduly influenced by its prior beliefs 

- Enabling LLMs to learn from and improve their own reasoning by relying on LogicGuide to identify certified correct reasoning traces

- Providing a general framework (guides) to combine the flexibility of LLM reasoning with constraints/tools that ensure reliability

So in summary, the key problem is enhancing LLM reasoning to be more reliable and interpretable. The proposed solution is guide tools like LogicGuide that certify soundness.
