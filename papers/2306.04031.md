# [Certified Reasoning with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04031)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop methods that combine the flexibility of language models with the reliability of formal logical reasoning? 

More specifically, the paper is investigating how to integrate language models like GPT-3 with formal theorem proving tools in order to perform more reliable and verifiable multi-step reasoning. The key ideas explored are:

- Developing "guide" tools that language models can invoke to constrain generation to valid outputs according to logical rules. 

- Implementing a specific guide called LogicGuide that interfaces with an external theorem prover and allows a language model to make certifiably sound inferences.

- Evaluating LogicGuide on question answering and reasoning tasks to see if it improves accuracy and mitigates issues like content bias. 

- Using LogicGuide for safer self-improvement of models by training only on certified reasoning chains.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that guide tools like LogicGuide can make language model reasoning more accurate and trustworthy by integrating symbolic logical guarantees while retaining the flexibility of natural language generation. The experiments aim to validate whether LogicGuide actually achieves those goals in practice.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be introducing a framework of "guide tools" for language models, and specifically a tool called LogicGuide that allows language models to perform logically sound reasoning. 

The key ideas are:

- Guide tools allow language models to invoke external constraints during text generation. When a guide tool is triggered, it defines a set of valid outputs the language model can generate.

- LogicGuide is a specific guide tool that interfaces with an external logical reasoning system. It allows the language model to formalize assumptions, set proof goals, and make logically valid inferences. 

- LogicGuide significantly improves the accuracy of language models like GPT-3 and LLaMA on multi-step natural language reasoning tasks. It helps avoid unsound inferences and reduces problematic "content effects".

- LogicGuide enables more effective self-improvement of language models through learning from their own certified reasoning chains. This avoids reinforcing possible reasoning mistakes.

Overall, guide tools like LogicGuide provide a way to combine the flexibility of large language models with the reliability of formal logical systems for improved reasoning capabilities. The main contribution is showing how this hybrid approach can work in practice.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points of comparison between this paper on certified reasoning with language models and related work:

- This paper introduces the idea of "guide" tools for language models that use incremental constraints during decoding to steer generation towards valid statements. This is a novel approach not explored in prior work on improving reasoning with language models. 

- The paper demonstrates the efficacy of this approach by implementing LogicGuide, which leverages an external theorem prover to certify logical inferences made by the language model. This differs from past work that aimed to make models more logically consistent through specialized training objectives or model architectures.

- The authors show LogicGuide reduces content bias and enables effective self-improvement through training on the model's own certified chains of reasoning. This provides a new solution to known issues in language model reasoning like content bias and learning from possibly incorrect rationales. 

- In terms of the external logic system, the use of dependent type theory in Peano differentiates this from most prior work interfacing LLMs with logic, which use classical first-order logic. The incremental proof generation in Peano is particularly suited to guide generation.

- The evaluation benchmarks are mostly standard reasoning datasets used across multiple recent papers. The new DeontiQA dataset for deontic reasoning complements existing resources.

Overall, this paper introduces a novel technique for certified reasoning with pre-trained language models. The guide framework and LogicGuide implementation demonstrate a promising new direction for combining logical and neural methods to improve reliability and interpretability of language model inference. The self-improvement results also open interesting avenues for future work on bootstrapping reasoning abilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions. Some key directions mentioned include:

- Developing more sophisticated guide functions that can handle more complex state and interactions. The LogicGuide explored in the paper is a proof-of-concept, but more advanced guides could be created.

- Exploring other external reasoning/inference systems besides Peano that could integrate with guides, such as SAT solvers, SMT solvers, or other theorem provers.

- Applying the guide framework to other domains beyond logical reasoning, such as mathematical reasoning, knowledge base question answering, acting in reinforcement learning environments, etc.

- Analyzing the theoretical computational capabilities of guided language models compared to unguided ones, building on results like the Parity problem result discussed in the paper.

- Developing methods to help language models better translate natural language into formal representations, and integrating these with guides to minimize formalization errors.

- Exploring the use of guides for safe/reliable fine-tuning and self-improvement of language models, as shown with the LogicGuide + STaR experiments.

- Developing techniques to help language models better plan and choose useful inferences when proving theorems, rather than just exploring valid deductions.

In summary, the key future directions are developing more advanced guide tools and integrating them with language models for reliable reasoning and inference across diverse tasks and domains. There are many opportunities to build on the LogicGuide paradigm to make language model reasoning more robust and trustworthy.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new class of tools called "guides" for language models. Guides are functions that take in the history of a language model's generations and return a set of valid next outputs. The authors implement a guide called LogicGuide that interfaces with an external theorem prover. LogicGuide allows the language model to formalize assumptions, state proof goals, and make logically sound inferences in between free-form natural language text. The authors show that using LogicGuide significantly improves the accuracy of GPT-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and LLaMA on reasoning datasets like PrOntoQA and ProofWriter. It also reduces undesirable content effects that influence reasoning performance. Finally, the authors find that LogicGuide enables effective self-improvement of LLaMA's reasoning through iterative training on its own generated solutions. Overall, guides provide a way to combine the flexibility of neural text generation with the reliability of symbolic reasoning tools.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the idea of guide tools for language models as a way to constrain and direct their generations. Guide tools define a set of valid outputs that the language model can generate from when invoked. The authors propose LogicGuide, which allows language models to perform logical reasoning by declaring objects, properties, relations and axioms that are passed to an external theorem prover. The language model can then make provably valid inferences under the logic formalization that it provided. 

Experiments demonstrate that guide tools like LogicGuide can significantly improve the accuracy of language models like GPT-3, GPT-3.5 and LLaMA on multi-step reasoning datasets. LogicGuide reduces the occurrence of unsound and inconsistent reasoning, as well as content bias effects that language models exhibit, allowing them to reason more reliably. The authors also show that LogicGuide enables effective self-improvement of reasoning abilities through a method like STaR, where the model learns from its own successful reasoning examples. Overall, guide tools point towards a promising approach for combining the flexibility of language models with the reliability of symbolic reasoning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a framework of "guide tools" for language models, specifically a tool called LogicGuide that allows models to perform certified logical reasoning. The key idea is that the language model can invoke LogicGuide to constrain its generation to valid logical inferences determined by an external theorem prover. When the model generates special delimiter tokens, the decoding is constrained so the model must produce one of the valid inferences returned by LogicGuide, based on its previous steps. In this way, the language model can produce reasoning chains that are guaranteed to be logically sound with respect to its assumptions. The authors show this framework significantly improves the accuracy of models like GPT-3 and mitigates issues like content bias in reasoning. They also explore using LogicGuide to allow an LLM to improve itself by learning only from its own certified reasoning steps. Overall, the framework integrates symbolic logical reasoning with the flexibility of neural language models in a unified natural language interface.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, it seems this paper is addressing the issue of how to improve the reliability and soundness of reasoning by language models. The key questions and problems it is tackling are:

1) Language models often make unsound inferences and exhibit "content effects" where their reasoning is influenced by prior beliefs rather than logical validity. This makes their reasoning unreliable. 

2) Formal reasoning systems like theorem provers can produce certified logical deductions, but require full formalization and don't provide natural language explanations. 

3) The authors want to combine the flexibility of language models with the reliability of formal systems to get the best of both - flexible yet sound reasoning expressed in natural language.

4) Specifically, they introduce "guide" tools that constrain language model generation to valid outputs, and use this to build LogicGuide which allows models to perform provably sound reasoning steps. 

5) They aim to show LogicGuide improves reasoning accuracy, reduces content effects, and enables models to self-improve by learning from provably correct reasoning.

In summary, the key problem is improving the logical soundness and reliability of language model reasoning, while retaining the flexibility of natural language generation. The paper introduces LogicGuide as a way to address this by constraining models to certified logical inferences.
