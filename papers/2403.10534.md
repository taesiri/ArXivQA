# [VISREAS: Complex Visual Reasoning with Unanswerable Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10534)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing visual question answering (VQA) datasets and models lack the ability to validate the authenticity and relevance of questions before providing an answer. This causes issues when models receive invalid or improperly formulated questions.
- Current VQA research focuses on answering questions about single objects and their attributes/relations, rather than reasoning about commonalities between multiple objects.
- Generative VQA models that produce reasoning programs rely heavily on external modules and APIs, limiting accessibility and end-to-end training.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce VisReas, a new VQA dataset with over 2 million questions requiring complex reasoning about objects, attributes and relations. Questions are labeled as answerable or unanswerable based on alignment with the image.
- Propose Logic2Vision, a modular VQA model that uses a language model to produce pseudocode representing reasoning steps. The pseudocode is then executed on the image by a visual-language model to produce the answer.

Main Contributions:
- VisReas dataset that emphasizes multi-object spatial reasoning and validating question authenticity before answering.
- Logic2Vision model that performs interpretable step-by-step reasoning fully within a single visual-language model, without reliance on external modules.
- Analysis showing Logic2Vision outperforms state-of-the-art generative and classification VQA models on VisReas by a significant margin.

The key innovation is the focus on verifying question relevance and chaining logical reasoning steps on sets of objects and relations before answering, unlike prior VQA research. The introduced dataset and modular model aim to push progress on robust, semantically-grounded VQA.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces VisReas, a new visual question answering dataset that contains both answerable and unanswerable questions requiring complex reasoning over objects, attributes, and relations in images, along with a new baseline model, Logic2Vision, that produces executable pseudocode to answer questions through step-by-step reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are twofold:

1. The introduction of the \ourdata dataset for complex and multi-hop visual reasoning and compositional question answering. The key features of this dataset are:

- It contains both answerable and unanswerable queries to enforce models to validate question relevance before answering. 

- It requires reasoning over commonalities and differences among multiple objects based on their attributes and relations.

- The questions are automatically generated using scene graphs to cover diverse reasoning over relations, attributes, counting, comparisons, etc.

2. The proposal of a new baseline model called \ours that generates and executes pseudocode for question answering. Key aspects of this model are:

- It is trained end-to-end without reliance on external modules.

- It reasons by producing and executing a series of pseudocodes.

- Experiments show it outperforms prior generative VQA models on the \ourdata dataset.

So in summary, the main contributions are a new complex visual reasoning dataset called \ourdata and a novel pseudocode-based reasoning model \ours for this dataset.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Visual question answering (VQA)
- Visual reasoning
- Unanswerable questions
- Scene graphs
- Object clustering
- Attribute and relation similarities
- Multi-hop reasoning
- Pseudocode generation
- Logical reasoning steps
- VisReas dataset
- Logic2Vision model

The paper introduces a new VQA dataset called VisReas that contains both answerable and unanswerable visual queries requiring complex reasoning over similarities and differences of multiple objects. It also proposes a new model called Logic2Vision that generates pseudocode representing reasoning steps and then executes that pseudocode on the image to produce an answer. Key aspects include handling unanswerable questions, clustering objects based on common attributes/relations, multi-hop reasoning chains, and logical reasoning with pseudocode.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new model called Logic2Vision that generates pseudocode before predicting an answer. What are the advantages of generating pseudocode compared to directly predicting an answer? Does it make the model more interpretable or transparent? 

2. The pseudocode generation module is trained on GQA data. Why was GQA chosen rather than other VQA datasets? Does the semantic representation in GQA lend itself better to pseudocode generation?

3. When executing the pseudocode, the same LLaVA model is used for both pseudocode generation and execution. Could using separate specialized models for each improve performance? What are the tradeoffs?

4. The paper finds that increasing the scale of the language model from 7B to 13B parameters yields significant gains on longer, more complex questions but not on problematic ones. Why might increasing scale not help with problematic questions?  

5. Could the proposed model be applied to visual dialog tasks? What modifications might be necessary to adapt it for a conversational setting?

6. Error analysis reveals the model struggles with object counting and clustering based on attributes. What architectural or training improvements could address these weaknesses?

7. How well does the model generalize to unseen compositions of reasoning primitives at test time compared to supervised baselines? Does the pseudocode provide more robustness?  

8. The model achieves 66.2% accuracy on VisReas compared to 62.8% for GPT-4v. What performance gaps remain compared to human performance and how might they be closed?

9. What other vision-and-language tasks could benefit from incorporating structured pseudocode generation and reasoning similar to Logic2Vision? In what ways would it need to be adapted?

10. How efficiently can the model scale to longer, more complex reasoning chains? At what point does performance degrade noticeably?
