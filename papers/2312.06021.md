# [GenDepth: Generalizing Monocular Depth Estimation for Arbitrary Camera   Parameters via Ground Plane Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06021)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods are heavily reliant on priors present in the training data, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. 
- One key issue that is often overlooked is varying camera parameters between training and test data, which changes the perspective geometry and degrades performance. 
- This is especially problematic for autonomous driving applications where datasets are captured with a fixed vehicle-camera setup, causing overfitting to that specific configuration.
- There is a lack of diverse real-world data and methods that can estimate accurate metric depth for arbitrary vehicle-camera systems without retraining.

Proposed Solution:
- Thoroughly analyze the effects of changing camera intrinsics (focal length, principal point, resolution) and extrinsics (camera height, pitch) on depth estimation performance.
- Create a large-scale synthetic dataset in CARLA with diverse vehicle-camera configurations to enable learning equivariant features.  
- Propose novel ground plane embeddings that encode camera parameters as per-pixel depth of ray intersections with the ground plane.
- Introduce architecture with adversarial feature alignment to transfer invariance from synthetic to real-world data.
- Achieve state-of-the-art domain generalization results on multiple unseen datasets without any fine-tuning.

Main Contributions:
- In-depth discussion of perspective geometry bias caused by fixed camera setups in training data
- Bespoke diverse synthetic dataset with camera parameter variations  
- Novel ground plane embeddings incorporating camera intrinsics and extrinsics
- Architecture with adversarial feature adaptation for sim2real transfer
- Evaluation on various unseen datasets proves accurate depth prediction for arbitrary vehicle-camera systems

In summary, this paper identifies and addresses the overlooked problem of lack of generalization across varying camera configurations in monocular depth estimation. It enables reliable metric scale depth perception for autonomous driving without requiring dataset-specific retraining or fine-tuning.
