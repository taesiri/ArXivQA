# [Automation of Triangle Ruler-and-Compass Constructions Using Constraint   Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11903)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Constructing triangles using ruler and compass is an old and challenging geometry problem. It involves finding a sequence of construction steps to build the vertices of a triangle, given some initial elements (points, lines, angles) of the triangle.

- Manually solving such construction problems requires deep geometric insights. Automating the solving is tempting but algorithmically challenging due to the large search space. 

- Prior automated approaches rely on hand-coded search procedures combined with geometric knowledge, which is tedious to implement. They also lack optimization capabilities to find shortest constructions.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate triangle construction as a constraint satisfaction/optimization problem and rely on efficient constraint solvers to do the search.

- Use MiniZinc language to model the problem. Initial elements are the problem parameters. Construction steps are operators. Goal is to construct the triangle vertices. Optimization objective is shortest construction.  

- Constraint solver searches over sequences of construction steps (plans), using backtracking and propagation. Can find shortest plans using optimization.

- Model incorporates geometric knowledge through predefined relations between points, lines, circles. Supports compound constructions. Easy to extend.

Contributions:
- Shows constraint solving is viable for automating ruler-compass constructions, freeing focus from search to modeling geometry.

- Implementation requires much less code than a hand-coded solver. Optimization comes for free from solver.

- Evaluated on 74 problems from Wernick's list. Comparable performance to state-of-the-art solver ArgoTriCS. Finds shorter constructions.

- Provides geometricians with a useful automation tool to tackle new construction problems by focusing on geometry knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an approach to automate triangle ruler-and-compass construction problems using finite-domain constraint solvers, comparing favorably to dedicated solvers by relying on efficient search algorithms and optimization capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting an approach to automate solving of triangle ruler-and-compass construction problems using finite-domain constraint solvers. This allows relying on the efficient search algorithms implemented in constraint solvers rather than having to implement search by hand.

2. Modeling the construction problems as automated planning problems that can be encoded as constraint satisfaction problems. This includes encoding the states, operators, transitions between states, and goals.

3. Evaluating the approach on 74 solvable instances from Wernick's triangle construction problem set and comparing to the state-of-the-art dedicated triangle construction solver ArgoTriCS. The results show the constraint solver approach is comparable in solving time while often finding shorter constructions due to built-in optimization capabilities.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing a way to model triangle constructions as planning/CSPs to leverage constraint solvers, and empirically demonstrating this approach is competitive with a dedicated solver while having advantages like easier implementation and built-in optimization.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Triangle constructions
- Ruler-and-compass constructions
- Automated solving
- Constraint solving 
- Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs)
- Constraint modeling
- MiniZinc modeling language
- Automated planning
- Wernick's triangle construction problems
- ArgoTriCS (triangle construction solver)

The paper focuses on using constraint solvers and modeling languages like MiniZinc to automate the solving of geometric construction problems, specifically triangle constructions using ruler and compass. It encodes these construction problems as constraint satisfaction problems and automated planning problems. A key contribution is developing a MiniZinc model for representing the geometric knowledge and search process needed to solve these problems. This approach is evaluated on benchmark triangle construction problems from Wernick's list and compared to the state-of-the-art ArgoTriCS triangle construction solver.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the constraint model for triangle construction problems encode the geometric knowledge required for solving such problems? What are the key data structures used?

2. Explain in detail how states, operators, and goals are encoded in the constraint model to formulate triangle construction problems as automated planning problems.

6. Compare the average solving times and survival plots between the constraint-based method and ArgoTriCS. What conclusions can you draw about the relative performance?

7. The authors claim the constraint-based method finds shorter constructions than ArgoTriCS. Do you think this claim is adequately justified based on the data? Why or why not?
