# [Approximating Solutions to the Knapsack Problem using the Lagrangian   Dual Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03413)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores using neural networks to approximate solutions to the classic Knapsack Problem (KP) combinatorial optimization problem. The key challenge is enforcing constraint satisfaction on the predicted solutions. The paper implements the Lagrangian Dual Framework (LDF) which leverages Lagrangian relaxation to encourage constraint satisfaction during training. Three neural network models are developed - a baseline fully connected network, an LDF network, and a LDF network pretrained on the baseline. On a dataset of 30,000 generated KP instances, results demonstrate a tradeoff between solution optimality and constraint satisfaction. The LDF models achieve near perfect constraint satisfaction (<3% violation) but with a 10% reduction in approximation ratio compared to the baseline. The violation rates are concentrated in low capacity instances. The pretrained LDF model alleviated exploding gradient issues during training. This demonstrates the ability to tune the relative priority of optimality versus constraint satisfaction in learned KP solvers. More broadly, it provides techniques and analysis applicable to using neural networks to approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems.
