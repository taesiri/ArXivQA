# [Data-Driven Modeling and Verification of Perception-Based Autonomous   Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06848)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Modern autonomous systems rely on complex perception pipelines and neural networks, making safety verification challenging. Environment models developed from first principles fail to capture real-world noise. Neural networks are not robust to small perturbations or distribution shifts from training data.

- This paper aims to address the problem of data-driven modeling and verification of perception-based autonomous systems operating in real-world environments with noise.

Methodology:
- Proposes compositional verification using a canonical model of the environment combined with a separate noise model trained on real data. This divides the problem into more manageable parts.

- Considers two types of noise - benign (smooth, easy to learn) and adversarial (discontinuous, difficult). Uses generative models like VAEs for benign noise, and classifiers to detect adversarial noise dimensions.

- Defines metrics to evaluate noise model quality based on downstream tasks of state estimation, control, and safety of simulated trajectories. This captures semantic meaning unlike raw pixel metrics.

Contributions:  
- Noise-specific modeling approach using generative models for benign noise and classifiers for adversarial noise.

- Demonstrates modeling and verification on two case studies:
   1) Image-based mountain car with blur and contrast noise
   2) F1/10 car with LiDAR noise leading to crashes

- Develops an accurate image noise model for mountain car and shows formally verified safety.

- Creates an adversarial LiDAR noise model correlating to real F1/10 crashes. Verifies safety under this noise model using a learned denoiser.

Overall, proposes a data-driven approach to accurately model real environment noise for verification of perception-based autonomous systems, with applications in areas like self-driving cars.
