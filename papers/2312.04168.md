## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from this paper:

This paper proposes a novel augmentation-free dense contrastive knowledge distillation (KD) method, called Af-DCD, for efficiently training compact and accurate deep neural networks for semantic segmentation applications. Unlike existing contrastive KD methods that rely heavily on computationally demanding data augmentation and memory buffers, Af-DCD leverages masked feature mimicking and introduces a new contrastive loss that tactfully partitions features across channel and spatial dimensions within local patches. This enables effectively transferring the teacher's dense, structured local knowledge to the student network without extra overheads. Specifically, Af-DCD incorporates spatial contrasting to transfer contextual information, channel contrasting for positional channel dependencies, and omni-contrasting to unify both. Experiments on semantic segmentation benchmarks with various network pairs show Af-DCD achieves state-of-the-art performance; e.g. DeepLabV3-Res18|MBV2 reaches 77.03\%|76.38\% mIoU on Cityscapes when trained to mimic DeepLabV3-Res101, the best result reported. Further analysis shows Af-DCD better handles difficult segmentation scenarios by learning the teacher's feature self-similarity distribution within local regions. The efficiency, accuracy, and generalization capability demonstrate the efficacy of Af-DCD for dense predictive tasks.
