# [PoseExaminer: Automated Testing of Out-of-Distribution Robustness in   Human Pose and Shape Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07337)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The main research question this paper addresses is how to systematically test the robustness and failure modes of human pose and shape estimation (HPS) methods in out-of-distribution situations. The key points are:- Current HPS benchmarks focus on in-distribution data and average performance, but failure modes in OOD situations matter more in real applications. - It is expensive to collect real out-of-distribution test data. Using synthetic data is a viable alternative.- The paper proposes an automated testing method called PoseExaminer that efficiently searches the parameter space of a human image simulator to find failure modes of HPS methods. - PoseExaminer introduces new metrics to quantify robustness based on the failure modes discovered.- Experiments show PoseExaminer reveals limitations in current state-of-the-art HPS methods, and the failure modes generalize to real images.- Fine-tuning HPS methods on the discovered failure modes improves robustness and performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks.In summary, the main hypothesis is that automatically searching for failure modes in synthetic OOD data can provide insights into limitations of HPS methods and improve their real-world robustness when used for fine-tuning.
