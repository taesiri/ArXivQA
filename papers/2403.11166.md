# [Pencil: Private and Extensible Collaborative Learning without the   Non-Colluding Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11166)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Collaborative machine learning training between multiple data owners (DOs) and a model owner (MO) faces challenges in simultaneously achieving data privacy, model privacy and extensibility to multiple DOs. Specifically, federated learning completely overlooks model privacy and homomorphic encryption (HE) methods only work for one DO. Secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols rely on a non-colluding assumption among servers which is hard to ensure in practice. Thus there lacks practical solutions for private collaborative learning without requiring the non-colluding assumption.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Pencil, a framework that reduces the multi-party collaborative learning scenario to a 2-party server/client computation paradigm. In each step, the MO trains with only one DO by secret sharing both data and model parameters. This eliminates the need to trust third-party computing servers. Polynomial encoding and the BFV HE scheme are combined for efficient linear computation. Non-linear layers are evaluated with MPC protocols adapted from prior arts. A preprocessing optimization conveys most HE operations offline to boost online efficiency. Extending to multiple DOs introduces no overhead by incrementally training with each DO. Differential privacy (DP) is integrated for stronger privacy guarantees of weight gradients.  

Main Contributions:
1) Pencil protects data privacy against the MO and model privacy against DOs simultaneously, without relying on any non-colluding assumption.

2) End-to-end training results show models trained in Pencil and plaintext achieve nearly identical (within 0.7%) test accuracies.

3) Pencil achieves 10-260× higher throughput and 100× less communication than closely related prior arts in private training.  

4) Pencil supports extensibility to heterogeneous DOs seamlessly without extra overhead. Incorporating more DOs with biased data also shows accuracy improvements.

5) Experiments show Pencil provides robust security against existing and adaptive attacks exploiting its protocols.

In summary, Pencil significantly advances practical private collaborative learning by achieving high efficiency, extensibility and security simultaneously.
