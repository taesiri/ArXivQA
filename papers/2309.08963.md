# [Struc-Bench: Are Large Language Models Really Good at Generating Complex   Structured Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08963)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Are large language models really good at generating complex structured data?The authors aim to assess the capability of current large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in generating complex structured outputs such as tables. They propose a new benchmark called Struc-Bench to evaluate different LLM models on their ability to produce structured data in raw text, HTML, and LaTeX formats. The key hypothesis appears to be that while LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have shown impressive performance on many natural language tasks, they still struggle when it comes to generating outputs that require adhering to specific structural constraints and formats. The authors evaluate this hypothesis through comprehensive experiments using the Struc-Bench benchmark.In summary, the central research question is: How capable are current LLMs at generating complex, structured data formats like tables? And the key hypothesis is that while powerful, these LLMs still have limitations in handling such structured output compared to free-form text. The paper aims to demonstrate and analyze these limitations through systematic benchmarking.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper appears to be:1. Developing a benchmark called Struc-Bench to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 to generate complex structured data outputs such as tables. 2. Performing a comprehensive analysis on Struc-Bench using 5 representative LLMs - GPT-NeoX, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Vicuna, and a fine-tuned LLaMA model. This analysis identified key weaknesses of LLMs in handling structured data generation.3. Proposing a structure-aware fine-tuning approach to improve adherence to formatting constraints and content accuracy when generating structured outputs. Experiments showed this method helps the fine-tuned LLaMA model outperform other LLMs on Struc-Bench.4. Presenting an "ability map" that highlights limitations of current LLMs across 6 dimensions - coverage, formatting, reasoning, comprehension, pragmatics, hallucination. This provides insights into areas needing improvement for structured data generation.In summary, the key contribution is the comprehensive benchmarking, analysis and proposed improvements to enhance LLMs' capability to generate complex structured data outputs that accurately follow specified formats and content constraints. The paper provides unique insights into current weaknesses of LLMs in this area.
