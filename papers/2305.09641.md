# [FitMe: Deep Photorealistic 3D Morphable Model Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09641)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to acquire high-fidelity and relightable human avatars from single or multiple unconstrained facial images. The key points are:- They introduce FitMe, a deep facial reflectance 3DMM that can generate high-resolution facial reflectance and shape. It consists of a multi-modal style-based generator for facial texture and a PCA-based model for shape.- They create a large facial reflectance dataset from a public dataset using image translation and augment it to balance skin tones.- They employ fast differentiable rendering to enable optimization of the model parameters to fit an input image. This uses diffuse and specular shading for more photorealism.- The fitting process combines 3DMM fitting and style-based GAN inversion to capture both shape and reflectance accurately. Fine-tuning the GAN improves results.- Experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art in terms of identity preservation, reflectance acquisition, and identity similarity from single images. Using multiple images produces impressive scan-like reconstructions.In summary, the key research hypothesis is that combining a deep generative reflectance model with optimization through differentiable rendering enables reconstructing high-fidelity and relightable avatars from unconstrained facial images.
