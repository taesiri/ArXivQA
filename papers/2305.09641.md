# [FitMe: Deep Photorealistic 3D Morphable Model Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09641)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to acquire high-fidelity and relightable human avatars from single or multiple unconstrained facial images. 

The key points are:

- They introduce FitMe, a deep facial reflectance 3DMM that can generate high-resolution facial reflectance and shape. It consists of a multi-modal style-based generator for facial texture and a PCA-based model for shape.

- They create a large facial reflectance dataset from a public dataset using image translation and augment it to balance skin tones.

- They employ fast differentiable rendering to enable optimization of the model parameters to fit an input image. This uses diffuse and specular shading for more photorealism.

- The fitting process combines 3DMM fitting and style-based GAN inversion to capture both shape and reflectance accurately. Fine-tuning the GAN improves results.

- Experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art in terms of identity preservation, reflectance acquisition, and identity similarity from single images. Using multiple images produces impressive scan-like reconstructions.

In summary, the key research hypothesis is that combining a deep generative reflectance model with optimization through differentiable rendering enables reconstructing high-fidelity and relightable avatars from unconstrained facial images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of FitMe, a deep 3D morphable model that can generate high-resolution facial shape and reflectance. Specifically:

- It presents the first 3DMM capable of generating high-resolution facial reflectance and shape that can be photorealistically rendered, using an increasing level of detail.

- It introduces the first branched multi-modal style-based progressive generator of facial assets (diffuse albedo, specular albedo, and normals) along with a suitable multi-modal branched discriminator.

- It acquires and augments a large facial reflectance dataset from a public dataset using histogram matching to balance skin tones. 

- It develops a multi-modal generator projection method optimized with diffuse and specular differentiable rendering.

The key outcomes are:

- High-fidelity and relightable facial shape and reflectance reconstruction from single or multiple unconstrained images.

- State-of-the-art facial reflectance acquisition and identity preservation on single images. 

- Highly detailed scan-like reconstructions from just a few images of the same person.

- Photorealistic rendering capabilities by directly using the reconstructed assets in common engines. 

- Fast optimization (under 1 minute) enabling practical avatar creation.

In summary, the main contribution is a complete pipeline for creating photorealistic 3D facial avatars from images using a novel deep 3DMM and optimization method. The results bridge the gap between 3DMMs and real human faces.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces FitMe, a method to create realistic and relightable 3D facial avatars from single or multiple images, using a style-based generator to model facial reflectance, a PCA model for shape, and differentiable rendering optimization to fit the model to images and fine-tune it for photorealism.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper introduces a new 3D morphable model called FitMe that is capable of generating high-resolution facial reflectance and shape. Other morphable models like 3DMM, Basel Face Model, and Facescape have focused more on lower resolution shape and texture models. The new FitMe model advances the state-of-the-art in terms of resolution and generating complete reflectance parameters for photorealistic rendering.

- The use of a branched multi-modal StyleGAN architecture for the texture model is novel. Other works have used StyleGANs for facial modeling but not in a multi-modal fashion like this. The branched discriminator is also a new technique to ensure consistency between different modalities.

- The method of inverting the StyleGAN texture model through differentiable rendering optimization is an innovative approach. Prior works on GAN inversion assume a 2D target image, whereas this paper has to render the GAN output before comparing to the target. The losses used are tailored for this task.

- For data, the paper creates a large facial reflectance dataset from an existing public dataset. This is a practical approach given the challenges of capturing such diverse data directly. The skin tone augmentation method is also simple and effective. Other works have relied on smaller captured datasets.

- The differentiable renderer with diffuse and specular shading improves upon commonly used Lambertian renderers in this field. This allows optimizing shape and reflectance for photorealistic results.

- Compared to other single image reconstruction methods, this paper achieves state-of-the-art identity preservation and reflectance quality. The flexible model plus rendering allows capturing fine details.

- The multi-view results are on par with specialized capture setups requiring far more images and equipment. This enables practical high quality facial acquisition.

Overall, the paper clearly advances the state-of-the-art in morphable models and facial reconstruction with innovations in architecture, inversion through rendering, and skin modeling while achieving impressive results. The rendered avatars are directly usable for real-time photorealistic applications.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Acquiring more diverse and larger-scale datasets of high-quality 3D facial geometry and reflectance. The limitations of current datasets inhibit further progress in facial modeling and reconstruction. The authors suggest that industry/academic collaboration could enable capturing larger and more varied datasets.

- Exploring non-linear statistical models and deep implicit representations for geometry and reflectance. The authors point out limitations of current linear models like 3DMMs and PCA-based methods. Developing more powerful non-linear models could better capture facial details and variability.

- Combining their approach with recent methods to overcome skin tone-illumination ambiguity. The authors mention combining their method with TRUST to further improve results.

- Validating the method on more diverse datasets and benchmarks to better understand its capabilities and limitations. The authors evaluate mainly on common datasets like LFW and CelebA-HQ. Testing on more diverse data could reveal limitations.

- Extending the method to full head and body modeling and reconstruction. The current method focuses on facial modeling. Expanding it to entire heads and bodies could enable full human digitization.

- Reducing fitting time and experimenting on reconstruction from video. The current approach requires ~1 minute per image. Faster optimization could enable video-based modeling.

- Improving eye material modeling. The eye reflections currently contain noise due to limits of the BRDF model. More accurate eye material modeling could enhance realism.

- Exploring alternative optimization strategies to further improve reconstruction quality. The current approach combines GAN inversion and 3DMM fitting, but other strategies could be explored.

In summary, the main future directions are acquiring better training data, developing more powerful generative models, improving reconstruction accuracy and speed, validating on more diverse benchmarks, and extending the approach to full human modeling. The method shows promising results but still has much room for improvement.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces FitMe, a method to produce highly accurate and photorealistic 3D avatars from single or multiple facial images. The method uses a deep facial reflectance model consisting of a multi-branched style-based GAN to generate facial texture maps and a PCA-based model for facial shape. It employs differentiable rendering to fit the model to input images through an optimization process combining GAN inversion and 3DMM fitting. This enables capturing detailed shape and reflectance information from the input images to reconstruct avatars with high fidelity in identity and appearance. The texture model is trained on a large dataset augmented to balance skin tones.

The reconstructed avatars have high similarity to the input and can be realistically re-rendered and manipulated.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces FitMe, a method to produce highly accurate and photorealistic 3D avatars from single or multiple facial images. The method consists of a deep facial reflectance model and an optimization pipeline. The facial reflectance model is a multi-modal generative network that can generate high resolution facial textures including diffuse albedo, specular albedo and surface normals. This allows rendering the textures with a photorealistic shader. The optimization pipeline combines 3D morphable model fitting with an inversion method for the generator network. By optimizing the latent code of the generator through differentiable rendering, high quality facial geometry and texture maps are reconstructed from input images. 

The method is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. On single image reconstruction, FitMe achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving identity compared to previous methods. When given multiple images of a subject, FitMe produces highly detailed and accurate facial avatars comparable to specialized capture setups, but requiring only a few mobile phone images. Ablation studies validate the proposed network architecture and optimization losses. Overall, FitMe enables high fidelity and photorealistic facial avatars usable in standard rendering engines, while requiring only a few unconstrained images.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces FitMe, a method for producing highly accurate, renderable human avatars from single or multiple "in-the-wild" images. The method uses a deep facial reflectance 3DMM consisting of a branched multi-modal style-based generative network for generating high-resolution facial diffuse albedo, specular albedo, and surface normals textures. It also uses a PCA-based model for facial shape. For fitting, the method combines style-based generator inversion with 3DMM fitting through accurate differentiable diffuse and specular rendering. Specifically, it projects the input image to the latent space of the generator using losses that ensure photorealism, identity preservation, and regularization. The projected latent code is then fine-tuned through the same rendering losses to pick up subtle features. This allows capturing high-fidelity facial reflectance and shape from images for photorealistic relightable avatar creation.
