# [Wild2Avatar: Rendering Humans Behind Occlusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00431)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing methods for rendering humans from monocular videos fail when there are occlusions that block the camera's view of the human. They struggle to reconstruct occluded body parts and often render artifacts or parts of the occlusion as the human. This is mainly due to lack of supervision and the difficulty of inferring information about occluded regions from limited evidence.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces a new method called Wild2Avatar that can render high quality human avatars from videos with occlusions. The key ideas are:

1) Occlusion-aware scene parametrization: The scene is decomposed into 3 parts - occlusion, human, background. This is done by introducing two concentric spheres around the human. The space between the camera center and the inner sphere models potential occlusions. 

2) Separate neural radiance fields are used to model the human, occlusion and background. The human is modeled in a bounded volume using an implicit surface representation based on signed distance functions.

3) Novel training objectives like occlusion decoupling loss and geometry completeness loss. The former encourages decoupling occlusion from the human. The latter ensures reconstructed geometry is complete.

Main Contributions:

1) Occlusion-aware scene parametrization to separate occlusion, human and background into different rendering spaces.

2) Overall framework to render the three elements separately using different neural radiance fields and compose sequentially.

3) New losses specifically designed to enforce decoupling of occlusion from human and encourage geometry completeness.

The method is shown to reconstruct occluded parts of humans cleanly without artifacts on real world videos with occlusions, outperforming previous state-of-the-art. The rendering quality, completeness of reconstructed geometry and overall quality are significantly better.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Wild2Avatar, a neural rendering method that can render complete and high-fidelity 3D human avatars from monocular videos of humans moving behind obstacles by modeling the scene as three separate components - occlusions, human, and background - and using novel losses to decouple them.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

(i) It introduces occlusion-aware scene parametrization, a method to decouple a scene into three parts: occlusion, human body, and background. 

(ii) It proposes a new rendering framework that renders each of these three parts separately, and designs novel optimization objectives to ensure a clean decoupling of the occlusion and a more complete human rendering.

(iii) It evaluates the method on challenging occlusion-intensive in-the-wild videos, demonstrating its effectiveness in rendering occluded humans.

In summary, the key innovation is the occlusion-aware scene parametrization and rendering framework to separate the occlusion from the human body, allowing the method to render a more complete human model from videos with heavy occlusions. The experiments on real-world occluded videos verify the capability of the proposed approach.

The paper introduces a method called "Wild2Avatar" for rendering complete 3D human avatars from monocular videos that contain occlusions. It proposes novel scene parametrization to decompose the scene into occlusion, human, and background components. The human body is represented implicitly using SDFs and volume rendering. Several losses are used to decouple the occlusion from the human rendering and encourage geometry completeness. Key terms like "neural radiance fields", "scene decomposition", "occlusion handling", and "volume rendering" capture the core ideas and techniques used in this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new occlusion-aware scene parametrization that models the scene as occlusion → human → background. What is the motivation behind modeling the scene in this way compared to previous two-part parametrizations of human → background? How does it help in rendering occluded humans?

2. Explain the mathematical formulation used to parameterize the occlusion space in the paper. How is the radius r of the inner sphere π determined? Why is negated inverted depth used alongside the surface coordinates of π to represent points in the occlusion space?

3. The paper uses the same network Fscene to render both the background and occlusion. What measures are taken to prevent overlapped surface vectors between these two spaces? Why can using the same network improve efficiency here?

4. Explain the working of the proposed occlusion decoupling loss Locc. How does it encourage decoupling of the occlusion from the human? What are the advantages of using a weakly-supervised loss here compared to a fully unsupervised approach?

5. What is the need for the geometry completeness regularization loss Lcomp? Why does optimizing just the 2D decomposition loss lead to incomplete geometry? How does Lcomp serve as a regularizer for the human pose?

6. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in rendering occluded humans. What are the main limitations of the proposed method? How can accuracy be improved for cases with inaccurate pose estimation?

7. The method relies on obtaining binary human segmentation masks. How big is the impact on rendering quality if inaccurate masks are used? Can the method work without masks? What changes would be needed?

8. How suitable is the proposed method for real-time rendering applications compared to other state-of-the-art human NERF methods? What efficiency optimizations can be made?

9. The paper focuses solely on rendering the human and does not reconstruct the occluding objects. Can the scene parametrization and losses proposed here be extended to model occlusions as well? What challenges would this face?

10. The method requires a predefined radius R for the outer sphere Π that bounds the human. How sensitive are the results to changes in R? Does an overestimated R lead to any negative impact?
