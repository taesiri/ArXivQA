# [Wild2Avatar: Rendering Humans Behind Occlusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00431)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing methods for rendering humans from monocular videos fail when there are occlusions that block the camera's view of the human. They struggle to reconstruct occluded body parts and often render artifacts or parts of the occlusion as the human. This is mainly due to lack of supervision and the difficulty of inferring information about occluded regions from limited evidence.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces a new method called Wild2Avatar that can render high quality human avatars from videos with occlusions. The key ideas are:

1) Occlusion-aware scene parametrization: The scene is decomposed into 3 parts - occlusion, human, background. This is done by introducing two concentric spheres around the human. The space between the camera center and the inner sphere models potential occlusions. 

2) Separate neural radiance fields are used to model the human, occlusion and background. The human is modeled in a bounded volume using an implicit surface representation based on signed distance functions.

3) Novel training objectives like occlusion decoupling loss and geometry completeness loss. The former encourages decoupling occlusion from the human. The latter ensures reconstructed geometry is complete.

Main Contributions:

1) Occlusion-aware scene parametrization to separate occlusion, human and background into different rendering spaces.

2) Overall framework to render the three elements separately using different neural radiance fields and compose sequentially.

3) New losses specifically designed to enforce decoupling of occlusion from human and encourage geometry completeness.

The method is shown to reconstruct occluded parts of humans cleanly without artifacts on real world videos with occlusions, outperforming previous state-of-the-art. The rendering quality, completeness of reconstructed geometry and overall quality are significantly better.
