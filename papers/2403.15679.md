# [DS-NeRV: Implicit Neural Video Representation with Decomposed Static and   Dynamic Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15679)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing implicit neural representations for video (NeRV) use a single network to represent the entire video, confusing static and dynamic information. This leads to two issues:
1) Inability to effectively compress redundant static information 
2) Lack of explicit modeling of global temporal-coherent dynamic details

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes DS-NeRV, which decomposes a video into:

1) Sparse learnable static codes: Represent time-invariant static elements in the video that can be shared to compress redundancy 

2) Dynamic codes: Represent time-varying dynamic elements with global temporal coherence  

The static and dynamic codes are jointly learned without needing explicit optical flow or residual supervision. 

To obtain the static code for a frame, the two nearest static codes are selected and weighted summed based on distance. The dynamic code is obtained through interpolation to match the video length.

The paper also proposes a cross-channel attention fusion module to efficiently fuse information from the static and dynamic codes.

Main Contributions:

1) Video decomposition into separate learnable static and dynamic codes to represent static and dynamic elements 

2) Careful design of sampling rates and sampling methods for static and dynamic codes to utilize redundancy and preserve details

3) Cross-channel attention fusion module to effectively integrate information from the two codes

4) State-of-the-art performance on video reconstruction, interpolation, inpainting and compression tasks, demonstrating the efficiency of decomposed static and dynamic modeling

The key insight is that decomposing videos into static and dynamic elements enables better compression of redundancy while retaining dynamic details for high quality video modeling. The proposed DS-NeRV framework achieves this effectively through its novel decomposition and fusion approach.
