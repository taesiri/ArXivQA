## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a web-based tool that leverages AI to automatically generate customized video summaries tailored for sharing on different social media platforms. The tool has an intuitive user interface that allows easy video upload and configuration of the desired summary length and aspect ratio based on various platform presets or custom parameters. Under the hood, it utilizes state-of-the-art unsupervised deep learning models for video summarization (AC-SUM-GAN) and aspect ratio transformation (smart video cropping with saliency prediction) to produce summaries that encapsulate the essence of the full video while meeting target platform restrictions. Evaluations demonstrate improved performance of the integrated models over prior versions. The tool aims to facilitate quick and effortless creation of platform-optimized video summaries for social media sharing. Its effectiveness will be showcased through live demonstrations at the upcoming MMM2024 conference.
