# [BiMediX: Bilingual Medical Mixture of Experts LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13253)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Lack of open-source bilingual medical language models (LLMs) in English and Arabic to facilitate seamless medical interactions. Existing models either lack medical knowledge, Arabic capabilities, or the ability to conduct conversational exchanges. 

- Scarcity of high-quality Arabic medical data and benchmarks poses challenges in developing and evaluating such models. Manual translation is costly and time-consuming.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce BiMediX, the first open-source bilingual medical LLM for English and Arabic conversations, question answering, etc.

- Propose semi-automated iterative translation pipeline to generate Arabic medical data and benchmarks with human verification for quality.

- Compile BiMed1.3M bilingual medical instruction set with 1.3M samples covering conversations, MCQA, QA. Maintains 2:1 English to Arabic ratio.

- Perform parameter-efficient finetuning of Mixtral architecture using BiMed1.3M for medical grounding in both languages.

Main Contributions:
- BiMediX bilingual medical LLM with state-of-the-art performance in English and Arabic
- Semi-automated translation pipeline for Arabic medical data
- Comprehensive Arabic evaluation benchmark
- Large-scale BiMed1.3M bilingual medical instruction set
- Finetuning approach needing fewer resources than alternatives
- Quantitative gains over Med42, Meditron, Jais-30B on medical exams

In summary, the paper introduces an open-source bilingual medical LLM called BiMediX that achieves impressive capabilities in English and Arabic medical conversations, QA, etc. through semi-automated data creation and parameter-efficient finetuning. The model, data, and benchmarks are valuable assets for advancing multi-lingual AI in healthcare.
