# [Prompt Mining for Language-based Human Mobility Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03544)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing language-based human mobility forecasting relies on fixed prompt templates to transform numerical data into natural language sentences as inputs for language models. However, inadequate prompt template design limits the accuracy of forecasts.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel prompt mining framework with three key stages - prompt initialization, prompt generation, and prompt refinement.

- Prompt initialization creates an initial pool of prompt templates and a quality evaluator.

- Prompt generation uses a model $\mathcal{G}$ to generate prompts, trained using a custom loss function based on prompt entropy from the evaluator $\mathcal{F}$. This encourages higher quality prompts.

- Prompt refinement enhances prompts through noise reduction, chain of thought integration and information gain-based segmentation. Four refined variants V1-V4 are generated.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of a systematic prompt mining pipeline for language-based mobility forecasting to generate better prompts.

- Leveraging prompt entropy in training the prompt generation model $\mathcal{G}$ and in the prompt quality evaluator $\mathcal{F}$.

- Integration of a chain of thought and information gain based segmentation to uncover refined prompt variants.

- Extensive experiments validating improved performance over baselines by using mined prompt variants V1-V4 for forecasting.

In summary, the paper presents a novel direction for advancing language-based mobility forecasting through systematic and optimized prompt design rather than reliance on fixed templates.
