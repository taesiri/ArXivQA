# [Using Zero-shot Prompting in the Automatic Creation and Expansion of   Topic Taxonomies for Tagging Retail Banking Transactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06790)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classifying and characterizing financial transactions using a predefined set of categories limits the ability to extend classification capabilities for new categories. 
- Taxonomies are useful for semantic analysis of data but costly and difficult to create and scale manually. Thus, methods for automatic taxonomy creation are needed.

Proposed Solution: 
- An unsupervised method is proposed that automatically constructs and expands topic taxonomies for tagging and characterizing merchants in a retail bank dataset.
- Topic modeling and keyword extraction techniques are used to generate an initial set of terms for each topic taxonomy. 
- ChatGPT is then used to refine terms, organize them hierarchically, and expand existing taxonomies.
- The resulting taxonomies are applied to assign semantic tags to merchants to characterize their types of activities.

Main Contributions:
- A method for automatically creating topic taxonomies for semantic analysis of transactions and merchants in a retail banking dataset. 
- The use of ChatGPT for post-processing taxonomy terms and organizing them hierarchically, as well as for expanding existing taxonomies with zero-shot prompting, which are novel applications.
- Evaluation demonstrating high coherence of generated taxonomies (94%, 92%) and accuracy of merchant tagging (over 80%) based on the taxonomies.
- Promising results for ChatGPT-based taxonomy expansion, surpassing established methods like Musubu, showing the robustness of LLMs in low-resource settings.

In summary, an unsupervised taxonomy creation and expansion method is proposed using LLMs, with demonstrated capability to create coherent taxonomies for improved semantic characterization of financial entities. The novelty lies in the application of instruction-based LLMs in taxonomy tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents an unsupervised method using instruction-based fine-tuned large language models to automatically construct and expand topic taxonomies from text, applies the taxonomies to tag retail bank transactions, and evaluates the quality of the taxonomies and tagging, finding over 90% coherence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) An unsupervised method for automatically constructing and expanding topic taxonomies using instruction-based fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This involves applying topic modeling and keyword extraction to create initial taxonomies, then using ChatGPT for post-processing and organizing terms into hierarchies.

2) A novel approach for expanding existing taxonomies with new terms using zero-shot prompting with ChatGPT to determine where to add new nodes in the taxonomy. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first application of zero-shot prompting for taxonomy expansion tasks.

3) Evaluation of the automatically generated taxonomies, including both quantitative coherence analysis and qualitative human evaluation. Two example taxonomies for "Brazilian Cuisine" and "Clothing & Accessories" are analyzed in detail.

4) Application of the resulting taxonomies to tag and characterize merchants/transactions in a retail bank dataset. Both the taxonomy quality and coherence of merchant tagging are evaluated.

5) Comparative experiments for taxonomy expansion using ChatGPT, LLama, BERT and Musubu. ChatGPT is shown to outperform other methods for low-resource parent node prediction.

In summary, the main contribution is the unsupervised creation and expansion of topic taxonomies using prompted fine-tuned LLMs, with a novel application to merchant/transaction tagging. Both the taxonomy construction method and expansion approach via zero-shot prompting are analyzed in detail.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Topic taxonomies - The paper focuses on automatically constructing and expanding topic taxonomies using large language models. Topic taxonomies organize conceptual topics in a hierarchy.

- Unsupervised method - The method presented for taxonomy creation and expansion is unsupervised, relying on topic modeling, keyword extraction, and large language models.

- Instruction-based fine-tuning - The large language models used are fine-tuned using instruction-based learning to align them for the taxonomy tasks.

- Zero-shot prompting - For taxonomy expansion, the paper utilizes zero-shot prompting of large language models to determine where to add new nodes in the taxonomy.

- Retail bank transactions - The constructed taxonomies are applied to tag and characterize merchants/establishments from a dataset of retail bank transactions.

- Food and shopping - Two domains focused on are food establishments and shopping establishments from the retail bank transaction dataset.

- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation - The paper includes both quantitative coherence metrics and qualitative human evaluation to assess the quality of the generated taxonomies.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using keyword extraction and topic modeling to select candidate terms for the taxonomies. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method? How could the candidate term selection process be improved?

2. The prompts provided to ChatGPT play a critical role in the taxonomy creation and expansion processes. What considerations went into designing effective prompts for these tasks? How could the prompts be refined to further improve performance? 

3. The paper evaluates only 2 out of the 64 generated taxonomies. What insights could be gained from a more comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of the full set of created taxonomies? 

4. How robust is the taxonomy expansion approach to taxonomies with hundreds of thousands or millions of nodes? What modifications would be needed to scale up the method?

5. What role does the choice of base corpus play in the quality of the generated taxonomies? How does corpus size, domain, etc. impact the coherence and completeness of the taxonomies?

6. How do the automatically generated taxonomies compare to human-curated gold standard taxonomies in the same domains? What are the key differences in structure, content, and utility?

7. The paper focuses on the food and shopping domains. How would the methodology transfer to other specialized domains like medicine, law, arts, etc.?

8. What mechanisms are in place, or could be added, to ensure the taxonomies reflect current terminology over time as language evolves?  

9. What role could reinforcement learning from human feedback play in iteratively refining and validating the taxonomies?

10. How do the results compare using other state-of-the-art LLMs beyond ChatGPT? What unique capabilities does each model bring to the taxonomy creation task?
