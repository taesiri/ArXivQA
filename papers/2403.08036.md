# [A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08036)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- The agriculture and food (FA) sector is increasingly adopting emerging technologies like IoT, AI, etc. This digital transformation makes the sector vulnerable to cyberattacks. 
- Between 2011-2023, 30 major cybersecurity incidents have occurred in the FA sector, mostly ransomware attacks. These incidents are causing financial losses, data breaches, and disruption in services.
- Such attacks can impact food security, critical infrastructures like water systems, and the economy. So there is a need for cybersecurity solutions tailored to the FA sector.

Proposed Solutions:
- The paper discusses 4 popular cybersecurity frameworks - NIST CSF, CIS Benchmarks, ISO 27000, and MITRE ATT&CK that can be used to improve cybersecurity.
- Recent agriculture-specific solutions using AI, blockchain, federated learning are presented which focus on intrusion detection, malware detection, DDoS attack detection etc.
- A novel Farmer-Centered AI (FCAI) framework is proposed to incorporate 6 goals of AI assurance - ethical, safe, fair, secure, explainable and trustworthy AI. This empowers farmers and enables contestable use of AI.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive compilation and analysis of 30 major cybersecurity incidents in the FA sector from 2011-2023
- Discussion of popular CSFs and recent agriculture-specific cybersecurity solutions using AI
- Proposal of a FCAI framework focused on AI assurance tailored to agriculture
- Analysis of impact of such cyberattacks on critical infrastructures, food security and economy
- Identification of key challenges (data, deployment, adoption) and recommendations in using AI for agriculture

In summary, the paper provides a timely review of increasing cyber threats in the crucial FA sector and discusses cybersecurity frameworks, solutions and an AI assurance framework to tackle this problem. It highlights the wider impacts of such attacks and challenges that need to be addressed.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper reviews 30 cybersecurity incidents in the food and agriculture sector between 2011-2023, discusses popular cybersecurity frameworks and recent AI solutions, proposes a Farmer-Centered AI framework to incorporate AI assurance, and examines the impacts of these incidents on critical infrastructures, food security, and the economy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions, including:

1. A compilation and review of 30 disclosed and documented cybersecurity incidents in the food and agriculture sector between 2011 and 2023. Details such as the type of attack, financial losses, data loss, and service interruptions are provided for each incident. 

2. A discussion of popular cybersecurity frameworks (NIST CSF, CIS Benchmarks, ISO 27000, ATT&CK) and recent agriculture-specific cybersecurity solutions that utilize AI, blockchain, and federated learning techniques.

3. The proposal of a new Farmer-Centered AI (FCAI) framework that incorporates AI assurance into the AI lifecycle for agriculture applications. The goal is to support farmers in decision-making while ensuring the AI systems are ethical, safe, fair, secure, explainable and trustworthy. 

4. An analysis of the effects of cybersecurity incidents on other critical infrastructure sectors like food supply chains and water systems, as well as impacts on food security, accessibility, availability and the broader economy.

5. A discussion of key challenges for utilizing AI in agriculture, including issues with data, deployment, and adoption. Potential solutions are also proposed.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive review and analysis of cybersecurity threats and incidents in the agriculture sector, along with proposed frameworks and solutions to improve security, trust in AI systems, and resilience. The implications for food systems, critical infrastructure, and society are also discussed.
