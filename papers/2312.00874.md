# [Hi-ArG: Exploring the Integration of Hierarchical Argumentation Graphs   in Language Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00874)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Argumentation tasks like debate preparation and participation rely on logical relations between arguments. However, language models struggle with such relational reasoning. 
- Existing argumentation graphs overly simplify semantic relations between concepts. They also lack flexibility to represent diverse argument types.

Proposed Solution - Hi-ArG:
- Proposes a hierarchical argumentation graph (Hi-ArG) with two levels:
   - Intra-argument level uses Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) to capture rich semantics within an argument.
   - Inter-argument level captures logical relations between arguments.
- This provides more explicit relational structure while retaining argument expression flexibility.
- Also proposes an automated pipeline to construct Hi-ArG from text.

Exploiting Hi-ArG:
- Introduces GreaseArG, a text-graph multi-modal model to process text jointly with its Hi-ArG subgraph. Adds GNN to standard LM.
- Proposes a pre-training framework that augments text samples with related "relative" sentences from Hi-ArG graph. New pre-training task predicts relations between original and relative sentences.

Main Contributions:
- Novel Hi-ArG graph structure to organize arguments and their relations explicitly at multiple semantic levels.
- GreaseArG model and pre-training framework to exploit graphical argument structure.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on argument pairing and stance classification tasks.
- Analysis shows Hi-ArG information helps improve model understanding and performance on argumentation tasks.

In summary, the paper introduces a structured way to represent argumentative text through Hi-ArG graphs, and leverages this structure to enhance language model performance on argumentation tasks.
