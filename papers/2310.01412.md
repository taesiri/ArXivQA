# [DriveGPT4: Interpretable End-to-end Autonomous Driving via Large   Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01412)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can large language models be utilized to develop an interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving system? The authors aim to leverage the reasoning and language generation capabilities of large language models to create a system that can not only drive autonomously in an end-to-end fashion, but also provide natural language explanations for its actions and decisions. This aims to address the lack of interpretability in existing end-to-end autonomous driving systems, which act as "black boxes" that humans cannot understand. Specifically, the paper introduces DriveGPT4, an interpretable autonomous driving system based on large language models. The main hypothesis appears to be that by training DriveGPT4 on a customized visual instruction tuning dataset for driving scenarios, it can process multimodal input data comprising videos, text, and control signals in order to:1) Generate textual responses to questions that explain its driving behavior and actions.2) Directly predict low-level control signals for vehicle operation in an end-to-end manner.In essence, the central research question is whether large language models can enable both end-to-end autonomous control and human-interpretable explanations when trained appropriately on a tailored dataset for this purpose. The development of DriveGPT4 aims to test this hypothesis.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related research in interpretable autonomous driving:- It focuses on utilizing large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving, which is a novel approach compared to prior work using smaller language models. Most other work in this area relies on smaller models like BERT.- The method trains a custom visual instruction tuning dataset generated by ChatGPT based on the BDD-X dataset. This allows fine-tuning the LLM to have conversational abilities about driving scenarios. Other approaches typically use fixed action description labels from datasets.- The proposed DriveGPT4 model can process diverse multimodal inputs including video, text, and control signals. It can provide text responses and predict low-level control outputs. Other methods are often limited to a single modality like video or focus only on generating textual descriptions.- DriveGPT4 is evaluated on a wide range of tasks - action/behavior descriptions, justifications, question answering, and control signal prediction. Most other work concentrates on a single evaluation dimension like description accuracy.- Results show DriveGPT4 achieves superior performance across different tasks compared to other approaches, including general video understanding LLMs. The method also demonstrates stronger generalization ability to unseen scenarios.- DriveGPT4 represents the first work applying LLMs for interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving, setting it apart from prior language-based interpretability methods. The end-to-end control capability enabled by the LLM is a novel contribution.In summary, the use of LLMs, custom instruction tuning data, multimodal processing, diverse evaluation, strong performance, and end-to-end focus differentiate this work from existing research on interpretable autonomous driving systems. The paper demonstrates LLMs have untapped potential for this application area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring other transformer architectures and pretraining methods as the backbone for the video and text encoders, beyond CLIP and LLaMA which were used in this work. The authors mention this could further enhance the multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities.- Incorporating additional sensor modalities beyond camera images, such as lidar, radar, etc. This could provide a more comprehensive perception of the driving environment. - Evaluating generalization to more diverse environments and scenarios, beyond the BDD-X dataset used in their experiments. Testing the approach in more complex real-world conditions could reveal limitations to address.- Incorporating traffic rules and domain knowledge more explicitly into the model pretraining and fine-tuning. This prior knowledge could improve driving behavior and safety.- Enabling capability for interactive conversations during driving, to handle natural language clarification, corrections, or new instructions from passengers. - Exploring methods for post-hoc interpretability of the model's outputs and internal representations, to better understand and analyze its driving decisions.- Integrating the control signal predictions and natural language interactions with downstream motion planning and vehicle control modules. Testing the end-to-end closed-loop driving performance.- Addressing limitations around prediction drift over longer horizons, to enable fully autonomous driving over extended durations.In summary, they highlight a number of exciting opportunities to build on this work on interpretable language-driven autonomous vehicles, including advances in multimodal modeling, generalization, incorporating prior knowledge, interactivity, explainability, and integration into full self-driving stacks.
