# [Curriculum Learning Meets Directed Acyclic Graph for Multimodal Emotion   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17269)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) is an important task in natural language processing and affective computing. Prior works have mostly focused on text modality, while multimodal ERC incorporating textual, acoustic and visual features can provide a more comprehensive understanding of emotions. However, multimodal ERC faces challenges in handling emotional shifts in conversations and imbalance across emotion classes in the training data. 

Proposed Solution - MultiDAG+CL:
The paper proposes a novel multimodal ERC model called MultiDAG+CL which integrates textual, acoustic and visual features using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) framework. On top of the MultiDAG model, curriculum learning (CL) is incorporated to handle challenges related to emotional shifts and data imbalance. The CL module consists of two components:
1) Difficulty Measure Function: Calculates conversation difficulty based on frequency of emotional shifts. More shifts indicates more difficulty.  
2) Training Scheduler: Schedules training by dividing data into bins of similar difficulty and gradually presenting them for training.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes MultiDAG, which is the first work to integrate multimodal features including text, audio and video using DAG framework for ERC task.

2) Incorporates curriculum learning strategy on top of MultiDAG using a novel difficulty measure and scheduler to specifically handle emotional shifts and imbalance issues in multimodal ERC.

3) Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP and MELD benchmark datasets. Outperforms prior best models by 1.05% on IEMOCAP and 0.34% on MELD.

4) Analysis shows curriculum learning improves model's handling of emotional shifts. Reduces confusion between neutral and other emotion classes.
