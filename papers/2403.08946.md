# [Usable XAI: 10 Strategies Towards Exploiting Explainability in the LLM   Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08946)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make AI models more transparent and interpretable by humans. However, most XAI methods focus on producing explanations without considering their actual usability in practice.  
- Two main challenges exist: (1) inherent conflict between automation of AI and human engagement needed for XAI, (2) XAI methods designed mainly as technical tools without considering user needs.
- Large language models (LLMs) have exacerbated opacity issues due to their scale and complexity. However, their advanced capabilities also present opportunities for XAI.

Proposed Solution - Usable XAI:  
- Utilize explanations to enhance LLM performance, fairness, security etc. (7 strategies) 
- Utilize LLM abilities to enhance XAI frameworks in aspects like user-friendliness and automation (3 strategies)

Key Contributions:
- Propose the concept of "Usable XAI" specifically aimed at improving utility of explanations for LLMs
- Review 10 strategies spanning attribution methods, module interpretation, sample tracing, diagnosing trustworthiness, explainable prompting, user-friendly explanation generation, interpretable system design, and more
- Provide multiple case studies and code to demonstrate the application of techniques
- Identify open challenges such as complexity of LLMs, designing metrics focused on semantic meanings, utilizing LLM knowledge to reduce human involvement in XAI workflows.

The paper delivers an extensive investigation into techniques for leveraging the reciprocal relationship between XAI and LLMs to make explanations more usable. It highlights the need to bridge the gap between producing insights into models and taking concrete steps for enhancement, presenting actionable strategies and frameworks to achieve this goal.
