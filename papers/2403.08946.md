## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make AI models more transparent and interpretable by humans. However, most XAI methods focus on producing explanations without considering their actual usability in practice.  
- Two main challenges exist: (1) inherent conflict between automation of AI and human engagement needed for XAI, (2) XAI methods designed mainly as technical tools without considering user needs.
- Large language models (LLMs) have exacerbated opacity issues due to their scale and complexity. However, their advanced capabilities also present opportunities for XAI.

Proposed Solution - Usable XAI:  
- Utilize explanations to enhance LLM performance, fairness, security etc. (7 strategies) 
- Utilize LLM abilities to enhance XAI frameworks in aspects like user-friendliness and automation (3 strategies)

Key Contributions:
- Propose the concept of "Usable XAI" specifically aimed at improving utility of explanations for LLMs
- Review 10 strategies spanning attribution methods, module interpretation, sample tracing, diagnosing trustworthiness, explainable prompting, user-friendly explanation generation, interpretable system design, and more
- Provide multiple case studies and code to demonstrate the application of techniques
- Identify open challenges such as complexity of LLMs, designing metrics focused on semantic meanings, utilizing LLM knowledge to reduce human involvement in XAI workflows.

The paper delivers an extensive investigation into techniques for leveraging the reciprocal relationship between XAI and LLMs to make explanations more usable. It highlights the need to bridge the gap between producing insights into models and taking concrete steps for enhancement, presenting actionable strategies and frameworks to achieve this goal.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses using attribution methods to enhance LLM utility. What are some limitations of existing attribution methods when applied to large language models? How can these methods be adapted to better suit LLMs?

2. The paper talks about interpreting internal LLM components like attention heads and feedforward layers. What mathematical models have been proposed to explain the functionality of the self-attention mechanism? How can we move from theoretical analysis to practical applications of these models?  

3. When using influence functions for sample-based explanation of LLMs, what assumptions need to be made to improve computational scalability? How can these assumptions affect the quality of explanations?

4. The paper examines using explanations to assess LLM trustworthiness across dimensions like security, privacy, fairness and truthfulness. What are some limitations of current detection methods for issues like toxicity and dishonesty? How can mitigation strategies be improved?

5. Explainable prompting methods like chain-of-thought rely on templates that could potentially bias LLM reasoning. What strategies can be used to reduce this reliance on templates? How can we evaluate the faithfulness of explanations generated through prompting?

6. When using retrieval augmentation for explainable question answering, what are some challenges regarding retrieval accuracy and controllable generation? How can relevance of retrieved information be effectively measured?

7. What is the key tradeoff between usability and reliability when using LLMs to generate user-friendly explanations? How can the constrained application scenarios be expanded to other domains beyond vision and language?

8. What feasibility issues need to be tackled when using LLMs for interpretable system design and planning in few-shot or dynamic scenarios? How can knowledge gaps in LLMs be effectively detected and mitigated?

9. When using LLMs to emulate human annotators and evaluators for XAI systems, what causes the uncontrollable credibility? How can ethical considerations be incorporated into LLM annotation workflows?

10. What objectives should be prioritized for developing explanation methods tailored to LLMs? What risks exist in attempting to achieve full transparency into all aspects of large language model behaviors?
