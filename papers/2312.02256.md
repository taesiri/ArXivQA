# [EMDM: Efficient Motion Diffusion Model for Fast, High-Quality Motion   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02256)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing human motion generation diffusion models like MDM struggle to achieve fast motion generation while maintaining high motion quality. Methods like motion latent diffusion accelerate generation but rely on effectively learning the motion latent space in a separate stage. Increasing the sampling step size in diffusion models typically results in lower quality motions. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes an Efficient Motion Diffusion Model (EMDM) that allows for fast motion generation with much fewer sampling steps while preserving motion quality. 

Key ideas:
1) A Conditional Denoising Diffusion GAN is proposed to model the complex denoising distribution over multiple steps, conditioned on control signals like text. This allows capturing multimodal distributions for heterogeneous motions, enabling larger step sizes.

2) Motion geometric losses are integrated during training to further improve motion quality and training efficiency. Losses help constrain reconstruction, joint positions, velocities etc.

3) The model enables sampling motions with fewer steps by effectively modeling complexity of denoising distributions. Larger step size possible without compromising quality.

Main Contributions:
- Conditional Denoising Diffusion GAN to model complex multimodal distributions conditioned on control signals and time
- Motion geometric losses to enhance quality and training efficiency
- Demonstrates much faster sampling while maintaining competitive or better motion quality
- End-to-end trainable motion generation diffusion model
- State-of-the-art tradeoff between motion quality and inference speed

The proposed EMDM pushes forward the frontier on motion generation by enabling faster inference without sacrificing on quality. Evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of EMDM in generating high quality motions with significant speedups compared to prior arts.
