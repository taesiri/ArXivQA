# [Quantum Polar Metric Learning: Efficient Classically Learned Quantum   Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01655)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Quantum Polar Metric Learning (QPMeL) for learning efficient quantum embeddings of classical data. QPMeL has both a classical and quantum component. The classical head uses a CNN to predict the polar angle parameters ($\theta$, $\gamma$) to represent qubits. These angles are then fed into a shallow parameterized quantum circuit with $R_y$, $R_z$, and $ZZ$ gates to encode the data and create entanglement. A key contribution is a Fidelity Triplet Loss function that measures distances between quantum states using state fidelity and a swap test circuit. This loss allows the classical model to learn better metric embeddings. Another contribution is Quantum Residual Corrections (QRC) - additional angle parameters that act as a noise barrier to speed up training before being integrated into the classical model. Experiments on MNIST show QPMeL achieves 3x better separation between classes compared to prior Quantum Metric Learning approaches, using only 1/2 the circuit depth and gates. The results also indicate the quantum loss helps the classical model learn better representations, presenting opportunities to use QPMeL for enhancing classical models.
