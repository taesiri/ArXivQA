# [Revisit Human-Scene Interaction via Space Occupancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02700)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new perspective on human-scene interaction (HSI) by viewing it as essentially human interaction with scene occupancy and space constraints. They argue that scene occupancy is the primary factor governing static HSI. Building on this insight, they transform large datasets of human motions without corresponding scenes into paired human-occupancy interaction data, called the Motion Occupancy Base (MOB). MOB contains 98K instances with more complex and stringent geometric constraints compared to existing HSI datasets. The authors then develop a versatile transformer-based controller that takes the surrounding occupancy and target locations as inputs to generate stable and realistic future motion predictions in an auto-regressive manner. Trained only on MOB without real 3D scenes, this controller generalizes well to diverse static and dynamic test scenes. It avoids collisions, navigates cluttered spaces, and produces natural transitions between locomotion and interaction. The controller's unified treatment of locomotion and interaction, field regulation module, and auto-regressive generation allow it to adapt to dynamic environments like opening doors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the controller's effectiveness for static HSI across different settings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes treating human-scene interaction as human-occupancy interaction, converts motion-only data into a paired human-occupancy database for training a versatile controller that can generate stable and flexible human motions in diverse static and dynamic scenes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1) It exhumes Human-Occupancy Interaction as a major component of static human-scene interaction (HSI). It argues that interacting with scenes is essentially interacting with the space occupancy of scenes from an abstract physical perspective.

2) It converts large-scale motion-only datasets into a paired Human-Occupancy database called Motion Occupancy Base (MOB) by identifying the inherent Human-Occupancy relationships in pure motions. This expands the data scale and diversity for static HSI. 

3) It develops a versatile auto-regressive Human-Occupancy Interaction controller for motion generation. The controller is flexible, stable across various static and dynamic HSI scenarios, and does not require real 3D scene data for training.

In summary, the key innovation is the new perspective of static HSI as Human-Occupancy Interaction. This view enables better use of existing motion data, as well as a unified controller for diverse HSI scenarios.

The paper proposes a new perspective of viewing human-scene interaction as human-occupancy interaction. It aggregates motion-only datasets into a Motion Occupancy Base which contains paired human-occupancy data. The paper also develops a versatile auto-regressive motion controller that can generate stable human motions interacting with both static and dynamic scenes after training on MOB, without needing real 3D scene data.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is important but faces challenges due to limited paired human-scene data. High-quality data with simultaneous captures of humans and 3D scenes is rare and expensive to obtain.
- Existing datasets have limited diversity and complexity in terms of interactions between humans and scenes.

Key Idea:
- The paper argues that for static HSI, interacting with a scene is essentially interacting with the space occupancy of the scene. 
- By treating motion-only sequences as records of humans interacting with implicit scene occupancies, motion data can be converted into a unified human-occupancy interaction database.

Proposed Solution:
- Aggregates 13 motion datasets into a large-scale Motion Occupancy Base (MOB) with 98k instances. Each motion sequence is converted into a human + pseudo-scene occupancy pair.
- MOB contains more complex geometric constraints compared to existing datasets.
- Proposes a versatile transformer-based motion controller that takes in history, current state, future states, surrounding occupancy, and target locations as input to auto-regressively generate future motions.
- A field regulation module is introduced to avoid collisions and penetrations.

Main Results:
- Controller trained on MOB generates realistic and stable motions for both complex and simple scenes, without seeing real 3D data.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art method DIMOS on a goal reaching task on MOB scenes.
- Able to produce long 30s motions on both synthetic and real 3D scan scenes involving navigation, sitting, etc.
- Can adapt motions to dynamic changes in environment like opening doors.

Key Contributions:
- New unified perspective of static HSI as human-occupancy interaction
- MOB database with more diverse and complex human-occupancy interactions 
- Versatile neural motion controller for static HSI generation
