# [Revisit Human-Scene Interaction via Space Occupancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02700)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new perspective on human-scene interaction (HSI) by viewing it as essentially human interaction with scene occupancy and space constraints. They argue that scene occupancy is the primary factor governing static HSI. Building on this insight, they transform large datasets of human motions without corresponding scenes into paired human-occupancy interaction data, called the Motion Occupancy Base (MOB). MOB contains 98K instances with more complex and stringent geometric constraints compared to existing HSI datasets. The authors then develop a versatile transformer-based controller that takes the surrounding occupancy and target locations as inputs to generate stable and realistic future motion predictions in an auto-regressive manner. Trained only on MOB without real 3D scenes, this controller generalizes well to diverse static and dynamic test scenes. It avoids collisions, navigates cluttered spaces, and produces natural transitions between locomotion and interaction. The controller's unified treatment of locomotion and interaction, field regulation module, and auto-regressive generation allow it to adapt to dynamic environments like opening doors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the controller's effectiveness for static HSI across different settings.
