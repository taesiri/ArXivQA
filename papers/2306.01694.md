# [Evaluating Language Models for Mathematics through Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01694)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the central research question is:How can we evaluate large language models (LLMs) in a way that better captures their capabilities and limitations when deployed in interactive, real-world settings? The key hypotheses seem to be:1) Typical static evaluations of LLMs using input-output pairs are insufficient, as they do not capture the interactive element critical for deployment.2) Incorporating human interaction into LLM evaluation can provide insights into behaviors and abilities not seen in static assessments.3) Studying real mathematician interactions with LLMs can characterize strengths, weaknesses, and potential harms when using these models as mathematical reasoning assistants.4) Expert mathematician evaluations can reveal LLM limitations in mathematical reasoning, particularly around algebra, that static approaches may miss.In summary, the core research question seems to be how to design interactive LLM evaluations that provide a more accurate picture of real-world performance, especially in collaborative domains like mathematics. The central hypothesis is that such interactive assessments will uncover important capabilities and issues not seen in standard static evaluations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be:1) Introducing CheckMate, a platform for interactively evaluating language models through conversations with human users. CheckMate allows collecting multi-dimensional ratings on the language model responses in a structured way.2) Conducting a comparative study evaluating 3 language models (InstructGPT, ChatGPT, GPT-4) on mathematical theorem proving assistance using CheckMate. The study engaged participants ranging from undergrads to math professors.3) Releasing MathConverse, a dataset of 261 human-model interactions and evaluations on undergraduate math problems. Analysis of MathConverse reveals insights into human behaviors when querying models, and differences in perceived correctness vs. helpfulness.4) Presenting expert case studies that uncover limitations of current LLMs like algebraic weaknesses and over-reliance on memorized examples. The case studies demonstrate the value of interactive assessment, especially with domain experts.5) Providing takeaways for different audiences - ML developers, mathematicians, LLM users - on designing better assistants, discerning proper use cases, and the need for continued interactive evaluations.In summary, the key contribution seems to be using the new CheckMate platform to enable comparative interactive evaluation of LLMs on math assistance, releasing the MathConverse dataset, and deriving insights for different stakeholders through analysis of the interactions. The work highlights the importance of incorporating interactivity into LLM assessments.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing better methods for evaluating language models through human-AI interactions and conversations. The authors propose that interactive evaluation is essential for properly assessing the capabilities of large language models, beyond just static input-output metrics. They call for more platforms like CheckMate that facilitate structured interactive evaluations.- Further analysis of interaction patterns and human behaviors when querying language models for assistance, to inform the design of models and interfaces. The authors provide a preliminary taxonomy of user behaviors based on MathConverse, but note more data is needed.- Studying effects of user expertise level on interaction quality, as the authors observe differences based on mathematical experience. More research on tailoring systems to users with different backgrounds is suggested.- Enabling language models to better communicate uncertainty and limitations, uptake corrections, provide explanations, and demonstrate more robust reasoning. The authors observe weaknesses here even in very large models like GPT-4.- Hybrid neuro-symbolic techniques to combine strengths of neural networks and reasoning systems. The authors note challenges like algebraic manipulation could benefit from incorporating symbolic methods.- Further interactive assessments by domain experts to characterize model capabilities and human-AI collaboration potential. The authors provide mathematician case studies as a model methodology.- Development of models and interfaces tailored to complement human abilities and provide timely assistance, avoiding over-reliance. Understanding optimal human-AI complementarity is highlighted.- Best practices for responsible LLM deployment and use, informed by interactive evaluations. The authors recommend careful consideration before deployment as assistants.In summary, the key themes are leveraging interactive human assessment to shape the development of safer, more usable LLMs that can productively collaborate with people.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces \cm, an adaptable prototype platform for humans to interact with and evaluate LLMs. Using \cm, the authors conduct a study to evaluate three language models (InstructGPT, ChatGPT, GPT-4) on undergraduate-level mathematical theorem proving with participants ranging from undergrads to professors. They release the \mc dataset of interactions and ratings. Analysis of \mc reveals a generally positive correlation between correctness and helpfulness, but also divergences. The authors derive a preliminary taxonomy of user behaviors and identify preference for chat-optimized models. Additionally, through expert case studies, they uncover GPT-4's challenges with algebraic manipulation and over-reliance on memorization. Key takeaways include developing models that communicate uncertainty, incorporating interactivity into evaluations, and using caution when relying on LLMs for mathematical reasoning today. Overall, the work demonstrates the importance of interactive assessment, provides initial insights into human-LLM mathematical collaboration, and suggests directions to improve language models as reasoning assistants.
