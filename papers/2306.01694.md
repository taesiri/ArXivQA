# [Evaluating Language Models for Mathematics through Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01694)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the central research question is:How can we evaluate large language models (LLMs) in a way that better captures their capabilities and limitations when deployed in interactive, real-world settings? The key hypotheses seem to be:1) Typical static evaluations of LLMs using input-output pairs are insufficient, as they do not capture the interactive element critical for deployment.2) Incorporating human interaction into LLM evaluation can provide insights into behaviors and abilities not seen in static assessments.3) Studying real mathematician interactions with LLMs can characterize strengths, weaknesses, and potential harms when using these models as mathematical reasoning assistants.4) Expert mathematician evaluations can reveal LLM limitations in mathematical reasoning, particularly around algebra, that static approaches may miss.In summary, the core research question seems to be how to design interactive LLM evaluations that provide a more accurate picture of real-world performance, especially in collaborative domains like mathematics. The central hypothesis is that such interactive assessments will uncover important capabilities and issues not seen in standard static evaluations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be:1) Introducing CheckMate, a platform for interactively evaluating language models through conversations with human users. CheckMate allows collecting multi-dimensional ratings on the language model responses in a structured way.2) Conducting a comparative study evaluating 3 language models (InstructGPT, ChatGPT, GPT-4) on mathematical theorem proving assistance using CheckMate. The study engaged participants ranging from undergrads to math professors.3) Releasing MathConverse, a dataset of 261 human-model interactions and evaluations on undergraduate math problems. Analysis of MathConverse reveals insights into human behaviors when querying models, and differences in perceived correctness vs. helpfulness.4) Presenting expert case studies that uncover limitations of current LLMs like algebraic weaknesses and over-reliance on memorized examples. The case studies demonstrate the value of interactive assessment, especially with domain experts.5) Providing takeaways for different audiences - ML developers, mathematicians, LLM users - on designing better assistants, discerning proper use cases, and the need for continued interactive evaluations.In summary, the key contribution seems to be using the new CheckMate platform to enable comparative interactive evaluation of LLMs on math assistance, releasing the MathConverse dataset, and deriving insights for different stakeholders through analysis of the interactions. The work highlights the importance of incorporating interactivity into LLM assessments.
