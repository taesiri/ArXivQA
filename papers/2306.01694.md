# [Evaluating Language Models for Mathematics through Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01694)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the central research question is:How can we evaluate large language models (LLMs) in a way that better captures their capabilities and limitations when deployed in interactive, real-world settings? The key hypotheses seem to be:1) Typical static evaluations of LLMs using input-output pairs are insufficient, as they do not capture the interactive element critical for deployment.2) Incorporating human interaction into LLM evaluation can provide insights into behaviors and abilities not seen in static assessments.3) Studying real mathematician interactions with LLMs can characterize strengths, weaknesses, and potential harms when using these models as mathematical reasoning assistants.4) Expert mathematician evaluations can reveal LLM limitations in mathematical reasoning, particularly around algebra, that static approaches may miss.In summary, the core research question seems to be how to design interactive LLM evaluations that provide a more accurate picture of real-world performance, especially in collaborative domains like mathematics. The central hypothesis is that such interactive assessments will uncover important capabilities and issues not seen in standard static evaluations.
