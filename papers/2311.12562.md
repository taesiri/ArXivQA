# [Multi-Resolution Planar Region Extraction for Uneven Terrains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12562)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel multi-resolution approach for efficiently and accurately extracting planar regions from unordered 3D point clouds of uneven terrains. The method first preprocesses the input point cloud using a deep learning-based pointwise classification module to categorize points based on local surface inclinations. The classified points are then organized in an octree structure. By analyzing the distribution of categorized points within each octree node using a set of defined criteria, the method determines when to further divide a node and when to extract a plane from the node points. This octree traversal process using a divide-and-conquer strategy achieves multi-resolution plane segmentation that balances segmentation quality and efficiency. The method also introduces an incremental scheme to efficiently update the parameters when merging coplanar regions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data containing stairs, walls and other uneven terrains demonstrate the proposed method achieves superior plane segmentation performance over 35 FPS, with strong robustness against noise and effectiveness in preserving plane boundaries compared to existing RANSAC and region growing methods. The high efficiency and accuracy make the method well suited for enabling robotic perceptive locomotion over complex terrains.
