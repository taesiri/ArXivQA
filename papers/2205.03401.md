# [The Unreliability of Explanations in Few-shot Prompting for Textual   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03401)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: Can prompting large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 with explanations improve their performance on textual reasoning tasks like question answering and natural language inference? 

The paper specifically investigates whether including explanations in the prompt examples for few-shot in-context learning leads to accuracy improvements over standard few-shot learning without explanations. The authors test this hypothesis across three datasets spanning question answering and natural language inference.

In summary, the main research question is whether explanations in prompts can boost the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs for textual reasoning tasks. The paper examines this through experiments on QA and NLI datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Investigating the nature of explanations generated by large language models (LLMs) when prompted to produce them, focusing on tasks involving reasoning over text (question answering and natural language inference). 

- Finding that simply including explanations in prompts does not substantially improve few-shot in-context learning performance for textual reasoning across different LLMs.

- Showing that the explanations generated by LLMs are often unreliable - they may be inconsistent with the model's predictions or not factually grounded in the input, even on simple tasks. 

- Demonstrating that unreliable explanations are actually indicative of incorrect predictions. By approximating explanation reliability with simple lexical overlap features, the predictions can be improved by rejecting or downweighting examples with unreliable explanations.

- Proposing a general framework for using explanations to calibrate LLM predictions post-hoc and showing this improves performance across several textual reasoning datasets.

So in summary, the key ideas are studying explanation generation by LLMs for textual reasoning, finding they are unreliable but still useful for calibration, and leveraging them to improve in-context learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points of comparison between this paper and other research on explanations for large language models:

- The paper examines textual reasoning tasks like question answering and natural language inference, whereas much prior work has focused on more symbolic reasoning tasks like math problems. Studying explanations on more free-form reasoning over language is an interesting direction.

- The paper finds that including explanations in prompts for large language models like GPT-3 leads to small to moderate gains in accuracy. This contrasts with some related work that has shown larger benefits from explanations, especially on symbolic tasks.

- The paper provides a detailed analysis of the factuality and consistency of the explanations generated by the models. This kind of evaluation is not present in most prior work, which simply focuses on whether explanations improve accuracy. The analysis reveals flaws in the quality of GPT-3's explanations.

- The paper proposes using simple features based on the explanations to improve calibration of model predictions. This differs from most work on training with explanations, which incorporates them during model training. Using explanations just for calibration enables leveraging them without re-training the model.

- Compared to methods that generate explanations using interpretation techniques, this approach is model-agnostic and does not rely on access to model internals. The tradeoff is that the quality of explanations is more limited.

Overall, the analysis of explanation quality and the use of explanations specifically for calibrating textual reasoning tasks help differentiate this paper from related work. It provides a more skeptical perspective on the benefits of prompting large language models for explanations compared to some recent papers. The calibration approach also explores a novel application of model-generated explanations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests a few potential future research directions:

- Developing pre-training techniques to make large language models rely more on explanations/prompts rather than generating unreliable explanations. The authors note that LLMs currently tend to generate explanations that are not well grounded in the input context. New pre-training objectives could potentially enforce stronger grounding.

- Building better automated explanation assessment models that can accurately judge the reliability of LLMs' explanations without needing full manual inspection. The authors show lexical overlap works as a simple proxy here, but more sophisticated models trained as entailment classifiers could work better across more tasks.

- Exploring different prompt engineering techniques to make LLMs benefit more from explanations during few-shot learning. The authors find limited gains from simply inserting explanations into prompts, so future work could study if other ways of incorporating explanations help more.

- Scaling up the analysis to more datasets and language models. The authors focus on a few representative datasets and primarily test InstructGPT, so expanding the scope could reveal more insights.

- Studying social impacts and risks if explanations from LLMs are deployed in real applications, since they may hallucinate reasoning and mislead users. The authors provide some cautionary notes on this topic.

In summary, the main future directions are developing better techniques to make LLMs' reasoning align with explanations, building automated assessors of explanation quality, and further analysis on more data. The authors provide an initial investigation of using explanations for few-shot learning, while pointing out risks and limitations that warrant more research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates whether prompting large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 with explanations improves their performance on question answering and natural language inference tasks that involve reasoning over text. The authors test the performance of four LLMs (OPT, GPT-3, InstructGPT, text-davinci-002) on three datasets (a synthetic QA dataset, HotpotQA, and E-SNLI) using prompts that include explanations in two styles (explain-then-predict and predict-then-explain). They find that including explanations only yields small to moderate accuracy improvements for OPT, GPT-3, and InstructGPT, but text-davinci-002 benefits more substantially. Further analysis shows the LLM-generated explanations are often unreliable - consistent but not necessarily factual. However, unreliable explanations tend to coincide with incorrect predictions, so features approximating explanation reliability can be used to successfully improve calibration and overall performance via learned calibrators.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores the utility of prompting large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 with explanations for improving few-shot in-context learning on natural language reasoning tasks. The authors experiment with question answering and natural language inference datasets, testing different styles of incorporating explanations into the prompt. They find that including explanations in the prompts for GPT-3, OPT, and InstructGPT leads to only small to moderate gains in accuracy over standard few-shot learning. However, the InstructGPT model text-davinci-002 benefits more substantially from explanations. 

The authors further analyze the quality of the explanations generated by the models, finding they are often unreliable or inconsistent, even on a simple synthetic QA dataset. However, they show that the unreliability of explanations can be leveraged as a signal for calibrating models' predictions. They train lightweight calibrators using automatically extracted scores reflecting explanation reliability, successfully improving performance across all datasets. Overall, the results suggest explanations in prompts provide limited direct accuracy gains but can be useful for calibration in few-shot learning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents an investigation into the usefulness of including explanations in few-shot prompting of large language models (LLMs) for textual reasoning tasks like question answering and natural language inference. The main method is to prompt LLMs like GPT-3 with examples that include an explanation paired with each input-output example, and compare performance to standard few-shot prompting without explanations. The authors test this on multiple datasets, with explanations provided in two styles: explain-then-predict and predict-then-explain. 

Overall, the authors find that including explanations in prompts yields small to moderate improvements in accuracy for most LLMs tested, with more substantial gains only for one model (text-davinci-002). Further analysis shows the generated explanations are often unreliable - consistent but not necessarily factual. However, unreliable explanations tend to coincide with incorrect predictions. Leveraging this, the authors are able to train lightweight calibrators using automatically extracted explanation reliability scores to successfully improve performance across datasets after prompting.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the following main problems/questions:

1. Does prompting large language models (LLMs) with explanations improve their performance on textual reasoning tasks like question answering and natural language inference? 

2. What is the nature and quality of the explanations generated by LLMs when prompted to produce them? Are they factually grounded in the inputs and logically consistent?

3. Can unreliable or low-quality explanations still provide useful signals for calibrating LLM predictions, even if the explanations themselves are flawed?

4. Can features approximating explanation reliability be used to improve LLM performance on textual reasoning tasks in a data-efficient way?

In summary, the key focus seems to be understanding whether and how prompting with explanations impacts LLM performance and calibration on textual reasoning tasks, as well as analyzing the factual correctness and logical consistency of LLM-generated explanations even if they do not directly improve accuracy. The paper finds that while explanations do not always boost accuracy, they can still be leveraged through calibration to improve performance.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores using explanations in few-shot prompts to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 on textual reasoning tasks like question answering and natural language inference. The authors test prompting four different LLMs (OPT, GPT-3, InstructGPT, text-davinci-002) with explanations on synthetic QA, HotpotQA, and E-SNLI datasets. They find that simply adding explanations to prompts does not substantially improve accuracy for most models, with text-davinci-002 being the exception.

However, good explanations correlate with correct predictions. The authors leverage this to build lightweight calibrators using explanation scores, successfully boosting performance across datasets. The unreliability of LLM explanations raises concerns about deception of users.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using explanations generated by LLMs to improve few-shot in-context learning. However, the results show that simply prompting LLMs with explanations does not consistently or substantially improve performance across different models and tasks. Why do you think explanations fail to help in some cases? Could it be an issue with the prompt design or the nature of the tasks? 

2. The paper finds that LLMs often generate unreliable explanations that are not grounded in facts from the input context. What factors do you think contribute to models generating nonfactual explanations? Could it be a lack of grounding in real world knowledge during pretraining?

3. The results show that text-davinci-002 benefits much more from explanations compared to GPT-3 and other models. What architectural differences could explain this? Since details of text-davinci-002 are not public, what hypotheses can we make about why it performs differently?

4. The authors calibrate model predictions by training lightweight models that use features based on explanations, such as lexical overlap scores. Do you think this method could work for more complex tasks where simple lexical overlap may not indicate explanation quality? What other signals could be used to approximate explanation reliability?

5. The paper analyzes the correlation between explanation quality and prediction accuracy. Do you think models could purposefully generate misleading but fluent explanations as a way to "justify" incorrect predictions? How could this issue be addressed?

6. Could the improvements from calibration transfer to different test distributions, or does the calibration model overfit to the small number of examples used for training? What measures could be taken to improve robustness?

7. The authors use a pipeline approach, where the explanation is generated independently after the prediction. How do you think a joint model trained to make predictions and generate explanations together could differ in its performance or explanation quality?

8. Do you think prompting with explanations could be more effective for certain narrow domains compared to the general reasoning tasks studied in this paper? When would it be most impactful?

9. The authorsstudy QA and NLI tasks focused on reasoning over provided context. How do you think explanation prompting would work for open-domain QA or conversational tasks? Would different prompt designs be needed?

10. The analysis reveals flaws in LLMs' reasoning, even on simple tasks where we can fully understand the correct explanations. How should we interpret what LLMs "learn" from few-shot prompting overall? Does this cast doubt on their reasoning capabilities?
