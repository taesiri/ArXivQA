# [FRNet: Frustum-Range Networks for Scalable LiDAR Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04484)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes FRNet, a novel frustum-range network for efficient and accurate LiDAR semantic segmentation. FRNet introduces a frustum-range representation where each pixel in the 2D range image corresponds to a frustum region in the 3D point cloud. This allows preserving contextual information for all points and predicting labels in an end-to-end manner without needing post-processing. Specifically, a frustum feature encoder extracts per-point features, then a frustum-point fusion module hierarchically updates features by fusing frustum and point information. Finally, a fusion head predicts semantic labels for each point by utilizing multi-level features. Two novel data augmentations are also introduced - FrustumMix mixes point clouds based on frustum units, and Range-Interpolation synthesizes potential points to fill empty areas in the range image. Experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, ScribbleKITTI and SemanticPOSS show FRNet achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. A faster variant, Fast-FRNet, also demonstrates strong performance while maintaining real-time inference speeds. Overall, FRNet advances range-view methods by effectively preserving contextual information through the frustum-range representation.
