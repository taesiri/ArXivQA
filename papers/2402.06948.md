# [Should I try multiple optimizers when fine-tuning pre-trained   Transformers for NLP tasks? Should I tune their hyperparameters?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06948)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- There is limited guidance on which optimizer to use and whether/how much to tune hyperparameters when fine-tuning pre-trained Transformers for NLP tasks. This leads to wasted effort and resources.

- The paper investigates: (a) whether it is worth trying multiple optimizers, and (b) whether it is worth tuning optimizer hyperparameters (and which ones to tune).

Methods:
- Experiments on 5 GLUE datasets, using DistilBERT and DistilRoBERTa models. 

- 7 popular optimizers considered: SGD, SGDM, Adam, AdaMax, Nadam, AdamW, AdaBound.

- 3 cases examined: (1) default hyperparameters, (2) tuning all hyperparameters, (3) tuning only learning rate.

Key Findings:
- When hyperparameters are tuned, adaptive optimizers (Adam, AdaMax, etc.) perform very similarly and clearly outperform SGD and SGDM. 

- In most cases, tuning only the learning rate is as good as tuning all hyperparameters.

- With default hyperparameters, SGDM performs the best overall. AdaBound also does relatively well.

- Trying multiple optimizers with defaults works reasonably well, but only due to SGDM and AdaBound's good default performance.

Main Conclusions:
- Recommend picking one well-behaved adaptive optimizer (e.g. Adam) and tuning only its learning rate when fine-tuning Transformers. 

- Tuning all hyperparameters or trying multiple optimizers is generally not worth the extra effort.

- If no tuning is possible, use SGDM with defaults. AdaBound with defaults also works occasionally.

Contributions:
- Guidance on optimizer selection and hyperparameter tuning for Transformer fine-tuning.

- Extensive empirical comparison of optimizers for Transformer NLP models.

- Analysis and recommendations aimed at saving effort, computational resources and energy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

When fine-tuning pre-trained Transformers for NLP tasks, picking one well-behaved adaptive optimizer like Adam and tuning only its learning rate is the best strategy, rather than trying multiple optimizers or tuning multiple hyperparameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contribution of this paper is:

The authors systematically investigate whether it is worth (a) trying multiple optimizers and/or (b) tuning their hyperparameters (and which ones) when fine-tuning pre-trained Transformer models on NLP tasks. Through experiments on five GLUE datasets using two efficient Transformer models (DistilBERT and DistilRoBERTa) and seven popular optimizers, they find that:

1) When optimizer hyperparameters are tuned, there is little difference in test performance between the adaptive optimizers, despite occasional differences in training loss. 

2) In most cases, tuning only the learning rate leads to very similar performance as tuning all hyperparameters, but is much cheaper.

3) When no hyperparameter tuning is possible, SGD with momentum is the best choice, with AdaBound also working relatively well. Trying multiple optimizers with defaults works reasonably well too.  

4) Based on these findings, the authors recommend picking one well-behaved adaptive optimizer like Adam and tuning only its learning rate as the best strategy for fine-tuning Transformers. This can save significant effort, compute resources and energy.

In summary, the key contribution is a set of clear guidelines on whether and how to tune optimizers when fine-tuning Transformers, aimed at improving computational efficiency.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Optimizers (SGD, SGDM, Adam, AdaMax, Nadam, AdamW, AdaBound)
- Transformers (DistilBERT, DistilRoBERTa)
- Fine-tuning
- Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, momentum parameters, etc.)  
- GLUE benchmark (SST-2, MRPC, CoLA, STS-B, MNLI)
- Training loss 
- Test performance
- Adaptive vs non-adaptive optimizers
- Default hyperparameters

The paper investigates which optimizer and what degree of hyperparameter tuning works best when fine-tuning pre-trained Transformer models on NLP tasks. It compares the performance of different adaptive and non-adaptive optimizers, with full tuning, only learning rate tuning, or default hyperparameters, on five GLUE datasets. The key terms reflect concepts related to optimizers, Transformer fine-tuning, tuning methodology, and evaluation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares various optimizers when fine-tuning pre-trained Transformers, but does not examine different optimizers for the initial pre-training stage. Do you think the choice of optimizer for pre-training vs fine-tuning may lead to different conclusions? Why or why not?

2. The authors limit experiments to two distilled Transformer models (DistilBERT and DistilRoBERTa) due to resource constraints. Do you think the conclusions would still hold for larger Transformer models? What differences might we expect to see?

3. The paper examines optimizer performance on a range of GLUE tasks, but does not cover other popular NLP benchmark datasets. How might optimizer performance potentially differ on other tasks like question answering, summarization, or translation?

4. Only a constant learning rate schedule is used in the experiments. How might adaptive learning rate schedules like cosine decay interact differently with the various optimizers examined?

5. The paper argues tuning only the learning rate is sufficient for most adaptive optimizers. Do you think tuning other hyperparameters could lead to further gains? If so, which ones may be most promising to tune?  

6. The authors recommend picking Adam, AdamW, or Nadam due to consistent performance when tuning the learning rate. What are the key differences between these algorithms and why might one be preferred over the others?

7. For practitioners with very limited resources/budget for hyperparameter tuning, the paper recommends stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). What makes SGDM a good choice in this setting compared to adaptive methods?

8. The findings suggest the default values for SGDM work remarkably well across tasks. What might explain why the default values generalize so effectively?

9. The authors speculate that the default learning rate values may explain why SGDM performs well without tuning. Do you think this fully explains the difference vs other optimizers with similar defaults?

10. The paper examines optimizer performance on established benchmarks with existing train/dev/test splits. Do you think conclusions could differ if optimizers were evaluated by training models from scratch on raw datasets? Why or why not?
