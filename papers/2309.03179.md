# [SLiMe: Segment Like Me](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03179)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes Segment-Like-Me (SLiMe), a novel one-shot segmentation method that can segment objects/parts at arbitrary granularity levels using just a single annotated example image. 

2. It introduces a new "weighted accumulated self-attention map" that incorporates semantic boundary information from high-resolution self-attention maps to get more accurate segmentations compared to just using cross-attention maps.

3. It shows how to optimize the text embeddings of Stable Diffusion such that each embedding corresponds to a distinct segmented region in the image. This allows segmenting multiple regions using just the single annotated example.

4. Through extensive experiments, it demonstrates SLiMe's superiority over other one-shot and few-shot segmentation methods, despite using significantly less annotation. For example, it exceeds ReGAN by ~8% mIoU with 10 samples and SegGPT by ~7% with just 1 sample.

5. It highlights SLiMe's ability to segment a wide variety of objects, handle occlusion, and capture both high-level concepts and object-specific information using just one annotated sample.

6. Overall, it presents a novel way to perform customizable, granular image segmentation using large vision-language models like Stable Diffusion with minimal annotation. The approach is general, intuitive and does not rely on category-specific datasets or curated inductive biases.

In summary, the key novelty is in enabling granular, one-shot segmentation leveraging Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion in an effective yet simple framework. The proposed weighted self-attention map and optimization of text embeddings are instrumental to this capability.

You provide a good overview of the segmentation problem, its applications, and the need for customizable one-shot segmentation. You also briefly summarize relevant prior work on few-shot segmentation.

To further highlight the novelty of your approach, you could explicitly call out the limitations of prior arts in tackling one-shot segmentation of arbitrary granularity:

- Methods like ReGAN and SegDDPM struggle with very few samples and are not designed for one-shot learning. 

- SegGPT requires substantial annotated data for pre-training, despite using just one sample at inference time.

- Existing methods often rely on category-specific models or curated inductive biases.

- No prior work has demonstrated customizable, granular segmentation using just a single annotated sample. 

You could then clearly state your key ideas and contributions:

- Proposing SLiMe, a novel one-shot segmentation method that can segment objects/parts at arbitrary granularity using just one annotated sample.

- Introducing weighted accumulated self-attention map to get more accurate segmentations.

- Optimizing multiple text embeddings of Stable Diffusion to align with distinct segmented regions.

- Demonstrating SLiMe's effectiveness over other one-shot and few-shot methods through extensive experiments.

- Showcasing SLiMe's ability to handle occlusion, capture high-level concepts or object-specific classes, and generalize across categories using just one sample.

- Highlighting how your approach provides an intuitive and customizable segmentation without relying on large annotated data or curated inductive biases.

Sharpening the introduction in this way will help clearly convey the limitations of existing arts, and how your SLiMe approach provides an effective solution through the proposed techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes SLiMe, a novel method that leverages Stable Diffusion's cross-attention and self-attention modules along with text embedding optimization to perform one-shot segmentation of objects and parts at arbitrary granularity levels using just a single annotated example, without needing extensive labeled data or class-specific training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on the SLiMe method compares to other related research in one-shot and few-shot segmentation:

- Compared to few-shot methods like ReGAN and SegDDPM, SLiMe shows superior performance with very limited data (as low as 1 annotated example), while those methods need 10-50 examples. 

- SLiMe leverages a pre-trained generative model (Stable Diffusion) rather than training a new model from scratch for each object category like ReGAN. This provides generalizable knowledge.

- Unlike supervised approaches like SegGPT that require large annotated datasets for training, SLiMe only needs 1 annotated example even during training.

- While methods like SegGPT take a reference image + segmentation at test time, SLiMe just needs the test image, learning the segmentation from the example at training time.

- Compared to correspondence methods like UnSeCo that output a point, SLiMe produces a full segmentation mask.

- SLiMe makes novel use of both cross-attention and self-attention in a pre-trained diffusion model for one-shot segmentation, unlike prior work.

- The weighted accumulated self-attention map in SLiMe helps improve localization and boundaries compared to just using cross-attention.

- Extensive experiments on PASCAL-Part and CelebA-Mask datasets demonstrate SLiMe outperforming prior state-of-the-art approaches.

So in summary, SLiMe pushes the capabilities of one-shot segmentation by creatively harnessing pre-trained generative models, requiring minimal data annotation, and outperforming existing few-shot and supervised methods. The novel attention mechanism also demonstrates improved localization.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some potential future research directions the authors suggest:

- Improving the optimization process to make it real-time and applicable to videos. The current optimization approach takes around 2 minutes per image to converge, which limits its applicability for video segmentation. Developing faster optimization techniques could enable video segmentation.

- Resolving limitations in segmenting very small objects/parts. As shown in Figure 8, the method struggles with segmenting tiny objects like necklaces due to the limited resolution of the attention maps. Exploring ways to obtain higher resolution attention maps could help overcome this. 

- Incorporating inductive biases to further improve segmentation accuracy. While a benefit of the method is not relying on handcrafted inductive biases, incorporating some biases related to common object/part structures could potentially boost performance.

- Extending the approach to 3D segmentation. The current method is designed for 2D image segmentation. An interesting direction could be adapting it for 3D shape or volumetric data segmentation.

- Leveraging additional modalities beyond vision+language, such as depth maps or surface normals. Integrating multi-modal cues could improve segmentation of ambiguous regions. 

- Applying the approach to video object segmentation. As mentioned above, developing faster optimization could enable video applications.

- Exploring self-supervised pre-training of the text embeddings for improved generalization. Rather than random initialization, pre-training on a large dataset could improve few-shot generalization.

In summary, some key directions are improving run-time, handling small objects, incorporating useful inductive biases, extending to 3D/multi-modal data, and pre-training the text embeddings. Overall, the general idea of using optimized text embeddings to control attention maps is promising for few-shot segmentation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the related work:

Recent work has explored using large pre-trained models like Stable Diffusion (SD) for semantic segmentation tasks. Methods like SegDDPM and ReGAN can perform few-shot part segmentation but struggle with very limited data. SegGPT achieves one-shot segmentation but requires extensive pre-training. Our method, Segment Like Me (SLiMe), performs one-shot part segmentation using SD's self- and cross-attention maps and text embedding optimization. Compared to correspondence methods like UnSeCo that output a point, SLiMe produces a segmentation mask. Unlike SegGPT which is supervised, SLiMe is unsupervised and needs only one annotated example, making it uniquely suited for one-shot segmentation without large labeled datasets. Experiments show SLiMe matches or exceeds state-of-the-art few-shot methods with orders of magnitude less data.

% Object and part segmentation involves identifying and distinguishing individual objects or regions of interest in an image. This process is pivotal in computer vision and image processing, facilitating numerous downstream applications. Accurate object segmentation is important for tasks such as object recognition, classification, and tracking, as well as image understanding, editing, and manipulation. It also has numerous applications in a wide variety of fields such as bio medicine, agriculture, and robotics. 
% Existing object segmentation methods often depend on extensive training datasets and/or incorporating inductive biases, which manifest as properties of the target objects, into the method's loss terms, architectures, or input features.


Segmentation is a multifaceted problem, with solutions existing at various levels of granularity. So from the perspective of an end-user, a straightforward and effective approach to guide a segmentation method is determining what to segment and the desired level of detail across a broad set of images by providing only one or a few examples for the method to use as a reference during training. The user should not need to curate a large dataset of images annotated with ground truth segmentations, train a large segmentation model, or encode elaborate properties of target objects. This example-driven instruction would provide users with the ability to intuitively define and refine the target segmentations according to their specific requirements. For instance, in applications like expression recognition or facial alignment, segmenting images of faces into basic regions like nose, eyes, and hair might suffice. However, in visual effects applications, more detailed segments such as eye bags, forehead, chin, and lips are necessary for tasks like wrinkle removal. Therefore, a flexible and customizable segmentation technique that can adapt to different levels of granularity becomes crucial. However, it is highly impractical to have a large set of ground truth annotations for all possible anticipated granularity levels, highlighting the need for a one-shot or a few-shot learning to address this challenge.

% To achieve a versatile and customizable segmentation technique, one effective approach is to frame the problem as a one-shot or few-shot segmentation method. 
% Recent research has delved into the realm of few-shot learning, offering promising solutions. For example, methods like ReGAN \citep{tritrong2021repurposing} employ a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate data, which is subsequently manually annotated to train a segmentation model. In contrast, SegDDPM \citep{baranchuk2021label} extracts image features from a pre-trained diffusion model and leverages multiple Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) on these features to perform segmentation. While both ReGAN and SegDDPM excel in managing segmentation tasks with a modest number of annotated examples (typically 10-50), they face challenges when dealing with a very limited sample size, let alone relying on just one segmentation sample.
% Though one-shot learning is challenging, it has been recently investigated in SegGPT \citep{wang2023seggpt}, which is a substantial segmentation model trained by applying random colorization to the training segmentation data, which includes part level and instance level segmentation data. After training the model, to segment an object or a part within a target image, SegGPT takes both the target image and a source image, along with the source image's object/part segmentation, as input, and segments the corresponding region in the target image. However, it's essential to highlight that SegGPT demands a substantial amount of annotated segmentation data for effective training. Thus, the search for a method capable of training with no more than a single annotated data point remains an unmet challenge.

Recent research has explored few-shot learning, bringing forward promising methods like ReGAN \citep{tritrong2021repurposing}, which uses a GAN to generate data for manual annotation and model training. In contrast, SegDDPM \citep{baranchuk2021label} extracts features from a pre-trained diffusion model (DM) and trains multiple MLPs for segmentation using few labels. Both excel in segmentation with 10-50 examples but struggle with extremely limited samples. Whereas, SegGPT \citep{wang2023seggpt} employs one-shot learning, training on color-randomized segmentation data that includes both instance and part-level details. During inference, it segments only one region in a target image using a reference image and its binary segmentation map. While SegGPT is effective, it demands a significant amount of annotated segmentation data for pre-training, keeping the challenge of training effectively with a single annotation still unaddressed.

In this work, we propose Segment-Like-Me (\method{}), which segments any object/part from the same category based on a given template with an arbitrary granularity level in a one shot-manner, avoiding the need for extensive annotated segmentation data (see Figure \ref{fig:teaser} and Figure \ref{fig:diff_class_res} for some examples).
For this purpose, we harness the rich knowledge of existing large-scale pre-trained vision/language models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD) \citep{rombach2022high}. Recent studies like \citep{hertz2022prompt} have highlighted that the cross-attention maps of models like SD highlight different regions of the image when the corresponding text changes. This notable property has recently been utilized to modify generated images \citep{hertz2022prompt} and to achieve image correspondence \citep{hedlin2023unsupervised}. Expanding on this idea, we present two key insights. First, we observed that standalone cross-attention maps can be inherently noisy, leading to imprecise segmentation, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ca_vs_slime}. To rectify this, we propose a novel weighted accumulated self-attention map. This attention map incorporates crucial semantic boundary information and employs high-resolution self-attention maps, ensuring enhanced segmentation accuracy. 
Secondly, the text embeddings in SD can be fine-tuned to capture semantic details, like segmented regions, where each embedding corresponds to a distinct segmented region, guided by a reference image and its segmentation map.
% Second, the text embeddings of Stable Diffusion can be optimized to learn semantic information such as  segmented regions where each text embedding represents a single segmentation part by using a  reference image and its corresponding segmentation map. 
% instead of relying on a single text embedding, as is the norm in textual inversion \citep{gal2022image} or image correspondence \citep{hedlin2023unsupervised}, we opt to fine-tune multiple text embeddings, where each text embedding aligns with a distinct segmented region, guided by a reference image and its corresponding segmentation map.


Drawing from these insights, \method{} employs a single training image and its associated segmentation map to fine-tune the text embeddings of SD through attention maps. These refined embeddings emphasize segmented regions within the attention maps, which can be converted to segmentation map. 
Once learned, these embeddings can be used to segment multiple real-world image during inference, mirroring the granularity of the segmented region from the training image.
% This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:teaser} and Figure \ref{fig:diff_class_res}. 
Through various quantitative and qualitative experiments, we highlight the efficacy of our approach. Our method, even when reliant on just one or a handful of examples, proves to be comparable to supervised counterparts demanding extensive training.
% Through various quantitative and qualitative experiments, we highlight the efficacy of our approach. Our method, even when reliant on just one or a handful of examples, proves to be comparable to supervised counterparts demanding extensive training. 
Furthermore, when compared to few-shot methods, our results demonstrate a significant performance advantage. In a 10-sample scenario, we surpass ReGAN \citep{tritrong2021repurposing} by approximately 8 percent, and in a 1-sample context, we exceed SegGPT by around 7 percent. In a 20-sample setting, \method{} also outperforms SegDDPM in terms of mIoU. These accomplishments firmly establish our method as a leading contender in the state-of-the-art landscape.
% Furthermore, in comparison to few-shot methods, our results demonstrate a significant performance advantage.
% Specifically, in a 10-sample setting, we achieve approximately an 8 percent improvement over ReGAN \citep{tritrong2021repurposing} and a 7 percent enhancement over SegGPT in a 1-sample setting. Additionally, \method{} we outperforms SegDDPM in terms of mIoU in a 20-sample setting. It's worth noting that these achievements position our method at the forefront of the state-of-the-art in the field.







% In a recent investigation by \citep{hedlin2023unsupervised}, the researchers proposed an image correspondence method, which determines the semantically corresponding point in a target image when provided with a source image and a single reference point on it. This task was accomplished through the utilization of cross-attention modules within the diffusion model, which effectively captured semantic knowledge to facilitate the mapping of points between the two images.
% In this paper, our primary objective is to achieve one-shot segmentation, based on a given template, across a range of arbitrary granularity levels. (Refer to Figure \ref{teaser} and Figure~\ref{fig:diff_class_res} for illustrative examples).
% One approach to achieve a flexible and customizable segmentation technique is to frame the problem as a one-shot or few-shot segmentation method.  For instance, methods such as ReGAN \citep{tritrong2021repurposing} employs a GAN to produce data, which is then manually annotated to train a segmentation model.
% On the other hand, SegDDPM \citep{baranchuk2021label} extracts image features from a pretrained diffusion model and utilizes multiple MLPs on these features for segmentation.
% Although both ReGAN and SegDDPM can manage segmentation with a limited number of annotated examples (10-50), they are incapable of working with very few samples, let alone relying on only one segmentation sample.
% As another example, SegGPT \citep{wang2023seggpt} is a large segmentation model which is initially trained by randomly coloring the training data, and then, to segment an object/part in the target image, they input this image along with a source image and its corresponding object/part segmentation. However, SegGPT needs a lot of annotated segmentation data to be trained.


%To tackle this problem, prior work such as ReGAN \citep{tritrong2021repurposing}, LeSS \citep{baranchuk2021label}, and SegGPT \citep{wang2023seggpt} have explored the potential solutions. To perform part level segmentation, ReGAN \citep{tritrong2021repurposing} use a GAN trained on the same category. Then, they annotate 10 images generated by the GAN to train a segmentation model using the annotation and the features extracted from the GAN. Compared to our method, this method takes several hours to be trained, and in addition to the annotated images, it needs a bunch of images from the same category. The second work, LeSS \citep{baranchuk2021label}, extracts features for the images from a pretrained diffusion model. Then stacks several MLPs on top of these features to perform segmentation. This method is also capable of segmenting with few segmentation images, but compared to our method, more annotated samples are needed to train their MLPs (20 to 50 samples), and it is not possible to train these MLPs with lower amount of data. The last example in this category of work is SegGPT \citep{wang2023seggpt}. In the training stage of this work, they train a large general segmentation model using a lot of images and a random coloring scheme. After training, to segment an object/part in the target image, they feed this image together with a source image and its segmentation of the corresponding object/part. Compared to our method, this is a supervised method and needs a lot of annotated images.

% To this end, we utilize cross-attention modules of a conditional pre-trained diffusion model. However, directly using the image correspondence technique proposed in \citep{hedlin2023unsupervised}, which only uses cross-attention modules, results in inaccurate and noisy segmentation (Figure \ref{fig:ca_vs_slime}).


% Instead, we propose a hierarchical image segmentation that is performed at three levels (image level, patch level, and part level) \am{Aliasghar, confirm}.
% {\color{red} Instead, we propose \method{}, which uses cross 

% Hence, in addition to cross-attention modules, we use self-attention modules to get refined segmentations. The self-attention maps, which encode valuable semantic knowledge about boundaries and are sourced from layers with a higher resolution than those housing cross-attentions, contribute to more precise segmentations.
% Figure \ref{teaser} shows several examples of how \method{} works.

% We show the effectiveness of our approach using several quantitative and qualitative experiments. We demonstrate that our method, despite requiring only one or a few examples, is on par with supervised alternatives that require extensive training.
%Our method uses the backward (denoising) process of a trained and frozen Stable Diffusion. In the optimization stage, using two loss functions which are calculated using the cross-attention and self-attention layers, we optimize two of the input token's text embeddings. Following the training step, in the test step, we use the optimized text embeddings and extract their corresponding attention maps from the cross-attention layer. Furthermore, we extract some attention maps from the self-attention layer and use them together with the cross-attention maps to enhance the quality of our segmentations. 
% When compared to few-shot methods, our results are about 8 percent better than ReGAN \citep{tritrong2021repurposing}, which is considered to be the state of the art. 
% % Additionally, our approach only takes 2 minutes per image to converge, which is significantly shorter than the training time of ReGAN.
% While ReGAN trains a GAN for each object class (e.g., car) once, to segment various parts within that class, it necessitates the training of a separate GAN from scratch for different object classes.

% Although the two segmentation networks in ReGAN are trained once for segmenting the parts in each category (e.g., face parts), for different categories, like the parts of cat, a GAN and two segmentation models should be trained from scratch. In addition to that, for various granularity, the two segmentation models should be re-trained.

\section{Method}
Prior research has demonstrated the use of  cross-attention maps in  detecting coarse segmented objects during the generation process \citep{hertz2022prompt}, yet there remains uncertainty regarding the applicability of these approaches for finer-grained detection of objects or parts specially within real-world images.

% Although highlighting the semantically relevant pixels by cross attention module is a precious feature, but it only works well in the object level for the generated images by SD (because the generation process is needed) and it does not work for the objects in the real image or parts of the objects both in the generated images and the real images.
We introduce \method{}, a method that enables us to perform segmentation at various levels of granularity in both real-world and generated images, needing only one labeled image as a reference.
% In this study, we present \method{}, which introduces a new attention map, called Weighted Accumulated Self-attention map (WAS-attention map),  which enables us to perform segmentation at various levels of granularity in both real-world and generated images, all while requiring as little as a single annotated image.
In our approach, during the training phase, we first extract the cross-attention map and weighted accumulated self-attention map to fine-tune the text embeddings, enabling each text embedding to encapsulate semantic information from individual segmented regions (Figure \ref{fig:optimization_step}).  During the inference phase, we use these optimized embeddings to highlight the segment part and then obtain the segmentation map (Figure \ref{inference_step}). In the following subsections, we will delve into the details of the text optimization first and then the inference process.

% Given an image $I_{train}$, its segmentation mask $M_{train}$, and a text $T$, our goal is to fine-tune the text embedding of the $i^{th}$ token ($T_i$) of the text prompt, $\mathcal{T}_i$, such that, for any test image $I_{test}$ if we encode it ($\mathcal{I}_{test} = \mathcal{E}(I_{test})$), pass $\mathcal{I}_{test}$ together with $\mathcal{T}$, where $\mathcal{T}_i$ is fine


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the related work section:

The first paragraph focuses on semantic part segmentation. Traditional methods for this task rely on large annotated datasets or manually designed inductive biases tailored to specific objects. Recent work has explored alternatives like few-shot learning, with ReGAN using a GAN to generate data for annotation and model training. However, it still requires many images to train the GAN for each object category. SegDDPM uses a diffusion model for feature extraction and trains small MLPs, but needs more samples than our method. SegGPT is trained on extensive colorized segmentation data and can segment an object given one example, but requires substantial pre-training data. 

The second paragraph covers diffusion models like Stable Diffusion (SD). SegDDPM demonstrates diffusion models on part segmentation but uses class-specific training and MLPs rather than optimizing text embeddings. Other works have adapted SD for tasks like image editing and generation by fine-tuning text embeddings or using attention maps. We take inspiration from these to perform part segmentation with just one annotated example, using SD's cross-attention and weighted self-attention maps to optimize text embeddings. Compared to prior arts, this eliminates the need for category-specific model training while achieving better performance from minimal samples.

% We find the text embeddings that refer to our desired \emph{region} in any image either generated or real. To do so, given an image and a binary mask determining the desired region, we use a pre-trained and frozen Stable Diffusion model and we must employ an optimization algorithm to find the best text token whose corresponding attention map highlights the desired area. However, as the text token space is not continuous, it is challenging to perform optimization in that space and also there may not exist good solutions. Hence, we perform the optimization in the text embedding space, which is a continuous space and propose \method{}, that can be used to segment any object, in any granularity, given as few as a \emph{single segmented example} of that category. 
% Figure \ref{train_image} \am{it does not show any example; woman?} shows an example of this task, where given an image of a woman and a segmentation mask of her mouth, \method{} learns to segment the human mouth in any given test image.

% During training, we optimize the text embeddings to learn different segmented areas using cross attention and self-attention maps obtained from the input source training image. When the input source image has multiple segments, we utilize and combine multiple binary masks. During inference, we use these learned text embeddings to segment the target images and also use our novel locate-and-zoom technique to improve the results. We will first elaborate the optimization stage, then go into the inference stage.
% Our method comprises two stages: finding the best text embedding to explain the segmented area in the input source image by optimization, and then using the optimized text embedding to segment the corresponding area in target images. To find segments of multiple regions, we utilize and combine multiple binary masks. In this section, we will first elaborate the optimization stage, then go into the inference stage and finally see how we get our final results by locating the target region and zooming over it.

% Given a pair of an image ($I \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}$) and a segmentation mask ($M \in \{0,1,2,..., K-1\}^{H \times W}$) with $K$-classes, where $K < T$, we first pass an empty text $H=\text{``"}$ to SD's text tokenizer to get $P$. The first token in $P$ is SOT and as $H$ is an empty text, the tokenizer puts EOT in place of the remaining $T-1$ tokens in $P$ (SOT and EOT are special tokens that the tokenizer uses to indicate start of text and pad the tokenized input text to have a specific length, respectively). Afterward, we pass these tokens through the text encoder of SD to get the text embeddings $\mathcal{P}$. 
In what follows, we will explain how we optimize the text embeddings to learn about the segmented regions. Given a pair consisting of an image ($I \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}$) and a segmentation mask ($M \in \{0,1,2,..., K-1\}^{H \times W}$), where the segmentation mask involves $K$ classes, our initial step involves supplying an empty text denoted as $B$ = ``" to the text tokenizer of Stable Diffusion (SD), yielding $P$. It's important to highlight that the number of tokens from $P$, represented as $T$, must exceed the $K$ classes. The magnitude of $T$ is often significantly large. For example, SD comprises 77 tokens, enabling the approach to accommodate up to 76 segmentation classes. The first token present within $P$ signifies the Start of Text (SOT), and since $B$ remains devoid of any text content, the tokenizer inserts the End of Text (EOT) token in place of the remaining $T-1$ tokens within $P$. (SOT and EOT tokens possess special functionality, as they serve to indicate the initiation of text and pad the tokenized input text to achieve a specific length, respectively.) Following this, the tokens are subsequently processed through SD's text encoder, resulting in the derivation of text embeddings represented as $\mathcal{P}$.
% In this section, we aim to fine-tune the text embeddings of SD, ensuring each embedding aligns with a distinct segment of the training image. For a graphical representation of this process, refer to Figure \ref{fig:optimization_step}.
% % In this section, our aim is to optimize the text embeddings of SD so each of them correspond to one of the segmented areas in the training image. For a visual depiction of our approach in this step, please consult Figure \ref{fig:optimization_step}.
% % In this section, our objective is to optimize  text embedding of SD such that its corresponding cross attention map highlights our desired region. For a visual representation of our approach for this step, please refer to Figure \ref{fig:optimization_step}.
% Given a pair of an image ($I \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}$) and a segmentation mask ($M \in \{0,1,2,..., K-1\}^{H \times W}$) with $K$-classes, where $K \leq T$, 
% % ($I \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C}, M \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W}$), where $H$, $W$, and $C$ are width, height, and number of channels of the input image, 
% we first pass an empty text $H=\text{``"}$ to SD's text tokenizer to get $P$. In $P$, the first token is SOT and as $H$ is an empty text, the tokenizer puts EOT in place of the remaining $T-1$ tokens (SOT and EOT are special tokens that the tokenizer uses to indicate start of text and pad the tokenized input text to have a special length, respectively. Afterward, we pass these tokens through the text encoder of SD to get the text embeddings $\mathcal{P}$. 
%We can feed any text to our method, as the initial text is not important, and given any text, we can reach the desired text embedding using our optimization process.
Then pass the input image $I$ to $\mathcal{E}$ to get the image embedding $\mathcal{I}$. Afterward, we sample standard Gaussian noise and add it with respect to the time step $t$ to $\mathcal{I}$ and name it $\mathcal{I}_t$. Finally, we feed $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{I}_t$ to UNet to get the denoised image embedding $\mathcal{I}'$. After passing these data to UNet, we extract the first $K$ text tokens' corresponding normalized cross-attention maps, $S_{ca}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{H' \times W'}$, for $i=\{0, ..., K-1\}$.
% Empirically, we have seen that the corresponding cross attention map of the 0'th text token of SD highlights the background, so we choose that to correspond to the background and call it $\{S_{ca}^0\}_l$. For the foreground, as there is no significant difference between the other text tokens' cross attention maps, we can choose any of them, and we choose the first one and call it $\{S_{ca}^1\}_l$.
% Figure \ref{extract_attention} depicts our attention extraction procedure for one token. 
Moreover, SD has several cross-attention modules located in different layers, and we show the normalized cross-attention map of the $l^{th}$ layer with $\{S_{ca}\}_l  \in \mathbb{R}^{H'_l \times W'_l \times T\}$. We average over different normalized cross-attention maps extracted from different layers because, empirically, we have seen that the averaging enhances the results.
However, as $H'_l$ and $W'_l$ are not the same for different attention modules in different layers, we resize $\{S_{ca}\}_l$, for all the layers we use, to an equal size. Finally, the attention map we use in our loss function is calculated as follows:
% choose the 0'th and 1'st tokens and extract their corresponding unnormalized attention maps from $S_{ca}$ and call $S_{ca}^0$ and $S_{ca}^1$ \ali{why these two? Explain...}. 
% For convenience, in the rest of the paper, we show $\{S_{ca}^0\}_l$ and $\{S_{ca}^1\}_l$ with $\{S_{ca}^i\}_l$ where $i=\{0, 1\}$. 
% In addition to this, the UNet has several attention layers, and we show the $l^{th}$ layers output with $\{S_{ca}^i\}_l$ and $\{S_{sa}\}_l$. 
% Then to calculate our losses, we resize them to an equal size and average them:
\begin{equation}
    A_{ca}^i = Average_l (Resize(\{S_{ca}^i\}_l)),
\end{equation}
where $A_{ca}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W}$, $Average_l$ calculates the average over layers, and $Resize$ is a bilinear interpolation. Figure \ref{extract_attention} visually depicts this procedure. % We average over several layers, as empirically we have seen that averaging over several attention layers enhances the results.
Now, for $i=\{1, ..., K-1\}$, we want to optimize $\mathcal{P}_i$ such that $A_{ca}^i$ highlights the $i^{th}$ class's region in the segmentation mask. Note that we don't optimize $\mathcal{P}_0$ and assign it to the background class, because if we change its values, SD won't operate properly. 
% ($A_{ca}^1$ should show the desired object/part (foreground) and $A_{ca}^0$ should show the remaining parts (the background))

To begin, we stack $A_{ca}^i$, for $i=\{0, ..., K-1\}$, and use them together with $M$ to calculate a cross entropy loss as follows:
%, but we first need to resize the attention maps to the size of $M$, as they are smaller than the segmentation mask. To achieve this, we use bilinear interpolation and denote the resized attention maps with: $L_{ca}^i$. 
%After resizing and \textcolor{green}{averaging} the attention maps, we calculate the cross entropy loss in this way
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{ce}= CE([A_{ca}^0| A_{ca}^1 | ... | A_{ca}^{K-1}], M),
\end{equation}
where $CE$ refer to cross-entropy. Although this loss optimizes $\mathcal{P}_i$ such that $A_{ca}^i$ highlights the desired area, as the sizes of $\{S_{ca}^i\}_l$ we use for calculating $A_{ca}^i$ are significantly smaller than the input image and object edges are vague in them, the resulting segmentation is very inaccurate. To improve the quality and elevate the accuracy, in conjunction with the cross-attention, we benefit from the self-attention map ($S_{sa}$). 

There are three underlying reasons for using the self-attention maps. First, it has rich information about the semantics of an image. In fact, for each pixel $p$ in the input of the self-attention module, it has an activation map highlighting those pixels that share the same


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes SLiMe, a one-shot segmentation method that can segment objects or parts at arbitrary granularity levels using a single annotated example. SLiMe leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained vision-language model like Stable Diffusion (SD). It first extracts cross-attention and weighted accumulated self-attention maps from SD. During training, it optimizes the text embeddings of SD so that each embedding corresponds to a distinct segmented region in the input image. This is done by using the extracted attention maps and the input segmentation mask in two loss functions. Once trained, these optimized text embeddings are used during inference to highlight the corresponding regions in the attention maps of a test image, which are then converted to segmentation masks. By using just one annotated example to fine-tune the text embeddings, SLiMe can segment new images according to the granularity of the training example.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

1. Can a large pre-trained vision-language model like Stable Diffusion be leveraged to perform segmentation at arbitrary granularity levels using just one annotated example, without needing a large labeled dataset? 

2. Can optimizing the text embeddings of Stable Diffusion guide it to learn to segment specific regions in an image as indicated by a single training example?

3. Can a combination of cross-attention and self-attention maps extracted from Stable Diffusion enable more accurate segmentation, compared to just using cross-attention? 

4. How does the proposed Segment Like Me (SLiMe) approach compare to existing few-shot and one-shot segmentation techniques like ReGAN, SegDDPM, and SegGPT in terms of segmentation performance?

In summary, the central hypothesis is that a large pre-trained vision-language model can be adapted to perform one-shot segmentation at flexible granularity levels by optimizing its text embeddings on just one annotated example, aided by extracted attention maps. The experiments aim to validate if this approach can match or exceed existing few-shot segmentation methods that require more training data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing a new segmentation method called SLiMe (Segment Like Me) that addresses the challenge of segmenting images at various levels of granularity using very limited labeled data (as few as one annotated example). 

The key points are:

- Image segmentation is important for many applications but often requires large labeled datasets. The authors aim to perform segmentation with only 1-10 annotated examples.

- Existing few-shot segmentation methods like ReGAN and SegDDPM rely on training class-specific generative models which is cumbersome. SegGPT requires a large segmentation dataset for pre-training. 

- SLiMe frames segmentation as a one-shot optimization task. Given one annotated image, it fine-tunes the text embeddings of Stable Diffusion using novel weighted accumulated self-attention maps to capture the semantic details of the desired segmentation.

- This allows segmenting new images at test time by using the optimized text prompts, without needing to train class-specific models or require large datasets. Experiments show SLiMe matches or exceeds other few-shot methods.

- Main limitations are potential noisy results for tiny regions, and extension to video/3D.

In summary, the key contribution is a new way to perform few-shot segmentation leveraging optimized text conditioning of diffusion models, without extensive class-specific training. The method shows promising results on a range of segmentation tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a weighted accumulated self-attention (WAS-attention) map along with the cross-attention map for segmentation. What is the intuition behind using WAS-attention and how does it help improve segmentation performance compared to just using cross-attention?

2. The method optimizes the text embeddings of Stable Diffusion using the reference image and segmentation mask. What is the reasoning behind optimizing the text embeddings rather than other components of the model? How does this allow the model to learn the desired segmentation in a one-shot manner?

3. The cross-attention and self-attention maps are extracted from multiple layers of the Stable Diffusion model and averaged. What is the motivation behind using attention maps from multiple layers rather than just a single layer? How does this multi-layer approach capture different levels of semantic information?

4. The method incorporates three loss terms during optimization - cross-entropy loss, MSE loss, and the original Stable Diffusion loss. Why is each of these losses necessary and what specific aspect of learning does each one target? How do they complement each other?

5. During inference, the optimized text embeddings are used to obtain the WAS-attention maps which are then upsampled and stacked to generate the final segmentation mask. Walk through this process in detail and explain the purpose of each step. 

6. The method is able to perform segmentation using just a single annotated example, which is a very challenging setting. What properties of the Stable Diffusion model enable this one-shot learning capability? How does the optimization strategy take advantage of this?

7. The authors highlight the generalization capability of the method to novel object classes not seen during Stable Diffusion's training. What gives rise to this generalization ability despite being one-shot? Are there any limitations?

8. The method struggles with segmenting very small objects as mentioned in the paper. Trace this issue back to the algorithm design and analyze the potential reasons behind it. How can this limitation be addressed?

9. The method only optimizes the first K text embeddings where K is the number of segmentation classes. Why is the background text embedding not optimized? What happens if it is optimized? Provide an analysis.

10. The inference process uses the noise schedule time step t_test to control the segmentation mask's granularity. Explain how varying t_test affects the final segmentation result. What is the intuition behind this? How should t_test be set?
