# [Evaluating the Performance of Large Language Models for Spanish Language   in Undergraduate Admissions Exams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16845)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper evaluates the performance of two large language models, GPT-3.5 and BARD, on sample undergraduate admission exams from the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) in Mexico. The exams cover three main fields of study: engineering/mathematical and physical sciences, biological and medical sciences, and social and administrative sciences. 

The models are prompted with 126-140 multiple choice questions from each exam, spanning topics like math, physics, biology, history and reading/writing comprehension. Their selected responses are compared to the answer key to measure accuracy across subjects.

Overall, GPT-3.5 marginally beats BARD, answering 60.94% questions correctly versus 60.42% for BARD. Both models exceed the 50th percentile minimum score required for admission to over half of IPN's academic programs. GPT-3.5 outperforms in math and physics questions, while BARD does better on history and factual queries.

The models showcase strengths in solving well-defined academic problems but struggle with open-ended math word problems requiring textual interpretation. Their 50-60% scores on reading/writing comprehension also highlight challenges with textual entailment, central ideas and tone.  

The paper concludes that while these models can pass IPN admissions for many programs, the top 25% programs remain out of reach currently. Still, the models' strong explanatory capabilities make them promising for supporting the learning process. The accessibility of advanced LLMs may necessitate modifying future exams to ensure fair assessments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates the performance of large language models GPT-3.5 and BARD on sample undergraduate admission exams from the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico, finding that both models exceeded minimum acceptance scores for up to 75% of academic programs, with GPT-3.5 slightly outperforming BARD overall.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an evaluation of the performance of two large language models, GPT-3.5 and BARD, on sample undergraduate admission exams in Spanish proposed by the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) in Mexico. 

Specifically, the paper assessed the models' capabilities on exams covering three main fields of study:

1) Engineering/Mathematical and Physical Sciences
2) Biological and Medical Sciences  
3) Social and Administrative Sciences

The exams aim to evaluate skills such as reading and writing comprehension, critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, and domain-specific knowledge in subjects like biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and history.

The results showed that both GPT-3.5 and BARD exceeded the minimum acceptance scores for admission to up to 75% of IPN's academic programs. Overall, GPT-3.5 slightly outperformed BARD, with scores of 60.94% and 60.42% respectively.

The paper concludes that while these models demonstrate promising capabilities, modifying exam formats may be necessary to ensure fair assessments for students, as the widespread availability of advanced LLMs could create an unfair advantage. The models still face some limitations in reliably solving more complex, interpretive problems.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous Spanish-language evaluation of LLMs on a diverse set of admission exams spanning different academic disciplines. The analysis provides insights into the current strengths and weaknesses of these models on educationally-relevant tests.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the keywords associated with this paper appear to be:

Keywords: Large Language Models, ChatGPT, BARD, Undergraduate Admissions Exams.

The paper focuses on evaluating the performance of large language models, specifically GPT-3.5 and BARD (supported by the Gemini Pro model), on undergraduate admissions exams in various subjects proposed by the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico. The key aspects examined are the models' general knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and reasoning capabilities. The admissions exams cover major groupings of academic programs in engineering/mathematical and physical sciences, biological and medical sciences, and social and administrative sciences. So the key terms summarized in the keywords relate to the main topics and focus of the study.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper evaluates the performance of GPT-3.5 and BARD on admissions exams from the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico. What were the key motivations and goals behind assessing these specific models and exam sets? 

2. The exams were adapted to remove visual components and converted equations to Wolfram format. How might the inclusion of visuals and unmodified equations have impacted the experimental design and results?

3. The exams covered diverse subjects including biology, chemistry, physics, math, history, and language skills. Did any observable performance patterns emerge across topics or question types? Were certain skills more challenging?

4. The paper reports overall scores for each model on the three exam groupings. Was the variance in performance significant? What factors may have contributed to differences by exam? 

5. Minimum acceptance scores vary by academic program at IPN. How well did the models perform relative to the distribution of minimums? What proportion of programs could they gain admission to?

6. The paper notes challenges with word problems and more complex mathematical reasoning. How might the models be further improved to handle such multi-step, interpretive problems? 

7. For language tasks, what specific weaknesses did the models demonstrate in areas like identifying central ideas, tone, and inference? How could training be tailored to strengthen these skills?

8. The conclusion highlights risks of test question formats becoming predictable for LLMs. What alternative question and assessment styles could address this issue? 

9. How reproducible and generalizable are these experimental findings to other admissions exams, academic subjects, and languages? What controls would be necessary?

10. What implications does this research have for using LLMs in education more broadly? How can institutions equitably integrate such models while upholding rigorous evaluative standards?
