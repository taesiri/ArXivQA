# [Evaluating the Performance of Large Language Models for Spanish Language   in Undergraduate Admissions Exams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16845)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper evaluates the performance of two large language models, GPT-3.5 and BARD, on sample undergraduate admission exams from the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) in Mexico. The exams cover three main fields of study: engineering/mathematical and physical sciences, biological and medical sciences, and social and administrative sciences. 

The models are prompted with 126-140 multiple choice questions from each exam, spanning topics like math, physics, biology, history and reading/writing comprehension. Their selected responses are compared to the answer key to measure accuracy across subjects.

Overall, GPT-3.5 marginally beats BARD, answering 60.94% questions correctly versus 60.42% for BARD. Both models exceed the 50th percentile minimum score required for admission to over half of IPN's academic programs. GPT-3.5 outperforms in math and physics questions, while BARD does better on history and factual queries.

The models showcase strengths in solving well-defined academic problems but struggle with open-ended math word problems requiring textual interpretation. Their 50-60% scores on reading/writing comprehension also highlight challenges with textual entailment, central ideas and tone.  

The paper concludes that while these models can pass IPN admissions for many programs, the top 25% programs remain out of reach currently. Still, the models' strong explanatory capabilities make them promising for supporting the learning process. The accessibility of advanced LLMs may necessitate modifying future exams to ensure fair assessments.
