# [HyperReenact: One-Shot Reenactment via Jointly Learning to Refine and   Retarget Faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10797)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform photorealistic facial reenactment using only a single source image and a target image with different facial pose. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel method called "HyperReenact" that aims to generate realistic talking head video sequences of a source person's face driven by the facial pose (head orientation and facial expression) of a target person. The key hypothesis is that by combining a pretrained StyleGAN2 generator with a hypernetwork module, the proposed method can effectively refine the identity characteristics of the source face and re-target its facial pose to match that of the target, even under challenging conditions like large differences in head pose between source and target. This allows photorealistic one-shot facial reenactment.In summary, the core research question is how to achieve robust and photorealistic one-shot neural face reenactment, even for difficult cases like large changes in head pose or cross-subject reenactment. The key hypothesis is that a hypernetwork operating on a StyleGAN2 generator can enable effective disentangling and manipulation of identity and facial pose features to accomplish this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a novel method called HyperReenact for neural face reenactment. The main contributions are:1. It leverages a pretrained StyleGAN2 generator and a hypernetwork to jointly refine the source identity and re-target the facial pose, eliminating dependence on external editing methods that produce artifacts.2. It operates in a one-shot setting using just a single source image and allows for cross-subject reenactment without subject-specific fine-tuning. 3. It achieves state-of-the-art results on datasets like VoxCeleb even for extreme pose variations, generating realistic and artifact-free results. 4. It effectively disentangles identity from facial pose by blending appearance features from the source and pose features from the target using a novel Reenactment Module.5. The hypernetwork learns to predict offsets to modify the weights of StyleGAN2 generator layers to achieve both identity refinement and facial re-targeting in one joint model.In summary, the key contribution is a novel framework that leverages StyleGAN2 and hypernetworks to perform robust one-shot cross-subject facial reenactment even for large pose variations, through joint identity refinement and pose retargeting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper presents HyperReenact, a neural face reenactment method that uses a hypernetwork to refine and re-target facial images generated by a pretrained StyleGAN2 model. The key idea is to leverage StyleGAN2's ability to generate realistic images while using the hypernetwork to preserve the source identity and transfer the target facial pose in a robust, artifact-free way, even with large pose differences between source and target.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of neural face reenactment:- The key approach taken in this paper is novel compared to prior work. The authors propose using a hypernetwork to jointly refine the inverted source face and re-target it to the target pose. Most prior works tackle these as separate steps, which can lead to artifacts. The concurrent refinement and re-targeting is a unique aspect.- The method operates in a one-shot setting, using just a single source frame. Many prior works require multiple frames of the source identity to fine-tune the model and avoid identity leakage. This makes the approach more practical.- The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on established benchmarks like VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2. Quantitative metrics show improved identity preservation and pose transfer over comparable methods. The method also produces fewer artifacts in challenging scenarios like large pose differences.- A key advantage over recent GAN inversion based methods is avoiding reliance on an external network for inversion. Methods that use pretrained inverters can suffer from editability issues. By using a hypernetwork to directly update the GAN generator, this work avoids these limitations.- Compared to other hypernetwork based inversion techniques like HyperStyle, this method better maintains identity and enables editing like pose retargeting. The concurrent refinement and editing is better suited to reenactment.- The approach generalizes well to multiple datasets without identity-specific fine-tuning, unlike many models that require per-identity adjustments. This also enables effective cross-subject reenactment.In summary, the core ideas appear novel compared to prior reenactment works, and lead to state-of-the-art results and fewer artifacts. The generalizable one-shot capability is also an advantage over methods needing fine-tuning. The evaluation validates these innovations translate to quantitative and qualitative improvements.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Improving the robustness of the model on large variations in head pose and facial appearance between the source and target images. The authors note limitations in handling accessories like hats and glasses. Developing techniques to better reconstruct these details would be useful.- Extending the framework for video reenactment instead of just image reenactment. Generating realistic and temporally coherent talking head videos is an important direction.- Exploring different training strategies like adversarial learning or self-supervision to further improve cross-subject generalization. - Applying the proposed hypernetwork framework for other image/video editing tasks beyond reenactment, such as age progression/regression, attribute editing etc.- Evaluating the method on more diverse and challenging datasets. The authors mainly experiment on talking head datasets like VoxCeleb and suggest testing on datasets with larger pose variations.- Combining the approach with other modalities like audio or text to develop controllable multimodal talking head generation systems.- Investigating ethical aspects and potential misuse of face reenactment methods, and developing solutions to detect manipulated facial content.In summary, the main future directions are around improving robustness, generalization and controllability of the face reenactment framework, applying it to related tasks and modalities, evaluating on more diverse data, and considering the societal impacts.
