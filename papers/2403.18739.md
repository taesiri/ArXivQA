# [Usage-Specific Survival Modeling Based on Operational Data and Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18739)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately predicting when a component will fail is important for maintenance planning. Data-driven survival models can describe the distribution of failure times but often have trouble capturing complex degradation behaviors.
- Existing models don't provide a clear methodology for training usage-specific survival models based on operational data gathered at multiple times during a component's lifetime. Having multiple data points per individual makes the data not independent, so standard maximum likelihood training can't be directly applied.

Proposed Solution:
- Define a usage-specific survival function conditioned on aggregated operational data up to a specific age of the component.
- Propose using a "quasi-likelihood" to enable maximum likelihood-like training when there are multiple non-independent data points per individual. 
- Show that if the snapshot data is "homogeneously sampled" (same snapshot times for all individuals) then maximizing the quasi-likelihood works well.
- When data is not homogeneously sampled, resample it to make it homogeneous before training. The resampling density is an important parameter.
- To avoid needing a high resampling density, propose an "epochwise random resampling" approach that uses a different random resampled version of the data each epoch.

Contributions:
- Formally defines the problem of training usage-specific survival models from longitudinal operational data.
- Provides conditions (homogeneous sampling) under which a quasi-likelihood can substitute for a proper likelihood during training.
- Shows that resampling non-homogeneous data works empirically.
- Proposes the epochwise random resampling method to reduce computational burden. 
- Evaluates the approach on simulated data and a real-world starter battery lifetime dataset.

In summary, the key contribution is a full methodology for training usage-specific survival models on longitudinal operational data by transforming the data to enable maximum quasi-likelihood training. The epochwise random resampling technique helps enable practical application.
