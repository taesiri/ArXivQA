# [A Benchmark of Domain-Adapted Large Language Models for Generating Brief   Hospital Course Summaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05720)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Brief hospital course (BHC) summaries are important clinical documents that summarize patient hospital visits, but manually generating them is time-consuming for clinicians. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to automate BHC generation, but their capabilities on this specific clinical task have not been thoroughly explored and benchmarked.  

Methods: The authors introduce a new benchmark using a preprocessed dataset of 270,033 clinical note and BHC pairs extracted from MIMIC-IV notes. They evaluate various LLM adaptation strategies, including prompting and fine-tuning, for generating BHC summaries from clinical notes using both open-source (Llama2, FLAN, Clinical-T5) and proprietary (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) LLMs. Both quantitative metrics (BLEU, ROUGE-L, BERTScore) and a qualitative clinical reader study with 5 expert clinicians are used to assess the adapted LLM's performance.

Results: Fine-tuned open-source Llama2 performs the best on quantitative metrics whereas prompted GPT-4 receives the highest qualitative rankings from clinicians. GPT-4 summaries are preferred by clinicians over both Llama2 and original clinician-written summaries (p < 0.001) in terms of comprehensiveness, conciseness, factual correctness and fluency.  

Conclusions: The study demonstrates that adapted LLMs, especially large proprietary models like GPT-4, can generate high quality BHC summaries that are preferred over human-written summaries. This benchmark and clinical reader validation highlights the potential for LLMs to alleviate clinical documentation burden in synthesizing brief hospital visit summaries.
