# [Vehicle Behavior Prediction by Episodic-Memory Implanted NDT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08423)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Predicting vehicle behaviors (e.g. turning left/right, stopping, etc.) is important for autonomous vehicles to make safe decisions. Existing deep learning models show good performance but lack interpretability, which is concerning for real-world application. The paper aims to enhance the interpretability for vehicle behavior prediction.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an Episodic Memory implanted Neural Decision Tree (eMem-NDT) to interpret vehicle behavior predictions. 

Key ideas:
- Construct a neural decision tree (NDT) with a predefined structure based on clustering of behavior text embeddings. This provides a reasonable tree structure aligned with driving common sense.

- Implant episodic memory in each leaf node. The episodic memory stores raw historical vehicle states and interactions that correlate with the leaf node behavior type from the training data. This provides introspective memory prototypes for prediction explanations. 

- Optimize NDT by matching input features against episodic memories for memory prototype matching (MPM), aggregating matches towards the root for final prediction (LLA).

- For a new prediction, trace the NDT path from root to matched leaf memory prototype to provide an interpretable explanation.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the episodic memory implanted NDT (eMem-NDT) for interpretable vehicle behavior prediction. This provides prediction explanations by matching against remembered instances.

- Constructs the NDT structure by clustering behavior text embeddings, keeping the tree aligned with driving common sense. 

- Implants episodic memories in leaf nodes to store correlated historical vehicle states/interactions from training data. This enables leaf nodes to be self-explainable.

- Optimizes eMem-NDT by memory prototype matching and leaf link aggregation for accurate behavior predictions.

- Shows improved prediction accuracy over baselines, with added model interpretability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an interpretable model called Episodic Memory implanted Neural Decision Tree (eMem-NDT) for fine-grained vehicle behavior prediction, which implants episodic memory of vehicle states and interactions into the leaf nodes of a neural decision tree to enable matching input instances to similar historical driving scenarios for explainable predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It constructs an Episodic Memory implanted Neural Decision Tree (eMem-NDT) to boost the interpretability of vehicle behavior prediction, where every prediction can be given a reasonable interpretation by matching it to memory behavior prototypes distilled from the training data.

2. It implants episodic memories of vehicles into the leaf nodes of the NDT to provide introspective behavior prototypes for each prediction, which promotes the leaf node explainability. 

3. It infers vehicle behavior prediction by an efficient bottom-up link searching to find the best matching episodic memory prototype for each instance, and obtains the behavior scores by layer-wise link score aggregation. This formulation incorporates vehicle behavior relations in certain driving scenes and improves performance on the BLVD and LOKI datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is using episodic memories in an NDT structure to enhance interpretability and performance for fine-grained vehicle behavior prediction.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Vehicle behavior prediction (vBeh-Pre) - Predicting future behaviors (e.g. turning left, stopping) of vehicles based on observations. This is the main focus of the paper.

- Episodic memory - Remembering specific events/episodes. The paper proposes using episodic memories of vehicle states and interactions to enhance interpretability. 

- Neural Decision Trees (NDTs) - Decision trees that incorporate neural networks at nodes to handle large-scale data. The paper proposes an NDT with episodic memories (eMem-NDT).

- Interpretability/explainability - A key focus of the paper is making the vehicle behavior predictions more interpretable and explainable compared to black-box models.

- Memory prototype matching (MPM) - Matching input instances to relevant memory prototypes in the NDT leaf nodes. Part of the inference process.  

- Leaf link aggregation (LLA) - Aggregating predictions from leaf nodes to make final behavior predictions. Also part of the inference process.

Some other terms: target vehicle, interaction graph, few-shot behaviors, etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
