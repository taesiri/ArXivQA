# [Vehicle Behavior Prediction by Episodic-Memory Implanted NDT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08423)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Predicting vehicle behaviors (e.g. turning left/right, stopping, etc.) is important for autonomous vehicles to make safe decisions. Existing deep learning models show good performance but lack interpretability, which is concerning for real-world application. The paper aims to enhance the interpretability for vehicle behavior prediction.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an Episodic Memory implanted Neural Decision Tree (eMem-NDT) to interpret vehicle behavior predictions. 

Key ideas:
- Construct a neural decision tree (NDT) with a predefined structure based on clustering of behavior text embeddings. This provides a reasonable tree structure aligned with driving common sense.

- Implant episodic memory in each leaf node. The episodic memory stores raw historical vehicle states and interactions that correlate with the leaf node behavior type from the training data. This provides introspective memory prototypes for prediction explanations. 

- Optimize NDT by matching input features against episodic memories for memory prototype matching (MPM), aggregating matches towards the root for final prediction (LLA).

- For a new prediction, trace the NDT path from root to matched leaf memory prototype to provide an interpretable explanation.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the episodic memory implanted NDT (eMem-NDT) for interpretable vehicle behavior prediction. This provides prediction explanations by matching against remembered instances.

- Constructs the NDT structure by clustering behavior text embeddings, keeping the tree aligned with driving common sense. 

- Implants episodic memories in leaf nodes to store correlated historical vehicle states/interactions from training data. This enables leaf nodes to be self-explainable.

- Optimizes eMem-NDT by memory prototype matching and leaf link aggregation for accurate behavior predictions.

- Shows improved prediction accuracy over baselines, with added model interpretability.
