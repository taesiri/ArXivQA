# [Learning a Sparse Representation of Barron Functions with the Inverse   Scale Space Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02671)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a method for finding a sparse representation of Barron functions using an inverse scale space flow. Specifically, given a function $f$, the method uses a dynamical system to iteratively construct a measure $\mu$ that minimizes both the $L^2$ loss between the associated Barron function $K\mu$ and $f$, as well as the Barron norm of $\mu$. This represents searching for a sparse shallow neural network approximating $f$. The convergence and error analysis of this method is studied under four cases: (1) ideal noiseless setting, (2) in the presence of measurement noise, (3) with biased sampling of the data distribution, and (4) with discretization of the parameter space. The ideal case achieves monotonic convergence at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$. With noise or bias, there is still monotonic convergence, but only up to an error level determined by noise/bias parameters. An additional discretization error appears with finite parameter spaces, disappearing as the discretization becomes infinitely fine. Overall, the inverse scale space flow provides a dynamically evolving system for constructing sparse representations of functions using Barron spaces and shallow neural networks.
