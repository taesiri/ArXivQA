# [CoGenesis: A Framework Collaborating Large and Small Language Models for   Secure Context-Aware Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03129)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) require extensive user context information to generate personalized and effective content. However, their cloud-based deployment risks compromising user privacy.  
- Smaller specialized models deployed on devices are more privacy-friendly but underperform compared to LLMs with context.
- Balancing performance and privacy across model scales remains an open challenge.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a context-aware instruction following task enriched with user privacy context like profiles, activities, etc.
- Design a pipeline to synthesize personalized writing instruction datasets for model evaluation.
- Propose CoGenesis, a collaborative framework between large cloud-based and small on-device models. It has two variants:
  - Sketch-based: LLM generates outline, SLM uses it to craft personalized content.
  - Logit-based: Lightweight model fuses logits from LLM (no context) and SLM (full context).

Main Contributions:
- Formulation and dataset creation for context-aware instruction following task.
- Empirical analysis showing SLM with context outperforms LLM without context, but lags behind LLM with context. 
- CoGenesis collaborative framework that enhances SLM performance and safeguards privacy through mixed-scale model synergy.
- Comparative assessment of sketch-based and logit-based CoGenesis variants. The latter proves more effective.

In summary, the paper introduces the context-aware instruction following task and proposes privacy-preserving collaborative generation between models of different scales as a promising solution direction.
