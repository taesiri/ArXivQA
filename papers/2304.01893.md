# [Trace and Pace: Controllable Pedestrian Animation via Guided Trajectory   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01893)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to generate realistic pedestrian trajectories and full-body animations that can be controlled to meet user-defined goals. Specifically, the authors aim to develop a generative model of trajectories that is data-driven yet controllable at test time through the use of guided diffusion models. This controllable trajectory model is then integrated with a physics-based humanoid controller to enable full-body pedestrian animation that can be directed by a user through high-level objectives like specifying waypoints or social groups.In summary, the key research questions are:1) How can recent advances in guided diffusion modeling be leveraged to achieve test-time controllability for trajectory generation?2) How can this controllable trajectory model be tightly integrated with a physics-based animation system to enable user-directed simulation of full-body pedestrian motions?3) Can this integrated system robustly handle varying tasks, terrains, and characters in a controllable manner based on user high-level goals?The main hypothesis is that by combining a controllable trajectory diffusion model with a general-purpose pedestrian animation controller, it is possible to develop an end-to-end pedestrian animation system that gives users control over high-level behavioral objectives while generating realistic physics-based motions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. A controllable trajectory diffusion model called TRACE that can generate realistic pedestrian trajectories and be guided at test time to meet user-defined objectives like waypoints, social groups, and collision avoidance. The key novelty is the use of guidance with a trajectory diffusion model to enable test-time control.2. A novel physics-based pedestrian animation controller called PACER that can drive simulated humanoid characters with diverse body types along trajectories from a high-level planner like TRACE. It is trained with terrain/social awareness and adversarial imitation learning for natural motions.3. An end-to-end pedestrian animation system combining TRACE and PACER in closed-loop feedback, enabling controllable simulation of crowds. The connection is strengthened by using PACER's learned value function to guide TRACE's trajectory diffusion, making planning aware of the animation model's preferences.In summary, the main contribution is an animation system with a controllable high-level trajectory planner based on guided diffusion and a robust low-level character controller, which can generate animations of pedestrians that meet user-defined objectives and constraints. The integration of the two components in closed-loop while leveraging the value function for planning is a key contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes a novel method for generating controllable pedestrian trajectories and full-body animations by integrating a guided diffusion model for high-level planning with a physics-based humanoid controller, enabling user control over waypoints, speed, social groups, and collision avoidance in simulated crowds and environments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in pedestrian trajectory modeling and controllable character animation:- The use of a diffusion model for trajectory generation is novel. Most prior work has used RNN/Transformer architectures for trajectory prediction. Diffusion models have advantages like efficient parallel sampling and test-time control through guidance.- Integrating the trajectory model with a full physics-based character controller is a key contribution. Many prior trajectory forecasting papers focus only on 2D positions. The authors demonstrate controlling simulated humanoids driven by the trajectories.- The idea of classifier-free guidance during diffusion training is an interesting way to improve controllability. Randomly dropping conditioning allows more flexible generation at test time. - Using the value function from the animation controller to guide the trajectory model is clever. It connects the high- and low-level models in a unidirectional way.- For animation, this work follows a two-stage planning-control approach. Some recent methods like DeepLoco and Haworth et al. do end-to-end control with learned implicit planning. The advantage here is the trajectory model can be re-used.- For trajectories, modeling longer-term multi-modal futures conditioned on context is still an open problem. This method generates a single deterministic path. Capturing diverse behaviors and far futures remains challenging.So in summary, key novelties are using diffusion for pedestrian trajectory modeling, enabling test-time control through guidance, and the integrated animation system. The work represents an advance in controllable data-driven character animation. Like other learning-based methods, modeling diversity and complex interactions between agents and environments over longer time horizons is still an area for future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Improving the efficiency and speed of the trajectory diffusion model (TRACE) to make it usable in real-time settings. They suggest diffusion model distillation as a potential solution.- Extending diffusion models to low-level full-body character control, beyond just high-level trajectory generation.- Better handling of using multiple guidance objectives simultaneously in TRACE, such as by dynamically clipping the guidance strength during sampling.- Improving the quality and diversity of motions generated by the PACER model, such as by incorporating more common pedestrian behaviors like talking on the phone.- Enhancing the ability of PACER to handle very large obstacles when there is no way to go around them.- Generalizing the system to work with more complex environments and scenarios beyond the pedestrian navigation tasks explored in this paper.- Tighter integration between the high-level trajectory planning of TRACE and low-level control of PACER, such as by sharing learned representations.- Exploring other conditional diffusion models beyond just trajectories, to generate full-body motions or even video of simulated humans.In summary, the main suggested directions are around improving the speed and scalability of the models, enhancing the quality and diversity of generated motions, tighter integration between the two components, and extending the approach to new domains like full body and video generation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a method for generating realistic pedestrian trajectories and full-body animations that can be controlled to meet user-defined goals. The method uses a guided diffusion model called TRACE to generate controllable trajectories by perturbing the outputs during denoising towards desired objectives. TRACE allows control through specifying waypoints, speed, and social groups while accounting for environment context. The trajectory model is integrated with a novel physics-based humanoid controller called PACER that can animate diverse body types to follow the trajectories in a simulated environment. By combining terrain awareness in PACER with collision avoidance guidance in TRACE, the system can produce full-body animations of pedestrians that meet high-level control objectives and low-level physical plausibility. Experiments demonstrate controllability of TRACE on synthetic and real-world pedestrian data. The integrated system is shown to enable user control over large simulated crowds while avoiding obstacles and traversing complex terrains.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:The paper introduces a method for generating realistic pedestrian trajectories and full-body animations in a controllable manner to meet user-defined goals. The first key contribution is TRACE, a trajectory diffusion model that leverages recent advances in guided diffusion modeling to enable test-time control of trajectories. TRACE allows users to constrain trajectories by specifying target waypoints, speed, and social groups while accounting for surrounding environmental context. It is trained on pedestrian data in a way agnostic to any tasks, with all control objectives defined through test-time guidance. The second main contribution is PACER, a novel physics-based humanoid controller capable of driving simulated characters with diverse body types along the 2D trajectories generated by TRACE. PACER focuses on producing high-quality, human-like motion using adversarial training, while being socially and terrain aware to enable robust crowd simulation. TRACE and PACER are integrated into an end-to-end controllable pedestrian animation system, where they operate in a closed feedback loop. The value function from PACER's RL training can further guide TRACE to generate animator-friendly trajectories suited for the current scenario. Experiments demonstrate controllable trajectory generation on synthetic and real-world data. The full animation system also shows capable performance on tasks like waypoint following, obstacle avoidance, and traversing variable terrains.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces a controllable trajectory diffusion model called TRACE for generating realistic pedestrian trajectories that can meet user-defined objectives. TRACE leverages recent advances in guided diffusion modeling to enable test-time control of trajectories through user guidance. It generates trajectories by denoising samples from a learned diffusion model, conditioned on past pedestrian motion, neighboring pedestrians, and a spatial grid encoding of the environment map. At test time, user objectives like avoiding collisions or reaching certain waypoints are incorporated through an analytical guidance loss that perturbs the denoised outputs towards meeting the desired goals. This trajectory model is integrated with a novel physics-based humanoid controller called PACER to create full-body animations. PACER is trained with reinforcement learning to follow 2D trajectories and navigate diverse terrains and crowds. Together, TRACE and PACER form an end-to-end controllable system for pedestrian animation, where TRACE plans high-level trajectories that PACER converts into realistic physics-based character motion.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of generating controllable and realistic pedestrian trajectories and full-body animations. The key problems/questions it is aiming to tackle are:1. How to make trajectory generation models controllable at test time to meet user-defined objectives like waypoints or social groups, while still generating natural human-like motion. Most existing learning-based methods are difficult to explicitly control.2. How to integrate trajectory generation with full physics-based character animation to create realistic pedestrian behaviors in simulated 3D environments with obstacles and varying terrains. Existing methods either use simplified kinematic models or require separate training for different tasks/terrains.3. How to create a closed-loop system where a high-level trajectory generator and low-level character controller work together, adapting their behaviors based on the environment and each other's outputs over time.So in summary, the main focus is on developing a controllable, flexible, and integrated system for generating full-body pedestrian animations that behave realistically in dynamic environments to meet high-level user control objectives. The key technical contributions are the trainable diffusion model for controllable trajectory generation, the robust physics-based humanoid controller, and the closed-loop coupling of the two components.
