# [Trace and Pace: Controllable Pedestrian Animation via Guided Trajectory   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01893)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to generate realistic pedestrian trajectories and full-body animations that can be controlled to meet user-defined goals. Specifically, the authors aim to develop a generative model of trajectories that is data-driven yet controllable at test time through the use of guided diffusion models. This controllable trajectory model is then integrated with a physics-based humanoid controller to enable full-body pedestrian animation that can be directed by a user through high-level objectives like specifying waypoints or social groups.In summary, the key research questions are:1) How can recent advances in guided diffusion modeling be leveraged to achieve test-time controllability for trajectory generation?2) How can this controllable trajectory model be tightly integrated with a physics-based animation system to enable user-directed simulation of full-body pedestrian motions?3) Can this integrated system robustly handle varying tasks, terrains, and characters in a controllable manner based on user high-level goals?The main hypothesis is that by combining a controllable trajectory diffusion model with a general-purpose pedestrian animation controller, it is possible to develop an end-to-end pedestrian animation system that gives users control over high-level behavioral objectives while generating realistic physics-based motions.
