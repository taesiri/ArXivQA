# [An Interpretable Ensemble of Graph and Language Models for Improving   Search Relevance in E-Commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00923)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Search relevance in e-commerce is challenging due to the need to understand short, nuanced queries and match them to appropriate products. 
- Traditional models use language models (LMs) to capture semantics and graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture product relationships. However, evaluating new model architectures requires extensive experimentation on complex datasets which is expensive.  
- Existing models also operate on latent representations that lack interpretability, hindering model development and adoption.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Plug and Play Graph Language Model (PP-GLAM), an interpretable ensemble of plug and play language models and relational GNNs.
- Uses a modular framework with uniform data pipelines and additive explanation metrics to independently decide whether to include (i) LM candidates, (ii) GNN candidates, (iii) inter-product behavioral signals.
- Encodes query-product pairs using multiple language-specific and multilingual LMs. Uses a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) for model selection.  
- Handles long product descriptions by denoising to a fixed token length using TF-IDF based term importance.
- Considers multiple behavioral signals like clicks, purchases etc. and corresponding GNNs. Uses GBDT ensemble and SHAP values to select best signals based on performance.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes PP-GLAM, a modular ensemble of LMs and relational GNNs using GBDTs for flexible model selection.
- Shows PP-GLAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on search relevance and irrelevant detection on a multi-regional e-commerce dataset.
- Demonstrates benefits of using ensembles as an interpretable strategy to aggregate features and efficiently select impactful models.
- Provides detailed strategy to deploy the modular framework in practical settings with dynamic data.

In summary, the paper presents an interpretable and flexible ensemble approach using LMs and GNNs to improve search relevance in e-commerce.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing PP-GLAM, a modular ensemble framework of language models (LMs) and relational graph neural networks (GNNs) that utilizes gradient boosted decision trees (GBDTs) for flexible model selection in practical environments. Specifically:

1) It presents PP-GLAM, a modular and interpretable ensemble model that aggregates signals from multiple LMs and relational GNNs using GBDTs. This allows it to leverage the latest advances in LMs and GNNs.

2) It demonstrates the effectiveness of PP-GLAM on search relevance tasks like ESCI classification and irrelevant detection. It shows improved performance over state-of-the-art baselines on a real-world e-commerce dataset.

3) It analyzes the model components using additive SHAP values to automatically select the best performing LMs and relational GNNs based on computational constraints. This makes the framework suitable for industry settings.

4) It provides a detailed strategy to deploy the modular framework in practical environments with dynamic data sources.

In summary, the main contribution is an interpretable, modular ensemble framework that can efficiently aggregate signals from language and graph models for improved search relevance, along with the analysis and deployment details.
