# [Fairness Evaluation for Uplift Modeling in the Absence of Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12069)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Uplift modeling is used to identify users who would benefit the most from an intervention (e.g. a marketing campaign)
- However, there is no ground truth on whether the intervention decision was the best possible action for each user
- This lack of ground truth severely limits the ability to evaluate algorithmic fairness of uplift models
- Most binary fairness metrics require ground truth labels which are not available in uplift modeling

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an algorithm to generate "surrogate ground truth" (SGT) labels for uplift modeling
- The key idea is to reuse the uplift model's own treatment and control score estimates to approximate counterfactual outcomes
- For each user, the surrogate lift is calculated as: actual outcome - control model prediction (if user received treatment) OR treatment model prediction - actual outcome (if user did not receive treatment)  
- After the campaign, users are re-ranked by the surrogate lift and cutoffs are reapplied to assign surrogate labels on who should have been treated

Main Contributions:
- A generic algorithm to generate proxy ground truth labels for uplift modeling campaigns, overcoming the lack of true labels
- Enables more comprehensive binary fairness evaluations using the surrogate labels
- Evaluated on a real-world Starbucks marketing campaign dataset with multiple scenarios 
- Shows surrogate labels close ~50% gap to a hypothetical Oracle, serving as a reasonable proxy
- Fairness analysis reveals potentially biased effects on age, gender and income groups
- Overall, enables uplift modeling fairness analysis which was not possible previously due to lack of ground truth labels

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution by developing a practical algorithm to generate proxy truth labels for uplift modeling. This enables more rigorous fairness evaluation where ground truth is missing. The method is demonstrated to work reasonably well on real marketing campaign data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an algorithm to generate surrogate ground truth labels for uplift modeling campaigns to enable enhanced binary fairness evaluations that would not be possible otherwise due to the lack of true labels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an algorithm for Surrogate Ground Truth (SGT) generation for the Campaign Design Problem (CDP). The SGT algorithm generates surrogate labels that can serve as a proxy for the ground truth in uplift modeling campaigns. This allows for an enhanced binary fairness evaluation of the uplift models, which would not be possible otherwise due to the lack of ground truth labels in such campaigns. Specifically, the SGT algorithm leverages the trained uplift models to generate estimated counterfactual outcomes for treatment and control groups. This surrogate ground truth then enables evaluating additional binary fairness metrics beyond what is possible without truth labels. The authors demonstrate the approach on a real-world marketing campaign dataset from Starbucks and show that the SGT can close about 50% of the performance gap compared to a hypothetical oracle. Overall, the key innovation is devising a practical method to conduct more comprehensive fairness evaluations for uplift modeling and campaign design problems.

The paper proposes an approach called "surrogate ground truth (SGT) generation" to enable enhanced fairness evaluation of uplift models used in campaign design, where ground truth labels are not available. The method is applied to a marketing campaign dataset from Starbucks to demonstrate its utility. The key ideas focus on uplift modeling, campaign design, generating surrogate labels to serve as a proxy for missing ground truth, and using this to conduct more comprehensive binary fairness evaluations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes generating "surrogate ground truth" (SGT) to enable enhanced fairness evaluation of uplift models. Could you explain in more detail the key ideas behind how the SGT labels are generated? What assumptions does this approach make?

2. The SGT algorithm seems to leverage ideas from doubly robust estimation. How is the method similar and different from typical doubly robust estimation approaches? What simplifications were made and why?

3. The paper evaluates the quality of the SGT labels by comparing the performance to an "Oracle" strategy on the Starbucks marketing campaigns dataset. Could you walk through the Oracle strategy and how it provides a notion of ground truth? What are limitations of this evaluation approach?

4. Beyond evaluating performance, the key benefit highlighted is being able to conduct more comprehensive binary fairness evaluations using the SGT labels. Could you explain this in more detail - what specific fairness metrics become available and what insights do they provide over the baseline metrics? 

5. The paper studies fairness evaluations with respect to protected attributes like age, gender and income. What checks were done on the uplift models themselves to examine if these attributes were critical features being used? How does this further motivate the need for enhanced fairness evaluations?

6. The Starbucks dataset provides an interesting case study with both treatment and control behaviors. What are some key data preprocessing and feature engineering steps that were done to setup the uplift modeling pipeline? How might this differ in other practical applications?

7. The paper focuses on a two-model uplift approach. Could you compare and contrast this with other uplift modeling techniques like the dummy-variable and four-quadrant approaches? What are relative pros and cons?

8. Beyond the methods studied, what other approaches exist in the literature that aim to evaluate fairness in the context of treatment effect estimation and decision making systems? How do they compare and contrast with the SGT technique?

9. The paper makes an assumption that the uplift models provide reasonable rankings between the start and end times. Could you discuss scenarios where this assumption might be violated? How robust is the SGT quality to such violations?

10. The surrogate ground truth is evaluated on a publicly available dataset. What are some practical challenges expected in real-world industry applications where ground truth remains completely unavailable? How might the approach need to be adapted?
