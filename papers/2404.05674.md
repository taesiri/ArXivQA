# [MoMA: Multimodal LLM Adapter for Fast Personalized Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05674)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing image personalization models require per-instance fine-tuning which is computationally expensive. Recently proposed tuning-free methods have limitations in detail accuracy, identity preservation, texture editing ability and generalization. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MoMA, a novel tuning-free open-vocabulary image personalization model built on top of Stable Diffusion and LLaVA (a multimodal language and vision model). 

- A multimodal generative image feature decoder is introduced that combines the visual features from a reference image and textual features from a prompt to generate contextualized image features. This helps modify textures while preserving identity.

- A self-attention shortcut mechanism efficiently transfers fine-grained features from the reference image to further enhance detail fidelity. A masking technique is used to prevent interference between backgrounds.

- A two-stage training methodology involving multimodal generative learning and diffusion learning is utilized.

Key Contributions:

- MoMA demonstrates superior performance in recontextualization and texture editing tasks through qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

- It achieves higher detail accuracy, identity preservation and coherence between images and prompts compared to prior arts, in a tuning-free manner.

- As a plug-and-play module built on top of Stable Diffusion, it can generalize to various community models without modification.

- The proposed multimodal decoder and self-attention shortcut techniques are vital components that enable MoMA's sample quality and efficiency.

In summary, the paper presents an effective tuning-free approach for personalized image generation that sets new state-of-the-art for open-vocabulary models. The method is computationally inexpensive and widely accessible.
