# [Towards Automated Causal Discovery: a case study on 5G telecommunication   data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14481)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Causal discovery algorithms and methods are challenging to apply in practice, requiring extensive expertise. The paper introduces the concept of Automated Causal Discovery (AutoCD) to make causal discovery accessible to non-experts by automating the full analysis pipeline. 

Proposed Solution: The authors propose an AutoCD system with three main modules:

1. Automated Feature Selection (AFS): Reduces dimensionality by estimating the Markov boundary of a target variable. It searches over feature selection algorithms and model configurations.

2. Causal Learning (CL): Learns the optimal causal graph given the selected features. It searches over causal discovery algorithms and configurations and uses a tuning method called OCT to select the best one.  

3. Causal Reasoning and Visualization (CRV): Computes confidence of estimated causal relations using bootstrapping, visualizes the graph, and answers causal queries about relationships in the graph.

The system can handle high-dimensional, mixed data types and temporally evolving data. It optimizes over representations, algorithms and parameters to find the best fitting causal model.

Contributions:
1) Proposal of the AutoCD concept and an implementation.
2) Application of AutoCD on a real-world 5G telecom dataset with 143 time series variables. AutoCD could scale to the problem size and admit latent confounders.
3) Experimental evaluation on resimulated and synthetic temporal data showing good performance of the pipeline.

The system makes automated causal discovery accessible to non-experts on real-world problems. Limitations are scalability of some methods and low recall. Future work includes more algorithms, evaluation procedures, and a web interface.
