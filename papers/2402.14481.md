# [Towards Automated Causal Discovery: a case study on 5G telecommunication   data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14481)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Causal discovery algorithms and methods are challenging to apply in practice, requiring extensive expertise. The paper introduces the concept of Automated Causal Discovery (AutoCD) to make causal discovery accessible to non-experts by automating the full analysis pipeline. 

Proposed Solution: The authors propose an AutoCD system with three main modules:

1. Automated Feature Selection (AFS): Reduces dimensionality by estimating the Markov boundary of a target variable. It searches over feature selection algorithms and model configurations.

2. Causal Learning (CL): Learns the optimal causal graph given the selected features. It searches over causal discovery algorithms and configurations and uses a tuning method called OCT to select the best one.  

3. Causal Reasoning and Visualization (CRV): Computes confidence of estimated causal relations using bootstrapping, visualizes the graph, and answers causal queries about relationships in the graph.

The system can handle high-dimensional, mixed data types and temporally evolving data. It optimizes over representations, algorithms and parameters to find the best fitting causal model.

Contributions:
1) Proposal of the AutoCD concept and an implementation.
2) Application of AutoCD on a real-world 5G telecom dataset with 143 time series variables. AutoCD could scale to the problem size and admit latent confounders.
3) Experimental evaluation on resimulated and synthetic temporal data showing good performance of the pipeline.

The system makes automated causal discovery accessible to non-experts on real-world problems. Limitations are scalability of some methods and low recall. Future work includes more algorithms, evaluation procedures, and a web interface.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Automated Causal Discovery (AutoCD), an architecture to automate causal discovery and reasoning through automated feature selection, causal learning, and causal visualization and querying, and applies it to a telecommunications case study and evaluates it on synthetic data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are twofold:

1) The authors implement and introduce AutoCD, a library for various causal learning and reasoning tasks targeting non-expert users. 

2) The authors apply AutoCD on a real-world telecommunication problem as a case study. Specifically, they use AutoCD to induce causal relations among time-series measurements from a commercial 5G network.

So in summary, the main contributions are (1) the development of the AutoCD library for automated causal discovery and (2) a demonstration of its application on real-world telecommunication data. The goal is to make causal discovery techniques more accessible to non-experts through automation.

 Based on my reading of the paper, the keywords and key terms that are associated with this paper include:

Automated Causal Discovery (AutoCD) - The main concept introduced in the paper, defined as the effort to fully automate the application of causal discovery and causal reasoning.

Automated Feature Selection (AFS) - One of the three main modules of the AutoCD architecture, which reduces the dimensionality of the data. 

Causal Learning (CL) - Another main module, which learns a causal model over the features selected by AFS.

Causal Reasoning and Visualization (CRV) - The third main module, which visualizes, summarizes, explains, and interprets the causal model.  

Causal discovery - A field of machine learning and statistics that aims to induce causal knowledge from data.

Markov boundary - The minimal set of variables that renders a target variable conditionally independent from all other variables. Used in feature selection.  

Out-of-sample Causal Tuning (OCT) - A method for optimizing/tuning causal discovery algorithms and configurations.  

Automated machine learning - The automation of machine learning model selection and tuning. Related concept that inspired AutoCD.

So in summary, the key terms cover the main AutoCD architecture modules (AFS, CL, CRV), causal discovery concepts like the Markov boundary, and methodologies like OCT.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the automated causal discovery (AutoCD) method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an architecture for AutoCD with three main modules: Automated Feature Selection (AFS), Causal Learning (CL), and Causal Reasoning and Visualization (CRV). Can you elaborate on the key functions and outputs of each module? What are the connections between the modules?

2. In the AFS module, the paper utilizes an automated machine learning platform for predictive modeling and feature selection. Can you explain in more detail the subcomponents like Algorithm and Hyperparameter Space Selection (AHPS), Configurator Generator (CG), and Configuration Evaluator (CE)? How do they work together?

3. The paper uses the Out-of-sample Causal Tuning (OCT) algorithm in the CL module to evaluate causal discovery configurations. Can you explain how OCT works? What is the intuition behind using predictive performance of Markov boundaries to select the best causal configuration?  

4. What are the key benefits of the proposed AutoCD framework compared to existing automated causal inference systems like PyWhy, OpportunityFinder, and CausalMGM? What functionalities are missing from those systems that AutoCD provides?

5. In the telecommunication case study, the paper tried several causal discovery algorithms but found issues with scaling up or imposing stationarity constraints. What were those specific algorithms and what were the issues faced? How did the final algorithm selection overcome those limitations?

6. In the experimental evaluation section, simulated datasets are generated based on resimulation from real 5G data rather than random synthetic data generation. Can you explain what resimulation is, why it was used, and how it helps create more realistic simulations?

7. Analyze the precision and recall results of the Markov boundary identification in AFS, adjacency identification in CL, and edge consistency estimation in CRV modules. What trends do you observe as sample size increases in the experiments? Why?

8. The causal discovery recall seems consistently low in the experiments. What are some potential reasons contributing to the low recall? How can it be improved in future work?

9. The paper identifies several limitations and future work like using more packages in each module, adding functionalities like optimization procedures, and constructing a web interface. Can you expand on some other limitations of the current AutoCD framework and useful extensions for the future? 

10. Do you think the proposed AutoCD framework advances the state-of-the-art in terms of enabling automated causal discovery? Why or why not? What are the key strengths and weaknesses?
