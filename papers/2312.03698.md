# [Intrinsic Harmonization for Illumination-Aware Compositing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03698)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach for realistic image compositing by formulating the problem in the intrinsic image domain. The key insight is to separate color harmonization from illumination harmonization. For color, they perform parameterized editing of the foreground albedo to match the background colors. For illumination, they estimate lighting of the background scene and use it to render initial Lambertian shading of the foreground object. This Lambertian shading is then refined by a neural network trained via self-supervision on segmentation masks to output realistic shading that matches the background lighting. By explicitly modeling shading separate from albedo, they are able to realistically relight the foreground object to match the illumination of the background scene. Both qualitative results and a user study demonstrate their methodâ€™s ability to generate more realistic composites than prior color harmonization methods, especially for challenging cases with very different foreground and background lighting. Their self-supervised training strategy also allows the reshading network to generalize well to diverse real-world scenes.
