# [Towards Meta-Pruning via Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07839)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Structural pruning of neural networks typically removes less important neurons, resulting in significant accuracy drops that necessitate fine-tuning efforts. 
- Existing methods focus mainly on designing neuron importance metrics rather than reconsidering the overlying pruning procedure.

Proposed Solution - Intra-Fusion:  
- Challenges prevailing pruning paradigm by utilizing concepts of model fusion and Optimal Transport to leverage given neuron importance metrics to arrive at more effective sparse model representations.  
- Aims to increase accuracy without need for fine-tuning, make pruning process more data and resource efficient.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes novel meta-pruning approach called Intra-Fusion that fuses pruned networks with themselves to reduce accuracy drops.
- Shows Intra-Fusion can increase accuracy substantially without any data or fine-tuning, across networks, datasets and importance metrics. 
- Explores how fusion can speed up training by factorizing into Prune-and-Fuse (PaF) and Fuse-and-Prune (FaP) approaches that leverage split datasets.
- Benchmarks on various CNNs and datasets.
- Challenges conventional pruning paradigm by redefining procedure rather than competing on metrics.
- Makes pruning process more efficient and aligned with privacy-preserving, green AI goals.

In summary, the paper introduces Intra-Fusion as an alternative meta-pruning technique that leverages fusion to increase accuracy and efficiency. Key goals are reducing reliance on fine-tuning data and reconsidering the overlying pruning procedure.
