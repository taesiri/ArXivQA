# [How to Determine the Most Powerful Pre-trained Language Model without   Brute Force Fine-tuning? An Empirical Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04775)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey and empirical analysis of transferability estimation (TE) methods for pre-trained language model (PLM) selection. The authors categorize TE methods into model similarity-based approaches that require a target model trained on the downstream task, and training-free approaches that directly examine the compatibility between PLM features and task labels. Through experiments on the GLUE benchmark with 6 candidate PLMs, the authors demonstrate that training-free methods generally achieve higher effectiveness and efficiency compared to similarity-based methods. Specifically, methods simulating fine-tuning dynamics like LogME perform the best in terms of ranking correlation. The analysis also reveals superior performance on sentence-pair tasks over single-sentence tasks, and stable effectiveness of certain methods like regularized H-Score with fewer samples. Based on both qualitative and quantitative analyses, the authors outline promising future directions regarding adaptation to various fine-tuning strategies and text generation tasks, as well as consistency to specific evaluation metrics. They conclude that H-Score exhibits desired usability in general for PLM selection.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper categorizes transferability estimation methods into model similarity-based methods and training-free methods. What are the key differences between these two categories of methods and what are the relative strengths and weaknesses of each?

2. The paper emphasizes the importance of considering fine-tuning dynamics when estimating transferability. However, most of the current methods only simulate simple linear feature transformations during fine-tuning. What are some ways the methods could be extended to better model the complex dynamics that occur during fine-tuning? 

3. Sample affinity functions play a key role in enabling model similarity computations. The paper examines Euclidean, cosine, and correlation distances. What other potential affinity functions could be worthwhile to explore and what challenges might they present?

4. What are some reasons that model similarity-based methods seemed to perform worse overall compared to training-free methods based on the GLUE benchmark results? How could their effectiveness be improved?

5. The performance of several methods varied significantly across the different GLUE task types (sentence classification vs sentence pairs). Why might this be the case and how could methods be made more robust to the task type?  

6. When using a subset of the data, the paper showed the performance of most methods decreased, especially in terms of ranking the best model (MRR). What modifications could make the training-free methods more robust to fewer data samples?

7. How suitable are the current methods for selecting the best model when the downstream task is text generation instead of classification? What major changes would need to be made?

8. The paper argues that methods should ideally correlate with specific evaluation metrics users care about for a task. What techniques could allow specifying a target metric to optimize consistency with during transferability estimation?

9. What types of theoretical guarantees or bounds can be provided for how well some of the training-free methods will rank model performance compared to the brute force approach?

10. The variance of the transferability estimation score across random seeds differed between methods in the experiments. What properties would an ideal estimation method have in terms of stability across runs?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the growing number of available pre-trained language models (PLMs), selecting the best performing one for a given downstream task is critical but computationally expensive if done through brute force fine-tuning. Thus, there is a need for efficient transferability estimation (TE) methods that can predict model performance at low computational cost.

Solution: 
The paper provides a comprehensive survey and empirical analysis of TE techniques for PLM selection. It categorizes methods into:

1) Model similarity-based: Assume similarity between candidate and target (fine-tuned) models correlates with transferability. Compute inter-model similarities using sample features. 
2) Training-free: Directly examine compatibility of PLM features and target data/labels through metrics like class separability and loss approximation. Avoid target model training.

The paper evaluates qualitative properties like task agnosticism and dynamic consideration of fine-tuning. It also conducts extensive experiments on GLUE benchmark to analyze effectiveness, efficiency, robustness to less data, feature dimensions, etc.

Main Contributions:

- First comprehensive survey and taxonomy of TE techniques for PLM selection
- Detailed qualitative analysis of properties like applicability to tasks, dynamic handling, training requirement
- Extensive empirical study analyzing effectiveness, efficiency, sensitivity to factors like task type, sample size, feature dimension  
- Identification of superior overall performance by H-Score method
- Outlining future directions like awareness of tuning strategies, applicability to text generation, metric specificity

The paper helps researchers and practitioners select appropriate TE methods for identifying best performing PLMs for their tasks, while avoiding expensive brute force fine-tuning.
