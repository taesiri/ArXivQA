# [How to Determine the Most Powerful Pre-trained Language Model without   Brute Force Fine-tuning? An Empirical Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04775)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey and empirical analysis of transferability estimation (TE) methods for pre-trained language model (PLM) selection. The authors categorize TE methods into model similarity-based approaches that require a target model trained on the downstream task, and training-free approaches that directly examine the compatibility between PLM features and task labels. Through experiments on the GLUE benchmark with 6 candidate PLMs, the authors demonstrate that training-free methods generally achieve higher effectiveness and efficiency compared to similarity-based methods. Specifically, methods simulating fine-tuning dynamics like LogME perform the best in terms of ranking correlation. The analysis also reveals superior performance on sentence-pair tasks over single-sentence tasks, and stable effectiveness of certain methods like regularized H-Score with fewer samples. Based on both qualitative and quantitative analyses, the authors outline promising future directions regarding adaptation to various fine-tuning strategies and text generation tasks, as well as consistency to specific evaluation metrics. They conclude that H-Score exhibits desired usability in general for PLM selection.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive survey and empirical analysis of transferability estimation (TE) methods for pre-trained language model (PLM) selection. The main contributions are:

1) It presents a taxonomy of existing TE methods, categorizing them into model similarity-based methods and training-free methods. It provides a qualitative analysis comparing their applicability and properties.

2) It conducts an extensive empirical study evaluating and comparing 14 different TE methods on the GLUE benchmark. Both effectiveness (correlation with true performance) and efficiency (time consumption) of the methods are analyzed. 

3) It provides detailed analyses investigating the sensitivity and robustness of the methods to factors like task type, sample size, feature dimensions, etc. It shows that H-Score generally performs well across different criteria.

4) It outlines several limitations and future research directions for TE methods, including considering training details, adapting to text generation tasks, and consistency with evaluation metrics.

In summary, this paper offers the first comprehensive survey focused specifically on TE for PLM selection, along with thorough empirical analysis and insights. It provides both a reference for researchers to advance the field and guidance for practitioners to select appropriate TE methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper categorizes transferability estimation methods into model similarity-based methods and training-free methods. What are the key differences between these two categories of methods and what are the relative strengths and weaknesses of each?

2. The paper emphasizes the importance of considering fine-tuning dynamics when estimating transferability. However, most of the current methods only simulate simple linear feature transformations during fine-tuning. What are some ways the methods could be extended to better model the complex dynamics that occur during fine-tuning? 

3. Sample affinity functions play a key role in enabling model similarity computations. The paper examines Euclidean, cosine, and correlation distances. What other potential affinity functions could be worthwhile to explore and what challenges might they present?

4. What are some reasons that model similarity-based methods seemed to perform worse overall compared to training-free methods based on the GLUE benchmark results? How could their effectiveness be improved?

5. The performance of several methods varied significantly across the different GLUE task types (sentence classification vs sentence pairs). Why might this be the case and how could methods be made more robust to the task type?  

6. When using a subset of the data, the paper showed the performance of most methods decreased, especially in terms of ranking the best model (MRR). What modifications could make the training-free methods more robust to fewer data samples?

7. How suitable are the current methods for selecting the best model when the downstream task is text generation instead of classification? What major changes would need to be made?

8. The paper argues that methods should ideally correlate with specific evaluation metrics users care about for a task. What techniques could allow specifying a target metric to optimize consistency with during transferability estimation?

9. What types of theoretical guarantees or bounds can be provided for how well some of the training-free methods will rank model performance compared to the brute force approach?

10. The variance of the transferability estimation score across random seeds differed between methods in the experiments. What properties would an ideal estimation method have in terms of stability across runs?
