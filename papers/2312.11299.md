# [Uncertainty-based Fairness Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11299)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing fairness measures for machine learning models rely only on the models' point predictions and ignore the prediction uncertainties. This makes them susceptible to issues like noise or shifts in data distributions. Also, meeting parity in point predictions does not guarantee fairness in terms of prediction uncertainties across groups.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose new notions of fairness based on uncertainties in predictions, specifically epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty and predictive uncertainty. They formally define uncertainty-based fairness at both group level and individual level. They also theoretically prove that the proposed uncertainty-based fairness measures are independent of existing point prediction-based measures.

Experiments and Results:
The authors experiment with synthetic and real-world datasets like COMPAS, Adult and D-Vlog. They highlight cases where models can appear fair per point predictions but show significant biases in terms of uncertainties. Key observations are:
- Epistemic uncertainty gaps can indicate lack of data for certain groups
- Aleatoric uncertainty gaps can reveal harder predictions for some groups
- Uncertainty fairness provides complementary insights to point-based fairness
- Uncertainty fairness is less susceptible to data shifts or manipulations

Main Contributions:
- Formal proposal of uncertainty-based fairness metrics at group and individual level
- Theoretical proof that uncertainty fairness is independent of point-prediction fairness  
- Empirical evidence over multiple datasets that uncertainty fairness provides complementary insights about model biases
- Demonstrating usefulness of different uncertainty types in revealing different data or model limitations

The paper makes a strong case for using uncertainty alongside point predictions to evaluate model fairness in a more reliable way.
