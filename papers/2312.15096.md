## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the sliding cubes model, which is a theoretical framework for analyzing reconfiguration algorithms for modular robots made up of face-connected cubes. A key question is whether there exists a sequence of moves that can transform any two given cube configurations into each other, and if so, how many moves are needed. Prior work by Abel and Kominers presented an algorithm needing O(n^3) moves for n-cube configurations, by first transforming them into an intermediate canonical shape. This paper investigates whether there exists an input-sensitive algorithm where the number of moves depends on properties of the input configuration rather than just its size.

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents an in-place algorithm that reconfigures any n-cube configuration into a compact canonical shape using a number of moves proportional to the sum of the cube coordinates in the input configuration. This bound is asymptotically optimal. The algorithm works by prioritizing moves that reduce the overall z-coordinate of cubes first, using slides, convex transitions and pillar shoves. If no further z-reduction is possible, x and y coordinates are reduced instead by moving pillars of cubes in the x/y plane. A potential function based on cube coordinates is used to analyze the number of moves and show the algorithm's optimality.

Main Contributions:
- First input-sensitive reconfiguration algorithm for the 3D sliding cubes model, with number of moves matching the lower bound of the sum of input cube coordinates.
- New pillar shove operation and algorithm for compacting 3D configurations by iteratively reducing coordinates.
- Optimal Universal reconfiguration algorithm for the sliding cubes model in 3D.
- Extends directly to give an optimal algorithm for reconfiguring hypercubes in higher dimensions.
- Does not require helper cubes or amortized analysis.

The paper makes a significant contribution by presenting the first provably optimal, input-sensitive algorithm for the fundamental reconfiguration problem in the 3D sliding cubes model. The new techniques develop could have broader applications in modular robotics.
