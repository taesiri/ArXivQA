# [Exploring Highly Quantised Neural Networks for Intrusion Detection in   Automotive CAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11030)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vehicles today have increased connectivity for novel capabilities like autonomous driving. However, this makes in-vehicle networks like CAN vulnerable to cyberattacks like denial of service (DoS), fuzzing, and spoofing.
- Machine learning models can detect such attacks, but multiple models are often required to detect multiple attacks, increasing cost and energy. FPGA-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) using quantized neural networks (QNNs) can help but still use multiple models.

Proposed Solution: 
- A custom quantized multi-layer perceptron (CQMLP) model for multi-attack detection on automotive CAN networks.
- Quantize model to 2-bit precision through design space exploration considering accuracy and hardware cost.
- Hardware accelerator for model using FINN framework that is tightly integrated to ARM cores on Zynq Ultrascale+ FPGA, mimicking an electronic control unit (ECU).  

Main Contributions:
- CQMLP model detects DoS, fuzzing and spoofing attacks with 99.9% accuracy using a single model, matching state-of-the-art specialized models.
- Tight ECU integration reduces per-message latency by 2.2x and energy consumption by 3.9x compared to other IDS solutions.
- High accuracy and efficiency makes distributed integration of IDS with ECUs ideal for securing CAN networks against multiple cyberattack vectors using a shared hardware model.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient QNN-based IDS accelerator integrated within an automotive ECU to enable high-accuracy multi-attack detection on CAN networks with low latency and energy overhead.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a custom quantized MLP-based intrusion detection system integrated into an automotive electronic control unit on an FPGA, achieving high accuracy in detecting denial-of-service, fuzzing, and spoofing attacks on controller area networks while improving latency and energy efficiency compared to prior art.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A custom quantised feed-forward neural network (CQMLP) based intrusion detection system (IDS) for automotive CAN that can classify multiple attack vectors (including DoS, fuzzing, and RPM spoofing attacks) simultaneously using a single model. 

2) A tightly integrated architecture where the CQMLP IDS hardware accelerator is implemented on the programmable logic (PL) side of a Zynq Ultrascale+ FPGA, while the processor system (PS) runs the ECU software tasks. This provides isolation between the IDS and ECU functions while enabling consolidation.

3) Quantified performance and energy benefits of the integrated CQMLP IDS accelerator:
- 2.2x faster per-message processing latency compared to state-of-the-art IDS designs
- 3.9x lower energy consumption per inference (0.23 mJ)
- Near line-rate threat detection capability for high-speed CAN

In summary, the main contribution is a custom quantised neural network based IDS accelerator that can detect multiple attack vectors with high accuracy while achieving significantly improved latency and energy efficiency through a tightly integrated ECU implementation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a concatenation of n=4 successive messages as the input feature. What is the rationale behind choosing n=4 specifically? Were other values of n explored? If so, what tradeoffs did they present?

2. The paper uses a conservative block-based labeling approach where if even one message in a block of 4 is an attack, the entire block is treated as an attack. What is the motivation behind this? How does it impact model performance compared to other labeling approaches? 

3. The paper explores 2-bit, 3-bit and 4-bit quantized models. What specific accuracy vs resource utilization tradeoffs drove the final choice of the 2-bit model? Were any other quantization levels considered?

4. The paper compares the proposed model against several other ML-based IDS techniques. What are the key advantages of the proposed model over these other techniques, especially in the context of in-vehicle deployment?

5. The paper uses the FINN compiler to generate the hardware implementation. What specific optimizations does FINN perform to transform the ML model into an efficient dataflow implementation? 

6. The tightly coupled architecture shows significant improvements in latency and energy consumption over other implementations. What are the specific advantages enabling these gains?

7. The paper reports 1.2ms latency for the FP32 model on the Jetson Nano. What are the factors contributing to this latency and how is the dataflow hardware implementation optimized to reduce it?

8. With under 2% resources utilized on the XCZU7EV device, there is scope to integrate multiple accelerators. What other automotive applications could potentially leverage this architecture?

9. The paper uses a single model to classify multiple attack vectors. What modifications would be required to detect new, unseen attack types without retraining from scratch?

10. The proposed architecture shows the IDS integrated on an individual ECU. What would a distributed, network-wide IDS deployment leveraging this look like across multiple ECUs?
