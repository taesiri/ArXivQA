## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Skeleton-based video anomaly detection (SVAD) aims to identify abnormal human motions from skeleton data. However, SVAD poses three key challenges: (1) skeleton data exhibits complex spatio-temporal dependencies between joints that need to be modeled, (2) subtle anomalies are often localized to specific body regions rather than the whole body, and (3) both normal and abnormal motions have infinite intra-class variations that need to be captured. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address all three challenges in a unified manner.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel framework called Graph-Jigsaw Conditioned Diffusion Model for Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection (GiCiSAD). It consists of three key modules designed to tackle the three aforementioned challenges:

1. Graph Attention-based Forecasting Module: Uses a learnable graph topology to capture spatio-temporal dependencies between joints within and across frames through a graph attention mechanism.

2. Graph-level Jigsaw Puzzle Maker Module: A novel self-supervised approach that treats graph-based body part shuffling as a pretext task to make the model sensitive to region-specific anomalies.  

3. Graph-based Conditional Diffusion Module: Generates diverse future pose samples conditioned on past poses to account for infinite variations of motions.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to simultaneously address all three key challenges in SVAD.
- Novel graph attention mechanism to capture spatio-temporal dependencies.  
- First application of self-supervised learning for region-focused understanding in SVAD.
- Conditional diffusion model that generates diverse pose forecasting.
- State-of-the-art anomaly detection performance on four datasets with 40% fewer parameters than existing methods.

In summary, GiCiSAD provides a comprehensive solution for tackling key obstacles in SVAD via synergistic modeling of dependencies, regions, and variations within a unified architecture.
