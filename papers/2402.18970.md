# [PrivatEyes: Appearance-based Gaze Estimation Using Federated Secure   Multi-Party Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18970)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Appearance-based gaze estimation methods require large-scale eye image datasets for training, but collecting and sharing such sensitive data poses privacy risks.
- Prior work used federated learning (FL) for privacy-preserving gaze estimation training, but FL leaks private information through the shared model updates.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "PrivatEyes", a novel privacy-enhancing training approach that combines FL and secure multi-party computation (MPC).

- In PrivatEyes, clients train models locally on their data and secret-share the model updates among multiple servers. The servers then securely aggregate the updates using MPC.

- MPC guarantees that servers do not learn the individual model updates or private data, even if all-but-one server is malicious.

Main Contributions:

- First approach to combine FL and MPC for privacy-preserving gaze estimation training with strong security guarantees.

- New "DualView" attack that reconstructs user appearance and gaze distribution to evaluate privacy leakage.

- Evaluations on MPIIGaze, MPIIFaceGaze, etc. show PrivatEyes matches performance of non-secure methods with negligible overhead.

- Experiments demonstrate significantly better privacy for PrivatEyes over centralized FL, e.g. DualView accurately reconstructs 15/15 people for FL but 0/15 people for PrivatEyes.

In summary, PrivatEyes enables collaborative training of accurate gaze estimators with formal privacy guarantees and shown resilience against data leakage attacks.
