# [RFBES at SemEval-2024 Task 8: Investigating Syntactic and Semantic   Features for Distinguishing AI-Generated and Human-Written Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14838)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Distinguishing between AI-generated text and human-written text is becoming increasingly important as language models are now adept at mimicking human writing. 

- This is a challenging task, especially for longer texts, as language models can produce coherent long-form content.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a semantic approach that splits input texts into smaller segments for analysis, as well as a syntactic approach using POS tag patterns.

- The semantic approach uses a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model to calculate the probability of each segment being AI-generated or human-written. It combines the per-segment predictions using soft voting, hard voting or weighted soft voting.

- The syntactic approach uses bidirectional LSTM models with attention to analyze Universal POS tag sequences, aiming to identify distinctive patterns.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrated that splitting texts into smaller segments for semantic analysis is more effective than analyzing entire documents directly.

- Showed weighted soft voting delivers the best performance for combining per-segment predictions.  

- Found no significant differences in POS tag distributions between AI and human text, indicating grammar alone may be insufficient.

- Delivered strong results, outperforming the baseline by 3.9% on the multilingual task, emphasizing the value of the segment-level semantic approach.

- Suggested graph neural networks analyzing grammatical connections as a direction for future work.
