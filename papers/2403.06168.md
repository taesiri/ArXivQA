# [DiffuMatting: Synthesizing Arbitrary Objects with Matting-level   Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06168)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Obtaining highly accurate matting-level annotations is difficult, laborious and expensive. There is limited public training data available with matting-level transparency masks.  
- Existing diffusion models struggle to steadily generate arbitrary objects on a green screen canvas.
- Downstream tasks like matting, segmentation, composition need more data with matting-level transparency.

Proposed Solution:
- DiffuMatting - a diffusion model to generate images of arbitrary objects on a green screen background paired with their high-accuracy matting-level transparency masks. 

Key Ideas:
- Collect a large-scale Green100K dataset with green screen background images and matting masks.
- Use green-background control loss to ensure clean separation of foreground objects and green background. Leverages cross-attention features for 'green' token.
- Introduce detailed-enhancement loss of transition boundaries to improve detail generation on object edges. 
- Build a matting head and GreenPost processing to produce matting-level masks from decoder latent space.

Main Contributions:  
- DiffuMatting can generate high-quality green screen images of arbitrary objects paired with matting-level transparency masks.
- Serves as an efficient 'anything matting' data factory to facilitate downstream tasks needing transparent objects.  
- Reduces error in general matting (15.4% MSE) and portrait matting (11.4% MSE) by generating synthetic training data.
- Compatible with community LoRAs for controllable transparent image generation.
- Enables convenient image/video composition by generating, copying and pasting objects with matting masks.

In summary, DiffuMatting combines the generative power of diffusion models with the functionality of producing matting-level transparency masks for arbitrary objects in a highly efficient manner. It addresses the scarcity of transparent object data availability and has diverse applications.
