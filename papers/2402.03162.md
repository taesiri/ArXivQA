## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Direct-a-Video: Customized Video Generation with User-Directed Camera Movement and Object Motion":

Problem:
Recent text-to-video diffusion models have achieved impressive progress in video generation. However, current methods lack support for user-defined and disentangled control over camera movement and object motion. This limits the flexibility in video motion control. Controlling camera movement and object motion is challenging because (1) in real videos these are often coupled, making it hard to disentangle, (2) obtaining large-scale annotated video datasets is laborious and costly.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Direct-a-Video, a framework that enables users to independently specify camera movement and motion of one or more objects in video generation. Two orthogonal controlling mechanisms are used:

1) For camera movement control, new temporal cross-attention layers (camera module) are introduced to interpret camera parameters like panning and zooming. To avoid motion annotation, a self-supervised training strategy based on camera augmentation is used. 

2) For object motion control, spatial cross-attention map modulation is adopted in a training-free manner to guide object placement. User defines motion trajectories by specifying bounding boxes.

These two components operate independently, allowing individual or joint control over camera and object motions.

Main Contributions:

1) A unified framework for controllable video generation that disentangles camera movement and object motion, enabling both individual and joint control.

2) A lightweight camera module trained via self-supervision to enable quantitative control over camera panning and zooming without motion annotations.

3) A training-free spatial cross-attention modulation approach for user-directed object motion control by simply specifying bounding box trajectories.

In summary, Direct-a-Video allows flexible and customized control over both camera and object motions in video generation through its disentangled and easy-to-use control mechanisms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a text-to-video framework called Direct-a-Video that enables independent user control over camera movement and object motion by introducing a self-supervised temporal cross-attention module for interpreting camera parameters and a training-free spatial cross-attention modulation for guiding object trajectories.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a unified framework, Direct-a-Video, for controllable video generation that decouples camera movement and object motion, allowing users to independently or jointly control both aspects. Specifically:

1) For camera movement control, the paper introduces a novel temporal cross-attention module dedicated to camera movement conditioning. This module is trained through a self-supervised, lightweight approach to enable quantitative control over the camera's panning and zooming. 

2) For object motion control, the paper utilizes spatial cross-attention modulation in a training-free manner to redirect the spatial-temporal size and location of objects based on user-specified bounding boxes. 

3) By controlling camera movement and object motion independently, the framework effectively decouples the two, providing flexibility for users to manipulate these aspects either individually or simultaneously in video creation.

4) Extensive experiments demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in separate and joint control of camera movement and object motion for customized video generation.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an efficient and flexible text-to-video generation framework that features disentangled and user-directed control over both camera movement and object motion.
