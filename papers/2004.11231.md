# [Federated Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11231)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a new method called federated stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (FSGLD) for Bayesian posterior inference on distributed non-IID data. The key ideas and contributions are:- Standard distributed stochastic gradient MCMC methods like distributed SGLD (DSGLD) suffer from high variance and bias when applied to federated non-IID data. This paper analyzes these issues both theoretically and empirically. - To address these problems, the authors propose "conducive gradients", which are auxiliary gradients computed from tractable approximations of the local likelihood on each client. These help reduce the variance and bias of the stochastic gradients.- The proposed FSGLD method incorporates conducive gradients into the gradient estimator of DSGLD. Theoretical analysis shows FSGLD converges to the true posterior even with non-IID data and infrequent communication.- Experiments on metric learning and Bayesian neural networks demonstrate FSGLD outperforms DSGLD on federated non-IID data, while achieving similar performance on IID data. FSGLD also converges faster and shows lower variance.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that conducive gradients can reduce the problems of high variance and bias in distributed stochastic MCMC methods like DSGLD when applied to federated non-IID data. The FSGLD method is proposed to leverage conducive gradients for more accurate and efficient Bayesian posterior inference in this setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel MCMC sampling method called federated stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (FSGLD) that is tailored for Bayesian posterior sampling in federated learning settings with non-IID data. The key ideas are:- They propose using "conducive gradients", which are computed from local approximations of each client's likelihood, to augment the gradient estimates in distributed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (DSGLD). This helps reduce the variance of the stochastic gradients and correct for bias caused by heterogeneity in the non-IID data. - They show formally that adding the conducive gradients results in a valid gradient estimator with finite variance.- They provide a convergence analysis for both DSGLD and their proposed FSGLD method, relating the convergence bounds to the heterogeneity in the data shards.- Their experiments demonstrate that FSGLD outperforms DSGLD in non-IID federated settings, both in terms of convergence speed and accuracy of the sampling. FSGLD is able to handle delayed communication without diverging from the true posterior like DSGLD.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a practical and scalable MCMC method that can handle non-IID data distributions in federated learning, through the use of conducive gradients computed from local likelihood approximations. Theoretical analysis and experiments back up the effectiveness of their approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of this paper:The paper proposes an approach called federated stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (FSGLD) to improve the convergence of distributed stochastic gradient-based MCMC methods for federated non-IID data by incorporating per-client approximations of the likelihood to reduce the variance of the gradient estimates.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper focuses on extending stochastic gradient MCMC methods like SGLD to handle federated learning settings with non-IID data. Other papers have looked at distributed or parallel versions of SGLD, but not specifically for the federated setting. So this provides a novel approach tailored to the challenges of federated learning.- Most prior work on reducing variance for SGLD has focused on serial/centralized settings. This paper introduces a method called "conducive gradients" to reduce variance in the distributed case. So it provides a new variance reduction approach in the context of distributed stochastic gradient MCMC. - The analysis in this paper seems quite thorough in terms of providing convergence guarantees for both the proposed FSGLD algorithm and the baseline DSGLD method. The bounds connect convergence rates to properties of the data distributions, which provides useful insights.- The experiments demonstrate strengths of the proposed approach on problems like metric learning and Bayesian neural nets. Comparisons to DSGLD show the benefits in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, and communication efficiency.- The idea of using local approximations (the q_s terms) to reduce variance is novel and seems generally applicable. But there is room for further exploration of how to construct or update these approximations efficiently.Overall, this paper makes important contributions in adapting stochastic gradient MCMC to federated settings. The proposed FSGLD method and analysis help address key challenges around non-IID data and communication constraints. More broadly, it expands the application domains for scalable Bayesian inference. The use of "conducive gradients" provides a new approach to variance reduction in distributed SGMCMC that could spur further research.
