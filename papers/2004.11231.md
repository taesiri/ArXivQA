# [Federated Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11231)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method called federated stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (FSGLD) for Bayesian posterior inference on distributed non-IID data. The key ideas and contributions are:

- Standard distributed stochastic gradient MCMC methods like distributed SGLD (DSGLD) suffer from high variance and bias when applied to federated non-IID data. This paper analyzes these issues both theoretically and empirically. 

- To address these problems, the authors propose "conducive gradients", which are auxiliary gradients computed from tractable approximations of the local likelihood on each client. These help reduce the variance and bias of the stochastic gradients.

- The proposed FSGLD method incorporates conducive gradients into the gradient estimator of DSGLD. Theoretical analysis shows FSGLD converges to the true posterior even with non-IID data and infrequent communication.

- Experiments on metric learning and Bayesian neural networks demonstrate FSGLD outperforms DSGLD on federated non-IID data, while achieving similar performance on IID data. FSGLD also converges faster and shows lower variance.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that conducive gradients can reduce the problems of high variance and bias in distributed stochastic MCMC methods like DSGLD when applied to federated non-IID data. The FSGLD method is proposed to leverage conducive gradients for more accurate and efficient Bayesian posterior inference in this setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel MCMC sampling method called federated stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (FSGLD) that is tailored for Bayesian posterior sampling in federated learning settings with non-IID data. The key ideas are:

- They propose using "conducive gradients", which are computed from local approximations of each client's likelihood, to augment the gradient estimates in distributed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (DSGLD). This helps reduce the variance of the stochastic gradients and correct for bias caused by heterogeneity in the non-IID data. 

- They show formally that adding the conducive gradients results in a valid gradient estimator with finite variance.

- They provide a convergence analysis for both DSGLD and their proposed FSGLD method, relating the convergence bounds to the heterogeneity in the data shards.

- Their experiments demonstrate that FSGLD outperforms DSGLD in non-IID federated settings, both in terms of convergence speed and accuracy of the sampling. FSGLD is able to handle delayed communication without diverging from the true posterior like DSGLD.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a practical and scalable MCMC method that can handle non-IID data distributions in federated learning, through the use of conducive gradients computed from local likelihood approximations. Theoretical analysis and experiments back up the effectiveness of their approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of this paper:

The paper proposes an approach called federated stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (FSGLD) to improve the convergence of distributed stochastic gradient-based MCMC methods for federated non-IID data by incorporating per-client approximations of the likelihood to reduce the variance of the gradient estimates.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on extending stochastic gradient MCMC methods like SGLD to handle federated learning settings with non-IID data. Other papers have looked at distributed or parallel versions of SGLD, but not specifically for the federated setting. So this provides a novel approach tailored to the challenges of federated learning.

- Most prior work on reducing variance for SGLD has focused on serial/centralized settings. This paper introduces a method called "conducive gradients" to reduce variance in the distributed case. So it provides a new variance reduction approach in the context of distributed stochastic gradient MCMC. 

- The analysis in this paper seems quite thorough in terms of providing convergence guarantees for both the proposed FSGLD algorithm and the baseline DSGLD method. The bounds connect convergence rates to properties of the data distributions, which provides useful insights.

- The experiments demonstrate strengths of the proposed approach on problems like metric learning and Bayesian neural nets. Comparisons to DSGLD show the benefits in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, and communication efficiency.

- The idea of using local approximations (the q_s terms) to reduce variance is novel and seems generally applicable. But there is room for further exploration of how to construct or update these approximations efficiently.

Overall, this paper makes important contributions in adapting stochastic gradient MCMC to federated settings. The proposed FSGLD method and analysis help address key challenges around non-IID data and communication constraints. More broadly, it expands the application domains for scalable Bayesian inference. The use of "conducive gradients" provides a new approach to variance reduction in distributed SGMCMC that could spur further research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more expressive or computationally cheaper surrogates $q_1, \ldots, q_S$ to approximate each client's likelihood contribution. The authors suggest options like non-parametric methods or variational approximations could be explored here.

- Updating the conducive gradients dynamically as the Markov chains explore the posterior landscape rather than computing them only once upfront. This could help maintain more accurate approximations, especially for complex models.

- Analyzing the theoretical properties of the proposed Federated Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (FSGLD) method in more depth, such as proving convergence rates or characterizing the bias-variance tradeoff. 

- Evaluating the performance of FSGLD on a broader range of models and data sets, especially real-world federated datasets. The authors tested mainly on simulated federated data.

- Comparing FSGLD to other distributed inference algorithms like distributed stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The current comparisons are mainly against distributed SGLD.

- Exploring second-order information to potentially improve performance. The current method uses only first-order gradient information.

- Extending the ideas to allow for fully decentralized computation with no central coordinating server.

- Developing adaptive or automated schemes for setting the exploration parameter Î± in the conducive gradients.

- Combining conducive gradients with other variance reduction strategies for distributed stochastic gradients.

Overall, the main suggested directions are around developing more advanced approximations, theoretical analysis, broader empirical evaluation, and extensions of the core FSGLD algorithm.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called federated stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (FSGLD) for performing Bayesian inference on distributed non-IID data. The key idea is to augment local stochastic gradient estimates with an auxiliary "conducive gradient" term that incorporates approximations of other clients' likelihood functions. This helps reduce the variance of the gradient estimates and enables the method to converge properly even with infrequent communication between clients, which is important for federated learning. The authors analyze the convergence properties of both FSGLD and distributed SGLD, providing insight into how data heterogeneity affects performance. Experiments on metric learning and neural networks demonstrate that FSGLD outperforms distributed SGLD on non-IID data. A notable advantage is that FSGLD converges smoothly even when allowing many local steps between communication rounds, unlike distributed SGLD which can diverge. Overall, FSGLD provides an effective way to perform stochastic gradient MCMC in federated learning settings with non-IID data and infrequent communication.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel method called federated stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (FSGLD) for performing Bayesian posterior inference on federated non-IID data. 

The key idea is to augment the distributed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (DSGLD) estimator with an additional term called the "conducive gradient", which is constructed using tractable approximations of the likelihood factors on each client. These approximations are computed locally on each client and communicated only once to the server. 

The conducive gradient term helps reduce the variance of the stochastic gradients and enables the chains to better explore the target posterior distribution even with delayed/infrequent communication between clients and server. Experiments on metric learning and neural network models demonstrate that FSGLD outperforms DSGLD in the federated non-IID setting and converges to the true posterior distribution in cases where DSGLD fails. A notable advantage is that with proper choice of likelihood approximations, FSGLD incurs negligible computational overhead compared to DSGLD.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper proposes a new method called federated stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (FSGLD) for performing Bayesian posterior inference on distributed non-IID data. The key problems it aims to address are:

1. Stochastic gradient MCMC methods like stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) suffer from high variance when applied to distributed non-IID data. The paper shows both theoretically and empirically that the variance of gradient estimates increases significantly in this setting.

2. Existing distributed SGLD methods require frequent communication between devices/clients which introduces bias and causes the Markov chains to diverge from the true posterior even for simple models. 

3. No previous work has developed and analyzed stochastic gradient MCMC techniques specifically for the federated learning setting where data is distributed over clients and is non-IID.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a novel method called FSGLD which adds an additional "conducive gradient" term to the gradient estimator. This conducive gradient combines local likelihood approximations from each client to help correct and improve the gradient updates. 

Theoretically, the paper provides convergence analysis for both DSGLD and FSGLD, showing formally how heterogeneity affects DSGLD and how the conducive gradients in FSGLD help mitigate this.

Empirically, experiments demonstrate that FSGLD converges to the true posterior in cases where DSGLD fails, and outperforms DSGLD in the federated non-IID setting for models like metric learning and Bayesian neural networks.

In summary, this paper develops a new stochastic MCMC approach tailored to the challenging setting of federated non-IID data and formally analyzes and demonstrates its advantages.
