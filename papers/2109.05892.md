# [WeakSTIL: Weak whole-slide image level stromal tumor infiltrating   lymphocyte scores are all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05892)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the central hypothesis of this paper is that a deep learning model trained with weak whole-slide image (WSI) level labels of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocyte percentage (sTIL%) can accurately predict sTIL% scores directly from H&E stained breast cancer WSIs. The key points are:- sTIL% is an important prognostic and predictive biomarker for breast cancer and other solid tumors. However, it is currently not used in routine clinical practice due to high annotation effort and variability. - Existing computational methods require detailed annotations of individual TILs or TIL-rich regions, which are costly to obtain. - The authors hypothesize that a deep learning model trained with only weak WSI-level labels of sTIL% can predict sTIL% scores directly from H&E WSIs that correlate well with pathologist-derived scores.- This is enabled by using self-supervised pretraining and multiple instance learning that allows learning from weak labels.- If shown to work, this approach could enable consistent and automated sTIL% scoring to guide treatment decisions, without requiring detailed TIL annotations.In summary, the central hypothesis is that weak WSI-level labels are sufficient to train a model to accurately predict sTIL% scores directly from H&E slides. This could enable routine use of this biomarker if proven successful.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:1. The authors propose WeakSTIL, a weak label deep learning pipeline using self-supervised learning (SSL) and a multiple instance learning (MIL) regressor called TILMIL for scoring the percentage of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL%) directly from H&E whole-slide images of breast cancer tissue. 2. They show that using an in-domain pretrained feature extractor with SSL is essential for this method to work well, while using an ImageNet-pretrained feature extractor leads to poor performance.3. They demonstrate that WeakSTIL performs at least as well as other more complex TIL detection methods in predicting the sTIL% score at the whole-slide image level, while requiring much less annotation effort. Specifically, WeakSTIL achieves a coefficient of determination of 0.45±0.15 compared to pathologist scores, and an AUC of 0.89±0.05 for the clinically relevant sTIL-high vs sTIL-low classification task.4. They show that the intermediate tile-level predictions of WeakSTIL are interpretable and appear to pay attention to features related to the number of TILs and tissue type.In summary, the main contribution is a weakly supervised deep learning pipeline called WeakSTIL that can predict the important sTIL% biomarker directly from H&E whole-slide images using only weak slide-level labels, with performance rivaling more complex approaches. The interpretability of WeakSTIL is also demonstrated.
