# [WeakSTIL: Weak whole-slide image level stromal tumor infiltrating   lymphocyte scores are all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05892)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the central hypothesis of this paper is that a deep learning model trained with weak whole-slide image (WSI) level labels of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocyte percentage (sTIL%) can accurately predict sTIL% scores directly from H&E stained breast cancer WSIs. The key points are:- sTIL% is an important prognostic and predictive biomarker for breast cancer and other solid tumors. However, it is currently not used in routine clinical practice due to high annotation effort and variability. - Existing computational methods require detailed annotations of individual TILs or TIL-rich regions, which are costly to obtain. - The authors hypothesize that a deep learning model trained with only weak WSI-level labels of sTIL% can predict sTIL% scores directly from H&E WSIs that correlate well with pathologist-derived scores.- This is enabled by using self-supervised pretraining and multiple instance learning that allows learning from weak labels.- If shown to work, this approach could enable consistent and automated sTIL% scoring to guide treatment decisions, without requiring detailed TIL annotations.In summary, the central hypothesis is that weak WSI-level labels are sufficient to train a model to accurately predict sTIL% scores directly from H&E slides. This could enable routine use of this biomarker if proven successful.
