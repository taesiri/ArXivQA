# [WeakSTIL: Weak whole-slide image level stromal tumor infiltrating   lymphocyte scores are all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05892)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central hypothesis of this paper is that a deep learning model trained with weak whole-slide image (WSI) level labels of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocyte percentage (sTIL%) can accurately predict sTIL% scores directly from H&E stained breast cancer WSIs. 

The key points are:

- sTIL% is an important prognostic and predictive biomarker for breast cancer and other solid tumors. However, it is currently not used in routine clinical practice due to high annotation effort and variability. 

- Existing computational methods require detailed annotations of individual TILs or TIL-rich regions, which are costly to obtain. 

- The authors hypothesize that a deep learning model trained with only weak WSI-level labels of sTIL% can predict sTIL% scores directly from H&E WSIs that correlate well with pathologist-derived scores.

- This is enabled by using self-supervised pretraining and multiple instance learning that allows learning from weak labels.

- If shown to work, this approach could enable consistent and automated sTIL% scoring to guide treatment decisions, without requiring detailed TIL annotations.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that weak WSI-level labels are sufficient to train a model to accurately predict sTIL% scores directly from H&E slides. This could enable routine use of this biomarker if proven successful.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1. The authors propose WeakSTIL, a weak label deep learning pipeline using self-supervised learning (SSL) and a multiple instance learning (MIL) regressor called TILMIL for scoring the percentage of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL%) directly from H&E whole-slide images of breast cancer tissue. 

2. They show that using an in-domain pretrained feature extractor with SSL is essential for this method to work well, while using an ImageNet-pretrained feature extractor leads to poor performance.

3. They demonstrate that WeakSTIL performs at least as well as other more complex TIL detection methods in predicting the sTIL% score at the whole-slide image level, while requiring much less annotation effort. Specifically, WeakSTIL achieves a coefficient of determination of 0.45±0.15 compared to pathologist scores, and an AUC of 0.89±0.05 for the clinically relevant sTIL-high vs sTIL-low classification task.

4. They show that the intermediate tile-level predictions of WeakSTIL are interpretable and appear to pay attention to features related to the number of TILs and tissue type.

In summary, the main contribution is a weakly supervised deep learning pipeline called WeakSTIL that can predict the important sTIL% biomarker directly from H&E whole-slide images using only weak slide-level labels, with performance rivaling more complex approaches. The interpretability of WeakSTIL is also demonstrated.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents WeakSTIL, a deep learning method that can predict the percentage of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL%) in breast cancer whole slide images using only weak slide-level labels, achieving performance comparable to models trained on more costly precise lymphocyte annotations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on scoring tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in histopathology images:

- This paper uses a weak label learning approach with self-supervised pretraining and multiple instance learning, which is relatively novel compared to prior work like exhaustive TIL detection or patch-based classification. Using only slide-level labels makes the method more practical for clinical use. 

- The performance seems comparable or slightly better than prior methods like the TIL detection baseline used in the paper, despite requiring less detailed annotations. The correlation coefficient of 0.82 is similar to other state-of-the-art methods on this dataset.

- The tile-level interpretability of the model is a nice feature not present in most prior methods that directly predict slide-level scores. Being able to visualize which regions contribute to the overall score could increase trust and provide insight into the model's logic.

- The dataset size of around 300 slides is reasonably sized but smaller than some large-scale public datasets used in other papers. Testing on additional datasets could further validate the robustness.

- The authors appropriately compare to a basic TIL detection baseline but more comparisons to recent state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks would better situate the performance and value of the method.

- While specific to breast cancer currently, the overall framework could generalize well to other cancer types where TIL scoring is clinically relevant. Expanding the evaluation to other tumor contexts could be valuable future work.

Overall, the weak label learning approach appears promising, achieving strong results with fewer annotations. More extensive comparisons and evaluations on large public datasets could further demonstrate the potential of the method. But this paper presents a solid proof-of-concept for an efficient and interpretable approach to tumor infiltrating lymphocyte scoring.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing methods to overcome the dilution of sTIL% scores that can occur for WSIs with high sTIL% but large tumor areas. The authors suggest using an additional network to output tumor-stroma classifications to filter out non-stroma tiles when computing the mean sTIL% score.

- Collecting more training data with weak labels to allow the model to better interpret uncommon or edge case tiles. The current approach sometimes falsely predicts high sTIL% for edge tiles without stroma/TILs. More training data could help resolve these edge cases.

- Incorporating larger context beyond individual tiles in the model architecture. The authors note that only using a tile-level context means the model can't determine if a stromal region is inside or outside the tumor bed. Larger context could help.

- Validating the approach on additional datasets with ground truth pathologist sTIL% scores, especially datasets where precise tumor-stroma segmentations are available. This could allow better evaluation of model performance.

- Exploring modifications to the MIL regression approach used, such as attentional mechanisms to selectively weight instance contributions.

- Applying the weak labeling approach to other prognostic/predictive biomarkers measurable from H&E WSIs beyond sTIL%.

In general, the authors highlight the promise of self-supervised and weakly supervised methods for histopathology image analysis, and suggest further work is needed to handle edge cases, incorporate larger context, and validate on more datasets. Expanding the applicability to other prognostic biomarkers is also noted as an interesting direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents WeakSTIL, a deep learning pipeline for scoring the percentage of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL%) in whole-slide images of breast cancer tissue. WeakSTIL uses a two-stage approach, first extracting features from image tiles using a model pretrained with self-supervised learning on unlabeled histopathology data. It then makes sTIL% predictions for each tile using multiple instance learning, requiring only a weak whole-slide image level label for training. WeakSTIL achieves similar performance to more complex methods needing exhaustive TIL annotations, reaching a coefficient of determination of 0.45 compared to pathologist scores. The tile-level predictions are highly interpretable, suggesting the model pays attention to features related to TIL count and tissue type. Overall, the paper shows weak labels are sufficient for consistent and explainable computational sTIL% scoring, which could help stratify breast cancer patients into targeted therapy arms.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents WeakSTIL, a deep learning method to predict the percentage of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL%) in whole-slide images of breast cancer tissue. sTIL% is an important prognostic and predictive biomarker, but current methods to measure it are time-consuming and have high inter-observer variability. 

WeakSTIL uses a two-stage approach with self-supervised learning and multiple instance learning. It first encodes image tiles from the whole-slide image into feature vectors using a model pretrained on unlabeled histology data. Then it predicts a sTIL% score for each tile and averages these to get the whole-slide sTIL% score. Compared to methods requiring exhaustive lymphocyte annotations, WeakSTIL performs similarly well while only needing weak whole-slide labels for training. It reaches a R^2 of 0.45 compared to pathologist scores and AUC of 0.89 for sTIL-high vs sTIL-low classification. The tile-level predictions are interpretable and suggest the model pays attention to lymphocyte numbers and tissue types. Overall, WeakSTIL demonstrates the potential for weak label learning to enable consistent and efficient sTIL% scoring directly from standard histology slides.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents WeakSTIL, an interpretable two-stage weak label deep learning pipeline for scoring the percentage of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL%) in H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) of breast cancer tissue. In the first stage, tiles from the WSI are compressed by extracting features using a feature extractor pre-trained with self-supervised learning on unlabeled histopathology data. In the second stage, a multiple instance learning (MIL) regressor called TILMIL is trained to predict a sTIL% score for each tile using only a weak WSI-level label. TILMIL assumes the predictive signal of the label is present in each tumor bed tile equally. The final output is the average of the tile-level scores. By using only weak labels, WeakSTIL aims to overcome the annotation efforts needed to train existing TIL detection methods that require exhaustive cell-level labels.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is developing an automated method to quantify tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in whole slide images of breast cancer tissue. Specifically, they aim to predict the percentage of stromal TILs (sTIL%), which is an important prognostic and predictive biomarker in breast cancer. 

However, manually quantifying sTIL% is time-consuming and subject to intra- and inter-observer variability. Existing computational methods require exhaustively annotating individual TILs, which is laborious. 

Instead, the authors propose a new deep learning pipeline called WeakSTIL that can predict sTIL% directly from weak slide-level labels. This requires much less annotation effort compared to annotating every TIL. The main questions seem to be:

1) Can weak slide-level labels be used with self-supervised learning and multiple instance learning to accurately predict sTIL%? 

2) Will this be comparable in performance to methods requiring exhaustive TIL annotations?

3) Will the model produce interpretable tile-level sTIL predictions?

So in summary, they are trying to develop a more efficient computational approach to quantify this important prognostic biomarker while retaining accuracy and interpretability. Reducing annotation effort could help enable broader clinical use of sTIL% measurements.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts in this paper include:

- Stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL%) - The percentage of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes present in the stromal compartment, an important prognostic and predictive biomarker in breast cancer. 

- Whole-slide images (WSIs) - Digitized pathology slides containing entire tissue sections scanned at high resolution. Enables analysis of entire tumor/tissue regions.

- Weak labels - Labels provided at the slide level rather than detailed annotations (e.g. only sTIL% score for whole slide rather than markings for all TILs). Require lower labeling effort.

- Self-supervised learning (SSL) - Method to pre-train neural networks on unlabeled data by creating surrogate supervised tasks. Used here to obtain useful feature representations from histopathology images.

- Multiple instance learning (MIL) - Supervised learning approach for problems where labels are provided for collections of instances/examples rather than individual instances. Used here to predict slide-level labels from tile features. 

- Interpretability - Providing transparency into how a model works, here by visualizing tile-level sTIL% predictions even though only trained on slide-level labels.

- Tumor microenvironment - The cellular environment in which the tumor exists, including immune infiltrates like TILs that interact with cancer cells. Assessing this environment is important for prognosis/prediction.

In summary, key ideas involve using weak slide-level labels and self-supervised pre-training to predict sTIL% scores directly from WSIs in an interpretable manner, circumventing the need for exhaustive TIL labeling.

This paper presents WeakSTIL, an interpretable two-stage weak label deep learning pipeline for scoring the percentage of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL%) in H&E-stained whole-slide images of breast cancer tissue.
