# [DAG-aware Synthesis Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07846)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DAG-aware Synthesis Orchestration":

Problem:
- Existing state-of-the-art DAG-aware logic synthesis algorithms are designed to perform stand-alone optimizations during a single DAG traversal. 
- However, they are limited in quality-of-results and runtime complexity as they miss tremendous optimization opportunities and get stuck in local minima.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes "Synthesis Orchestration", which orchestrates multiple stand-alone operations like rewriting, resubstitution and refactoring within the single traversal of an And-Inverter Graph (AIG).

- Two orchestration policies are proposed: 
   1) Local-greedy: Picks operation with highest local gain (node reduction) at each node
   2) Domain-specific Priority: Picks operation based on predefined domain-specific priority order

Main Contributions:
- Proposed the concept of "synthesis orchestration" to enhance logic optimization by orchestrating multiple optimizations in a single DAG traversal

- Implemented first synthesis orchestration approach for AIGs by orchestrating rewriting, resubstitution and refactoring

- Evaluation on 104 designs shows orchestration achieves 4.2% more reductions on average compared to stand-alone optimizations

- Demonstrated orchestration's advantages in iterative synthesis flows like resyn and resyn3 in ABC

- Integrated orchestration optimization into OpenROAD framework and demonstrated benefits in end-to-end performance even after technology mapping and routing

In summary, the paper introduces an effective concept of orchestrating multiple logic synthesis optimizations within a single DAG traversal, leading to better optimization opportunities and results. The orchestration technique is shown to provide consistent benefits across various experiments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel logic synthesis concept called DAG-aware synthesis orchestration that orchestrates multiple optimization operations such as rewriting, resubstitution, and refactoring within a single traversal of an And-Inverter Graph to achieve better logic optimization compared to stand-alone optimizations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the concept of "DAG-aware synthesis orchestration" for logic optimization. Specifically, the paper proposes orchestrating multiple logic optimization operations like rewriting, resubstitution, and refactoring within a single traversal of the circuit's DAG representation (such as an AIG). This is in contrast to existing techniques that apply these optimizations in a stand-alone, iterative fashion. 

The paper introduces two orchestration policies - a local greedy policy that picks the optimization with highest local gain at each node, and a domain-specific priority policy where a predefined order of optimizations is followed. Experimental results on 104 designs show that orchestration outperforms stand-alone techniques, achieving 4.2% higher node reduction on average. The concept also demonstrates consistent benefits when integrated into broader synthesis flows like resyn and resyn3 in ABC, as well as end-to-end in OpenROAD.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and demonstrating the benefits of coordinating multiple logic optimization techniques simultaneously within a single DAG traversal, instead of applying them in an isolated, iterative manner. This DAG-aware synthesis orchestration concept opens up new opportunities for logic optimization.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Here are some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper:

- DAG-aware synthesis orchestration
- AIG (And-Inverter Graph) optimization 
- Rewriting, resubstitution, refactoring (stand-alone optimizations in ABC)
- Local-greedy orchestration policy 
- Domain-specific priority orchestration policy
- Logic minimization
- Iterative optimization
- Technology mapping 
- Post-routing evaluation
- End-to-end design flow (integration with OpenROAD)

The main focus of the paper is proposing a new concept called "DAG-aware synthesis orchestration", which orchestrates multiple logic optimization techniques like rewriting, resubstitution and refactoring within a single traversal of an AIG data structure. Two orchestration policies are introduced - local-greedy and domain-specific priority. Experiments show superior logic minimization results compared to stand-alone techniques in ABC, with iterative optimization and when integrated into full EDA flows using OpenROAD. The paper also analyzes runtime vs performance tradeoffs and miscorrelations between logic synthesis and later physical design stages, motivating further research into end-to-end aware orchestration.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel concept called "DAG-aware synthesis orchestration". Can you explain in more detail what this concept entails and how it works? What are the key mechanisms involved?

2. The paper implements two orchestration policies - Local-greedy and Domain-specific Priority. Can you contrast these two policies and discuss the trade-offs between them? When might one policy be preferred over the other?

3. The experimental results show that orchestration outperforms stand-alone optimizations on average. However, there is variability in the improvements seen across different benchmarks. What factors might explain why orchestration works better for some designs than others? 

4. The paper identifies optimization opportunities that are missed by stand-alone methods during DAG traversal. Can you provide some examples of specific cases where orchestration is able to find improvements that individual methods cannot?

5. Runtime overheads are analyzed when comparing orchestration versus stand-alone methods. What are the key sources of additional runtime introduced by orchestration? How might these overheads be reduced in future implementations?

6. Iterative optimization results are presented comparing orchestration flows versus sequences of stand-alone optimizations. Why does orchestration tend to outperform stand-alone methods in the iterative setting?

7. The paper integrates orchestration into OpenROAD and evaluates end-to-end performance. What are some possible reasons for the degradation in advantages post technology mapping and routing?

8. How difficult was it to integrate the proposed orchestration techniques into the ABC synthesis tool? What modifications or hooks need to be added to enable orchestration?

9. The concept of orchestration seems general enough to apply to other data structures besides AIGs. Can you discuss how orchestration might work with other representations like MIGs? Would the same policies translate over?

10. The paper identifies miscorrelations between technology independent and technology dependent stages as an issue. How might a technology aware orchestration approach help address these challenges? What mechanisms would be required?
