# [Robust Generalized Proportional Integral Control for Trajectory Tracking   of Soft Actuators in a Pediatric Wearable Assistive Device](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00289)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing wearable assistive devices for infants is challenging due to their unique physical and developmental characteristics. Prior work has limitations in providing powered assistance for upper extremity reaching motions in very young pediatric populations (<2 years old).

- Soft robotics can provide safe and compliant actuation but controlling soft pneumatic actuators precisely for trajectory tracking remains an open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops a generalized proportional integral (GPI) control method to achieve accurate trajectory tracking for shoulder joint assistance using soft pneumatic actuators. 

- Two fabric-based bellow and pouch type pneumatic actuators are designed to assist with shoulder abduction/adduction and flexion/extension motions respectively.

- The actuators are mounted on a custom infant-sized mannequin designed based on 12-month old anthropometrics. Inertial measurement units provide proprioceptive joint angle feedback.

- The GPI controller commands the pneumatic PWM based on error between desired and actual joint angle to achieve trajectory tracking. Controller gains are tuned based on model parameters fit from experimental data.

Contributions:
- Novel control of bellow-type soft actuators and dual actuator control for infant shoulder assistance.

- Extensive experimentation with fitted polynomial, harmonic and teach-and-repeat trajectories showcase accurate tracking across diverse motions.

- This is the first work to consider general 2DOF shoulder motion for infants using soft robotics and GPI control, validating system efficacy towards future integration in pediatric wearable assistive devices.

In summary, the key innovation is achieving precise trajectory tracking control for infant scale shoulder assistance using soft pneumatic actuators via a robust GPI control approach.
