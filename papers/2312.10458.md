# [Degree-based stratification of nodes in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10458)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Graph neural networks (GNNs) do not display the same favorable scaling properties as other deep neural networks like CNNs and Transformers. Issues like oversmoothing of node representations have been identified, where node embeddings become overly similar as depth increases, limiting model performance.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a method to stratify graph nodes based on degree, splitting them into high and low degree groups. Separate weight matrices are learned for each group per GNN layer. Motivation is provided that low and high degree nodes behave differently - low degree nodes are harder to classify and lie near decision boundaries, while high degree nodes lie in more uniform areas. Learning separate weights better handles these differences.

Main Contributions:
- Motivate node degree stratification based on analysis showing low degree nodes are harder to classify and lie near decision boundaries 
- Propose modifying GNN architectures like GCNs and GATs to have separate weight matrices for low and high degree nodes
- Show consistent performance improvements across datasets and GNN variants with the proposed degree-based stratification
- Ablation study shows gains are not just from added capacity but specifically from degree-based splitting of nodes

The method provides a simple way to account for graph topology in GNN message passing. Future work involves more heavily encoding local neighborhood topology to condition messaging passing. The degree-based splitting shows potential for better handling oversmoothing in GNNs.
