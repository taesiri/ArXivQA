# [Predicting Sustainable Development Goals Using Course Descriptions --   from LLMs to Conventional Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16420)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Universities are adopting UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into their curricula to promote sustainability. However, it is challenging for universities to understand which SDGs are being taught across different degree programs and courses at an aggregate level. 

Proposed Solution:
- Gathered course description data from a university spanning 2021-2023
- Used the PaLM-2 large language model (LLM) to generate SDG predictions for each course
- Cleaned the LLM-generated training data 
- Trained smaller foundation models like BERT and BART on this data to predict SDGs from course descriptions

Key Contributions:
- Presented a novel approach to mapping university courses to SDGs using LLMs 
- Showed how noisy course description data can be used alongside LLMs to create training data
- Demonstrated that smaller foundation models can be fine-tuned to effectively predict SDGs from course descriptions
- The best performing model was BART with an F1-score of 0.786 for multi-label SDG classification
- This approach allows universities to understand SDG adoption in curricula to facilitate sustainability practices

The paper makes important contributions regarding the application of NLP techniques to promote sustainability in university education by predicting alignment with SDGs from course-level metadata.
