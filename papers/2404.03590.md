# [SemGrasp: Semantic Grasp Generation via Language Aligned Discretization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03590)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating natural human grasps requires considering not just object geometry but also semantic information. Prior grasp generation methods rely solely on geometric cues, limiting their capability when downstream tasks necessitate alignment with human intent. Hence, there is a need for an approach that incorporates semantic knowledge into the grasp generation process.

Method:
The paper proposes SemGrasp, a novel semantic grasp generation method. It introduces a discrete representation that divides the grasp into three interrelated components - orientation, manner, and refinement. These align with the human grasp planning process of first determining general orientation, then grasp type for interaction, and finally pose adjustments for plausibility. 

To enable language alignment, this representation is discretized into grasp tokens using a VQ-VAE. An MLLM model is then trained to map objects, grasps, and language descriptions into a unified semantic space. This facilitates grasp generation from language instructions.

The model is trained on CapGrasp, a new dataset compiled by the authors. It augments an existing HOI dataset with low-level contact annotations, high-level intent descriptions by GPT-4, and grasp-language conversations.

Contributions:
1) SemGrasp method that generates grasps incorporating semantic information through language alignment.

2) Novel discrete grasp representation that is interpretable, controllable, and supports description via tokens.

3) CapGrasp dataset containing rich semantic grasp annotations - low-level contacts, high-level intents, conversations.

The method shows strong performance on metrics assessing physical plausibility and semantic consistency. Qualitative results and applications in AR/VR and robotics highlight its ability to produce grasps aligned with linguistic intents.
