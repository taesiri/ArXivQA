# [DeltaZip: Multi-Tenant Language Model Serving via Delta Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05215)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph for this paper:

This paper reviews DeltaZip, a multi-tenant language model serving system for personalized language models. DeltaZip uses delta compression between a base model and fine-tuned personalized language models to enable efficient model serving across multiple tenants. Various lossy and lossless compression techniques are used, including the optimal brain surgeon (OBS) methodology integrating quantization and sparsification, as well as the GDeflate algorithm. Model quality evaluation is done based on downstream task accuracy and conversational examples, showing minimal quality degradation at high compression ratios. The lossy compression methodology based on OBS along with the underlying theory is also described in detail. In summary, DeltaZip demonstrates an effective approach for multi-tenant serving of personalized language models through differential model compression.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Unfortunately there is not enough information provided in the Latex document to summarize the content into one sentence. The document contains LaTeX code to format a paper, including document class definition, package imports, custom command definitions, and some sample content, but does not have a complete paper that could be meaningfully summarized. It seems to be a template or framework for a paper discussing model compression techniques, with sections for proposed methods, experiments, results, and conclusions left unwritten. Without any substantive content in the paper, I cannot provide a one sentence summary. Please provide a more complete paper draft if you would like me to summarize the key point.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be presenting the DeltaZip system, which is a multi-tenant serving system that leverages delta compression techniques to efficiently serve multiple machine learning models from a shared model base. Specifically:

- The paper proposes techniques to compress the deltas between a base model and specialized fine-tuned models in order to reduce redundancy and efficiently serve multiple models. This includes integrating quantization, sparsification, and lossless compression into a pipeline.

- The paper presents the DeltaZip algorithm, which is adapted from prior work on optimal brain surgeon and model compression techniques in order to compress the deltas from a shared base model.

- The paper evaluates DeltaZip on large transformer models and shows it can save up to 95% of storage costs for serving multiple tenant models in a multi-tenant setting while retaining accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the DeltaZip approach for efficient multi-tenant serving of machine learning models using delta compression from a shared base model. The techniques allow serving a large number of specialized models with significantly reduced storage costs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Delta compression
- Lossy compression (optimal brain surgeon, quantization, sparsification)
- Lossless compression (GDeflate)
- Language models
- Model compression
- Model serving
- Multi-tenant serving

The paper discusses using delta compression techniques, including both lossy and lossless methods, to compress updates to language models in order to enable efficient multi-tenant serving. Key techniques include the optimal brain surgeon framework for lossy compression of model deltas and the GDeflate algorithm for lossless compression. The goal is to allow efficient serving of customized language models to multiple tenants by compressing the deltas from a base model.
