# [ConsistentEE: A Consistent and Hardness-Guided Early Exiting Method for   Accelerating Language Models Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11882)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing early exiting methods for accelerating language models impose all internal classifiers to predict all instances correctly during training. However, during inference, only one internal classifier needs to predict correctly to exit early without losing accuracy. This inconsistency between training and inference objectives harms the performance of internal classifiers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ConsistentEE, a reinforcement learning based early exiting approach that is consistent between training and inference. 
- A policy network is added to decide whether an instance should exit at the current layer or continue. If the policy network decides to exit, only the internal classifier at that layer incurs a loss to predict correctly.  
- A concept of "memorized layer" is proposed to measure hardness of instances. It is used in the reward function to allow "easy" instances to focus more on acceleration and "hard" instances to focus more on accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates early exiting as a reinforcement learning problem to achieve training-inference consistency.
- Proposes memorized layer to quantify instance hardness and uses it to guide the trade-off between accuracy and acceleration. 
- Experiments show ConsistentEE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various language understanding and generation benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness and efficiency.

In summary, the paper addresses the inconsistency issue of early exiting methods via a reinforcement learning formulation and a hardness-aware reward design. The proposed ConsistentEE method achieves better accuracy-speed trade-offs on multiple language tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ConsistentEE, a reinforcement learning-based early exiting method for language models that encourages easy instances to exit early while allowing hard instances to focus more on accuracy, achieving faster inference speeds while maintaining accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing an early exiting method based on reinforcement learning that achieves consistency between training and inference. Only one internal classifier is required to predict an instance correctly during training. 

2. Introducing a new concept called "Memorized Layer" to measure the hardness of instances. This is incorporated into the reward function to allow easy and hard instances to balance accuracy and acceleration differently.

3. Experimental results showing the proposed method outperforms existing baselines on natural language understanding and generation tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is using reinforcement learning for early exiting to achieve training-inference consistency, as well as using the proposed Memorized Layer concept to guide the reward function so instances can customize tradeoffs between accuracy and acceleration. Experiments demonstrate effectiveness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Early exiting - The main technique explored in the paper to accelerate model inference by allowing instances to exit at early layers rather than going through the full model.

- Reinforcement learning - The paper formulates early exiting as a reinforcement learning problem, where a policy network decides when instances should exit.

- Reward function - A key component of the reinforcement learning formulation, balances between accuracy and acceleration. 

- Memorized layer - A proposed concept to measure hardness of instances, incorporated into the reward function.

- Consistency - The paper aims to make training and inference consistent by only requiring one internal classifier to predict an instance correctly during training.

- Natural language understanding - The paper evaluates methods on GLUE classification tasks.

- Natural language generation - The paper also evaluates on conditional text generation using large language models. 

- Accuracy - One of the two key metrics considered, measures performance on end tasks.

- Acceleration - The other key metric that measures how much faster inference is compared to baseline.

In summary, the key focus is on using reinforcement learning for early exiting to accelerate inference of models on NLP tasks while maintaining accuracy. The reward function design and consistency between training/inference are important components.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 suggested in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that there is a gap between training and inference in existing early exiting methods. Can you elaborate more on what causes this gap and why it is problematic? 

2. The concept of "memorized layer" is introduced to measure instance hardness. How is this concept inspired by existing literature on measuring instance hardness? What are its connections and differences compared to those methods?

3. Reinforcement learning is used to determine the exit layer. What considerations went into the design of the state, action space, and reward function? How do these choices impact the training dynamics?  

4. The hardness-guided reward function treats easy and hard instances differently. What would happen if a uniform reward is used instead? What are the limitations of the uniform reward?

5. The iterative training technique alternates between optimizing the policy network and the classifiers. Why is this helpful compared to joint optimization? What challenges arise from iterative training?

6. How does the early exiting criterion during inference get determined? What impact would changing this threshold have on accuracy versus efficiency tradeoffs? 

7. The method is evaluated on a diverse set of language tasks. Are there any task-specific tuning or modifications made to the method? If not, why does the same formulation work across different tasks?

8. How does this method compare to other dynamic inference methods like token skipping? What are the pros and cons when applied to large language models?

9. Could memorized layer be useful for other applications beyond early exiting, such as curriculum learning? What modifications would be needed to enable this?

10. The accuracy-efficiency tradeoff curve shows some interesting trends as compared to baselines. What factors contribute to achieving those improved tradeoff characteristics?
