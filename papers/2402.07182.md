# [Divide and Conquer: Provably Unveiling the Pareto Front with   Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07182)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Learning the Pareto front, the set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between different objectives, is an important challenge in multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL). However, existing methods either rely on assumptions like convexity of the Pareto front or are limited to specific policy classes like stochastic policies. The paper addresses the problem of learning Pareto fronts for general policy classes like deterministic policies without making restricting assumptions.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Iterated Pareto Referent Optimisation (IPRO), an algorithm that iteratively learns Pareto optimal policies by decomposing the overall problem into a sequence of single-objective problems. In each iteration, IPRO proposes a reference point to a Pareto oracle which returns a Pareto optimal policy with expected return dominating that reference point. By strategically selecting new reference points and discarding dominated areas after each oracle query, IPRO provably converges to the exact Pareto front. 

Key Contributions:

- IPRO guarantees convergence to the true Pareto front for any policy class given an appropriate Pareto oracle, while providing bounds on the distance to undiscovered Pareto optimal solutions at each iteration.

- It introduces Pareto oracles, which enable transforming the search for Pareto optimal policies into constrained single-objective problems, for which many RL methods exist. Rigorous definitions and theoretical results are provided for Pareto oracles.

- For deterministic policies, it proposes practical Pareto oracle implementations by extending DQN, A2C and PPO using achievement scalarising functions. Empirical results demonstrate IPRO matches or outperforms existing methods needing additional assumptions, while being generally applicable.

- The idea of iterative referent selection using theoretical guarantees from multi-objective optimisation is novel and promising for broader application in pathfinding, planning etc. beyond just MORL.

In summary, IPRO is a principled, assumption-free algorithm to learn Pareto fronts in MORL problems by creativelyutilizing single-objective solvers, with strong theoretical foundations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Iterated Pareto Referent Optimisation (IPRO), an algorithm that decomposes the problem of learning a Pareto front of policies in multi-objective reinforcement learning into a sequence of single-objective problems, providing theoretical guarantees on convergence and approximation quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Iterated Pareto Referent Optimisation (IPRO), an algorithm to learn the Pareto front in multi-objective Markov decision processes (MOMDPs). Specifically, IPRO:

- Decomposes the problem of finding the Pareto front into a sequence of single-objective problems, enabling convergence guarantees and providing an upper bound on the distance to undiscovered Pareto optimal solutions at each step.

- Guarantees convergence to the Pareto front and establishes bounds on the approximation error at each iteration. 

- Is a general algorithm applicable to different policy classes, but is demonstrated to be particularly effective for the challenging case of deterministic policies where the Pareto front can be irregularly shaped. 

- Empirically matches or outperforms existing methods that make additional assumptions, showcasing IPRO's effectiveness without requiring domain knowledge.

So in summary, the main contribution is the IPRO algorithm along with its theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, providing the first general, principled approach to provably learn Pareto fronts in MOMDPs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes decomposing the problem of finding the Pareto front into a sequence of single-objective problems. How does formulating the problem this way allow leveraging more mature single-objective solution methods? What are some of the challenges in extending existing single-objective methods to the multi-objective setting addressed by this approach?

2. The paper introduces the concept of a Pareto oracle which returns a Pareto optimal policy for a given referent point. What are some possible ways to implement this oracle beyond using achievement scalarizing functions? What theoretical guarantees come with using achievement scalarizing functions to construct the oracle? 

3. The paper proves convergence to the exact Pareto front under certain assumptions on the referent selection mechanism and properties of the Pareto oracle. What are these key assumptions and why are they necessary to ensure convergence? How might the convergence guarantees degrade if any of these assumptions are violated?

4. For the bi-objective case, the paper introduces a simplified variant, IPRO-2D. What specific simplifications are possible in two dimensions that do not extend naturally to higher dimensions? How do these simplifications lead to more efficient exploration of the search space?

5. The paper empirically evaluates deterministic memory-based policies which are relevant in safety-critical applications. What modifications were made to reinforcements learning algorithms like DQN and policy gradient methods to optimize the proposed achievement scalarizing function? How was an extended network used to improve sample efficiency?

6. How does the paper address the challenge of verifying if a feasible policy exists that dominates a given referent point, which is shown to be NP-hard? What practical approximations needed to be made in the implementation while retaining theoretical guarantees?

7. The paper compares against baselines requiring additional assumptions like a convex Pareto front shape. Under what conditions might these specialized methods outperform the more general algorithm proposed? When might the proposed approach have an advantage?

8. The method relies on bounding the search space between an ideal and nadir point. What strategies are proposed to set these bounds and how might inaccuracies impact the quality of the final Pareto front approximation?

9. What metrics beyond hypervolume are used to measure the quality of the final Pareto front approximation? Why might hypervolume alone be insufficient to compare against methods that produce very different subsets of the Pareto front?

10. The paper claims the method might have promise for applications beyond multi-objective reinforcement learning. What characteristics of the approach make it potentially applicable to other multi-objective optimization problems like pathfinding? Would any components need to be adapted?
