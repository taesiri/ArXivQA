# [Technical Report on: Tripedal Dynamic Gaits for a Quadruped Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02280)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be whether an empirical study of fault tolerant dynamic gaits can be designed for a quadrupedal robot suffering from a single known "missing" limb. Specifically, the paper investigates whether a gait controller successfully anchors a previously developed planar monopedal hopping template in a three-legged spatial machine, as a generalizable approach to developing tripedal recovery gaits for damaged quadrupedal robots. The key hypothesis seems to be that appropriately coordinating three legs on a physical robot can anchor the dynamics of a single "virtual" leg model, enabling stable tripedal locomotion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting an empirical study of fault tolerant dynamic gaits designed for a quadrupedal robot suffering from a single missing limb. Specifically, the authors demonstrate a steady-state fore-aft tripedal pronking gait implemented on a physical quadrupedal robot (Minitaur) with one of its limbs rendered non-functional. This is believed to be the first time a tripedal dynamic gait has been demonstrated on a quadrupedal robot. The gait controller successfully anchors a previously developed planar monopedal hopping template in the three-legged spatial machine. The compositional approach offers a useful and generalizable methodology for developing tripedal recovery gaits for damaged quadrupedal robots. Preliminary data suggests the gait achieves stable, repeatable tripedal pronking on the quadruped despite missing a limb.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:This paper presents an empirical study of a steady-state fore-aft tripedal pronking gait for a quadrupedal robot with one missing limb, demonstrating that a previously developed monopedal hopping controller can be successfully adapted to achieve stable dynamic tripedal locomotion on the physical robot.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points of comparison between this paper and other related research on fault tolerant gaits for legged robots:- The paper focuses specifically on developing a tripedal dynamic gait for a quadruped robot that has lost a limb. Much prior work has focused on quasi-static gaits or locked joint failures rather than complete limb loss. Implementing a dynamic gait on a legged robot with missing limb is a novel contribution.- The approach anchors a simple monopedal vertical hopping template on the three remaining legs of the quadruped. This compositional approach using templates is different from optimization or learning based methods commonly used for fault tolerant gait generation.- Experimental results are shown on a physical quadruped robot (Ghost Robotics Minitaur), demonstrating the real-world applicability of the proposed tripedal gait. Many prior papers present simulated results only.  - The tripedal gait is empirically shown to be stable and repeatable, with an approximately affine relationship between vertical hopping height and control gain as predicted by the theoretical template model. Quantitative metrics like cost of transport are also presented.- Compared to prior work on quadrupeds adapting to limb damage, this paper uses a model-based approach starting from first principles rather than learned or evolutionary techniques. It also focuses specifically on amputation rather than joint locking failures.- Limitations of the work include only addressing steady-state pronking rather than more efficient/faster gaits, and lack of comparisons to other gait generation methods applied to the same robot.In summary, the paper makes a useful contribution in demonstrating dynamic tripedal locomotion on a physical quadrupedal robot, with comparisons to an underlying theoretical model, building on a compositional template-anchoring approach. The results help advance fault-tolerant capabilities for legged robots operating in challenging environments.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:- Developing more efficient stable fault tolerant dynamic gaits for quadrupeds that encounter permanent limb damage. The tripedal pronking gait presented in this paper is not very efficient, so the authors suggest working on other gaits like bounding and galloping that may have better efficiency when adapted for three-legged locomotion.- Developing online learning methodologies for limb fault detection in legged robots. The paper assumes the limb damage is known, but future work could look at detecting limb faults automatically.- Gaining independent control of fore-aft speed and hopping height with more sophisticated stepping controllers. Currently the fore-aft speed is coupled to the hopping height, so decoupling these could allow better control.- Broadening the approach to address different types of limb damage beyond amputation, such as joint locking. The current paper focuses specifically on loss of a limb but other damage could be addressed.- Extending the compositional anchoring approach to develop recovery gaits for other types of damaged multi-legged robots beyond quadrupeds. The general framework could potentially apply to hexapods or bipeds as well.In summary, the main future directions are developing more efficient tripedal gaits, automating fault detection, decoupling control of speed and height, addressing other damage types, and extending the approach to other legged robots. The overall goal is to improve the fault tolerance and resilience of legged robots operating in complex environments.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper presents an empirical study of fault tolerant dynamic gaits designed for a quadrupedal robot suffering from a single known "missing" limb. The authors develop a steady-state fore-aft tripedal pronking gait for the robot using an anchoring approach that composites a previously developed planar monopedal hopping template into the three-legged spatial machine. Preliminary data suggests the gait controller successfully stabilizes the tripedal pronking behavior. This compositional methodology offers a useful framework for developing a range of tripedal recovery gaits for damaged quadrupedal robots. Experiments demonstrate stable vertical and fore-aft pronking on the physical robot. The results show pronking is possible with three legs, though less efficient than with four intact limbs. Overall, the paper provides an initial exploration of dynamic fault tolerant gaits for quadrupeds.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper presents the development and demonstration of a steady-state fore-aft tripedal pronking gait for a quadruped robot that has lost the use of one of its limbs. The authors take inspiration from prior work on developing templates for vertical hopping and fore-aft running that can be anchored in physical robots. They leverage these templates to develop a controller that coordinates the remaining three limbs of the quadruped robot to mimic the dynamics of a monopedal hopper. The controller regulates hopping height by modulating energy injection and dissipation over the stance phase. Forward speed is controlled by pre-setting the angle of each limb at touchdown. Experiments conducted with a Minitaur quadruped robot verify that the proposed control approach yields stable vertical hopping over a range of heights. The addition of fixed limb angle stepping enables steady-state fore-aft pronking. Measurements of cost of transport for the tripedal gait demonstrate substantially increased cost compared to pronking with four legs, but likely lower than quasi-static gaits that would otherwise need to be used following loss of a limb. Overall, the results suggest that anchoring monopedal templates is a viable approach to achieve stable dynamic tripedal gaits on quadrupedal robots. The authors propose this as a first step toward developing more efficient fault tolerant gaits.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:This paper presents an empirical study of fault tolerant dynamic gaits designed for a quadrupedal robot suffering from a single, known "missing" limb. The method involves anchoring a previously developed planar monopedal hopping template controller in the three remaining legs of the quadrupedal robot to achieve stable tripedal pronking. Each functional limb is treated as an actively damped mass-spring-damper system and coordinated together through a combination of individual and averaged feedback to approximate the dynamics of a single "virtual" leg. The desired fore-aft velocity is adjusted through fixed leg angle stepping at touchdown and liftoff events. Preliminary results demonstrate that this compositional approach can successfully stabilize tripedal pronking on the quadrupedal robot. Overall, the paper provides a useful guide to developing tripedal recovery gaits for damaged quadrupedal machines by anchoring reduced-order template dynamics.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the main problem being addressed is how to develop fault tolerant dynamic gaits for a quadrupedal robot that has suffered limb damage or loss. Specifically, the paper focuses on developing a tripedal dynamic gait for a quadruped robot that has lost the use of one of its limbs.Some key aspects I gathered about the problem and questions being addressed:- Legged robots operating outdoors are at high risk for limb damage, but ability to recover with compensatory gaits would be very beneficial. - Most prior work has focused on quasi-static gaits for load-bearing locked joint failures, but this paper aims to address non-load bearing limb loss.- Developing dynamical rather than quasi-static gaits could help avoid further body damage from ground impacts and be more efficient at higher speeds.- The paper explores using a compositional approach of anchoring a monopedal hopping template on the remaining three limbs of a quadruped with one missing limb. - Key questions include: can a monopedal hopping controller stabilize tripedal pronking on a physical quadruped robot? How to coordinate the three remaining limbs? What are the empirical speed and efficiency tradeoffs?In summary, the key problem is developing an empirically stable and efficient dynamic tripedal gait for a quadruped robot with a missing limb, using a compositional anchoring approach based on a monopedal template. The paper aims to demonstrate this on a physical robot and characterize its properties.
