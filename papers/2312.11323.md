# [UniForCE: The Unimodality Forest Method for Clustering and Estimation of   the Number of Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11323)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Clustering is an ill-posed unsupervised learning problem since there are many reasonable objectives to optimize. A key challenge is determining the number of clusters k.
- Typical cluster assumptions (e.g. Gaussian, convex) fail to capture irregular real-world cluster shapes. 
- Prior unimodality-based methods (e.g. dip-means) for joint clustering and estimating k have limitations: they use ineffective tests for assessing multidimensional unimodality; they follow a top-down divisive strategy hence cannot find arbitrary shapes.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a flexible cluster definition called "locally unimodal cluster" which aggregates subclusters from an initial overclustering as long as unimodality is locally preserved across pairs of subclusters.
- Assess unimodality between subcluster pairs via a proposed statistical "unimodal pair testing" method using dip tests on balanced samples.
- Build a "unimodality graph" on the subclusters. Connected components correspond to maximal locally unimodal clusters. 
- Present the UniForCE algorithm which computes a minimum spanning forest on the unimodality graph for joint clustering and estimating k.

Contributions:
- Novel locally unimodal cluster definition that flexibly captures both regular and highly irregular/complex clusters.
- Effective statistical unimodal pair testing procedure for assessing local unimodality.
- UniForCE algorithm for robust clustering and automatically estimating k based on computing a spanning forest on the unimodality graph.
- Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrating UniForCE's versatility and robustness in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape and estimating k.

In summary, the key novelty is the locally unimodal cluster assumption and UniForCE algorithm that take a bottom-up agglomerative approach to flexibly discover clusters. This is enabled by a statistically principled formulation and testing of unimodality at a local subcluster level.
