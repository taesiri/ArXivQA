# [Conditional Variational Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02246)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Inverse problems aim to determine parameters from observations, a crucial task in science and engineering. Examples include image super-resolution, where a high-resolution image is estimated from a low-resolution input.
- Deep generative models like diffusion models can model the uncertainty in inverse problems. However, diffusion models are very sensitive to the choice of variance schedule, which controls the dynamics of the diffusion process. Fine-tuning this schedule is time-consuming and suboptimal.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Conditional Variational Diffusion Model (CVDM) to learn the variance schedule as part of training, avoiding schedule fine-tuning. 
- The schedule is factorized into separate functions of time and the condition. Additional constraints and regularization terms ensure meaningful learning of the schedule.
- The model supports conditioning on observations and can learn per-pixel schedules for images.

Contributions:
- Theoretical analysis relating schedule smoothness to the convergence of discrete and continuous training losses, motivating a new regularization strategy.
- Introduction and evaluation of CVDM, which learns the schedule automatically. It achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results in 3 inverse problems without schedule fine-tuning.
- Demonstration that learning the schedule outperforms fine-tuning it as a hyperparameter. This is a simple yet effective way to improve diffusion models.
- Establishing links between the learned schedule and uncertainty in the reconstructions.

In summary, the paper proposes a principled way to learn variance schedules in diffusion models, analyses the theory behind it, and shows how it can effectively solve and provide uncertainty estimates for inverse problems. By learning the schedule, diffusion models become more automated and achieve better performance.
