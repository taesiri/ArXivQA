## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new budgeted online kernel learning algorithm called Ahpatron that achieves improved mistake bounds compared to prior work. The key ideas are: (1) They design an aggressive Perceptron variant (AVP) with tighter bounds using a more active update rule. (2) They introduce a budget maintenance mechanism that removes half the examples at a time and projects the removed examples onto the remaining examples to retain information. (3) Ahpatron approximates AVP using this budget mechanism. Theoretical analyses prove Ahpatron achieves mistake bounds of the form $L_T(f) + O(\frac{L_T(f)}{\sqrt{B}})$ outperforming bounds depending on $T$ rather than the loss. They also resolve an open problem on removing a logarithmic factor. Experiments validate Ahpatron outperforms prior budgeted algorithms on the same or lower budgets across several datasets. Overall, this work makes notable contributions in advancing the theory and practice of budgeted online kernel learning.
