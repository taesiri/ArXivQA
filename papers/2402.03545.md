# [Online Feature Updates Improve Online (Generalized) Label Shift   Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03545)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the issue of label shift in an online setting with missing labels, where the data distribution changes continuously over time and obtaining timely labels is challenging. Existing methods for online label shift adaptation primarily focus on adjusting or updating the final layer of a pre-trained classifier, without enhancing the feature representations.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel framework called "Online Label Shift adaptation with Online Feature Updates (OLS-OFU)" that leverages self-supervised learning to refine the feature extraction process using unlabeled test data. This allows improving the prediction model's effectiveness over time. Specifically, at each timestep, OLS-OFU runs a modified online label shift adaptation algorithm, updates the feature extractor through self-supervised learning on the new unlabeled batch, and retrains the final linear layer.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the OLS-OFU framework that seamlessly integrates online feature updates through self-supervised learning into existing online label shift methods.

- Provides theoretical analysis showing OLS-OFU reduces the algorithmic regret by improving feature representations, leading to lower loss on test samples.

- Empirically demonstrates on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10C that OLS-OFU consistently outperforms counterpart online label shift methods in both label shift and more challenging generalized label shift settings. The gains are especially significant in case of domain shifts.

- Shows OLS-OFU is robust across different datasets, distribution shift processes, and choice of self-supervised learning techniques.

In summary, the paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions in enhancing online learning under label shifts by updating feature representations at test time through self-supervised learning.
