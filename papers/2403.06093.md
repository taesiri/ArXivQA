# [Enhancing 3D Object Detection with 2D Detection-Guided Query Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06093)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-camera based 3D object detection is challenging due to lack of depth information and small object size in faraway regions. 
- Although query-based 3D detectors have made progress, there are still cases where popular 2D detectors are more reliable.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel query anchor generation approach called QAF2D that infers 3D query anchors from 2D detection boxes to improve query-based 3D detectors.  
- Lift a 2D box to 3D anchors by associating sampled points in the box with depth, size and yaw candidates. Verify validity of anchors by projecting back and keeping ones with high IoU.
- Share image feature backbone between 2D and 3D detectors via prompt tuning. Train in two stages - first train 3D detector, then train 2D detector while freezing other parameters.

Main Contributions:
- Novel idea of generating 3D query anchors from 2D detection boxes so more reliable 2D results directly aid 3D detection.
- Efficient sharing of image feature backbone between 2D and 3D detectors via prompt tuning and two-stage training. 
- Generalizable approach integrated into three query-based 3D detectors with consistent improvement on nuScenes dataset, advancing state-of-the-art.

In summary, the paper proposes QAF2D to infer high quality 3D query anchors from 2D detection, leveraging more reliable 2D results to enhance 3D detectors. An efficient two-stage training strategy allows sharing of image features. When integrated into three detectors, consistent and significant improvements are achieved on a complex 3D detection benchmark.
