# [Gaussian Process-based Traversability Analysis for Terrain Mapless   Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19010)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Efficient navigation through uneven and rugged terrain remains a key challenge for autonomous ground robots. Map-based methods require generating extensive global maps, which is computationally expensive and scales poorly. Mapless methods sacrifice global optimality for real-time efficiency but face limitations in accurately assessing terrain characteristics. There is a need for an approach that can efficiently navigate unknown environments in real-time without compromising safety or optimality.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new mapless navigation framework combining a Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) local elevation mapping module with a Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) optimal sampling-based planning algorithm. 

The SGP module builds a local 2D elevation map from LiDAR data to capture the geometry of the nearby terrain. This map provides the elevation, slope, and uncertainty at any queried point. Additional terrain attributes like roughness and step height are extracted to construct a highly descriptive local traversability map. Values in this map range from 0 (traversable) to 1 (non-traversable).

The RRT* planner uses the traversability map to explore the navigable space by probabilistically sampling points and connecting them to form an optimal tree expanding towards the goal. The assessment of new points considers the robot's footprint to ensure the planned paths adhere to its physical constraints. Local sub-goals are chosen using a weighted distance metric to guide the incremental progress.

Main Contributions:

- A SGP-based local mapping module that accurately models terrain geometry and uncertainties 
- A traversability analysis method combining slope, roughness, step height to characterize navigability
- An optimal sampling-based planning approach using RRT* adapted for mapless uneven terrain navigation
- Simulation experiments in complex environments demonstrating enhanced navigation safety, efficiency and optimality compared to a state-of-the-art baseline

The proposed mapless framework enables safe and efficient real-time navigation in unknown natural environments without reliance on global maps. Its components synergistically integrate to overcome limitations of existing methods.
