# [Quantifying Divergence for Human-AI Collaboration and Cognitive Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08722)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes novel measures of "decision-making similarity" between humans and AI models to quantify their potential for collaboration and establish cognitive trust. Specifically, the authors calculate divergence metrics like KL divergence and Jensen-Shannon distance between label distributions provided by humans and various AI models on a textual entailment task. They then conduct a multi-stage user study where participants choose the model with the most similar label distribution to their own judgments. Participants are asked about their willingness to collaborate with and trust in their matched model. The study finds that humans tend to collaborate with models that have high confidence agreement on answers, indicated by low inverse KL divergence. However, cognitive trust also requires avoiding overconfidence when unsure, reflected through forward KL divergence. Overall, decision-making similarity correlates with collaboration likelihood, but individuals may still collaborate even if they lack full cognitive trust. This work provides new ways to approximate human preferences toward AI systems prior to real-world deployment.
