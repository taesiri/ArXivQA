# [Improved Frequency Estimation Algorithms with and without Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07535)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies the problem of frequency estimation over data streams. It provides tight analysis on the performance of popular sketching algorithms like Count-Min and Count-Sketch for Zipfian data streams. It shows Count-Sketch outperforms Count-Min and using multiple hash functions does not help asymptotically. The paper then proposes a novel algorithm that exploits the heavy-tailed nature of the distribution to achieve tighter error bounds, with and without the help of machine learned predictions. For example, without predictions, the proposed algorithm achieves weighted error $O(\frac{\log B + \poly\log\log n}{B \log n})$ compared to Count-Sketch's $\Theta(\frac{1}{B})$. With predictions, the error is further improved to $O(\frac{1}{B \log n})$. The algorithms retain robustness guarantees in case the distribution is not Zipfian or predictions are inaccurate. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate significant improvements over prior approaches. The gap is especially noticeable in the small space regimes common in practice.
