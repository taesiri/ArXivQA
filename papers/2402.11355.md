# [What Changed? Converting Representational Interventions to Natural   Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11355)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Representation interventions in language models, which erase or alter encoding of concepts like gender, are effective for controlling model behavior. However, since they operate in the latent representation space, it is challenging to interpret the specific features they modify. 

- Natural language counterfactuals that reflect the changes from representation interventions would aid interpretation and have intrinsic value for tasks like data augmentation.

Method:
- Leverage text inversion models that can reconstruct a text from its encoded representation. Apply a representation intervention, then invert back to text to get a counterfactual.

- Compare counterfactual texts induced by different interventions: LEACE (erases concept encoding), MiMiC (matches representation distribution of opposing class), MiMiC+ (pushes representations further towards opposing class).

Analysis and Applications:
- Counterfactuals recover known gender biases in word usage, and suggest novel subtle biases encoded in LMs, like increased use of "recent/recently" for males.

- Human evaluation shows interventions successfully alter perceived gender markers without major quality degradation.

- Counterfactual texts used for data augmentation mitigate gender bias and improve fairness in profession classification, outperforming models trained on data with overt gender markers removed.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate feasibility and value of converting representation space interventions to natural language.
- Analysis highlights subtle gender biases encoded in LMs.
- Data augmentation with counterfactuals reduces classification bias.

The summary covers the key points on the problem being addressed, the proposed method of inverting representation interventions to text, analysis showing the kinds of subtle biases revealed, and the application for data augmentation and bias mitigation. It highlights the main contributions around interpreting representation interventions, bias analysis, and bias mitigation with counterfactuals.
