# [Weak Supervision with Arbitrary Single Frame for Micro- and   Macro-expression Spotting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14240)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for micro-expression (ME) and macro-expression (MaE) spotting rely on time-consuming frame-level labeling (fully-supervised) or lack location and quantity information (video-level weakly-supervised). Frame-level labeling requires laborious per-frame annotation. Video-level labeling lacks expression location and count details, resulting in significantly worse performance.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a point-level weakly-supervised expression spotting (PWES) framework that utilizes a single random frame from each expression interval as a training label. This reduces annotation cost compared to frame-level labeling, while providing more supervision than video-level labels. 

The key ideas are:
1) Multi-refined pseudo label generation (MPLG) to produce reliable pseudo labels by merging information from class probabilities, attention scores, features, and point labels. This retains low-confidence foregrounds and suppresses high-confidence backgrounds.

2) Distribution-guided feature contrastive learning (DFCL) with a memory bank to capture global representations and enhance feature similarity within classes and differences between classes.  

Main Contributions:
1) First point-level weakly-supervised method for ME and MaE spotting requiring only a single random frame per expression. Significantly reduces annotation cost compared to frame-level supervised methods.

2) MPLG algorithm to generate higher quality pseudo labels by fusing multiple cues like probabilities, attention, features, and point labels. Better than prior pseudo label methods. 

3) DFCL algorithm with memory bank to capture global representations across the dataset using contrastive learning. Enhances within-class aggregation and between-class separation.

4) Experiments on CAS(ME)2, CAS(ME)3, and SAMM-LV show the performance of this weakly-supervised method is promising, approaching recent fully-supervised techniques for expression spotting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a weakly-supervised facial expression spotting framework called PWES that uses arbitrary single frames as point-level supervision to alleviate the annotation cost of full frame-level labeling while achieving performance comparable to fully-supervised methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a point-level weakly-supervised expression spotting (PWES) framework that utilizes randomly selected single frames from each ground truth interval as training labels. This reduces annotation cost compared to frame-level fully-supervised methods, while providing more localization information than video-level weakly-supervised methods. 

2. It introduces a multi-refined pseudo label generation (MPLG) algorithm to generate more reliable pseudo labels by merging information from class-specific probabilities, attention scores, current video features, and point-level labels. This addresses limitations of previous pseudo label generation methods.

3. It proposes a distribution-guided feature contrastive learning (DFCL) algorithm with a memory bank to capture global representations across the entire dataset. This enhances feature similarity for the same categories and feature variability for different categories.

4. Extensive experiments on the CAS(ME)$^2$, CAS(ME)$^3$ and SAMM-LV datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PWES framework, with performance comparable to recent fully-supervised methods for expression spotting.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a novel point-level weakly-supervised framework PWES for facial expression spotting, along with algorithms like MPLG and DFCL to improve model training.
