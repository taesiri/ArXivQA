# [COMQ: A Backpropagation-Free Algorithm for Post-Training Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07134)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Post-training quantization (PTQ) aims to compress pre-trained deep neural networks into low-precision versions (e.g. 4-bit) without significant accuracy loss. Despite being more efficient than quantization-aware training, existing PTQ methods tend to suffer substantial accuracy degradation especially for low-bit quantization of vision transformers. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes COMQ, a coordinate-wise minimization algorithm for PTQ that sequentially minimizes the layer-wise squared error between the outputs of pre-trained and quantized models. Key ideas:

(1) Decompose quantized weights into scaling factors and integer bit codes. Treat them as coordinate variables to minimize error.

(2) In each iteration, update only one coordinate variable while fixing others. This involves only dot products and rounding, avoiding backpropagation.

(3) Update coordinates in a carefully designed greedy order for faster error reduction.

Main Contributions:  

(1) A backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm based on coordinate descent optimization. Computationally more efficient than existing methods.

(2) State-of-the-art PTQ performance, especially for 4-bit quantization of vision transformers (<1% accuracy drop) and CNNs (0.3% drop). 

(3) Achieves strong results even in extreme 2-bit setting unseen in prior arts. Demonstrates versatility across various neural architectures.

(4) Extensive ablation studies on factors like batch size, iteration number etc. Analyzes properties of the algorithm.

In summary, the paper develops an optimized coordinate descent approach to PTQ that achieves promising accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. It shows SOTA quantization capability for both CNNs and transformers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes COMQ, a coordinate-wise minimization algorithm for post-training quantization of convolutional neural networks and vision transformers that sequentially updates layerwise quantization parameters to minimize reconstruction error through only dot products and rounding operations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The introduction of COMQ, a post-training quantization method that performs uniform weight quantization on a layer-by-layer basis. COMQ sequentially conducts coordinate-wise minimization of the layer-wise reconstruction errors by treating all scaling factors and bit-codes within a layer as variables of the error function. It solves a sequence of minimization of univariate quadratic functions which have closed-form solutions, leading to backpropagation-free iterations that primarily involve dot products and rounding operations without using any hyperparameters.

In summary, the main contribution is a simple yet effective post-training quantization algorithm called COMQ that achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially for quantizing Vision Transformers to ultra low bit-widths.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the COMQ method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a coordinate-wise minimization approach to post-training quantization. How is this approach different from standard cyclic coordinate descent? What specific order of updating the coordinates is proposed and why?

2) Explain the initialization procedure for the scaling factors and bit-codes in the COMQ algorithm. Why is the average infinity norm used for initializing the shared scalar in per-layer quantization? 

3) For per-channel quantization, the paper proposes a greedy update order instead of cyclic order. Explain how this greedy order is determined and why it leads to better performance.

4) In Algorithms 1 and 2, explain the rationales behind the closed-form updates for the bit-codes (q_ij) and scaling factors (delta). Why can univariate quadratic optimization problems be solved analytically here?

5) The coordinate descent method requires solving multiple univariate subproblems per iteration. Compare the computational complexities of COMQ and backpropagation-based methods for minimizing the layer-wise squared error.

6) Why does COMQ work significantly better than prior PTQ methods under aggressive low-bit quantization regimes? Analyze the potential weaknesses of existing methods in this setting.  

7) Discuss the flexibility of the COMQ framework in terms of supporting different precision levels, activation quantization methods, and neural architectures.

8) Analyze the results in Tables 2 and 3. Why does COMQ achieve superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art especially for Vision Transformers?

9) Based on the ablation studies, discuss the effects of batch size and number of COMQ iterations on the image classification accuracy. Is there an optimal choice?

10) Suggest some potential limitations of COMQ and future research directions that can build upon the coordinate descent principle for post-training quantization.
