# [InstaSynth: Opportunities and Challenges in Generating Synthetic   Instagram Data with ChatGPT for Sponsored Content Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15214)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) like chatGPT to generate synthetic Instagram captions for the task of sponsored content detection - identifying undisclosed advertisements on Instagram. Getting real data for this task is challenging due to limited API access and costly annotation. Synthetic data generation can help overcome these issues. The key research question is - how realistic and useful are the synthetic datasets produced by chatGPT for training models to detect sponsored Instagram posts?

Methodology 
The authors experiment with different prompt engineering strategies to generate synthetic Instagram captions, both sponsored and non-sponsored. They propose various metrics categorized into - caption composition, content-specific, embedding similarity and network metrics to evaluate the fidelity of synthetic captions by comparing them to real Instagram data. Additionally, they train logistic regression models on synthetic and real datasets to classify posts as sponsored/non-sponsored on two test sets, assessing the utility of synthetic data for the downstream task.

Key Observations
- Individual synthetic posts appear realistic but collectively lack diversity in content, topics, usernames and connectivity compared to real Instagram data
- Metrics like cosine similarity between embeddings can be misleading despite high values; closest matches to real captions are still other real posts 
- The goals of fidelity to real data and utility for downstream tasks are conflicting
- While synthetic data improves classification of disclosed ads, performance drops significantly for undisclosed ads
- Prompt engineering alone is insufficient to generate high-quality synthetic social media data

Main Contributions
- Comprehensive set of metrics and a rigorous methodology to evaluate the quality and utility of synthetic social media data 
- Analysis highlighting gaps in diversity and realism of synthetic Instagram captions
- Demonstrating limitations of existing LLMs in generating useful synthetic datasets for social media research
- Establishing the need for using post-processing methods in addition to prompt engineering to enhance diversity and connectivity

The paper makes important contributions toward assessing the promise and pitfalls of using synthetic data for computational social science research. The evaluation methodology and observations provide a strong foundation for future work on developing more robust techniques for synthetic data generation using LLMs.
