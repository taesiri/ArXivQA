# [OpenEval: Benchmarking Chinese LLMs across Capability, Alignment and   Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12316)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rapid development of Chinese large language models (LLMs) poses challenges for efficient evaluation. 
- Existing initiatives focus primarily on capabilities, overlooking alignment and safety issues.
- Traditional NLP benchmarks may not suit Chinese LLM evaluation due to limitations.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce OpenEval, a comprehensive testbed for benchmarking Chinese LLMs across capability, alignment and safety.
- Include 12 benchmark datasets for capability evaluation across 4 sub-dimensions: NLP tasks, disciplinary knowledge, commonsense reasoning and mathematical reasoning. 
- Contain 7 datasets for alignment assessment, examining bias, offensiveness and illegalness.
- Evaluate safety with 6 datasets, monitoring risks like power-seeking, self-awareness.
- Implement phased public evaluation and benchmark update strategy to ensure OpenEval stays current.

Main Contributions:
- Introduce OpenEval, a comprehensive evaluation platform with 35 benchmarks for Chinese LLMs covering capability, alignment and safety.
- Complete first public assessment of 14 Chinese LLMs, including open-source and proprietary models from 7B to 72B parameters.
- Provide performance landscape of current Chinese LLMs and suggestions for improvements regarding commonsense reasoning, alignment and safety.

In summary, the paper presents OpenEval, a much-needed comprehensive evaluation platform tailored for Chinese LLMs. It not only focuses on language capabilities but also alignment to human values and safety, ensuring responsible development of increasingly powerful models. A first evaluation of 14 LLMs offers insights into current strengths and weaknesses.
