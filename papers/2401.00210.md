# [The Problem of Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00210)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper examines the problem of "alignment" in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, which refers to coordinating their verbal behavior to align with human values and interests. This involves syntactic, semantic, and moral competencies. 

The authors approach this through a series of experiments prompting ChatGPT to edit excerpts from Joyce's Ulysses to conform to its rules, as well as analyzing emerging practices like "prompt engineering." They find ChatGPT anonymizes characters and progressively abstracts actions, reducing specificity, which reveals its underlying structuralist logic. 

They then historically situate debates on reconciling linguistic structure with statistical probabilities, revisiting postwar debates between discrete, structural models (Chomsky) and continuous probability distributions (cybernetics, information theory). The overlooked Moscow Linguistic School tried reconciling these, using statistics to study patterns revealing implicit linguistic structures. 

Later structural arguments by Searle, Chomsky and Kristeva also assume innate non-communicative functions of language separate from usage statistics. The authors suggest current LLM capabilities complicate assumptions about the primacy of a Cartesian human subject over language.

Overall, they argue alignment involves imposing normative structure onto a statistical model, cascading across syntactic, semantic and moral competencies. This reveals complex interrelations between language, technology and subjectivity. Contemporary alignment practices like prompt engineering also show this coordination between users and models. Revisiting past linguistic debates helps explain behaviors and interdependencies emerging in the accelerating human-machine dialogue with LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The paper examines the problem of aligning AI language models with human values and communication norms, revisiting historical linguistic debates that sought to reconcile structural and statistical views of language while also recognizing enduring critiques that insist on non-computational aspects of meaning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides an analysis of the problem of "alignment" in large language models (LLMs), examining how such models are trained and corrected to conform to human values and expectations. The authors frame alignment as an issue that spans syntactic/pragmatic competency, semantic competency, and deontological considerations.

2. Through experiments prompting ChatGPT to edit excerpts of Joyce's Ulysses, the authors demonstrate how alignment involves processes of abstraction, anonymization, and modulation of textual anomalies. This reveals underlying rules and logic in ChatGPT's operations.

3. The paper situates contemporary debates about LLMs and alignment within earlier 20th century linguistic traditions, especially the work of the Moscow Linguistic School in reconciling structural and statistical models of language. Attention to these traditions casts the problem of alignment as concerning the social structuration of linguistic practice.

4. Discussion of perspectives from Searle, Chomsky and Kristeva on the relationship between language, mind and subjectivity further enriches understanding of alignment in LLMs. The authors argue alignment problems should be understood in their variegated psychosocial complexity rather than as simplistic quantitative targets.

In summary, the paper makes a contribution by framing AI alignment as a complex techno-social issue rooted in longstanding debates about language, structure and communication, arguing for the continued relevance of perspectives from linguistic traditions like the Moscow School. The analysis of ChatGPT experiments and prompt engineering practices substantiates this conceptual argument.

- AI alignment
- structuralism 
- Moscow Linguistic School
- ChatGPT
- language models 
- linguistics
- probability
- communication theory
- semantics
- pragmatics
- prompt engineering

The paper discusses the problem of "alignment" in relation to large language models like ChatGPT - that is, how to coordinate their behavior with human values and expectations. It situates this in relation to longstanding debates in linguistics, communication theory, and AI about the relationship between underlying linguistic structures and surface statistical patterns in language use. Key figures and concepts discussed include the Moscow Linguistic School, structuralism, probability, prompt engineering, etc. The analysis explores experiments using ChatGPT to edit text, as well as the emerging practice of "prompt engineering." Overall, the paper tries to resituate contemporary issues around AI language models in light of these past theoretical discussions about language, mind and technology.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the paper situate the problem of alignment historically in relation to debates about structure and statistics in language? What key figures and schools of thought are reviewed to provide this background?

2. What was the significance of the Moscow Linguistic School's attempt to reconcile structural and statistical approaches to language? How did their program relate to technological imperatives around communication at the time?

3. What does the concept of "implicit structure" refer to in the context of the Moscow School's inquiries into linguistic probabilities? How did they see it relating to statistical patterns in language use?  

4. How do the authors experimentally probe the logic of normativity and anomaly in ChatGPT? What does this reveal about the system's approach to textual alignment?

5. What connections does the paper draw between practices of alignment in model training and user prompting? How does this situate alignment as an inter-relational framework?

6. How do the authors relate arguments by figures like Searle, Chomsky and Kristeva to contemporary debates about language models? Where do they see lines of continuity and critique?  

7. What does the paper's review of historical debates reveal about contemporary behavior and interdependencies between users and LLMs? How does this complicate the problem of alignment?

8. How does the paper critique existing notions of anomaly and deviation underpinning efforts to align LLMs? What alternative framing does it propose?

9. What does the paper argue the legacy of the Moscow School suggests in relation to interpreting and using powerful new LLMs?

10. How does the paper characterize the problem of alignment in relation to subjectivity, according to different theories of language and mind? What directions does this open up?
