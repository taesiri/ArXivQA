# [MVD$^2$: Efficient Multiview 3D Reconstruction for Multiview Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14253)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multiview diffusion (MVD) models generate 3D shapes by first generating multiple view images of an object from text or image prompts, and then reconstructing the 3D shape from these images. 
- However, the generated multiview images are often sparse, inconsistent in details across views, and have domain gap from real images.
- Existing multiview 3D reconstruction methods like NeuS struggle with such images, leading to low-quality 3D geometry.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MVD, an efficient neural network to reconstruct high-quality 3D shapes from MVD images.
- MVD aggregates image features into a 3D volume, and decodes the volume into a mesh using FlexiCubes.

Key Ideas:
- Identify unique challenges of sparsity and inconsistency in MVD images.
- Design a lightweight network robust to varying view configurations. 
- Propose a view-dependent training scheme that enforces shape similarity only for views close to the input view.

Main Contributions:
- Significantly improve quality and efficiency of 3D reconstruction from MVD images.
- Complement a wide range of MVD methods with better downstream 3D generation.
- Careful ablation studies to validate key ideas like view-dependent loss.
- Extensive experimentation showing generalizability to varying MVD methods and inputs.

In summary, the paper addresses an important problem in making multiview diffusion viable for 3D generation, by designing an efficient neural reconstruction approach tailored for MVD images. The core novelty lies in the view-dependent training strategy.
