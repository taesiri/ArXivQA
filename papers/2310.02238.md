# [Who's Harry Potter? Approximate Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02238)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that often contain problematic content like copyrighted text. This poses legal and ethical issues for LLM developers and users.
- Retraining LLMs from scratch without the problematic data is infeasible due to the enormous compute resources required. 
- There is a need for techniques to selectively "unlearn" subsets of an LLM's training data post-training.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a novel approximate unlearning technique to erase specific training data from an LLM without full retraining.

- The technique has 3 main components:
   1. Use a reinforced model to identify tokens most related to the target data. 
   2. Replace idiosyncratic expressions in the target data with generic versions and generate alternative token labels using the baseline LLM's own predictions.
   3. Finetune the LLM on the alternative labels to effectively erase the original text from the LLM's memory.

- The method is applied to unlearn the Harry Potter books from the Llama2-7b LLM while retaining performance on NLP benchmarks.

Key Contributions:
- First paper to demonstrate an effective unlearning technique for generative language models.
- Shows it's possible to make an LLM "forget" intricate details about the Harry Potter books with minimal compute compared to full retraining. 
- Performance on NLP benchmarks stays largely unaffected after unlearning.
- Establishes approximate unlearning as a promising first step towards more adaptable, responsible, and legally compliant LLMs.
- Technique may have limitations with certain types of content but provides a foundation for future research.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel 3-step approach to approximately unlearn subsets of problematic training data from large language models post-training, while retaining broad capabilities. This is demonstrated via erasing intricate knowledge of Harry Potter plots from an LLM. The method serves as an initial step towards developing more adaptable LLMs aligned with ethical, legal and user-defined constraints.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel technique to selectively unlearn parts of a language model's training data without full retraining, and shows its effectiveness at erasing a model's knowledge of the Harry Potter books while preserving performance on common benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a novel technique for selectively "unlearning" parts of the training data of large language models (LLMs) without having to completely retrain them from scratch. Specifically, the authors demonstrate a proof-of-concept by unlearning the Harry Potter book series from the Llama2-7b model, while preserving its performance on common benchmarks. The key contributions are:

1) Introducing an effective approximate unlearning technique for large generative language models consisting of: 

- Using a reinforced model to help identify tokens most related to the unlearning target 
- Replacing idiosyncratic expressions with generic counterparts 
- Generating alternative token labels to approximate predictions of a model without the target data
- Finetuning the model on these alternative labels

2) Empirically showing that this technique can effectively "erase" an LLM's ability to generate or recall details about the Harry Potter series with minimal impact on performance on NLP benchmarks.

3) Discussing the potential of such approximate unlearning techniques to address legal, ethical and technical issues with LLMs in the future by selectively removing problematic training data without prohibitively expensive retraining.

So in summary, the main contribution is presenting and demonstrating the first effective approach for approximate unlearning in large generative language models.

The paper proposes a novel technique for approximately unlearning specific subsets of training data, like the Harry Potter books, from large language models without needing to retrain them from scratch. It evaluates this technique on the Llama2-7b model and shows it can effectively "forget" detailed knowledge of the Harry Potter series while retaining performance on other benchmarks. Key aspects include using a reinforced model, anchored terms with generic translations, and combining logits to generate alternative "generic" predictions to fine-tune the model. The evaluation methodology relies on familiarity scores based on completions and token probabilities to assess retaining or forgetting of knowledge.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using GPT-4 to generate a dictionary of "anchored terms" and their generic translations. What are some alternative ways to generate this dictionary without relying on a model's existing knowledge of the content?

2. How might the technique be adapted to handle non-fiction content or more abstract concepts that do not have obvious "anchored terms"? What modifications would be needed?

3. The reinforcement bootstrapping technique computes generic predictions by comparing the logits of a baseline and reinforced model. What are some potential issues with relying solely on this approach? How might it be made more robust? 

4. What types of inconsistencies might arise when replacing anchored terms with generic translations within passages of text? How does the method aim to mitigate these?

5. Could adversarial attacks be used to more rigorously evaluate if familiarity with the unlearned content has been erased? What kinds of attacks might reveal cracks?  

6. How might the technique scale to unlearning much larger subsets from an LLM or forgetting multiple disjoint subsets? Would the approach still be feasible?

7. The paper argues the technique causes minimal impairment on standard benchmarks. But could more subtle declines be measured via precision tasks? What kind of analysis could reveal these?

8. What underlying architectural properties of LLMs make selective unlearning inherently challenging? How might models be designed differently to enable more targeted forgetting?  

9. The method relies on fine-tuning for a very short duration. Does this leave open the possibility of relapse where forgotten knowledge slowly seeps back? How could this be safeguarded against?

10. How might the techniques introduced in this paper be combined with existing machine unlearning algorithms to create a hybrid approach tailored to LLMs? What would be the tradeoffs?
