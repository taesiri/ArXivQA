# [Video Summarization: Towards Entity-Aware Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02188)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing video captioning models generate generic captions devoid of named entities like people, places, organizations. This is not informative enough for news videos which require entity-aware captions. 
- Current news video captioning datasets are small-scale and captions are not well-aligned. Models relying on paired articles are not practical.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces VIEWS, a large-scale news video captioning dataset with 144K samples. Captions are highly precise and aligned with video content.
- Proposes a novel approach to generate entity-aware captions directly from video using detected entities and retrieved knowledge.
- Trains an Entity Perceiver (EP) module to recognize named entities from video frames. 
- Uses a knowledge retriever module to obtain relevant news articles using the detected entities.
- Integrates video, entities and knowledge as context to state-of-the-art captioning models like GIT and BLIP-2 to generate informative captions.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates a new task of directly generating entity-aware captions from news videos.
- Constructs VIEWS, the largest video captioning dataset in news domain with precise captions.
- Proposes a complete pipeline to leverage external knowledge and generate informative captions using entity perception and knowledge retrieval modules.
- Provides extensive experiments and ablation studies analyzing the impact of entities and knowledge on captioning.
- Demonstrates improved performance of captioning models on VIEWS and other datasets when augmented with contextual knowledge.

In summary, this paper pioneer research in entity-aware news video captioning by proposing a novel dataset, task and approach. The introduction of an external knowledge retriever in captioning pipeline is a key novelty.
