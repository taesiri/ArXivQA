# [Learning Unified Decompositional and Compositional NeRF for Editable   Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02840)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the main research question this paper addresses is how to perform joint scene novel view synthesis and editing based on implicit neural scene representations. The key challenges are:- Most prior works on implicit neural scene representations (like NeRF) focus only on novel view synthesis for the entire scene, but lack the ability to represent and edit individual objects within the scene.- Some recent works have started exploring object-level scene representations, but they typically build separate networks for view synthesis and editing. This limits modeling interactions and correlations between these two tasks, which is critical for learning high-quality scene representations.To address these challenges, the main hypothesis of this work is:By proposing a unified neural radiance field framework to effectively perform joint scene decomposition and composition, it can achieve both high-quality novel view synthesis and enable scene editing capabilities in an end-to-end manner.The key ideas are:- Learn to decompose the scene into object-level and background radiance fields to enable editing.- Learn to compose them back into an entire scene radiance field for novel view synthesis.- Unify decomposition and composition in a joint framework to model interactions between global scene and local object representations.In summary, the main novelty is in the joint decomposition-composition design within a unified NeRF framework to achieve the dual goals of high-quality novel view synthesis and scene editing.

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a unified neural radiance field framework for joint scene decomposition and composition to learn disentangled 3D object representations and an entire scene representation, enabling high-quality novel view synthesis and editing in a unified pipeline.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper proposes a novel unified neural radiance field (NeRF) framework that performs joint scene decomposition and composition for editable novel view synthesis. Most prior work has focused on either novel view synthesis or scene editing separately. Jointly addressing both tasks in a unified framework is relatively new. - For novel view synthesis, this method builds on NeRF and its extensions like ObjectNeRF. The key difference is the proposed decomposition-composition design that models both global scene consistency and local object details. This is shown to improve synthesis quality over ObjectNeRF.- For scene editing, this method allows manipulating individual objects in the scene by re-composing their decomposed radiance fields. This enables applications like object removal, insertion, and rearrangement. In contrast, NeRF models the scene implicitly as a whole without object-level editing capability.- Compared to other object-based scene representations like ObjectSDF, this method uses a radiance field rather than signed distance functions. Radiance fields have shown advantages for novel view synthesis. The proposed framework complements radiance field's synthesis strength with decomposition for editing.- For decomposition, the proposed one-hot density regularization and inpainting pseudo-supervision are new techniques to improve learning disentangled object radiance fields, especially for ambiguous background areas. This leads to better editing quality.- Overall, the key novelty is the joint decomposition-composition design within a unified NeRF framework. This harmonizes the synergistic connection between synthesis and editing tasks for modeling complex real scenes. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.In summary, this work presents important innovations in jointly addressing scene synthesis and editing compared to prior research focused on either task separately. The unified framework and new decomposition-composition techniques demonstrate improved performance and capabilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Extending the framework to model dynamic scenes with object and camera motion. The current method focuses on modeling static scenes. Modeling dynamic scenes would require extending the framework to handle motion and occlusion relationships between objects over time.- Incorporating more complex material and lighting representations beyond the current diffuse model. For example, modeling specular materials and complex lighting would allow rendering more photorealistic novel views.- Exploring unsupervised or self-supervised training methods to avoid the need for detailed semantic supervision. The current method relies on semantic masks for supervision. Developing methods that can learn without detailed segmentation masks could enable broader application.- Generalizing the framework to outdoor scenes. The experiments are demonstrated on indoor scenes. Applying the method to more complex outdoor environments with lighting variation, terrain, and vegetation would be an important direction.- Integrating the compositional scene representation with other vision tasks like segmentation, tracking, etc. Leveraging the learned compositional scene model could benefit other higher-level scene understanding tasks. - Improving run-time efficiency for rendering. Current neural rendering methods are computationally heavy. Optimizing the efficiency of network inference and volume rendering could make the approach more practical.In summary, the key future directions involve extending the compositional modeling to dynamic scenes, more complex materials/lighting, less supervision, outdoor environments, integration with other vision tasks, and improving run-time rendering efficiency. Advances in these areas could help transition the technology from research to practical applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a unified Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) framework to perform joint scene decomposition and composition for modeling real-world scenes. The key idea is to learn disentangled 3D representations of different objects and background to enable both scene editing and novel view synthesis in a single framework. The method has two stages - a coarse stage to predict a global radiance field for sampling guidance, and a fine-grained stage for decomposition and composition. For decomposition, the framework predicts distinct object radiance fields using learnable codes and employs two novel strategies - a 3D one-hot density regularization and 2D inpainting pseudo-supervision for the background. For composition, it uses a Gumbel-Softmax activation to combine object radiance fields into an entire scene field. Extensive experiments demonstrate the approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both novel view synthesis and editing tasks. The joint modeling of decomposition and composition allows capturing both global scene consistency and local object details for high-quality scene representation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:The paper proposes a unified Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) framework for joint scene novel view synthesis and editing based on implicit neural scene representations. The key idea is to perform joint scene decomposition and composition within a single NeRF model. The decomposition aims to learn disentangled 3D representations of different objects and background, enabling scene editing. The composition models the entire scene for novel view synthesis. A two-stage NeRF is presented. The coarse stage predicts a global guidance radiance field. The fine stage performs decomposition and composition. For decomposition, object code conditions predict distinct object radiance fields. A novel 3D one-hot density regularization enforces one active object per point. 2D inpainting provides pseudo-supervision for occluded areas. Composition uses activations from decomposition for object radiance fields. Extensive experiments validate the joint framework, showing improved performance on both novel view synthesis and editing tasks compared to prior work. The unified modeling of decomposition and composition is critical for learning effective scene representations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a unified Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) framework for joint scene decomposition and composition to learn object-level and scene-level implicit representations for effective scene modeling and editing. The method has two main stages - a coarse stage that predicts a global radiance field for guidance, and a fine stage that performs decomposition and composition. For decomposition, the method predicts distinct radiance fields for each object and background using learnable object codes. It uses a Gumbel-Softmax activation on volume densities for one-hot object radiance activation and regularization. It also uses 2D inpainting pseudo-supervision to handle ambiguity in occluded regions. For composition, it combines the object radiance fields using the one-hot activation weights from decomposition. This joint decomposition and composition approach allows for both high-quality novel view synthesis from the composed scene radiance field as well as editing by manipulating the decomposed object radiance fields.
