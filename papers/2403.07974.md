## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Evaluating and comparing large language models (LLMs) for code has become an important challenge, but existing benchmarks like HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS suffer from issues like contamination, lack of diversity, and overfitting. Specifically, these benchmarks focus solely on natural language to code generation and may already be present in LLM training datasets, leading to inflated scores. Additionally, code generation is just one facet of programming ability.

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces LiveCodeBench, a comprehensive, contamination-free benchmark for evaluating LLMs on coding tasks. Key aspects are:

1) Uses live updates of problems from platforms like LeetCode, AtCoder to prevent contamination. Assigns contest release dates and evaluates models on unseen problems. 

2) Evaluates on broader tasks beyond code generation including - self-repair from errors, code execution, test case output prediction to capture different programming capabilities.

3) Sources high-quality problems from reputable competition platforms validated by users. Provides many test cases (>59 on average) for robust evaluation.

4) Ensures balanced distribution over easy, medium, hard problems unlike existing benchmarks focusing solely on easier tasks. Enables more granular comparisons.


Currently, LiveCodeBench contains 400 coding problems published between May 2023 and Feb 2024. Models spanning different scales and 9 base + 20 instruction-tuned models are evaluated.


Key Findings:

1) Detected contamination in DeepSeeks models based on performance drop over time.

2) Relative model order is consistent but performance differences vary across scenarios highlighting need for holistic evaluation.

3) Many models might overfit on HumanEval while generalizing poorly to LiveCodeBench.

4) DeepSeeks models outperform CodeLlamas and StarCoders across base model comparisons. Instruction tuning is crucial for better performance.  

5) Closed models still outperform open models in most cases. Only some large 30B+ instruction-tuned models can match them in performance.


In summary, LiveCodeBench is uniquely designed to enable thorough and fair evaluations of coding LLMs using continuous problem updates and expanded programming scenarios. The benchmark reveals novel findings on benchmark contamination, generalization, model capacities missed by existing setups.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes LiveCodeBench, a continuously updated benchmark for evaluating language models on coding tasks that mitigates contamination through live problem collection and provides holistic assessment through additional scenarios like self-repair, code execution, and test output prediction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing LiveCodeBench, a new benchmark for evaluating large language models on their capabilities for code. Key aspects of LiveCodeBench include:

- It uses live updates of coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, AtCoder, and Codeforces to avoid potential data contamination issues where the models may have already seen problems in their training data. Problems are tagged with release dates to allow evaluating models on new problems after their training cutoff dates.

- It evaluates models more holistically on multiple code-related capabilities beyond just code generation, including self-repair, code execution, and test case output prediction. This provides a broader assessment of coding skills.

- It sources problems from reputable coding platforms that have existing quality validation through participant testing and ratings for balanced difficulty levels. This helps benchmark reliability and meaningful comparisons.

- It allows detecting contamination in models like DeepSeeker which showed significantly reduced performance on newer LeetCode problems, indicating it likely trained on older problems. 

- It reveals findings not shown in prior benchmarks, like overfitting in some Humaneval models and also clearly highlighting the gap between state-of-the-art commercial models versus publicly available models.

So in summary, LiveCodeBench contributes a new contamination-free, holistic benchmark for more reliable and insightful evaluations of ever-advancing LLMs on programming tasks over time.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- LiveCodeBench - The proposed benchmark for evaluating large language models on code capabilities. It is continuously updated, focuses on multiple coding-related scenarios beyond just code generation, and avoids data contamination issues.

- Contamination - The risk that benchmark problems are included in the training data for language models, resulting in misleadingly high performance. The paper detects contamination in DeepSeek models.

- Holistic evaluation - Evaluating language models on multiple facets of coding including code generation, self-repair, code execution, and test case output prediction. 

- Overfitting - Models performing much better on HumanEval than on LiveCodeBench, indicating potential overfitting on the benchmark rather than general coding ability.

- Competition programming - Problems are sourced from LeetCode, AtCoder and Codeforces competition platforms. Ensures high quality and difficulty.

- Instruction tuning - Fine-tuning language models on additional datasets to improve performance on downstream tasks like coding. Models like Phind and WizardCoder use this.

- Open vs closed models - Comparing publicly available models vs private access models like GPT, Claude and Gemini. Closed models generally outperform.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper "LiveCodeBench: Holistic and Contamination Free Evaluation of Large Language Models for Code":

1. The paper mentions using a "live update" approach to avoid benchmark contamination. Can you elaborate more on the mechanisms used to ensure problems are added only after a model's cutoff date? How is this enforced technically?

2. One of the principles outlined is using high-quality problems and tests. What specific quality assurance steps or checks are performed on newly added problems? Are there any automated tools used or is it mostly manual verification?  

3. For the test case generation approach outlined in Section 3.1, can you explain more about how the few-shot prompting works? What templates or examples are provided to the LLMs to generate quality test case generators?

4. How extensive was the filtering process outlined in Appendix C to construct the code execution benchmark split? What are some examples of criteria that led to filtering out certain problems?

5. The paper evaluates performance over different time windows to detect contamination. Was any statistical analysis done to quantify uncertainty bands on the reported metrics to account for variations due to sample size?

6. For the code execution scenario, what modifications were made specifically to the prompts from CRUXEval to fit the format of samples in LiveCodeBench? Can you provide some examples?

7. One of the principles outlined is balanced problem difficulty. How is this achieved technically during curation from the different platforms? Are any automated tools used?

8. What additional scenarios were considered during the design process of LiveCodeBench but were eventually excluded? What were the reasons for exclusion?

9. The correlation analysis reveals high correlation between related tasks. Is there any plan to reduce high correlation between scenarios by improving diversity during benchmark curation? 

10. Qualitatively comparing human-written and LLM generated code can reveal insights about strengths/weaknesses. Was any such qualitative analysis performed, especially for top performers like GPT-4-turbo?
