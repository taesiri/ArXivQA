## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we develop a computational long exposure mobile photography system that can produce high quality long exposure foreground or background blur effects fully automatically on smartphones?

In particular, the paper focuses on designing a system that can:

- Capture long exposure effects like silky water or light trails over a sharp background (foreground blur) or a sharp subject over a blurred background (background blur)

The paper describes a computational photography system implemented on a smartphone camera that can automatically produce aesthetically pleasing long exposure photographs with foreground or background blur effects using image burst capture, subject detection and tracking, image alignment, motion prediction, and compositing techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a computational long exposure photography system for smartphone cameras. Here are some key ways it compares to related work in computational photography:

- It presents a full end-to-end system implemented in a smartphone camera app, capable of producing both foreground and background blur long exposure effects automatically. This differentiates it from prior work on computational long exposure photography that focused on offline processing or required extensive user guidance. 

- For background blur, it detects and segments the main subject automatically using a combination of gaze saliency prediction and face detection. This avoids the need for manual foreground tagging or heuristics used in other methods. The subject tracking also considers temporal smoothness in a novel way.

- For foreground blur, it achieves robust stabilization using an efficient spatially-varying image warp guided by feature tracks. This provides a good tradeoff between speed and handling complex stabilization effects compared to prior techniques.

- It uses a motion blur synthesis approach based on predicting smooth motion paths using splines. This produces more photorealistic and temporally consistent blur trails compared to simple averaging or optical flow warping used previously.

- The system architecture and model design balances quality and efficiency to run the full pipeline on a smartphone in a few seconds. This includes innovations like a soft-gamma rendering space and distilled/mobile-optimized networks.

Overall, the end-to-end integration and automatic operation represent a significant advance in making long exposure effects practical for casual users. The computational techniques also improve upon prior work to achieve better quality and efficiency tradeoffs. By bringing these capabilities to consumer devices, this system delivers creative photographic styles in an accessible way not possible before.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Improving subject detection for very small subjects in background blur images. They note issues with mispredictions from the saliency and portrait masks, as well as tracking errors, that can lead to incorrect alignment and sharpness. Refining the predictions using higher resolution inputs could help. 

- Handling larger motion disparities between frames. Their motion prediction model has a limited receptive field that caps motion disparity handling. Increasing the model capacity could extend this range.

- Better handling of motion silhouettes and disocclusions when foreground and background are moving perpendicularly/oppositely. The current model can produce swirly artifacts in these cases. The authors state resolving these challenging cases is left to future work.

- Exploring the use of semantic segmentation to isolate different moving objects, not just foreground vs. background. This could allow for more creative isolation and blurring of different scene elements.

- Experimenting with machine learning approaches to aesthetically guide the image alignments, instead of using hand-designed constraints. 

- Extending the method to video input, to achieve temporally coherent long exposure effects.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the robustness of subject detection, expanding the motion handling range, aesthetically handling complex motions and disocclusions better, using more advanced segmentation, and applying machine learning for aesthetic alignment and coherence over time in video.

 Here are two short paragraphs summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a computational long exposure photography system implemented in a smartphone camera application. The system produces aesthetically pleasing long exposure effects such as foreground or background blur fully automatically at the tap of the shutter button. Key components of the system include burst frame selection and alignment to stabilize desired image regions, motion prediction models to synthesize smooth motion blur, and compositing to preserve sharpness. Both conventional and long exposure photographs are generated within a few seconds. This democratizes creative photographic techniques that previously required additional equipment, skills and effort. 

The system detects salient subjects using gaze prediction and face detection, then tracks their motion across frames. Input images are aligned to cancel hand-shake or track the subject, enabling sharp foreground or background as desired. Inter-frame motions are predicted using efficient neural network models to render smooth motion blur trails. A compositing stage layers the synthetic blur with a sharp base frame, protecting facial details. The system is integrated into a smartphone camera application, accessible to casual photographers. It expands creative possibilities in mobile photography that were previously difficult to achieve.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a computational long exposure mobile photography pipeline that operates in a smartphone camera app. The key methodologies are:

- The system captures a burst of underexposed frames and selects a subset to process based on estimated motion blur length. This allows producing blur trails of consistent length regardless of scene motion speed. 

- For foreground blur, the background is stabilized to remain sharp by estimating a mesh warp that accounts for parallax and local motions. For background blur, the subject is tracked and image alignment keeps it sharp while blurring the background.

- A neural network predicts dense motion kernels, which are used by a GPU renderer to synthesize smooth motion blur across multiple aligned input frames. 

- Important regions like faces are kept sharp through compositing the motion blurred result with the regular exposure photograph.

Overall, the system integrates real-time neural networks, optimization-based alignment, and efficient GPU rendering to produce aesthetically pleasing long exposure images fully automatically in a mobile photography pipeline.
