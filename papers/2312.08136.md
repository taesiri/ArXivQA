# [ProNeRF: Learning Efficient Projection-Aware Ray Sampling for   Fine-Grained Implicit Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08136)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes EpiNeRF, a new neural rendering approach that incorporates an epipolar-encoded sampling network (EpiSampler) and an exploration-exploitation training strategy to achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of rendering speed, quality, and model compactness. The key idea is to leverage epipolar geometry to guide the sampling network to focus on the most important regions along each ray for efficient volumetric rendering. Specifically, the EpiSampler extracts features along epipolar lines between the sampling points and neighboring camera centers, enabling refined distance and density predictions. The training alternates between having the MLP network explore the full scene distribution, and exploiting the refined samples from EpiSampler. This allows end-to-end optimization. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that EpiNeRF with only 12 samples per ray outperforms NeRF in terms of PSNR and LPIPS, while being over 12x faster. The compact representation also matches NeRF's memory footprint. Overall, this work pushes the frontier of fast, high-quality neural rendering via intelligent sampling guided by multi-view epipolar geometry.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ProNeRF, a novel neural rendering method with a residual epipolar encoding sampler network and an exploration-exploitation training strategy that achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and quality by producing detailed novel views with just a few samples per ray.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A fast and efficient sampler network called EpiSampler that exploits epipolar line information to provide accurate and refined 3D sampling points to the downstream NeRF network. This allows fast rendering with only a few samples per ray.

2. A training strategy based on exploration and exploitation that allows the NeRF network to explore the full color and density distributions of the scene, while the EpiSampler focuses on regions with highest densities. 

3. Overall, the proposed EpiNeRF method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of rendering quality and speed. Specifically, it yields higher PSNR and SSIM than NeRF, while being 12-20x faster in inference. It also surpasses previous sampler-based methods by large margins.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel sampler network with epipolar encoding and a complementary training strategy that enables fast yet high-quality neural rendering that outperforms NeRF for the first time among sampler-based methods.
