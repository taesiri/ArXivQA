# [Can LLMs Compute with Reasons?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12080)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex mathematical reasoning tasks and are prone to "hallucinating" incorrect answers due to reliance on statistical patterns rather than logic. This limitation is amplified in smaller models with less context and training data.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes an "Inductive Learning" approach using a distributed network of small language model (SLM) pairs. Each pair consists of a general purpose (GP) SLM focused on logical reasoning and an equation (EQ) SLM focused on numerical computations.

- The SLMs perform independent computations in parallel. If their outputs differ, they provide contextual hints to each other to refine reasoning. This error-based learning aims to improve logical gaps.

- A cross-inference mechanism matches outputs across SLM pairs to identify the most probable correct solution. This boosts accuracy beyond conventional distributed architectures.

Contributions:
- A novel framework to enhance reasoning capabilities of SLMs towards the level achieved by high-parameter models, with potential to benefit any language model.

- Demonstrates 17.3% average improvement in GP model performance over baseline. Combined improvement of 25.29% using the full topology.

- Competitive performance increase compared to related works TinyGSM and Phi 1.5 model. Showcases effectiveness of distributed learning approach.  

- Logic improvement in GP models evident through contextual dialogue examples. Sets path for future work on reinforcement learning to further tune logical capabilities.

- Overall, provides a promising direction to bridge the logical gap between humans and language models across different domains.
