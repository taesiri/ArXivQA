## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SynthScribe: Deep Multimodal Tools for Synthesizer Sound Retrieval and Exploration":

Problem:
- Using synthesizers requires managing many complex, unintuitive parameters to create sounds. This is difficult for novice users. 
- Finding desirable preset sounds in large preset libraries is tedious.
- Modifying preset sounds to users' needs is challenging without expertise. 
- Creating original, creative sounds is important but difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- SynthScribe system with three main features using multimodal deep learning without needing new model training or user annotations:

1. Multimodal search engine - Users can search through preset sounds using text or audio queries to find desirable sounds.

2. User-centered genetic algorithm - Creates new sounds by mixing parameters of user's favorite preset sounds. Users can search through these new sounds. 

3. Sound editing support - Suggests examples of modifications to a sound based on text/audio query. Highlights key parameters to change to achieve desired effect.

Main Contributions:
- Novel system enabling intuitive control of synthesizers with text and audio. 
- User study evaluation showing system can reliably retrieve and modify existing synthesizer sounds.
- Free usage observations showing system helps musicians of varying skill levels, saves time, and inspires creativity.

The system facilitates synthesizer use by helping users search presets, create surprising new sounds, and make meaningful modifications without needing musical expertise. The multimodal deep learning foundation connects text and audio for an intuitive control modality.
