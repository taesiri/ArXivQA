# [Stochastic Two Points Method for Deep Model Zeroth-order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01621)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large foundation models like large language models (LLMs) have shown great performance but fully fine-tuning them is often infeasible due to compute/memory constraints. 
- Zeroth-order methods that rely only on function evaluations to update models are promising but existing analyses focus on general smoothness assumptions that limit applicability.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes Stochastic Two-Point (S2P) method that improves over prior zeroth-order approaches by removing a redundant function evaluation.
- Provides theoretical analysis of S2P convergence under both general and relaxed smoothness assumptions.
- Based on new convergence properties, proposes Accelerated S2P (AS2P) variant that exploits relation between step size, gradient norm, and hessian captured by the standard deviation of the stochastic metric γ.
- Key ideas in AS2P: Progressive γ-clipping to mimic optimal step size relation and automatic learning rate based on statistics of γ.

Main Contributions:
- Analyzes S2P method under both general and relaxed smoothness assumptions, with query complexity bounds.
- New convergence properties shed light on faster AS2P variant that captures gradient and curvature information through statistics of the stochastic metric γ.   
- Comprehensive experiments including LLM fine-tuning show AS2P significantly outperforms prior zeroth-order approaches, with ~2x speedup across tasks.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient stochastic two-point zeroth-order optimization method, analyzes its properties, and uses the analysis to develop an accelerated variant that shows strong empirical performance in optimizing objectives for large deep models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces an efficient Stochastic Two-Point optimization method for deep models called AS2P that exploits new convergence properties under relaxed smoothness assumptions and incorporates statistical information about the objective function to accelerate training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the field of zeroth-order optimization for large deep models:

1) It proposes a new zeroth-order optimization method called Stochastic Two-Point (S2P) search, which eliminates the need for an extra forward pass compared to methods like Stochastic Three Points (STP). This saves computation when optimizing large models.

2) It provides theoretical convergence analyses for S2P under both general smoothness assumptions and relaxed smoothness assumptions. This sheds light on the behavior of S2P for optimizing objectives arising from deep models. 

3) Based on the theoretical analyses, the paper proposes an accelerated variant called Accelerated S2P (AS2P) which incorporates findings about capturing statistical information from the objective function to accelerate training.

4) Extensive experiments on large models like ResNets and language models demonstrate that AS2P significantly outperforms competing zeroth-order methods, requiring only ~0.5x the training cost to reach the same loss values.

In summary, the main contributions are introducing S2P, providing convergence guarantees, using theory to develop AS2P, and empirically showing strong performance of AS2P for zeroth-order optimization of large deep models.

The paper proposes a new zeroth-order optimization method called Stochastic Two-Point (S2P) and its faster variant Accelerated S2P (AS2P). It analyzes the convergence properties of S2P under general and relaxed smoothness assumptions. The relaxed smoothness assumption is more realistic for objectives arising from large deep models like language models. The paper shows that S2P and AS2P can reach an ε-first order stationary point with O(d/ε2) query complexity. Extensive experiments on large deep models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AS2P method over existing approaches. Key ideas include progressive λ-clipping to mimic variable step sizes and automatically learning step sizes by exploiting statistics of the γ values from function evaluations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Stochastic Two-Point (S2P) approach for zeroth-order optimization of deep models. How does S2P differ from existing zeroth-order methods like Gaussian smoothing and Stochastic Three Points? What are the key innovations?

2. The paper analyzes the convergence properties of S2P under both general smoothness and relaxed smoothness assumptions. Can you explain the difference between these assumptions and why the relaxed smoothness is more suitable for deep models? 

3. The paper shows that S2P achieves a query complexity of O(d/ε^2) to find an ε-first order stationary point under both smoothness assumptions. Can you walk through the key steps in the convergence proofs? Where do the assumptions play a role?

4. Based on the convergence analysis, the paper proposes an Accelerated S2P method. Can you explain the two key improvements in AS2P - progressive γ-clipping and automatic learning rate? How are these motivated by the theory?

5. The automatic learning rate formula has an interesting connection to clipped gradient methods. Can you explain this connection? Why does clipping the learning rate based on Std Dev(γ) make sense?

6. For AS2P, the paper introduces parameters like ηa, ηb and decay strategies for τ. What is the intuition behind these settings? How should one select these parameters in practice? 

7. The experiments show significant gains for AS2P over baselines. Can you analyze the results and explain which components of AS2P contribute to the speedups? Are the gains consistent across tasks?

8. The method is analyzed in the non-convex setting. Do you think the approach can be extended for convex or strongly convex objectives? What changes would be needed in the analysis?

9. The convergence rate has a dependence on the dimension d. For very high dimensional problems, the method may not be feasible. Are there ways to improve the dependence on d? 

10. For practical use in tuning large models, are there any limitations of the S2P/AS2P approach? How can the method be made more usable in real applications?
