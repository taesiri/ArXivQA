# [ArabicMMLU: Assessing Massive Multitask Language Understanding in Arabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12840)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating reasoning and knowledge capabilities of Arabic language models (LLMs) is challenging due to limited availability of relevant datasets tailored to Arabic contexts. Most evaluations rely on datasets translated from English, which introduces errors and biases.
- Comprehensive assessment of Arabic LLMs requires datasets that capture local norms and culture across North Africa, Levant, and Gulf regions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces ArabicMMLU, the first large-scale multi-task language understanding benchmark for Arabic sourced from school exams across 8 countries.
- The dataset has 14,575 multiple choice questions covering 40 tasks and various subjects across primary, middle, high school and university levels. Over 50% of questions have Arabic-specific content.

Key Contributions:
- ArabicMMLU enables localized evaluation of Arabic LLMs spanning different education levels and subjects. Questions tailored to Arabic culture test real-world knowledge.
- Extensive experiments conducted with 35 models including multilingual, Arabic-centric and GPT models in zero-shot and few-shot settings.
- GPT-4 achieved the best performance (72.5%) but top open-source models struggled to exceed 60% accuracy, showing need for better Arabic LLMs.
- Detailed analysis provided for top models on individual subjects, education levels, by country, few-shot learning, model confidence and effect of negation.

In summary, the paper presents ArabicMMLU, the first large-scale Arabic benchmark for assessing language understanding, providing localized testing of Arabic LLM knowledge grounded in regional contexts. Experiments show open-source Arabic LLMs still lack sufficient real-world reasoning skills.
