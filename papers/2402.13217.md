# [VideoPrism: A Foundational Visual Encoder for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13217)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing video foundation models (ViFMs) often struggle to balance performance across appearance-heavy tasks and motion-centric reasoning, falling short compared to specialized models on many benchmarks. There is a need for a general-purpose video encoder that can achieve state-of-the-art results across a diverse range of video understanding tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces VideoPrism, a ViFM designed to excel on both appearance and motion-focused tasks using a single frozen model. The key ideas are:

(1) Assemble a large-scale pretraining corpus with 36M high-quality video-caption pairs and 582M video clips with noisy text like ASR transcripts. This combines manually labeled data with automated approaches to scale.  

(2) Conduct two-stage pretraining: (i) Contrastively train a video encoder and text encoder. (ii) Continue training only the video encoder using masked modeling with two innovations - global-local distillation to retain semantics from stage 1, and token shuffling to avoid shortcuts.

(3) Comprehensively evaluate VideoPrism across 33 diverse benchmarks spanning four categories - video-only tasks, video-text retrieval, captioning/QA, and scientific video analysis.

Main Contributions:

- VideoPrism sets new state-of-the-art on 30 out of 33 benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior ViFMs. It excels on both appearance and motion, unlike other models specialized on one.

- A scalable strategy to collect pretraining data combining high-quality captions and large-scale noisy video-text pairs.

- A unique two-stage pretraining approach tailored for this hybrid data, ensuring VideoPrism focuses on video while benefiting from associated text.

- State-of-the-art results on scientific video analysis tasks, demonstrating potential to accelerate research.

In summary, VideoPrism is an impactful general-purpose video encoder achieving excellent performance across an extensive set of video understanding benchmarks using a single frozen model.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces VideoPrism, a general-purpose video encoder pretrained on 36M high-quality video-caption pairs and 582M video clips with noisy text that achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of video understanding tasks by producing video representations from a single frozen model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing VideoPrism, a general-purpose video encoder that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of video understanding tasks using a single frozen model. 

2. Advocating for a scalable strategy to collect pretraining data by combining high-quality manually captioned videos with videos containing noisy textual descriptions from sources like ASR and captions generated by models.

3. Designing a two-stage pretraining approach tailored for this hybrid video-text data. The first stage performs video-text contrastive learning to acquire semantics. The second stage continues training on video-only data using masked video modeling with improvements like global-local distillation and token shuffling.
