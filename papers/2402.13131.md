## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents exploreCOSMOS, an interactive web-based application for exploring conditional statistical shape models (SSMs). SSMs are mathematical representations used to analyze the variability in shapes, like faces or body parts, in a dataset. They have applications in medical imaging, computer graphics, and computer vision. However, existing SSM tools target experts, limiting accessibility. 

The exploreCOSMOS application enables convenient SSM exploration in a web browser without needing to install anything. Users can upload SSMs in the Statismo file format or use a provided face model. The interface displays a 3D mesh visualization of the SSM's mean shape. Users can interactively generate random variations of the shape by scaling the principal components that represent the main modes of variation.

A key contribution is the ability to create a posterior shape model given user-provided constraints on certain vertices, like moving them or assigning landmarks. This computes a statistically likely shape satisfying the constraints. It facilitates tasks like guided avatar creation and visualization of shapes with desired features. The interface and workflow support iteratively refining the designed shape.

The implementation uses Three.js for 3D visualization and Dat.GUI for controls. Matrix operations leverage GPU acceleration via TensorFlow.js. It runs fully client-side, enabling privacy. Users can export the modified mesh. Examples demonstrate facial attribute manipulation, clinical applications like planning nose reconstruction surgery, and tasks solved quickly in a small user study.

In summary, exploreCOSMOS pioneers accessible web-based interactivity with SSMs, mesh manipulation via posterior models, and applications like data-driven design. The open-source tool lowers barriers for working with statistical shape analysis.
