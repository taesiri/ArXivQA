# [MA-BBOB: A Problem Generator for Black-Box Optimization Using Affine   Combinations and Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11083)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Choosing appropriate benchmark problems is critical for empirically evaluating optimization algorithms. The BBOB suite is a popular benchmark in continuous optimization, but it has limitations such as biases in the instance generation procedure.  
- BBOB was not originally designed for testing methods like algorithm selection, yet it is still commonly used for this. Testing algorithm selectors by cross-validating on BBOB functions likely overfits due to similarity of instances.
- There is a need for an unbiased generator of new benchmark problems that can provide unlimited functions to train and test algorithm selectors.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose MA-BBOB, an affine function generator that combines existing BBOB functions into new problems.
- It creates weighted sums of multiple BBOB functions, with rescaling to handle differences in scales. The optimum is placed randomly, avoiding biases from BBOB's instance generation.
- This allows arbitrary numbers of new problems to be generated, with control over properties like modality through the choice of weights.

Contributions:
- Analysis of the impact of design choices like weights, instance creation, and adding global structure on properties of generated functions.
- Demonstration of how MA-BBOB enables in-depth studies on smooth transitions in landscape and algorithm performance.
- Use of a large benchmark set from MA-BBOB to show limitations of ELA features and poor generalization of algorithm selectors trained purely on BBOB.
- The customizable generator allows new benchmark problems to be created for testing algorithm selection methods in continuous optimization.

In summary, the authors designed and analyzed an unbiased, flexible generator of new optimization benchmark problems based on BBOB components. They used properties of MA-BBOB to provide insights into optimization landscapes and algorithms, as well as demonstrate limitations of existing approaches like ELA-based algorithm selection.
