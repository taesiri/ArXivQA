# [MA-BBOB: A Problem Generator for Black-Box Optimization Using Affine   Combinations and Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11083)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Choosing appropriate benchmark problems is critical for empirically evaluating optimization algorithms. The BBOB suite is a popular benchmark in continuous optimization, but it has limitations such as biases in the instance generation procedure.  
- BBOB was not originally designed for testing methods like algorithm selection, yet it is still commonly used for this. Testing algorithm selectors by cross-validating on BBOB functions likely overfits due to similarity of instances.
- There is a need for an unbiased generator of new benchmark problems that can provide unlimited functions to train and test algorithm selectors.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose MA-BBOB, an affine function generator that combines existing BBOB functions into new problems.
- It creates weighted sums of multiple BBOB functions, with rescaling to handle differences in scales. The optimum is placed randomly, avoiding biases from BBOB's instance generation.
- This allows arbitrary numbers of new problems to be generated, with control over properties like modality through the choice of weights.

Contributions:
- Analysis of the impact of design choices like weights, instance creation, and adding global structure on properties of generated functions.
- Demonstration of how MA-BBOB enables in-depth studies on smooth transitions in landscape and algorithm performance.
- Use of a large benchmark set from MA-BBOB to show limitations of ELA features and poor generalization of algorithm selectors trained purely on BBOB.
- The customizable generator allows new benchmark problems to be created for testing algorithm selection methods in continuous optimization.

In summary, the authors designed and analyzed an unbiased, flexible generator of new optimization benchmark problems based on BBOB components. They used properties of MA-BBOB to provide insights into optimization landscapes and algorithms, as well as demonstrate limitations of existing approaches like ELA-based algorithm selection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents MA-BBOB, a generator for new optimization benchmark problems created through affine combinations of BBOB functions, and analyzes the impact on algorithm performance and landscape features while also showing challenges in using MA-BBOB for algorithm selection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of MA-BBOB, a problem generator for creating new benchmark problems for black-box optimization by using affine combinations and shifts of existing BBOB functions. Specifically:

- The paper describes the full procedure to create these affine combinations of multiple BBOB functions, including choices around scaling, instance creation, and sampling weights. It highlights trade-offs in these design decisions.

- It illustrates how MA-BBOB can be used to gain more low-level insights into function landscapes through the use of exploratory landscape analysis on pairwise combinations.

- It shows a potential use-case of MA-BBOB in generating training and testing data for algorithm selectors. Using this setup, it indicates limitations of using ELA features for algorithm selection when generalizing from BBOB to MA-BBOB.

In summary, the paper proposes and analyzes a new benchmark problem generator called MA-BBOB, highlighting its usefulness for gaining insights into optimization landscapes and testing algorithm selection techniques. A key contribution is showing limitations of ELA-based algorithm selection in generalizing from BBOB to MA-BBOB.

The paper proposes an extension of the BBOB benchmark problem suite called MA-BBOB, which creates new benchmark problems by making affine combinations of existing BBOB problems. It analyzes the impact on algorithm performance and landscape features when transitioning between different BBOB problems.

So the core focus is around benchmarking and analyzing the behavior of optimization algorithms using constructed problem landscapes.
