# [Not Just Novelty: A Longitudinal Study on Utility and Customization of   AI Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative AI models and workflows show impressive abilities, but it's unclear if this is due to novelty effect or genuine utility. 
- After familiarization, do users continue to find AI workflows useful? Or does the novelty wear off?
- How do users customize and appropriate AI workflows over time?

Study & Contributions:
- Conducted a 3-week longitudinal study with 12 users utilizing an AI workflow for writing science communication "Tweetorial" hooks. 
- Found that perceived utility of the system increased by 12.1% after familiarization phase (average 4.27 sessions). Indicates benefits are not just due to novelty.
- Increase in usefulness attributed to prompt editing feature, allowing users to customize system. 
- Identified 3 main reasons users edit prompts: to keep generations relevant, guide narrative/style, and make workflow more efficient.
- Adding user's own hooks as examples showed no significant improvement.
- Users have consistent mental models of the system over time. Feelings of ownership increased for some users based on their involvement.

Key Insights:
- Workflows maintain usefulness over time by assisting cognitively challenging tasks like ideation and translation. Also task decomposition enables better human-AI collaboration.
- Exposing prompts for editing provides simple yet powerful way for users to customize and appropriate AI workflows.
- Findings show potential for workflows to facilitate continuous co-design between users and system developers.

Limitations & Future Work:
- Focused on one workflow, model, and user group. Further studies needed across different workflows. 
- Models continue to evolve so required edits/customization may change.
- Study insights may differ with more diverse users or higher stakes tasks.

Impact:
- Helps communication between scientists and general public.
- Provides methodology and insights on longitudinal utility of AI workflows.
- Aligns with technology acceptance theories and provides new design guidelines.
- Highlights appropriation for user-centric co-design.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a three-week longitudinal study of a generative AI workflow for science writing, finding that its usefulness increased over time due to users' ability to customize prompts and appropriate the system, indicating generative AI workflows can facilitate user co-design rather than just providing novelty.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a longitudinal study over three weeks examining whether the benefits of a generative AI workflow persist after users become familiar with the system, or if it is just a novelty effect. The key findings are:

1) The familiarization phase lasts an average of 4.27 sessions (about 1.5 weeks). Before familiarization, users explore the system's capabilities. After familiarization, users understand the workflow better, can anticipate system generations, and have "finalized" their own version of the workflow.

2) The system's perceived usefulness actually increases by 12.1% after familiarization, indicating there is no novelty effect wearing off. The increased benefits come mainly from users' ability to customize prompts and appropriate the system to their own needs.

3) Users' mental models of the system remain fairly consistent over time. However, users exhibit different levels of involvement and ownership, with some linking more involvement to increased ownership. 

4) Prompt editing becomes significantly more useful to users over time as they learn how to tweak prompts to enhance generations. Adding users' own examples to prompts shows some benefits but does not significantly improve the system.

In summary, the paper shows generative AI workflows can escape the novelty effect through supporting challenging cognitive tasks and allowing customization. It points to designing systems that facilitate user appropriation and continuous co-design between developers and users.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Longitudinal study
- Generative AI workflows
- Novelty effect
- Familiarization 
- Customization
- Appropriation
- Prompt editing
- Mental models
- Ownership
- Science communication
- Tweetorial hooks

The paper presents a three-week longitudinal study on an AI workflow for writing Tweetorial hooks to communicate science topics to the general public. It investigates whether the benefits of using the generative AI workflow are just due to a novelty effect or if there is lasting utility even after users become familiar with the system. The study specifically looks at how users customize the workflow through prompt editing and how their mental models and sense of ownership evolves over time. Key findings indicate that the usefulness of the system actually increases after familiarization, mainly attributed to the prompt editing feature, allowing users to appropriate the workflow to their needs. The paper discusses the potential for generative AI systems to facilitate greater user customization and co-design between developers and end users.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper studies a 7-step human-AI workflow to help STEM experts write Tweetorial hooks. Could you explain in more detail how each step in this workflow supports the Tweetorial writing process? What role does the AI play at each step?

2. The study uses a three week deployment with 12 participants writing 10 Tweetorial hooks each. What were the rationale and considerations behind choosing this study duration and frequency of system usage? How might the results differ with a shorter or longer deployment?  

3. Survey data was collected after each system usage session. What specific measures were captured in the survey to evaluate things like system usefulness, task experience, and performance? Why were those measures chosen?

4. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at 3 points during the study. What was the purpose of the interviews? What kinds of questions were asked to understand things like familiarity, customization, and ownership? 

5. The paper identifies a familiarization period of 4.27 sessions on average. What data and analysis methods were used to determine when familiarization occurred for each participant? What were the key changes reported by participants after familiarization?

6. Prompt editing was found to increase in usefulness over time. What were the different strategies participants used for editing prompts and what issues were they trying to solve with their edits? How could the system be improved to better support productive prompt editing?

7. The new "Learn My Style" feature showed no significant improvement in system utility. Why do you think this feature did not provide substantial benefits even though some participants responded positively to it? How could it be revised?

8. The paper discusses customization and appropriation theory in relation to AI workflows. In what ways did participants customize or appropriate the workflow over time? Does the natural language prompting simplify or complicate customization?

9. How was ownership measured in the study? What were the different ways participants experienced ownership and how did their level of involvement influence their perceived ownership? What implications does this have for workflow design?  

10. The paper focuses on a specific workflow, user group, and task. What are some limitations of these choices and what kinds of additional studies are needed to strengthen and extend the results?
