# [Not Just Novelty: A Longitudinal Study on Utility and Customization of   AI Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative AI models and workflows show impressive abilities, but it's unclear if this is due to novelty effect or genuine utility. 
- After familiarization, do users continue to find AI workflows useful? Or does the novelty wear off?
- How do users customize and appropriate AI workflows over time?

Study & Contributions:
- Conducted a 3-week longitudinal study with 12 users utilizing an AI workflow for writing science communication "Tweetorial" hooks. 
- Found that perceived utility of the system increased by 12.1% after familiarization phase (average 4.27 sessions). Indicates benefits are not just due to novelty.
- Increase in usefulness attributed to prompt editing feature, allowing users to customize system. 
- Identified 3 main reasons users edit prompts: to keep generations relevant, guide narrative/style, and make workflow more efficient.
- Adding user's own hooks as examples showed no significant improvement.
- Users have consistent mental models of the system over time. Feelings of ownership increased for some users based on their involvement.

Key Insights:
- Workflows maintain usefulness over time by assisting cognitively challenging tasks like ideation and translation. Also task decomposition enables better human-AI collaboration.
- Exposing prompts for editing provides simple yet powerful way for users to customize and appropriate AI workflows.
- Findings show potential for workflows to facilitate continuous co-design between users and system developers.

Limitations & Future Work:
- Focused on one workflow, model, and user group. Further studies needed across different workflows. 
- Models continue to evolve so required edits/customization may change.
- Study insights may differ with more diverse users or higher stakes tasks.

Impact:
- Helps communication between scientists and general public.
- Provides methodology and insights on longitudinal utility of AI workflows.
- Aligns with technology acceptance theories and provides new design guidelines.
- Highlights appropriation for user-centric co-design.
