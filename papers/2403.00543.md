## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for uncertainty estimation in deep neural networks do not uniformly excel when dealing with real-world challenges like data corruption, label noise, or long-tailed class distributions. 
- There is a need for more reliable and robust approaches that can handle the complexity of real-world data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes SURE, a novel framework that synergistically integrates multiple techniques spanning model regularization, classifier design, and optimization. 
- For regularization, SURE utilizes RegMixup, correctness ranking loss (CRL), and cosine similarity classifier (CSC). 
- For optimization, it incorporates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA).
- Together, these techniques aim to increase entropy for challenging samples and enforce flat minima during training.

Main Contributions:
- Reveals that existing methods do not perform uniformly well across diverse real-world scenarios, motivating the need for SURE.  
- Proposes SURE, which harnesses strengths of diverse techniques to achieve robust uncertainty estimation.
- Shows SURE consistently outperforms individual techniques for failure prediction across datasets and architectures.
- Demonstrates SURE's remarkable effectiveness when applied directly to tasks like long-tailed classification, learning with label noise, and corruption robustness. 
- SURE achieves state-of-the-art performance on Animal-10N and Food-101N for learning with noisy labels without any task-specific adjustments.
- Sets new benchmark for robust uncertainty estimation and paves way for its use in real-world applications requiring reliability.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in motivating, developing, and rigorously evaluating SURE, a synergistic approach that advances the state-of-the-art in uncertainty estimation to handle real-world complexity.
