# [What does CLIP know about a red circle? Visual prompt engineering for   VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06712)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is:

Can visual prompt engineering, by manipulating images rather than just text, elicit useful emergent behaviors from large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP?

The key hypotheses explored are:

1) Marking images by drawing shapes like circles or boxes around objects can direct a VLM's attention, similar to textual prompts. This allows solving visual tasks like referring expression comprehension in a zero-shot manner.

2) Marking is more effective than cropping images, as it retains contextual information.

3) VLMs can learn from rare/sparse signals like annotations with red circles in their training data. This enables the emergent capability of understanding markings.

4) Visual prompt engineering can also reveal undesirable social biases learned from the training data distribution.

So in summary, the central research question is whether useful behaviors can be extracted from VLMs by engineering the visual instead of just textual prompts. The hypotheses focus on using marking/annotation as a way to do this, its advantages, the role of pretraining, and potential downsides regarding biases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes visual prompt engineering, where VLMs like CLIP are prompted by editing the image instead of just the text. In particular, it shows that simply drawing a red circle around an object steers CLIP's attention to that region while retaining global context.

2. It demonstrates the power of this simple visual prompting approach by achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot referring expressions comprehension on multiple benchmarks. The method also shows strong performance on keypoint localization. 

3. It provides an analysis of why visual prompting with a red circle is so effective for CLIP, linking it to the training data and model capacity needed to learn this emergent behavior.

4. It reveals potentially concerning biases that can be elicited in VLMs using visual prompting, such as increasing the probability that CLIP associates a person with being a criminal when circling them in red.

In summary, the key innovation is prompting VLMs like CLIP by editing the visual input instead of just the text. This is shown to be a powerful technique for zero-shot tasks, while also revealing interesting properties and potential issues with large VLMs.

The paper explores visual prompt engineering, such as drawing red circles on images, to direct large vision-language models like CLIP to focus on certain image regions and demonstrates this enables new capabilities like state-of-the-art zero-shot referring expression comprehension while also revealing potential ethical issues.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in vision-language models and prompt engineering:

- It focuses on visual prompt engineering, which is less explored than text prompt engineering. Most prior work has focused only on manipulating the text prompt. This paper shows the benefits of manipulating the visual input as well, such as drawing annotations on the image.

- It demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on vision tasks like referring expression comprehension by using visual prompt engineering. This shows these techniques can elicit useful emergent behaviors from models like CLIP. Prior work has mainly shown emergent behaviors in large language models.

- The analysis explores why visual prompt engineering works, linking it back to the training data distribution and model capacity needed. This provides insight into what allows the model to learn behaviors from sparse signals.

- The paper surfaces ethical issues around large VLMs learning from rare events, including problematic biases. Most prior analysis of VLMs has focused on image classification biases. This demonstrates other types of biases that can arise.

Overall, this paper uniquely studies visual prompt engineering as a way to elicit behaviors from VLMs. It shows strong technique advancements compared to past text prompt engineering works, while also providing analysis into why these techniques are effective and potential downsides around biases. The visual prompting and in-depth analysis distinguish it from related works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other types of visual prompt engineering beyond marking with circles/boxes. The authors show the power of this simple approach, but suggest there may be other novel prompting techniques to try in the visual domain.

- Better understanding the emergent capabilities of VLMs and what prompts can elicit them. The authors were surprised by the effectiveness of the red circle prompting, so they suggest further probing what other "hidden" abilities VLMs may have.

- Studying the biases and potential harms of large VLMs. The authors show an example of how visual prompting can trigger problematic biases in VLMs. They suggest further analysis of model biases as an important direction. 

- Developing better techniques to mitigate unwanted biases during pretraining. The authors note the biases likely come from the training data. They suggest ways to proactively avoid encoding certain biases in future VLMs.

- Exploring other novel computer vision capabilities that could emerge from VLMs. The authors show promising results on referring expression comprehension as one example. They suggest probing VLMs for other pixel-level vision tasks beyond just classification.

- Scaling up model capacity and pretraining data further. The authors find bigger VLMs exhibit more of the desired emergent behaviors, so they suggest pushing the boundaries on model size and data.

In summary, the main future directions are around understanding the capabilities and limitations of VLMs through visual prompting, studying their biases, and developing methods to mitigate issues while scaling up their capacity. The authors are excited about the promise of VLMs and want research to continue exploring them responsibly.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores visual prompt engineering, which involves modifying images rather than just text prompts, to elicit useful behaviors from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP. The authors show that simply drawing a red circle on an image guides the model's attention to that region while maintaining global context, achieving strong zero-shot performance on referring expression comprehension and keypoint localization. This emergent capability likely arises from rare examples with annotations in the training data. While visual prompts enable new applications, they can also trigger undesirable biases, as adding circles makes people more likely to be classified as criminals. Overall, the work demonstrates both the power and potential risks of manipulating images to direct VLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores visual prompt engineering for large vision-language models like CLIP. Rather than solely manipulating the text input to CLIP, the authors also modify the visual input by drawing annotations like circles directly on the images. They show that drawing a red circle around an object directs CLIP's attention to that region, allowing it to solve tasks like referring expression comprehension in a zero-shot manner. The authors achieve state-of-the-art results on referring expression datasets by having CLIP evaluate object proposals marked with red circles. 

The authors analyze why red circles are an effective visual prompt, linking it to examples present in CLIP's training data. However, they note such annotations are rare, so only very large models trained on huge datasets can learn behaviors from such sparse signals. Finally, the authors point out ethical concerns, as red circles can also elicit problematic biases in CLIP related to how annotations are used to highlight criminals or missing persons. Overall, the work introduces visual prompt engineering as a powerful technique for eliciting behaviors from vision-language models, while also revealing nuances around model capacity, training data, and potential harms.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes using visual prompt engineering with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP to elicit useful emergent behaviors for solving visual reasoning tasks. The key idea is to transform the input image by marking regions of interest with visual cues like drawing a red circle. This directs the model's attention to specific image regions while retaining global context, unlike cropping. The method is applied to tasks like referring expression comprehension and keypoint localization by treating them as question-answering problems. Given an input image, the question is encoded in text (e.g. referring expression) and possible answers are encoded as visual prompts on the image (e.g. marked object proposals). The VLM's score for the compatibility of question and answer is used to select the best match. Experiments show state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on referring expressions using this simple visual prompting approach. The effectiveness is analyzed in terms of the capacity of large VLMs and the presence of such markings in their training data. Potential issues like model biases are also discussed when using such methods on sensitive data. Overall, the paper demonstrates the power of multimodal prompt engineering with VLMs for visual reasoning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of how to perform visual reasoning and solve visual tasks like referring expression comprehension, keypoint detection, etc. using large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP in a zero-shot manner. Specifically, it explores the idea of "visual prompt engineering" for VLMs, where instead of manipulating the text prompt, the authors manipulate the visual input to the model by drawing annotations like circles or boxes to direct the model's attention. The key questions addressed are:

- How can visual prompt engineering elicit useful emergent behaviors from VLMs like CLIP?

- Can this approach allow CLIP to achieve good performance on visual reasoning tasks like referring expression comprehension in a zero-shot setting? 

- Why does marking images with simple shapes like circles work well for steering VLMs?

- What does the effectiveness of this approach reveal about properties of the VLM and its training data?

- Can visual prompt engineering also elicit unwanted biases or behaviors in VLMs?

So in summary, the paper introduces and analyzes visual prompt engineering as a way to direct VLMs to perform visual reasoning and discrimination tasks beyond just classification by engineering the visual input.
