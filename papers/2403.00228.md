# [DISORF: A Distributed Online NeRF Training and Rendering Framework for   Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00228)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to enable online 3D reconstruction and visualization for scenes captured by cameras on resource-constrained mobile robots and edge devices. Key challenges include:

1) Mobile robots have limited compute capabilities and cannot support expensive neural rendering computations like NeRF training. 

2) Naive online NeRF training leads to lower quality reconstructions compared to offline training due to unbalanced frame sampling over time. Earlier frames get sampled more while recent frames get inadequate samples.

Proposed Solution - DISORF:

The paper proposes a distributed framework called DISORF that addresses the above challenges:

1) Leverages on-device SLAM (like ORB-SLAM2) to generate posed keyframes and transmit only these (not full frames) to a remote server. This saves bandwidth while still providing poses.

2) The remote server has powerful GPUs to perform expensive NeRF optimization.

3) A novel "shifted exponential" frame sampling method is proposed that gives higher weight to recent frames to mitigate the issue of under-sampling of newer frames in online training.

Main Contributions:

1) A distributed computation framework to enable online NeRF training and rendering on resource-constrained robots.

2) Identifying and addressing the problem of unbalanced frame sampling in online NeRF training through a shifted exponential sampling strategy.

3) Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of enabling high quality 3D reconstruction from streaming videos on mobile robots by evaluating on Replica and Tanks & Temples datasets using metrics like PSNR, SSIM etc.
