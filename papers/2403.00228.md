# [DISORF: A Distributed Online NeRF Training and Rendering Framework for   Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00228)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to enable online 3D reconstruction and visualization for scenes captured by cameras on resource-constrained mobile robots and edge devices. Key challenges include:

1) Mobile robots have limited compute capabilities and cannot support expensive neural rendering computations like NeRF training. 

2) Naive online NeRF training leads to lower quality reconstructions compared to offline training due to unbalanced frame sampling over time. Earlier frames get sampled more while recent frames get inadequate samples.

Proposed Solution - DISORF:

The paper proposes a distributed framework called DISORF that addresses the above challenges:

1) Leverages on-device SLAM (like ORB-SLAM2) to generate posed keyframes and transmit only these (not full frames) to a remote server. This saves bandwidth while still providing poses.

2) The remote server has powerful GPUs to perform expensive NeRF optimization.

3) A novel "shifted exponential" frame sampling method is proposed that gives higher weight to recent frames to mitigate the issue of under-sampling of newer frames in online training.

Main Contributions:

1) A distributed computation framework to enable online NeRF training and rendering on resource-constrained robots.

2) Identifying and addressing the problem of unbalanced frame sampling in online NeRF training through a shifted exponential sampling strategy.

3) Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of enabling high quality 3D reconstruction from streaming videos on mobile robots by evaluating on Replica and Tanks & Temples datasets using metrics like PSNR, SSIM etc.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a distributed framework, DISORF, that enables online 3D reconstruction and visualization on resource-constrained mobile robots by transmitting posed keyframes from on-device SLAM to a remote server for efficient NeRF training, and introduces a shifted exponential sampling method to address unbalanced frame sampling issues in online NeRF training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a framework called DISORF that enables online 3D reconstruction and visualization from images captured by resource-constrained mobile robots and edge devices. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes a distributed framework that offloads computationally expensive neural radiance field (NeRF) training to a remote server, while using on-device SLAM to estimate poses and only transmit keyframes over the network. This reduces reliance on network bandwidth.

2) The paper identifies and addresses a key challenge with naive online NeRF training, which is unbalanced frame sampling that leads to lower quality renderings. It proposes a novel shifted exponential frame sampling strategy to dynamically focus more samples on recently received frames during training.

3) Experiments demonstrate that the proposed sampling strategy visibly improves rendering quality over baseline methods on both synthetic indoor scenes and real captured outdoor scenes. The framework and sampling method are also shown to enhance performance when applied to an alternative 3D representation method.

In summary, the main contribution is a complete framework to enable high quality, real-time 3D reconstruction and visualization on resource-constrained mobile robots by distributing computation and using a tailored sampling method for online NeRF training.

The paper introduces a framework called DISORF that enables online 3D reconstruction and visualization using NeRF models. It distributes computation between resource-constrained mobile robots/edge devices and remote servers. The keyframes and poses from on-device SLAM are transmitted to leverage more powerful servers for NeRF training. A novel shifted exponential sampling strategy is proposed to address unbalanced frame sampling issues in online NeRF training. Loss-guided active sampling is also utilized to further improve quality. So the core focus is on enabling real-time high-quality 3D reconstruction on mobile systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a distributed framework called DISORF that enables online 3D reconstruction by distributing computation between an edge device and remote server. What are the key advantages of this distributed approach compared to performing all computation on the edge device?

2) The paper identifies unbalanced frame sampling during online NERF training as a key challenge leading to lower quality reconstructions. Explain the shifted exponential sampling weight function proposed to address this challenge and how it differs from prior sampling strategies.  

3) The local end of the framework uses an on-device SLAM system to generate posed keyframes. What are the tradeoffs in relying on visual odometry from SLAM versus sending all image frames to the server? How does this design choice impact bandwidth usage?

4) How does the paper model the arrival of new keyframes from the edge device? Explain how this modeling provides insights into designing the sampling strategy.

5) Explain how loss-guided active ray sampling is incorporated along with the shifted exponential frame sampling method. What are the limitations of using loss-guided sampling for outdoor scenes?

6) The experiments evaluate the proposed method on both synthetic indoor scenes from Replica and real outdoor scenes from Tanks and Temples dataset. Compare the results on these two dataset types - which performs better and why?

7) The method is evaluated by applying the proposed sampling approach to both NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting models. What do the 3DGS results demonstrate about the sampling method?

8) What hyperparameters control the properties of the exponential sampling weight function? How do they impact the concentration of samples from recent frames?

9) How is a fair comparison of different online training strategies achieved in the experiments? Why is the replay of a fixed keyframe stream necessary?

10) What directions for future work are identified in the paper to build on this online 3D reconstruction framework for robotics applications?
