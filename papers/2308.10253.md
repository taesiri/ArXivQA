## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach to generating visual instruction tuning datasets for multimodal large language models (LLMs) by leveraging generative models. The goal is to create more flexible and diverse training data compared to existing methods that rely on annotations from benchmark datasets, which often exhibit domain bias.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method to generate visual instruction tuning datasets for multimodal large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to leverage generative models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion to synthesize both image content and associated dialogues, rather than relying solely on existing vision datasets. The authors argue that current approaches using benchmark datasets exhibit limitations like noise, domain bias, and constraints on possible dialogues. Their proposed pipeline instead allows flexible control over image diversity and quality.  

The authors demonstrate their approach by generating a large-scale dataset spanning 12 capabilities like color, objects, actions etc. Using the open-source LLaVA model, they show significant quantitative and qualitative improvements over baseline methods on both AI-generated and real image benchmarks. The results highlight enhanced adherence to question instructions and accuracy across diverse tasks. The authors conclude by noting the promise of leveraging advanced generative models through such dual generation strategies to further enrich LLM abilities. Their novel data collection methodology effectively addresses benchmark dataset limitations and can play an important role in future multimodal LLM research.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel data collection methodology for generating visual instruction tuning datasets to train multimodal large language models (LLMs). Instead of relying on existing vision datasets which may exhibit domain bias, the method leverages generative models to synchronously synthesize both images and associated dialogues. Specifically, the authors use ChatGPT to generate prompts for the text-to-image model StableDiffusion to produce diverse images covering a range of capabilities. ChatGPT is also used to generate dialogues related to the image content, such as descriptions or questions. By generating both images and dialogues simultaneously with controllable prompts, the method obtains flexible and high-quality training data. The synthesized image-dialogue pairs are then used to train the open-source LLaVA multimodal LLM model. Experiments demonstrate enhanced performance on 12 visual reasoning abilities compared to the baseline model trained on existing datasets. The dual-generation approach addresses limitations of current datasets and provides a customizable way to improve particular capabilities of multimodal LLMs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing two main problems related to the training of multimodal large language models (LLMs):

1) Existing methods for creating image-dialogue datasets for visual instruction tuning rely on benchmark vision datasets, which often exhibit domain bias and lack diversity. For example, datasets like COCO predominantly feature everyday images, while other image styles like cartoons are underrepresented. The annotations also constrain the types of dialogues that can be generated.

2) Large-scale vision-text datasets used for training often contain noise or insufficient examples to properly align visual and textual features for user needs.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a novel data collection approach that synchronously generates images and dialogues using generative models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion. The key idea is to create more flexible, diverse, and controllable datasets to improve visual instruction tuning.

In summary, the main problems are the domain bias, lack of diversity, and noise in existing datasets used for visual instruction tuning of multimodal LLMs. The proposal is to use AI synthesis to create more customizable and higher quality datasets that can enhance a wider range of capabilities.
