# [MambaIR: A Simple Baseline for Image Restoration with State-Space Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15648)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Image restoration tasks like super-resolution and denoising have made great progress with CNNs and Transformers. However, CNNs have limited receptive fields while Transformers have quadratic complexity. 
- Recently, state space models (SSMs) like Mamba have shown promise for long-range modeling in NLP. But their potential is under-explored for low-level vision tasks like image restoration.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MambaIR, a simple but effective SSM-based network for image restoration. 
- It consists of shallow feature extraction, deep feature extraction with Residual State Space Blocks (RSSBs), and reconstruction stages.
- The RSSB enhances Mamba with image priors - it uses convolutions to model local patch recurrence and channel attention for inter-channel interaction.
- This allows MambaIR to leverage both local patterns and global context with linear complexity.

Main Contributions:
- First work to adapt SSMs for image restoration and propose an effective backbone with MambaIR.
- Design of RSSB that augments Mamba with restoration-specific inductive biases like local similarity and channel interaction.
- Extensive experiments showing SOTA results on multiple restoration tasks against CNN and Transformer baselines, proving efficiency and efficacy.

In summary, the paper successfully formulates MambaIR which serves as a simple yet strong alternative to existing CNN and Transformer networks for image restoration. The proposed RSSB unifies the merits of both local and global modeling in an efficient manner.
