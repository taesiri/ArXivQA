# [Surveying the Dead Minds: Historical-Psychological Text Analysis with   Contextualized Construct Representation (CCR) for Classical Chinese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00509)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Historical psychology is an emerging field focused on understanding psychology and mental processes from historical texts and records. However, most computational methods have focused on contemporary languages and corpora. 
- Classical Chinese texts are hugely important historically but lack good computational methods for psychological analysis. Main challenges are:
  1) Lack of alignments between English psychology questionnaires and classical Chinese texts.
  2) Lack of good contextual language models tailored for classical Chinese psychology.

Proposed Solution - Contextualized Construct Representation (CCR):
- Develops a pipeline to extract psychological constructs from classical Chinese, combining expert knowledge and neural models.
- Introduces two main components:
  1) Cross-lingual Questionnaire Conversion (CQC) 
     - Uses quotation recommendation model to convert English questionnaires into classical Chinese.
  2) Indirect Supervised Contrastive Learning
     - Creates first Chinese historical psychology corpus (C-HI-PSY).
     - Uses title similarity as pseudo labels for paragraph similarity. 
     - Fine-tunes language models with contrastive learning on corpus.

Main Contributions:
- First computational pipeline tailored for historical psychology in classical Chinese texts.
- Cross-lingual conversion of questionnaires using quotation recommendation. 
- Indirect supervision and contrastive learning to adapt models.
- Outperforms prior dictionary and prompting baselines across tasks.
- Validated against external data on officials' attitudes to demonstrate validity.

In summary, the paper develops a novel CCR pipeline to open up new possibilities for studying Chinese history and psychology using classical texts. The interdisciplinary solution combining expertise in psychology and NLP is an important step forward.
