# [Surveying the Dead Minds: Historical-Psychological Text Analysis with   Contextualized Construct Representation (CCR) for Classical Chinese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00509)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Historical psychology is an emerging field focused on understanding psychology and mental processes from historical texts and records. However, most computational methods have focused on contemporary languages and corpora. 
- Classical Chinese texts are hugely important historically but lack good computational methods for psychological analysis. Main challenges are:
  1) Lack of alignments between English psychology questionnaires and classical Chinese texts.
  2) Lack of good contextual language models tailored for classical Chinese psychology.

Proposed Solution - Contextualized Construct Representation (CCR):
- Develops a pipeline to extract psychological constructs from classical Chinese, combining expert knowledge and neural models.
- Introduces two main components:
  1) Cross-lingual Questionnaire Conversion (CQC) 
     - Uses quotation recommendation model to convert English questionnaires into classical Chinese.
  2) Indirect Supervised Contrastive Learning
     - Creates first Chinese historical psychology corpus (C-HI-PSY).
     - Uses title similarity as pseudo labels for paragraph similarity. 
     - Fine-tunes language models with contrastive learning on corpus.

Main Contributions:
- First computational pipeline tailored for historical psychology in classical Chinese texts.
- Cross-lingual conversion of questionnaires using quotation recommendation. 
- Indirect supervision and contrastive learning to adapt models.
- Outperforms prior dictionary and prompting baselines across tasks.
- Validated against external data on officials' attitudes to demonstrate validity.

In summary, the paper develops a novel CCR pipeline to open up new possibilities for studying Chinese history and psychology using classical texts. The interdisciplinary solution combining expertise in psychology and NLP is an important step forward.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a pipeline called Contextualized Construct Representation (CCR) to extract psychological variables from classical Chinese texts by converting English questionnaires into classical Chinese, building a historical psychology corpus for model fine-tuning, and using sentence embeddings from contextual language models to measure semantic similarity between texts and questionnaires.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It develops a pipeline called Contextualized Construct Representation (CCR) for historical-psychological text analysis in classical Chinese. This allows extracting psychological constructs like values, norms, emotions etc. from historical Chinese texts.

2. It proposes a cross-lingual questionnaire conversion (CQC) method to convert contemporary English questionnaires into classical Chinese using a multilingual quotation recommendation model. This allows aligning English questionnaires with classical Chinese texts. 

3. It creates the first Chinese historical psychology corpus (C-HI-PSY) and uses an indirect supervised contrastive learning approach to fine-tune transformer models on this corpus. This results in better representations for psychological analysis of classical Chinese texts.

4. It comprehensively evaluates the CCR pipeline and shows it outperforms alternatives like the Distributed Dictionary Representation (DDR) method and prompting large language models in most tasks. It also validates CCR on externally annotated data about officials' attitudes towards reform.

In summary, the paper develops a full pipeline leveraging transformer models to effectively extract psychological variables from classical Chinese texts, contributing to the emerging field of historical psychology. The evaluation and benchmarking validate its effectiveness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Historical psychology - The emerging field focused on using computational methods to extract psychological constructs from historical corpora.

- Contextualized Construct Representation (CCR) - The proposed pipeline for historical-psychological text analysis that utilizes transformer-based language models. 

- Classical Chinese - An historically significant language that the methods are applied to in this paper.

- Cross-lingual questionnaire conversion (CQC) - A novel workflow proposed to convert contemporary English questionnaires into classical Chinese. 

- Indirect supervised contrastive learning - An approach introduced to fine-tune pre-trained models on a newly built historical psychology corpus.

- Semantic textual similarity - One of the tasks used to evaluate the performance of the CCR pipeline.

- Questionnaire item classification - Another evaluation task involving classifying questionnaire items. 

- Psychological measure - The third evaluation task that involves quantitatively measuring various psychological constructs.

- Traditionalism and authority - Specific psychological variables that are benchmarked against external historical data.

The key focus is on developing and evaluating computational methods, especially the CCR pipeline, to effectively analyze classical Chinese texts to extract meaningful psychological constructs for the emerging interdisciplinary field of historical psychology.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel cross-lingual questionnaire conversion (CQC) method to convert contemporary English questionnaires into classical Chinese. Can you elaborate on the details of this method and how the multilingual quotation recommendation model QuoteR is utilized? What are some limitations or challenges with this approach?

2. The paper introduces an indirect supervised contrastive learning approach to fine-tune transformer-based models on the Chinese historical psychology corpus (C-HI-PSY). Can you explain the process of positive and negative sampling from this corpus using title similarity as pseudo ground truth? What are some potential issues with using this indirect supervision approach? 

3. The Contextualized Construct Representation (CCR) pipeline is adapted in this paper for historical-psychological text analysis. How does CCR compare to prior methods like Distributed Dictionary Representations (DDR) or prompting large language models? What are the relative advantages and limitations?

4. The paper evaluates CCR on semantic textual similarity, questionnaire item classification, and psychological measure tasks. Can you discuss the results on these tasks and how they demonstrate the effectiveness of CCR? What other tasks could be used to evaluate the pipeline?  

5. Classical Chinese holds great historical significance as discussed in the paper. What are some examples of how the proposed CCR pipeline could enable new insights in fields like psychology, quantitative history, and social sciences using classical Chinese corpora?

6. The paper shows benchmarking against external data on officials' attitudes towards reform. Can you explain this validation process and how it provides evidence for the validity of the CCR pipeline? How could more benchmark datasets be developed?

7. The limitations discuss potential issues with noise from indirect supervision. How could the pipeline be improved to address this limitation in the future? What steps could be taken to further refine the datasets?

8. What implications does this work have for the emerging field of historical psychology and the use of NLP for studying historical texts and corpora? How could researchers build upon this pipeline in the future?

9. The model performance improves substantially after fine-tuning transformer models on the C-HI-PSY corpus. What does this highlight about the need for domain-specific language models, even for historical languages?

10. What other historical corpora, languages, and psychological constructs could this pipeline be applied to or extended for? How can we promote more multi-disciplinary research between fields like psychology, history, and NLP?
