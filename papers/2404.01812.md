# [Uncertainty-aware Active Learning of NeRF-based Object Models for Robot   Manipulators using Visual and Re-orientation Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01812)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of active learning of neural radiance fields (NeRF) based 3D object models using robot manipulation. Specifically, it focuses on intelligently selecting views to capture images that maximize information gain for building accurate NeRF models of objects. A key challenge is handling occlusion and selecting optimal grasp poses to reorient objects to reveal unseen/uncertain surfaces. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents an active learning framework that:

1. Estimates model uncertainty using an ensemble of NeRFs to identify uncertain views. It uses semantic segmentation to isolate object uncertainty.

2. Selects optimal next views by minimizing an objective function that trades off reducing uncertainty vs action costs. For view selection, it uses a bi-level optimization strategy.

3. Determines optimal grasp poses to reorient objects using AnyGrasp and custom geometric and uncertainty-based scoring. This reveals unseen surfaces.

4. Recovers object poses after manipulation using an enhanced inverse graphics approach with multiple images and non-gradient optimization. This unifies data before and after reorientation.

Key Contributions:

- Novel method to actively build NeRF models of objects by intelligently manipulating them
- Using semantic segmentation to quantify object-specific uncertainty 
- Custom bi-level optimization strategy for efficient view planning
- Uncertainty-aware grasp scoring mechanism for reliable reorientation
- Enhanced inverse graphics method for accurate post-manipulation pose estimation

The method is evaluated on a physical robot and shows significant improvement over prior active learning methods for NeRF and outperforms several strong baselines.
