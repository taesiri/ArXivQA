# [Modeling non-genetic information dynamics in cells using reservoir   computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07977)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a model for intracellular information dynamics in cells centered around ion gradients and the cytoskeleton. It hypothesizes that cells use transmembrane ion gradients not only for energy production but also as an information system to rapidly respond to environmental signals. In the model, external signals open ion channels, causing local ion flux changes that alter functions of peripheral proteins. Persistent signals trigger cytoskeleton assembly, propagating signals deeper into the cell via microtubules and actin filaments that conduct ions. This links membrane signals to organelles like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and the nucleus to orchestrate cellular responses. They developed a computational model called Cell-Reservoir implementing these dynamics on a 3D cell grid graph with reservoir computing. Simulations demonstrate rapid signal propagation consistent with the need for quick responses. The model learned complex nonlinear cell behavior from experimental immune cell data. Overall, this paper proposes intracellular ion flows enable versatile information processing, transmitting external signals spatially and temporally to key cell components to optimize responses.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a computational model of intracellular information dynamics in which ion concentration gradients and cytoskeletal networks enable rapid transmission of signals from the cell membrane to internal organelles, allowing adaptive cellular responses to environmental perturbations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and modeling a hypothesis for intracellular information dynamics built upon transmembrane ion gradients. Specifically:

1) The paper hypothesizes that in addition to genetic information dynamics, cells have a secondary information system built on ion gradients and fluxes. This system allows cells to rapidly acquire, analyze, and respond to environmental information for optimal evolutionary fitness.

2) A computational model called "Cell-Reservoir" is developed to model the hypothesized information dynamics system. The model consists of a 3D mesh of conductors representing the cytoskeleton which can transmit electrical signals originating from ion fluxes at the cell membrane.

3) Simulations using the Cell-Reservoir model demonstrate that the hypothesized ion/cytoskeleton based information system allows rapid and directed signaling from the cell membrane to intracellular organelles, enabling quick cellular responses. The directed nature is shown to follow basic physics laws.

4) Analysis is done to quantify the minimum cytoskeleton volume needed for signal transmission across the cell. Noise and perturbation analysis are also done to evaluate the robustness of the model.

5) As an experimental case study, the Cell-Reservoir model is trained on flow cytometry measurements of immune cell suppression based on extracellular potassium levels. This shows the ability of the model to learn actual cell behavior related to ion concentrations.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and computationally modeling a hypothesis for a secondary intracellular information system optimized by evolution, analyzing its properties, and showing consistency with some experimental observations. The Cell-Reservoir model provides a framework to further investigate this.
