# [Offline Reinforcement Learning: Role of State Aggregation and Trajectory   Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17091)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) for policy evaluation. Specifically, it considers the setting where the learner only has access to a pre-collected batch of offline data (generated by some behavior policy), and aims to evaluate the value of a given target policy using this offline dataset. A key challenge is that the offline data distribution can be very different from the state-action distribution that would be induced by the target policy. The paper focuses on the setting with value function approximation, and specifically asks: can we guarantee efficient offline policy evaluation if we assume value function realizability (access to a function class that contains the value function of the target policy) and bounded concentrability coefficient of the target policy (which quantifies the distribution mismatch between offline data and target policy)?

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1) The paper shows that efficient offline policy evaluation depends on the concentrability coefficient defined on an aggregated MDP, determined jointly by the function approximation and the offline data distribution. This aggregated concentrability can be exponentially larger than the original concentrability coefficient even under benign assumptions on the MDP and data distribution.

2) For admissible offline data (data generated by some fixed behavior policy), the paper shows an exponential lower bound on sample complexity when aggregated concentrability is large, despite small original concentrability and realizability. This resolves an open question on whether bounded concentrability plus realizability guarantees tractability.

3) For trajectory offline data, the paper provides a reduction showing that offline policy evaluation is no easier in the worst case than the admissible setting. Together with the admissible lower bound, this proves that value function realizability and bounded concentrability alone do not ensure efficient offline policy evaluation even with trajectory data.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive characterization of offline policy evaluation under value function realizability, showing the central role of aggregated concentrability in governing the sample complexity. The lower bounds generalize prior works and the reduction for trajectory data is new.
