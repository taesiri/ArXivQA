# [Regional Multi-scale Approach for Visually Pleasing Explanations of Deep   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11720)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate saliency maps that are more class-discriminative and visually pleasing to explain deep neural network predictions? Specifically, the paper proposes a region-based approach that estimates feature importance in terms of appropriately segmented regions. By fusing saliency maps generated from multi-scale segmentations, the goal is to obtain a more class-discriminative and visually pleasing map.The key ideas proposed are:- A region-based approach rather than pixel-wise approach to generate saliency maps. This involves segmenting the image into regions using superpixels and estimating importance based on excluding each region. - A multi-scale approach that generates saliency maps from multiple segmentation scales (coarse to fine) and fuses them. This captures importance at both global shapes and local details.- Incorporating these ideas into a prediction difference framework that is model-agnostic, allowing application to any neural network model without changing the model itself.The central hypothesis is that this regional multi-scale approach will produce saliency maps that are more class-discriminative (i.e. better highlight features relevant to the predicted class) and visually pleasing compared to prior pixel-wise methods. The experiments aim to demonstrate this qualitatively and quantitatively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a region-based approach that estimates feature importance in terms of appropriately segmented regions to generate more class-discriminative and visually pleasing saliency maps explaining deep neural network predictions. The key ideas are:- Regional approach: Estimate feature importance in terms of segmented regions rather than individual pixels. This produces saliency maps that retain object shapes and are visually pleasing. - Multi-scale: Fuse saliency maps generated from multiple segmentation scales, from coarse to fine, to account for objects appearing in various sizes. - Model-agnostic: Embed the regional multi-scale approach into a prediction difference method that is applicable to any model without changing the model internals.- Syntactic interpretation: Generate saliency maps that show the importance of image regions for the classification decision. This provides a syntactic way to interpret model predictions.The proposed regional multi-scale prediction difference method is shown to produce saliency maps that are much more class-discriminative and visually pleasing compared to prior pixel-wise methods. The method is also efficient, being two orders of magnitude faster than a prior pixel-wise technique.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a region-based approach using multi-scale image segmentations to generate more class-discriminative and visually pleasing saliency maps that explain deep neural network predictions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on interpreting and visualizing deep neural network decisions:- It proposes a new visually pleasing and regional approach, while most prior work has focused on pixel-wise saliency maps. The proposed method produces saliency maps that retain object shapes more clearly.- It incorporates a multi-scale segmentation approach to generate more class-discriminative saliency maps by fusing information from different scales. Most prior work uses a single-scale pixel-wise approach.  - The proposed method is model-agnostic and can be applied to any classifier without changing the model internals. Many existing methods like CAM are model-specific and constrained to certain CNN architectures.- The paper argues for the importance of visual pleasingness and perceptual attractiveness of saliency maps, a perspective not emphasized much before. This could increase user trust and understanding.- It adapts the prediction difference framework for images in a novel way using boundary priors and conditional sampling, enabling much faster computation than prior pixel-wise approaches.- The method is evaluated on large-scale ImageNet images and shown to produce superior class-discrimination and visual quality compared to gradient-based, deconvolution, and other approaches.Overall, the paper makes useful contributions in developing a regional multi-scale visually pleasing method that works for any model, demonstrating advantages over most existing approaches that are pixel-based and single-scale. The perspective on perceptual attractiveness and trusting model interpretations is also notable.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Performing actual user studies to evaluate the proposed method and measure how it impacts user trust, model selection, etc. The authors state they plan to do this in the future.- Embedding the regional multi-scale concept into other interpretation methods like Grad-CAM to improve their class-discriminability and visual quality. - Incorporating the proposed method into CNN-RNN models to enable semantic (textual) interpretations in addition to the syntactic (visual) interpretations currently provided.- Evaluating the method on additional datasets beyond ImageNet to further analyze its effectiveness.- Experimenting with other base network architectures besides GoogLeNet, ResNet, etc. to see if similar benefits are achieved.- Establishing better quantitative evaluation metrics and protocols for saliency maps, as the authors note this is still an open issue.- Comparing against additional state-of-the-art explanation methods as new ones continue to emerge.So in summary, the authors suggest enhancements like user studies, embedding into other methods, semantic interpretation, more evaluation, and comparisons as important future directions to build on their regional multi-scale approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a region-based approach to generate visually pleasing and class-discriminative explanations of deep neural network predictions. The key ideas are: 1) Estimate feature importance in terms of appropriately segmented regions rather than individual pixels. 2) Fuse saliency maps generated from multi-scale segmentations to obtain a more class-discriminative map. 3) Incorporate these ideas into a prediction difference method that is model-agnostic. The input image is segmented at multiple scales using superpixels. Exclusion of a region is simulated by sampling from a normal distribution constructed using boundary prior. Experiments show the proposed method produces much more class-discriminative and visually pleasing saliency maps compared to prior arts. The method is also faster than conventional prediction difference algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new region-based approach to generate visually pleasing and class-discriminative saliency maps that explain the predictions of deep neural networks. The key ideas are using multi-scale segmentations of the input image into regions and fusing the saliency maps from different scales. The paper first reviews existing explanation methods like sensitivity analysis, deconvolution, Grad-CAM etc. and notes their limitations in not retaining object shapes and being class-discriminative. It then proposes a prediction difference algorithm that simulates excluding a region by sampling from a normal distribution derived from boundary priors. This is done over multiple scales of segmentation to get multi-scale saliency maps which are then fused. The fused saliency map retains object shapes better and is more class-discriminative and visually pleasing compared to prior methods as shown qualitatively and quantitatively on ImageNet images. The proposed method also has lower computational complexity than conventional pixel-wise prediction difference. Overall, the regional multi-scale prediction difference generates superior explanation maps efficiently in a model-agnostic manner.In summary, this paper presents a novel region-based multi-scale approach to generate explanation saliency maps for deep neural network predictions. By performing prediction difference over multiple scales of segmentation and fusing the results, the proposed method produces saliency maps that are more class-discriminative, visually pleasing and efficiently computable. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the advantages over existing methods. The key novelty is using regional information at multiple scales rather than pixel-level manipulations. This helps retain object structure better in the final saliency map. The proposed technique is model-agnostic and can help increase trust and transparency in deep neural network systems.
