# [Uncertainty Quantification for Forward and Inverse Problems of PDEs via   Latent Global Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08383)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning PDE solvers lack uncertainty quantification, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in their approximate solutions. This is problematic for scenarios involving critical decision making.
- Existing methods for uncertainty quantification struggle with time-dependent PDEs, failing to accurately propagate uncertainty over long autoregressive rollouts.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose LE-PDE-UQ, a method that integrates efficient and precise uncertainty quantification into deep learning PDE solvers. 
- It leverages latent vectors to evolve the system state and uncertainty estimation over time. The latent vectors are decoded to provide predictions and uncertainty estimates.
- For forward problems, LE-PDE-UQ is augmented with deep ensembles to improve uncertainty quantification. 
- For inverse problems, it enables optimization within the latent space via backpropagation through time.

Main Contributions:
- LE-PDE-UQ demonstrates state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification results, outperforming Bayes layers, dropout, and deep ensembles.
- It excels at propagating uncertainty over long autoregressive rollouts suitable for long-term prediction.
- Ablation studies confirm the latent evolution and dedicated uncertainty latent vectors are critical for accurate uncertainty quantification.  
- For inverse problems, optimization within the latent space is more stable and matches ground truth better than baseline methods.
- LE-PDE-UQ bridges the gap between deep learning surrogates and trustworthy uncertainty estimates for time-dependent PDEs.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative method for endowing deep learning PDE solvers with precise and efficient uncertainty quantification capabilities for both forward and inverse problems. Experiments confirm state-of-the-art performance.
