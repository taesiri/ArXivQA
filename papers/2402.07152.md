# [Explainable Global Wildfire Prediction Models using Graph Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07152)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Wildfires are increasing in frequency and severity due to climate change. Accurate prediction of wildfires is crucial but challenging. 
- Traditional CNN-based models for wildfire prediction struggle with:
   1) Missing oceanic data - oceans lack data but are arbitrarily assigned constants like 0, introducing bias.
   2) Long-range dependencies - distant locations can be climatically connected but CNNs have limited receptive fields.
- Computational expense of physics-based wildfire models like JULES-INFERNO motivates developing efficient deep learning surrogate models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- Global climate data from JULES-INFERNO is transformed into a graph representation:
   1) Nodes - terrestrial data collection locations
   2) Edges - based on wildfire correlation between locations
- GCN captures spatial dependencies in the graph.
- LSTM captures temporal dependencies in sequences.  

Main Contributions:
- Novel GNN-based model for global wildfire prediction using GCN and LSTM.
- Graph data representation addresses issues with missing oceanic data and long-range dependencies.  
- Model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy over LSTM, ConvLSTM and CAE-LSTM baselines.
- Enhanced interpretability through community detection, and feature/node attribution analysis:
   1) Identified regions with wildfire correlations.
   2) Key factors like humidity and lightning emerged for predictions.
   3) Model uses information from both proximal and distant correlated regions.
- Advances wildfire prediction methodology and emphasizes model transparency for stakeholders.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative graph-based hybrid deep learning model for global wildfire prediction that achieves higher accuracy and interpretability compared to existing approaches. The graph representation and GNN architecture provides an effective solution to limitations in traditional CNN-based wildfire models.
