# [A Machine learning and Empirical Bayesian Approach for Predictive Buying   in B2B E-commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07843)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- In B2B e-commerce, predicting customer purchase behavior is critical for targeted recommendations and sales growth. However, relationships and trust heavily influence buying, making prediction difficult.
- E-commerce companies use telecallers to engage customers and promote purchases, but have limited bandwidth to target high-potential customers. More accurate purchase prediction models are needed.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a model to predict each customer's likelihood of placing an order within 48 hours. This will allow telecallers to focus on high-probability customers.

- Use an ensemble approach combining XGBoost and a Modified Poisson-Gamma (MPG) model in a stacked architecture with logistic regression as the meta-learner.

- XGBoost provides predictive capabilities based on extensive customer feature data. MPG analyzes full purchase history to model repetitive buyer behavior. 

- Stacked model combines feature-level (XGBoost) and score-level (MPG) information for enhanced predictions.

Key Contributions:

- Careful feature engineering and selection for the XGBoost model using domain knowledge of B2B buying patterns.

- Integration of MPG to capture granular repeat purchase behaviors based on empirical Bayesian principles.

- Novel stacked ensemble approach fusing machine learning and Bayesian methodologies for more accurate purchase prediction.

- Remarkable 3X increase in customer order rate to 13% when deploying new model, significantly outperforming both manual method (4%) and standalone XGBoost (8%).

- First-of-its-kind work showcasing the fusion of machine learning and empirical Bayes in B2B e-commerce purchase prediction.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions through its innovative stacked predictive model that combines the strengths of multiple approaches to achieve much higher purchase prediction accuracy and business impact.
