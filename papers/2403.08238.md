## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Search and rescue operations in hazardous environments require robots that can navigate safely and efficiently to locate victims. However, traditional path planning approaches face challenges in complex, dynamic environments with sudden changes. They are computationally expensive and cannot provide satisfactory real-time responses.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel Feature Learning-based Bio-inspired Neural Network (FLBBINN) to enable multi-robot systems to generate heuristic collision-free rescue paths rapidly. 

Key ideas:

1) Incorporates a bio-inspired neural network with a feature learning method to reduce computational complexity while retaining real-time environmental adaptability.

2) Extracts feature neurons using multiple filtering techniques - turning angle, Euclidean distance, neural activity landscape, and secondary distance fusion. This prunes redundant neurons.

3) Constructs a neurodynamics-based feature matrix upon completing feature learning. This matrix captures topological connections between features. 

4) Performs fast heuristic path planning by backward search on the feature matrix from target to start. The planned paths have in-built safety and adaptability.

Main Contributions:

- Reduces computational complexity significantly compared to traditional bio-inspired neural networks

- Enables real-time responses to sudden environmental changes through continual feature learning

- Provides shorter, safer and more optimal paths by planning on learned feature space

- Achieves faster propagation without getting trapped by obstacles due to neurodynamics-based connections

- Demonstrates compelling performance improvements over traditional methods through extensive simulations and real-robot experiments

The paper makes bio-inspired neural networks more practical for real-world rescue operations by integrating environmental feature learning to enhance efficiency. The neurodynamics-based feature matrix also equips the robots with the ability to navigate complex environments safely.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

1. A novel feature learning-based bio-inspired neural network (FLBBINN) is proposed for executing rescue operations in complex and dynamic environments.
