# [WISE: full-Waveform variational Inference via Subsurface Extensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06230)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is important for estimating Earth's subsurface properties from seismic data, but faces challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and computational complexity. 
- There is a need for computationally efficient probabilistic approaches that can generate multiple feasible migration-velocity models compatible with observed seismic data to quantify uncertainty.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new technique called WISE (full-Waveform variational Inference via Subsurface Extensions) that combines variational inference and conditional normalizing flows with physics-informed summary statistics.
- Common-image gathers (CIGs) are proposed as robust physics-informed summary statistics that preserve more information compared to reverse-time migration when initial velocity models are inaccurate. 
- Conditional normalizing flows are trained on velocity model and CIG pairs to approximate the posterior distribution over migration-velocity models. This enables generating multiple realizations conditioned on seismic data.

Key Contributions:
- First application of conditional normalizing flows for probabilistic full-waveform inversion to produce uncertainty-aware velocity model building.
- Introduction of CIGs as information-preserving physics-informed summary statistics for variational inference with inaccurate initial models.
- Quantification of uncertainty propagation from conditional velocity models to amplitude and positioning effects in migration images.
- Demonstration of method's effectiveness on challenging synthetic datasets like Open FWI and Compass model.

In summary, the paper presents a novel integration of physics and deep generative models to efficiently perform Bayesian inference for FWI while quantifying multiple types of uncertainties. The use of CIGs as summary statistics is pivotal in making this feasible with inaccurate initial models.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a probabilistic full-waveform inversion technique called WISE that employs variational inference and conditional normalizing flows to efficiently generate multiple feasible migration-velocity models compatible with the observed seismic data and quantify uncertainty in velocity models and its impact on seismic imaging.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing WISE (full-Waveform variational Inference via Subsurface Extensions), a probabilistic technique for full-waveform inversion that employs variational inference and conditional normalizing flows to quantify uncertainty in migration-velocity models and its impact on imaging. 

Specifically, the key aspects of the contribution are:

1) Integrating generative AI (variational inference and conditional normalizing flows) with physics-informed common-image gathers to reduce reliance on accurate initial velocity models in full-waveform inversion.

2) Using common-image gathers as physics-informed summary statistics to capture more information from the data compared to using reverse-time migration alone, enabling more accurate uncertainty quantification.

3) Demonstrating WISE's efficacy in producing realizations of migration-velocity models conditioned by the data through synthetic case studies. 

4) Quantifying amplitude and positioning effects in subsequent imaging using the uncertainty represented in the distribution of migration-velocity models.

In summary, the paper introduces a computationally cost-effective probabilistic framework for full-waveform inversion that harnesses advancements in generative AI and leverages common-image gathers to quantify and propagate uncertainty.
