# [ExaRanker: Explanation-Augmented Neural Ranker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10521)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can augmenting training data for neural ranking models with natural language explanations improve their effectiveness, especially when limited labeled data is available? The key hypothesis appears to be that adding explanations as additional training signals will allow models to learn more effectively from fewer labeled examples. The paper proposes a method to generate explanations using large language models and integrate them into the training process for neural ranking models. It hypothesizes this will improve performance compared to only training on categorical labels, particularly in low-data regimes. The experiments aim to test if this hypothesis holds across different amounts of training data.In summary, the main research question is whether explanation-augmented training can make neural rankers more data-efficient. The central hypothesis is that the additional explanatory training signals will enable models to learn more from limited labeled data. The experiments test this hypothesis by evaluating models trained with varying amounts of explanation-augmented data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to train neural ranking models using natural language explanations as additional training signals. This allows the models to learn more effectively from limited labeled data. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Using a large language model (LLM) to automatically generate explanations for query-passage pairs. This avoids the need for expensive manual annotation.- Augmenting the training data with these synthetic explanations, in addition to the standard relevance labels. - Training a sequence-to-sequence ranking model to jointly predict a relevance label and an explanation.- Showing that models trained with explanations (dubbed ExaRanker) outperform those trained without explanations, especially in low data regimes. For example, ExaRanker trained on 5k examples performs similarly to a model trained on 15k examples without explanations.- Demonstrating the utility of explanations decreases as more training data is available. But incorporating explanations does not hurt performance even with abundant data.- ExaRanker allows generating explanations on the fly during inference without impacting latency.In summary, the key contribution is using automatically generated explanations to reduce the training data requirements for neural ranking models. The method is simple, scalable, and results in models that can provide explanations without impacting inference time.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method called ExaRanker to train neural ranking models using natural language explanations as additional supervision, which improves performance especially when training data is limited.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on using explanations to improve neural ranking models:- The main novelty is using LLMs like GPT-3 to automatically generate explanations for query-passage pairs, rather than requiring manual annotations. This makes the approach more scalable. - Prior work has focused more on generating explanations to interpret model predictions, whereas this paper uses explanations directly during training to improve the model's ranking effectiveness.- The paper shows explanations help most when training data is limited (e.g. <10k examples). Benefits decrease as more training data is available. This insight on when explanations are most useful is not explored much before.- The paper focuses on ranking, whereas most prior work on induced explanations has been on classification tasks. Adapting the method to ranking required some modifications like using the label token probability as the relevance score.- The paper compares generating the explanation before vs after the label, finding label then explanation works better. Some prior work hypothesized generating explanations first may be better for reasoning.- The paper uses synthetic explanations from LLMs, rather than human rationales. Quality/faithfulness of explanations is not evaluated. Other papers focus more on human-aligned explanations.Overall, the key novelties are using LLMs to generate explanations to augment limited training data for ranking models. The insights on when explanations are most useful and integration with ranking differ from prior work focused on classification tasks or human explanations.
