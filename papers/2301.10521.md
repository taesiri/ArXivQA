# [ExaRanker: Explanation-Augmented Neural Ranker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10521)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can augmenting training data for neural ranking models with natural language explanations improve their effectiveness, especially when limited labeled data is available? 

The key hypothesis appears to be that adding explanations as additional training signals will allow models to learn more effectively from fewer labeled examples. The paper proposes a method to generate explanations using large language models and integrate them into the training process for neural ranking models. It hypothesizes this will improve performance compared to only training on categorical labels, particularly in low-data regimes. The experiments aim to test if this hypothesis holds across different amounts of training data.

In summary, the main research question is whether explanation-augmented training can make neural rankers more data-efficient. The central hypothesis is that the additional explanatory training signals will enable models to learn more from limited labeled data. The experiments test this hypothesis by evaluating models trained with varying amounts of explanation-augmented data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to train neural ranking models using natural language explanations as additional training signals. This allows the models to learn more effectively from limited labeled data. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- Using a large language model (LLM) to automatically generate explanations for query-passage pairs. This avoids the need for expensive manual annotation.

- Augmenting the training data with these synthetic explanations, in addition to the standard relevance labels. 

- Training a sequence-to-sequence ranking model to jointly predict a relevance label and an explanation.

- Showing that models trained with explanations (dubbed ExaRanker) outperform those trained without explanations, especially in low data regimes. For example, ExaRanker trained on 5k examples performs similarly to a model trained on 15k examples without explanations.

- Demonstrating the utility of explanations decreases as more training data is available. But incorporating explanations does not hurt performance even with abundant data.

- ExaRanker allows generating explanations on the fly during inference without impacting latency.

In summary, the key contribution is using automatically generated explanations to reduce the training data requirements for neural ranking models. The method is simple, scalable, and results in models that can provide explanations without impacting inference time.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called ExaRanker to train neural ranking models using natural language explanations as additional supervision, which improves performance especially when training data is limited.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on using explanations to improve neural ranking models:

- The main novelty is using LLMs like GPT-3 to automatically generate explanations for query-passage pairs, rather than requiring manual annotations. This makes the approach more scalable. 

- Prior work has focused more on generating explanations to interpret model predictions, whereas this paper uses explanations directly during training to improve the model's ranking effectiveness.

- The paper shows explanations help most when training data is limited (e.g. <10k examples). Benefits decrease as more training data is available. This insight on when explanations are most useful is not explored much before.

- The paper focuses on ranking, whereas most prior work on induced explanations has been on classification tasks. Adapting the method to ranking required some modifications like using the label token probability as the relevance score.

- The paper compares generating the explanation before vs after the label, finding label then explanation works better. Some prior work hypothesized generating explanations first may be better for reasoning.

- The paper uses synthetic explanations from LLMs, rather than human rationales. Quality/faithfulness of explanations is not evaluated. Other papers focus more on human-aligned explanations.

Overall, the key novelties are using LLMs to generate explanations to augment limited training data for ranking models. The insights on when explanations are most useful and integration with ranking differ from prior work focused on classification tasks or human explanations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating whether the utility of incorporating explanations decreases as the number of training examples increases, as their results indicate. They suggest more analysis on the relationship between explanation benefits and amount of training data.

- Integrating their method with other complementary approaches like InPars and Promptagator that generate queries from documents rather than augmenting training data. They foresee potential benefits from combining these approaches.

- Further examining if their method helps users understand ranked results better, beyond just improving ranking effectiveness. They did not evaluate explanation correctness or interpretability for users in this work.

- Analyzing the quality and faithfulness of the automatically generated explanations more deeply through human evaluation. They did not claim the explanations make the retriever interpretable.

- Exploring different prompting strategies and LLMs to generate explanations, to see impact on quality. They used a simple prompting approach with GPT-3.5 in this work.

- Testing integration of their method into cross-encoder reranking models like ColBERT. They only experimented with sequence-to-sequence models.

- Evaluating on more diverse datasets beyond just the BEIR benchmarks used in this study.

In summary, the authors point to several promising directions for better understanding the utility of explanations in training neural rankers, integrating their approach with other methods, evaluating explanation quality, and applying it to other models and datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called ExaRanker for training neural ranking models using natural language explanations as additional labels. This is done by first using a large language model like GPT-3 to generate explanations for query-document pairs from a dataset like MS MARCO. These explanations are then used along with the relevance labels to finetune a sequence-to-sequence ranking model. At test time, only the relevance label is generated which allows efficient reranking. Experiments show that models trained with explanations perform much better than those trained only on labels, especially when training data is limited. For example, an ExaRanker model finetuned on 5k examples with explanations performs similarly to a model finetuned on 15k examples without explanations. The method allows transferring knowledge from large models to improve ranking models without increasing inference time.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method called ExaRanker to improve neural ranking models by using natural language explanations as additional training signals. The key idea is to use large language models (LLMs) to generate explanations for query-passage pairs that are labeled as relevant or non-relevant. These query-passage-explanation triples are then used to finetune a sequence-to-sequence ranking model to output a relevance label followed by an explanation. 

The authors show that finetuning the ranking model on just a few thousand examples augmented with LLM-generated explanations leads to effectiveness on par with finetuning on much larger sets of examples without explanations. For instance, their ExaRanker model finetuned on 5k examples with explanations performs similarly to a baseline model finetuned on 15k examples without explanations. The benefits are more pronounced when less training data is available. Qualitative analysis reveals the model can generate reasonable explanations, even though it relies primarily on the relevance label for ranking. Overall, this work demonstrates that explanations can effectively augment limited training data to improve neural ranking models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called ExaRanker for training neural ranking models using natural language explanations as additional labels. The method starts by using a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3 to generate explanations for query-passage pairs labeled as relevant or not relevant. These query-passage-label-explanation training examples are then used to finetune a sequence-to-sequence ranking model (like T5) to generate a relevance label and explanation for a given input. During training, the model is conditioned to first output a relevance label, then generate an explanation. At inference time, only the relevance label is generated and its probability is used as the ranking score, avoiding extra computation for generating explanations. The key benefit shown is that using explanations as additional supervision signals reduces the number of labeled query-passage pairs needed for training an effective ranker. Experiments demonstrate that a model finetuned on thousands of examples with synthetic explanations can match the effectiveness of models trained on much more data without explanations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem that neural ranking models require a large amount of training data to achieve good effectiveness. The authors propose a method to reduce the amount of training data needed by augmenting the training data with natural language explanations.

The key points are:

- Neural ranking models like BERT need hundreds of thousands of training examples to outperform traditional retrieval models like BM25. This is expensive to obtain.

- The authors propose training the model to generate a relevance label and explanation for a query-document pair. 

- Explanations provide more nuanced information beyond just a binary relevance label. This helps the model learn better with less data.

- They show a model trained with explanations on 15k examples performs similarly to a model trained on 400k examples without explanations.

- Explanations are generated automatically using GPT-3, so no manual annotation is needed.

- At inference time, only the relevance label is generated, so there is no extra computation cost.

So in summary, the paper addresses the problem of requiring large labeled data for neural ranking models, and proposes using automatically generated explanations to reduce the data requirement.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a method called ExaRanker to improve neural ranking models by augmenting training data with natural language explanations. The authors use GPT-3 to generate explanations for query-passage pairs from the MS MARCO dataset. A T5 model is then finetuned to generate a relevance label followed by an explanation for each input query-passage pair.
