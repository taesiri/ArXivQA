# [Handling Delayed Feedback in Distributed Online Optimization : A   Projection-Free Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02114)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of online convex optimization (OCO) with adversarial delayed feedback in both centralized and distributed settings. In many real-world applications like wireless sensor networks and online advertising, there are often delays between when a decision is made and when the feedback/loss for that decision is received. Existing OCO algorithms assume instant feedback and thus fail to perform well. The challenge is to design algorithms that can handle such delays in an adversarial (unknown) manner, while still being simple enough to run on edge devices with limited computation. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two projection-free online algorithms based on Frank-Wolfe - DeLMFW for centralized setting and De2MFW for distributed setting. The key ideas are:

- Employ multiple copies of a base online linear optimization oracle (e.g. FTPL) to estimate gradients and make decisions. The oracles handle the delayed gradients in an online manner.

- Carefully accumulate the delayed gradients from different time steps whenever they arrive and feed them to the oracles to refine their estimations.

- In the distributed variant, agents use local delayed gradients as well as neighbors' shared gradients to track the global gradient. Consensus steps are added to enable gradient tracking.

The algorithms achieve an optimal regret bound of O(√dT) where d is the maximum delay and T is the time horizon. This matches the lower bound for OCO with delays. The projection-free nature also makes them suitable for edge devices.

Main Contributions:
- First projection-free algorithms for centralized and distributed OCO under adversarial delays with optimal regret.

- Flexible framework that allows different base OCO algorithms to be used as the online linear oracle.

- Extensive theoretical analysis providing regret bounds and discussing their tightness.

- Empirical evaluation on real-world multiclass classification validates the algorithms' practical effectiveness and predicts their performance as analyzed theoretically.

Overall, the paper makes multiple strong contributions in making OCO algorithms, especially projection-free ones, robust to unknown delays in both centralized and distributed settings.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors propose two projection-free algorithms (DeLMFW and De2MFW) for solving the online convex optimization problem with adversarial delayed feedback in centralized and distributed settings respectively. 

2. The proposed algorithms achieve an optimal regret bound of O(√dT) where d is the upper bound on the delays. This matches the best known regret for this problem setting while still being projection-free. 

3. The algorithms are designed to address the challenges of uncertainty, asynchronicity, partial information and computational/communication constraints in distributed edge learning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two algorithms, DeLMFW for centralized settings and De2MFW for distributed settings. What are the key differences in the update rules between these two algorithms? How do they account for the decentralized nature and handle communication between agents?

2. Both algorithms utilize multiple online linear optimization oracles. Explain the motivation behind using multiple oracles rather than a single one. How does the use of multiple oracles help address the issue of delayed feedback? 

3. The regret analysis shows a bound of O(√dT) which recovers the classic regret without delays when d=1. Walk through the key steps in the regret proof that lead to this bound. What causes the additive term depending on the delay d to appear?

4. How does the algorithm aggregate the delayed gradients that arrive at each step? Explain the surrogate gradient computation and how it relates to handling arbitrarily delayed gradients from previous steps.

5. In the distributed setting, how does the connectivity of the communication graph affect the impact of delays on the oracle outputs? Explain the intuition behind Lemma 3 and how the spectral gap ρ appears in the result.

6. Compare the theoretical guarantees of DeLMFW and De2MFW to prior algorithms like DGD and DOFW. What are the advantages of the proposed methods over these baselines? When would DGD or DOFW potentially outperform the proposed algorithms?

7. The algorithms can work with any online linear optimization oracle. If you were to select an oracle other than FTPL, what would be appropriate choices and why? What modifications would be needed in the algorithms and analysis?

8. How do the stepsizes ηk need to be set in both algorithms? Explain why the choice of stepsizes utilizes the parameter A which depends on the smoothness and diameter. 

9. In the experiments, how are the delayed gradients actually generated? What process is used to simulate arbitrary delays at each step in order to evaluate the algorithms?

10. The experiments show the proposed algorithms outperforming prior approaches, aligning with the theory. Based on the regret analysis, try to explain or interpret the empirical performance gaps observed between methods.
