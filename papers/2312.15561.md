# [README: Bridging Medical Jargon and Lay Understanding for Patient   Education through Data-Centric NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15561)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Medical jargon in electronic health records (EHRs) poses comprehension challenges for patients trying to understand their health information.  
- Existing lay term resources like Consumer Health Vocabulary (CHV) have limited coverage and scalability.
- There is a need for an automatic way to generate layperson definitions of medical terms that can scale and adapt to different contexts.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduced a new task of automatically generating layperson definitions for medical jargon to enhance patient comprehension.
- Created an expansive expert-annotated dataset called README with over 20,000 medical terms and 300,000 layperson definitions covering diverse contexts.
- Proposed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method that retrieves standard definitions and prompts language models to simplify them into layperson language.  
- Developed a data-centric pipeline called Examiner-Augmenter-Examiner (EAE) that uses both human experts and AI to filter, augment and select high-quality training data.
- Showed that open-source small models can match large proprietary models like ChatGPT when trained on curated high-quality data.

Main Contributions:
- Formulated a novel task of automatic medical jargon to lay definition generation.
- Constructed a substantial manually annotated dataset README with over 300,000 data points as a benchmark.
- Demonstrated efficacy of RAG using standard definitions to produce high-quality layperson definitions. 
- Designed a robust data-centric EAE pipeline that integrates human and AI abilities for quality data curation.
- Established that open-source models can achieve state-of-the-art performance given curated data.
- Advanced patient education and comprehension of EHRs through automatic lay definition generation.

The paper makes significant contributions in introducing a new impactful task, constructing a valuable dataset, showing efficacy of data-centric methods, and demonstrating potential of open-source models to enhance patient education.
