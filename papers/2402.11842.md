# [CodeArt: Better Code Models by Attention Regularization When Symbols Are   Lacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11842)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Transformer models have shown impressive performance on software engineering tasks. However, their effectiveness degrades significantly when symbols (e.g. variable names, comments) are missing or not informative, such as in stripped binaries or obfuscated code. The reason is that without helpful symbols, programs become very difficult for models to understand and attention can be misled to spurious correlations. Existing solutions either focus on single downstream tasks or require symbols. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new method to pre-train general Transformer code models from scratch when symbols are lacking. The key idea is to use program analysis to extract potential contexts like dependencies between instructions and then leverage novel attention masking techniques to constrain self-attention to only these contexts during training. This helps the model learn the right correlations even without symbols. Specifically:

- Enhance tokenization and model architecture to integrate attention masks and relative positional biases based on dependence analysis.
- Construct different types of masks to restrict self-attention to dependence contexts, instruction-local contexts and global contexts. Allow bidirectional attention between instructions reachable in the dependence graph.  
- Pre-train the model using masked language modeling to predict masked tokens and masked dependence modeling to predict dependence edges.

Main Contributions:

- Propose a new attention regularization method to pre-train Transformer code models without symbols. The model is general instead of specialized for certain downstream tasks.

- Address multiple technical challenges including tokenization, model architecture, mask construction, pre-training objectives etc. Construct a large dataset with 26 million functions and explicit dependence information.

- Develop a tool CodeArt to realize the ideas. Pre-train a BERT-like model from scratch. Demonstrate effectiveness on tasks like binary similarity (improves SOTA from 53% to 64%), malware classification (49% to 60%) and type inference (74% to 94%).

- Outperform prior general pre-training methods like GraphCodeBERT significantly when symbols are not available. Provide ablation studies to validate design choices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method to pre-train Transformer-based code models when symbols are lacking by using program analysis to construct attention masks that regulate self-attention to program dependences and other contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method to pre-train Transformer-based code models when symbols are lacking, such as in stripped binary executables. The key ideas include:

1) Using program analysis to extract potential dependencies between instructions and construct attention masks to regulate self-attention to those dependencies during training. This helps the model learn the right contexts when symbols are not available.

2) Enhancing the tokenization, model architecture, and pre-training method to incorporate the masks and dependence information. This includes computing transitive dependences and transforming them to connectivity relations to allow bi-directional attention.

3) Developing a new pre-training algorithm involving masking input tokens as well as masking/perturbing dependencies to force the model to learn precise semantics.

4) Evaluating the pre-trained model on downstream tasks like binary similarity, malware classification, and type inference and showing substantially improved performance over state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an innovative attention regularization approach to pre-train Transformer code models focusing on scenarios where symbols are lacking, and demonstrating its effectiveness over other methods.

The paper proposes a new method called "CodeArt" to pre-train Transformer-based code models when symbols are lacking, such as in stripped binaries. The key ideas are to use program analysis to extract dependence information, construct attention masks to regulate self-attention based on this, introduce relative positional embeddings to encode dependence distances, and enhance the pre-training with masked dependence modeling. The goal is to learn better general code representations that can transfer to downstream tasks like binary similarity analysis, malware classification, and type inference.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the proposed method uses program analysis to extract contexts a priori instead of relying on symbols and masked language modeling as in vanilla models. Could you elaborate more on why relying solely on symbols and masked language modeling is insufficient in this problem setting?

2. The attention regularization technique leverages program dependence analysis to construct attention masks. Could you explain in more detail the rationale behind using attention masks constructed in this way? How do they help the model learn better representations?

3. The paper converts the program dependence graph into a connectivity graph before constructing attention masks. What is the motivation behind this conversion step? What are the limitations if attention masks are constructed directly from the dependence graph without conversion?  

4. The proposed method uses both data flow and control flow dependencies for constructing attention masks. What is the relative importance of modeling each type of dependency? Are both required for good performance?

5. The pretrained model is applied to three different downstream tasks. Could you analyze the commonalities and differences across these tasks and how the pretrained representations help in each case?

6. An ablation study is presented with several components removed. Which component seems most critical for good performance? Why does removing it degrade performance so significantly? 

7. The method is compared to a GraphCodeBERT-like approach. What are the key differences in methodology between these two techniques? Why does the proposed approach outperform GraphCodeBERT by a large margin?

8. The motivation example highlights limitations of prior work on binary code models lacking symbols. How does the proposed technique overcome these limitations? What specific components address the issues raised?

9. The paper mentions the technique helps disentangle interleaved contexts when symbols are lacking. Could you explain this claim further with examples? How exactly does it achieve the disentanglement?

10. What are some promising future directions for improving or extending this work? What enhancements could make the representations learned even more expressive and useful?
