# [One TTS Alignment To Rule Them All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10447)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a generic alignment learning framework that can improve speech-text alignment convergence, robustness, and speech quality across different types of neural TTS models (both autoregressive and non-autoregressive)?

The key hypothesis appears to be that by combining forward-sum, Viterbi, and diagonal alignment priors in an unsupervised alignment learning objective, they can improve alignment learning for neural TTS models in three main ways:

1) Faster convergence of alignments during training

2) More robust alignments, reducing errors on long utterances  

3) Improved overall speech quality as judged by human listeners

The authors propose a framework for unsupervised alignment learning that can be applied to different neural TTS architectures. They show experimentally that this framework improves convergence speed, alignment robustness on long sequences, and speech quality over baseline alignment techniques for several autoregressive and non-autoregressive TTS models. The main goal is developing a generic framework that simplifies TTS training pipelines while also improving alignments and speech synthesis compared to existing methods relying on external alignment tools or pre-trained aligners.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an alignment learning framework that can be applied to various neural text-to-speech (TTS) models, both autoregressive and non-autoregressive, to improve their training and inference. The key points are:

- They propose an unsupervised alignment learning objective based on maximizing the likelihood of text given speech mel-spectrograms. This can be efficiently implemented using the forward-sum algorithm from HMMs.

- They show this objective can be incorporated in both autoregressive TTS models like Tacotron and Flowtron to improve attention learning, as well as non-autoregressive models like FastSpeech 2 and RAD-TTS to eliminate the need for external aligners. 

- The framework improves convergence speed of alignment learning during training across different models. It also improves robustness and reduces errors during inference of long utterances.

- With this framework, they are able to train multi-flow Flowtron and simplify its training pipeline. For non-autoregressive models, they can learn alignments online instead of relying on forced aligners.

- The proposed framework results in better speech quality judged through human evaluation, lower alignment errors, and lower character error rates especially for long utterances.

In summary, the key contribution is a generic alignment learning approach applicable to many TTS architectures, that improves training stability and inference robustness while simplifying the training pipeline by removing dependency on external aligners.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, a one-sentence summary could be: 

The paper proposes an alignment learning framework that improves convergence speed, robustness, and speech quality for both autoregressive and non-autoregressive text-to-speech models by combining forward-sum, Viterbi, and diagonal prior techniques.
