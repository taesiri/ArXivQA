# [One TTS Alignment To Rule Them All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10447)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a generic alignment learning framework that can improve speech-text alignment convergence, robustness, and speech quality across different types of neural TTS models (both autoregressive and non-autoregressive)?

The key hypothesis appears to be that by combining forward-sum, Viterbi, and diagonal alignment priors in an unsupervised alignment learning objective, they can improve alignment learning for neural TTS models in three main ways:

1) Faster convergence of alignments during training

2) More robust alignments, reducing errors on long utterances  

3) Improved overall speech quality as judged by human listeners

The authors propose a framework for unsupervised alignment learning that can be applied to different neural TTS architectures. They show experimentally that this framework improves convergence speed, alignment robustness on long sequences, and speech quality over baseline alignment techniques for several autoregressive and non-autoregressive TTS models. The main goal is developing a generic framework that simplifies TTS training pipelines while also improving alignments and speech synthesis compared to existing methods relying on external alignment tools or pre-trained aligners.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an alignment learning framework that can be applied to various neural text-to-speech (TTS) models, both autoregressive and non-autoregressive, to improve their training and inference. The key points are:

- They propose an unsupervised alignment learning objective based on maximizing the likelihood of text given speech mel-spectrograms. This can be efficiently implemented using the forward-sum algorithm from HMMs.

- They show this objective can be incorporated in both autoregressive TTS models like Tacotron and Flowtron to improve attention learning, as well as non-autoregressive models like FastSpeech 2 and RAD-TTS to eliminate the need for external aligners. 

- The framework improves convergence speed of alignment learning during training across different models. It also improves robustness and reduces errors during inference of long utterances.

- With this framework, they are able to train multi-flow Flowtron and simplify its training pipeline. For non-autoregressive models, they can learn alignments online instead of relying on forced aligners.

- The proposed framework results in better speech quality judged through human evaluation, lower alignment errors, and lower character error rates especially for long utterances.

In summary, the key contribution is a generic alignment learning approach applicable to many TTS architectures, that improves training stability and inference robustness while simplifying the training pipeline by removing dependency on external aligners.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, a one-sentence summary could be: 

The paper proposes an alignment learning framework that improves convergence speed, robustness, and speech quality for both autoregressive and non-autoregressive text-to-speech models by combining forward-sum, Viterbi, and diagonal prior techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on speech-to-text alignment in neural text-to-speech models:

- It proposes a general alignment learning framework that can be applied to both autoregressive and non-autoregressive TTS models. Most prior work has focused on alignment mechanisms for specific model architectures. The framework here seems widely applicable.

- The framework combines forward-backward, Viterbi, and diagonal prior alignment techniques that have been explored separately before. The paper shows that together these can lead to faster and better alignment convergence.

- It compares against strong baselines like location-sensitive attention in Tacotron 2 and Montreal Forced Aligner durations. The alignment framework matches or exceeds the performance of these prior alignment methods.

- It thoroughly evaluates alignment learning along multiple axes - convergence, duration accuracy, synthesis quality, and robustness. This provides a convincing case that the framework improves alignment.

- Unlike some other work, the focus here is purely on learning alignments in a completely unsupervised, end-to-end fashion rather than relying on external alignment tools. This simplifies the TTS pipeline.

Overall, the framework seems flexible, performs well, and is supported by comprehensive experiments. It makes a strong case for end-to-end alignment learning as an integral part of TTS systems rather than relying on external tools. The simplicity and generality of the approach are major advantages compared to prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Testing the alignment learning framework on other TTS architectures beyond the ones explored in this work, such as WaveNet and WaveRNN. The authors state the framework is general and could likely benefit other architectures as well.

- Exploring different formulations and neural network architectures for computing the alignment probabilities P(s_t|x_t). The authors note the framework is agnostic to how these probabilities are obtained.

- Evaluating the alignment learning approach on other voice cloning and multi-speaker TTS tasks. The robustness of the learned alignments could be beneficial in these settings.

- Applying the techniques to low-resource languages where forced aligners may not be readily available. The end-to-end learning could help with aligning speech and text.

- Further improvements to the static prior for accelerating alignment convergence. The simple diagonal prior proved effective, but more optimal learned priors could help. 

- Testing on longer utterances and analyzing if there are still failure cases. Continued improvements to robustness would be useful.

- Analysis of alignment learning in two-stage TTS with separate encoder and decoder training. The framework could potentially help with alignment in this scenario.

So in summary, the main directions are applying the approach to other TTS models and tasks, improving the alignment learning components like the prior and probability modeling, and further evaluation on very long utterances and low-resource languages.
