# [Learning Fair Ranking Policies via Differentiable Optimization of   Ordered Weighted Averages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05252)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Conventional learning to rank (LTR) models maximize relevance to users but can produce biased rankings that disadvantage certain groups. 
- Existing fair LTR methods have limitations in (A) inability to reliably enforce fairness constraints, (B) ineffectiveness in handling multiple protected groups, and (C) inefficiency during training and inference.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a framework called SOFaiR that integrates an Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) fair ranking optimization model into the training loop of an LTR model. 
- It shows how to efficiently solve the OWA model using Frank-Wolfe optimization and how to backpropagate through the discontinuous OWA objective despite not being differentiable.
- This allows end-to-end training to minimize the regret between the optimized fair policy and the true optimal fair policy.

Main Contributions:
1) First framework to integrate OWA-based fair ranking model into end-to-end trainable LTR pipeline.
2) Novel method to backpropagate through OWA optimization despite discontinuities. 
3) Experiments show SOFaiR achieves:
   - Higher fairness satisfaction than previous fair LTR methods
   - Over 10x speedup compared to a previous end-to-end fair LTR method
   - Effectiveness in handling multi-group fairness criteria

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient and scalable approach to integrate precise fairness constraints into end-to-end learning of ranking systems, with competitive utility and superior fairness over previous methods.
