# [BadChain: Backdoor Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12242)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) benefit from chain-of-thought (COT) prompting for complex reasoning tasks. However, COT prompting also introduces new vulnerabilities in the form of backdoor attacks, wherein the model outputs malicious content given a specific trigger.  
- Existing backdoor attacks involve contaminating the training data or directly manipulating model parameters. But these are impractical for commercial LLMs operated via APIs without access to training data or parameters.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose "BadChain", the first backdoor attack against LLMs using COT prompting without needing access to training data or model parameters.

- BadChain inserts a \textit{backdoor reasoning step} into the sequence of reasoning steps to manipulate the final response whenever the input query contains a predefined backdoor trigger.  

- During attack injection, some COT demonstrations are manipulated to incorporate the backdoor reasoning step. Consequently, given any query with the trigger, the LLM will output the backdoor reasoning and altered response.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate BadChain effectiveness across 4 LLMs (GPT-3.5, Llama2, PaLM2, GPT-4) and 6 reasoning tasks, with 85.1%, 76.6%, 87.1%, 97.0% attack success rates respectively. 

- Stronger reasoning LLMs are more susceptible to BadChain. COT strategy leveraging LLM reasoning ability (e.g. self-consistency) also showed higher attack success rates.

- Provide interpretations connecting the trigger and backdoor reasoning step, analyzing logical reasoning of victim LLM. Extensive ablation studies optimize key attack design choices using only 20 examples.  

- Propose two shuffling-based defenses and show their ineffectiveness, underscoring the urgent need to develop robust defenses against such novel attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes BadChain, the first backdoor attack against large language models that uses chain-of-thought prompting to manipulate model reasoning without accessing training data or model parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing BadChain, the first effective backdoor attack against large language models (LLMs) that uses chain-of-thought (COT) prompting. This attack does not require access to the training set or model parameters of the victim LLM.

2) Showing the effectiveness of BadChain for two COT strategies across four LLMs (Llama2, GPT-3.5, PaLM2, and GPT-4) and six complex benchmark tasks involving arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. BadChain achieves high attack success rates of 85.1%, 76.6%, 87.1%, and 97.0% on average across the benchmarks on GPT-3.5, Llama2, PaLM2, and GPT-4, respectively.

3) Demonstrating the interpretability of BadChain by analyzing the relationship between the backdoor trigger and the inserted backdoor reasoning step. Also conducting extensive ablation studies on design choices like trigger type and location.

4) Proposing two shuffling-based defenses and showing their ineffectiveness against BadChain, underscoring the urgency of developing more robust defenses.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing BadChain, an effective and interpretable backdoor attack against LLMs that uses COT prompting, and showing this attack poses a severe threat with the ineffectiveness of initial defenses.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the BadChain method proposed in this paper:

1. How does BadChain leverage the inherent reasoning capabilities of language models compared to prior backdoor attacks against LLMs? What specific component of the attack facilitates this?

2. Why does the attack effectiveness of BadChain improve when using self-consistency prompting strategies? What properties of self-consistency prompting make models more vulnerable? 

3. The paper shows BadChain is highly effective across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. What underlying commonalities across these tasks contribute to the broad applicability of the attack?

4. How does the choice of backdoor trigger in BadChain balance semantic correlation and ease of deployment? What are the tradeoffs?

5. The paper demonstrates GPT-4's increased susceptibility to BadChain compared to smaller models. What factors contribute to larger models being more prone to BadChain specifically? 

6. What exactly causes the shuffling defenses to be ineffective against BadChain? Would any prompt randomization defenses be promising against this type of attack?

7. Can the attack interpretability analysis for BadChain be extended to gain further insights into model vulnerabilities and aid defense development? If so, how?

8. How might the threat model assumptions, regarding lack of output inspection, be addressed to protect against BadChain in practice? What solutions seem viable?

9. The negative societal impacts outlined mainly relate to output deception. What other broader societal risks might emerge from attacks like BadChain?  

10. What defenses seem most promising against BadChain and similar attacks that leverage reasoning manipulation? What makes these approaches suited to defend this class of attacks?

The paper proposes a new backdoor attack called "BadChain" against large language models that use chain-of-thought prompting. It does not require access to the training data or model parameters. The attack works by inserting a "backdoor reasoning step" that correlates a trigger phrase to an unintended model output. Experiments show BadChain succeeds against multiple LLMs and tasks with high attack success rates. The paper also studies the attack's interpretability, design choices, and defenses. It underscores that stronger reasoning models are more vulnerable and that effective defenses are still lacking.
