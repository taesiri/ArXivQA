# [Characteristic AI Agents via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12368)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of academic research on characteristic AI agents (personalized chatbots that mimic real individuals) despite successful commercial products. 
- Existing datasets lack real-life individuals and rely more on abstract personas. 
- There is no standard benchmark to systematically evaluate LLMs for this task.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct "Character100" dataset with 106 real individuals sourced from Wikipedia.
- Explore different techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, finetuning with LoRA/QLoRA) to build characteristic AI agents using LLMs.
- Design automatic evaluation metrics tailored for characteristic AI agents - background knowledge consistency and style consistency.  

Experiments and Analysis:
- Few-shot learning improves background knowledge consistency but can hurt style consistency.
- Instruction tuning significantly boosts performance over base LLMs.  
- Bilingual LLMs decline in performance after finetuning. QLoRA is more effective than LoRA.
- ChatGPT has amazing language capabilities and excels in style consistency.

Main Contributions:
- First academic dataset "Character100" for characteristic AI agent modeling and evaluation.
- Comprehensive assessment of multiple LLMs across different settings for this task. 
- Custom automatic evaluation metrics for background knowledge and style consistency.
- Analysis of strengths and weaknesses of different techniques, providing directions for future work.

The paper systematically investigates LLMs for characteristic AI agents, establishes benchmarks, and offers insights to advance research in this domain.
