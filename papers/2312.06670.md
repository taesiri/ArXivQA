# [Combating the effects of speed and delays in end-to-end self-driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06670)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In end-to-end driving models trained by behavioral cloning, there is a mismatch between the predictive task the model is optimized for (guessing expert actions on a static dataset) and the actual driving task. One difference is that delays exist when deploying the model in the real world, but not when training. 
- Higher speeds make the effects of delays worse, as decisions become more spatially belated. The paper argues that driving at different speeds constitutes different tasks, even just in the predictive sense, not only in the control sense.

Proposed Solutions and Contributions:

1) Demonstrating speed is an important factor:
- Models trained on slow driving fail to drive fast and vice versa, despite slow driving seeming an easier task. This suggests a "task shift".
- For multi-frame models, novel speeds also cause a detectable "input shift", activations inside the network get increasingly different from activations caused by training data.

2) A new method to counteract delays: 
- Instead of minimizing delays, models can be trained to predict actions relevant at the future moment when computation ends. This is achieved by temporally shifting the labels in the training data to match frames with future steering values.
- Models predicting human commands 50ms into the future allow faster driving and cope better with larger computational delays.

The effects are demonstrated on a 1:10 scale car with a Raspberry Pi, showing the ideas transfer to vehicles with limited compute power. Overall, the paper argues we should be aware of the task differences caused by speed and shows a way to account for inevitable delays.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper demonstrates that driving at different speeds constitutes different tasks for end-to-end steering models, and that the effects of computational delays during model deployment can be counteracted by training the models to predict future steering commands instead of simultaneous ones.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Demonstrating that the performance of good driving pipelines may fall apart if deployed at a speed the system was not exposed to during training. The paper discusses the underlying reasons and implications for how on-policy testing should be performed.

2. Demonstrating the degree to which the performance of good driving models suffers due to computational delays. The paper shows that temporally shifting labels in the training data to take into consideration the delays occurring during deployment allows alleviating the problem.

In summary, the paper examines the effects of speed and computational delays on end-to-end driving models, and proposes solutions to counteract these effects. The main contributions are highlighting the problem of task shift due to different speeds, and a method to compensate for computational delays by predicting time-shifted commands during training.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper include:

- End-to-end driving
- Behavioral cloning
- Delays
- Out-of-distribution
- Task shift
- Speed
- On-policy evaluation
- Off-policy evaluation
- Label shifting
- Computational delays
- Spatial belatedness
- Generalization

The paper focuses on end-to-end driving models trained with behavioral cloning, and investigates the effects of different speeds and computational delays. It introduces concepts like task shift, spatial belatedness, and label shifting to account for these effects. Both on-policy and off-policy evaluations are used to measure model performance. Key findings relate to models failing to generalize to novel speeds, as well as counteracting delays by shifting labels to predict future commands.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that driving at different speeds constitutes different tasks, even for single-frame models where the inputs look very similar. Why would this be the case if the mapping from individual frames to steering commands remains the same? What causes the need for different outputs at different speeds?

2. When proposing to counteract delays by predicting future commands instead of minimizing delays, what assumptions is this approach making about the delays at deployment time? What could go wrong if those assumptions do not hold?  

3. The paper demonstrates predicting commands 50ms and 100ms into the future allows driving with higher delays. What factors limit how far into the future useful predictions can be made? At what point would performance probably start degrading?

4. The paper uses 1:10 scale model cars. What considerations would be necessary if transferring these methods to full-sized vehicles? How might the effects demonstrated translate to real self-driving cars?

5. When using label shifting to counteract delays, should the training data itself be transformed or is it sufficient to just change the loss function/labels during training? What are the trade-offs?  

6. How exactly does label shifting change the imitation learning task compared to regular behavioral cloning? Does it make the task harder for the model in some ways while alleviating problems in other ways?

7. The deployment speed is decided by a human judging crashes. Could any more objective automated metrics be used instead to systematically find the maximal safe speed? What precautions are needed if using automated metrics?

8. What other model types beyond behavioral cloning might benefit from label shifting? Where in the pipelines of modular self-driving cars could similar delay compensation mechanisms be introduced?

9. The paper warns that good performance at slow speeds does not guarantee good performance at higher speeds. Should on-policy testing at multiple speeds be a recommendation for the community? What speeds to use?

10. How do the findings about task shifts and OOD issues caused by speed apply to related domains like robotics? What similarities and differences exist?
