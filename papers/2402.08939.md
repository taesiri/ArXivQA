# [Premise Order Matters in Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08939)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper investigates the effect of premise order on the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. 
- It notes that while changing the order of premises does not change the underlying logical reasoning task for humans, it has a significant impact on the accuracy of LLMs.
- Specifically, LLMs perform best when premises are presented in the same order as the steps in the ground truth proof, rather than a random order.

Methods:
- The paper comprehensively evaluates multiple state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-3, GPT-4, PaLM and Gemini on logical and mathematical reasoning tasks.
- It generates variants of reasoning problems with different orderings of the premises based on their correlation to the ground truth proofs.
- Two key factors are varied - number of premises and presence of distracting/irrelevant premises.
- A new benchmark, R-GSM, is introduced for mathematical reasoning based on a subset of GSM8K problems.

Key Findings:
- All LLMs perform significantly worse (30%+ drop in accuracy) when the premise order deviates from the ground truth proof order.  
- The accuracy drop is higher with more premises and in the presence of distracting information.
- While all LLMs prefer the "forward" ground truth order, GPT-3 and GPT-4 also perform decently with the exact reverse order. 
- Error analysis shows LLMs tend to hallucinate facts or make mistakes while trying to follow the sequential premise order.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates and quantifies the significant impact of premise order on LLM reasoning across different models.
- Highlights a key limitation in LLM reasoning arising from their auto-regressive nature/training.
- Introduces a new mathematical reasoning benchmark, R-GSM, for evaluating this effect.
- Lays groundwork for developing techniques to mitigate the ordering effect and enhance LLM reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates how the ordering of premises significantly affects the reasoning performance of large language models, even when the premise order does not alter the underlying reasoning task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is identifying and systematically studying the effect of premise order on the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- The paper shows that changing the order of premises in reasoning tasks significantly impacts the accuracy of LLMs, even though the order does not change the underlying reasoning task. For deductive reasoning tasks, shuffling the premise order can cause a performance drop of over 30% for LLMs.

- The paper introduces a benchmark for studying premise order effects in logical reasoning. By controlling factors like the number of premises and distracting information, the benchmark allows a fine-grained analysis of how premise order impacts different LLMs.  

- The paper proposes a variant of the GSM8K mathematical reasoning dataset called R-GSM to study ordering effects on math word problems. Again, changing the order of sentences while preserving the underlying reasoning task causes a notable performance drop.

- The paper analyzes the types of errors that occur under different premise orders. The common failure modes include incorrectly refuting conclusions, hallucinating non-existent facts or rules, and reasoning mistakes.

In summary, the key contribution is comprehensively demonstrating, via new benchmarks, that premise order significantly and unexpectedly impacts the reasoning accuracy of LLMs, highlighting a limitation in their robustness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Premise order effect - The paper investigates how changing the order of premises in reasoning tasks impacts the performance of large language models, even when the order does not change the underlying reasoning task.

- Deductive reasoning - The paper examines the premise order effect in deductive logical reasoning tasks involving modus ponens.

- Mathematical reasoning - In addition to deductive reasoning, the paper looks at mathematical word problem solving using a dataset based on GSM8K. 

- Kendall tau distance - A measure used in the paper to quantify the difference in premise order compared to the "forward" order that matches the ground truth reasoning steps.

- Performance drop - The paper shows significant drops in accuracy (30%+ in some cases) when the premise order is changed from the forward order.

- Failure modes - Changing premise order seems to align with or exacerbate known LLM failure modes like distractibility and lack of backward/bi-directional reasoning. 

- Benchmark datasets - Logical reasoning benchmarks with controlled premise order and the new GSM-R dataset are introduced to study the effect.

So in summary, key ideas involve the premise order effect itself, the reasoning domains it was studied in, metrics used, performance impacts observed, related LLM weaknesses, and new datasets for analysis.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper claims that premise order significantly impacts LLM reasoning performance even when it does not change the underlying task. Can you expand on why this might be the case? What aspects of LLM design or training might contribute to this sensitivity?

2. The authors categorize premise orders using Kendall's tau distance to the "forward order." What specifically does this metric capture in terms of the relationship between premise order and reasoning process? How was the choice of this metric justified?  

3. For the logical reasoning benchmark, the authors generate variants of each problem with different premise orders. What considerations went into the design of the different orderings analyzed? Why examine orders at specific values of tau rather than sampling orders completely at random?

4. When analyzing model performance on problems with increasing numbers of rules, accuracy drops are larger for some models than others. What explanations are given for these differential drops? How might model capacity or training methodology relate to robustness to premise order changes?  

5. The analysis revealed different preferences in premise orderings across models. For instance, GPT-4 prefers backward orders while PaLM 2-L performs worst on these. What might account for these opposing preferences? How do the authors explain this in terms of model design?

6. Error analysis revealed differences in the types of errors across premise orderings. Notably, fact hallucination errors increased substantially for non-forward orders. Why might disrupting the forward order lead models to hallucinate nonexistent facts? 

7. For the GSM-R dataset, the authors manually rewrite subsets of problems with altered premise order. What guidelines or criteria are used to determine which orderings preserve the original answers? What makes reordering difficult for some problem subsets?

8. On GSM-R, accuracy also drops on problems requiring more reasoning steps. Is the ordering effect exacerbated for longer derivations? Why might premise order sensitivity increase for problems requiring more symbolic manipulation?  

9. The authors connect the observed premise order effects to known LLM limitations like distractibility and poor logical reasoning skills. However, the root causes behind order sensitivity remain unexplained. What kinds of follow-up work could better elucidate the underlying reasons for this effect? 

10. The paper demonstrates the significant impact of premise ordering but does not propose strategies to mitigate this effect. What modeling and training techniques could potentially make LLMs more robust to premise order permutations? What are some challenges associated with this?
