# [Genixer: Empowering Multimodal Large Language Models as a Powerful Data   Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06731)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- High-quality multimodal instruction data is crucial for training robust Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), but acquiring sufficient data is challenging. 
- Manual labeling is expensive and impractical at scale. Using GPT-4 for data generation incurs high costs and may not work well for certain tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces \genixer{}, a novel pipeline to automatically generate high-quality multimodal instruction data to enhance MLLMs.
- \genixer{} collects datasets across 10 multimodal task types and transforms them into instruction-tuning format. It designs instruction templates for subsequent model training.
- \genixer{} trains existing advanced MLLMs like InstructBLIP (for non region-based tasks) and Shikra (for region-based tasks) to generate task-specific instruction data. It employs an effective data filtering strategy to ensure high quality.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes \genixer{}, an innovative multimodal instruction data generation pipeline that enables MLLMs to function as potent data generators at low cost.
- Introduces \kakapo{}, a new performant and reproducible MLLM foundation model for assessing generated data quality.
- Shows \genixer{} generated data significantly improves \kakapo{} and SOTA models on diverse tasks, proving efficacy of the pipeline.

In summary, the paper presents a novel and effective way to automatically generate large-scale high-quality multimodal instruction tuning data through MLLMs to advance model capabilities across domains. The data generator and proposed MLLM foundation model are key contributions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Genixer, a novel pipeline to automatically generate high-quality multimodal instruction data for advancing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a novel data generation pipeline called \genixer{} that enables existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to function as potent data generators for high-quality multimodal instructional data. 

2. It proposes a new foundational MLLM model called \kakapo{} that is designed for data efficiency and robust instructional comprehension through a modularized training paradigm. \kakapo{} achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multimodal tasks.

3. The paper shows through experiments that the data generated by \genixer{} significantly improves the performance of both the base \kakapo{} model and the state-of-the-art Shikra model on various tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed data generation approach.

In summary, the key contribution is the \genixer{} data generation pipeline that leverages capabilities of existing MLLMs to produce high-quality multimodal instruction data for advancing MLLM research. The proposed \kakapo{} model and experimental results further validate the utility of the generated data.
