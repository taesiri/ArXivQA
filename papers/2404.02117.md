# [Pre-trained Vision and Language Transformers Are Few-Shot Incremental   Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02117)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) requires models to learn new classes from limited data without forgetting previous knowledge. FSCIL faces two key challenges - catastrophic forgetting of old classes and overfitting to limited new class data.

- Prior FSCIL methods rely on shallow models like ResNet-18 to mitigate forgetting and overfitting. However, their limited capacity hinders knowledge transfer across sessions. 

- The paper investigates using large pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) for FSCIL. Experiments find directly applying ViTs to existing methods is ineffective due to catastrophic forgetting in incremental sessions.

Proposed Solution - PriViLege Framework:  
- Proposes PriViLege - a framework using pre-trained ViTs with prompting functions and knowledge distillation for effective FSCIL.

- Introduces Pre-trained Knowledge Tuning (PKT) to selectively fine-tune ViT layers using additional prompts. Learns domain knowledge while preserving useful pre-trained knowledge.

- Uses base prompt (B-Prompt) and vision-language prompt (VL-Prompt) during PKT for better knowledge transfer across sessions. 

- Further assists B-Prompt updates via proposed modulation prompts for effective domain knowledge capture.

- Enhances discriminative learning via proposed entropy-based divergence loss for the vision token in VL-Prompt. 

- Distills semantic knowledge from language models into VL-Prompt's language token using proposed semantic knowledge distillation loss. Improves representation learning.

Main Contributions:
- Novel PriViLege framework to effectively utilize pre-trained ViTs for FSCIL using well-designed prompting and knowledge distillation.

- Pre-trained Knowledge Tuning technique to balance pre-trained and domain knowledge acquisition in ViTs.

- Entropy-based divergence loss to improve discriminative ability of vision tokens during base session.  

- Semantic knowledge distillation to provide semantic guidance from language models.

- Experiments show PriViLege significantly outperforms prior FSCIL methods across benchmarks. Enables large ViT models to be highly effective few-shot incremental learners.
