# [Decision Making in Non-Stationary Environments with Policy-Augmented   Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03197)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenge of sequential decision-making under uncertainty in non-stationary environments, where the dynamics of the environment can change over time. Two main approaches exist - reinforcement learning (RL) to learn a policy, and online planning methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, RL policies can become stale when the environment changes, and retraining takes time. On the other hand, MCTS requires significant computation time to find good actions. The paper explores how to combine the strengths of both approaches.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a hybrid algorithm called Policy-Augmented MCTS (PA-MCTS) that combines a previously learned policy with online MCTS search. The key idea is that if the environment has not changed too much, the old policy still provides useful guidance. PA-MCTS selects actions based on a convex combination of Q-values from the old policy and value estimates from MCTS. This allows it to leverage prior learning while accommodating changes through online search.

Main Contributions:

- Conceptually shows how offline learning and online search can be combined for decision-making in non-stationary MDPs

- Develops the PA-MCTS algorithm that combines MCTS and a stale policy completely outside the search tree 

- Provides theoretical analysis on conditions for optimality of PA-MCTS actions

- Demonstrates empirically across multiple OpenAI Gym environments that PA-MCTS outperforms standard MCTS, Deep Q-Learning, and AlphaZero in non-stationary settings, especially with limited computation budgets

- Shows that PA-MCTS accommodates uncertainty in the model of environment changes and is robust to such noisy settings

In summary, the key insight is that combining online planning with prior, even stale knowledge can help agents quickly adapt their actions when an environment changes. The paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions towards this hybrid decision-making approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a hybrid approach called Policy-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search that combines a previously learned policy with online Monte Carlo tree search to enable quick adaptation to changes in non-stationary environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

1. Conceptually, the core contribution is the idea that offline planning and online search can be combined for decision-making in non-stationary environments.

2. The paper presents two algorithms to operationalize this idea:
(a) A novel algorithm called Policy-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (PA-MCTS) that combines a stale policy with MCTS after the search, completely outside the tree. Several theoretical results are presented for this approach.  
(b) Showing that existing hybrid approaches like AlphaZero can also be used for decision-making in non-stationary environments.

3. The paper validates the proposed approach using four open-source environments from OpenAI Gym and compares it with other state-of-the-art approaches like AlphaZero and Deep Q-Learning. Experiments show that:
(a) Given a specific computational budget, the PA-MCTS framework converges to significantly better decisions than standard MCTS.  
(b) Online search makes the approach significantly more robust to environmental changes than standard state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, the main contribution is the conceptual idea of combining offline planning and online search for decision-making in non-stationary environments, along with two algorithms to achieve this and experimental validation of the ideas.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- OpenAI Gym environments

The paper introduces the concept of transition-bounded non-stationary MDPs to model environments where the dynamics can change abruptly between the training and execution phases. It proposes a hybrid approach called Policy-Augmented MCTS that combines online search using MCTS with action-value estimates from a previously learned policy to make decisions. Theoretical results are provided on the performance of PA-MCTS and it is evaluated on OpenAI Gym environments against baselines like AlphaZero and Deep Q-learning. The key terms above capture the core ideas and techniques explored in this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The key intuition behind the proposed PA-MCTS method is to combine the strengths of reinforcement learning and online planning for decision-making in non-stationary environments. Can you expand more on why this combination is useful and the limitations of using either approach in isolation?

2. PA-MCTS essentially performs a convex combination of Q-values from a pre-trained policy and value estimates from MCTS. Can you explain the rationale behind this design choice and why simply using either the policy Q-values or the MCTS estimates may not be optimal? 

3. One of the theoretical results shows conditions under which PA-MCTS will return the optimal one-step action. Walk through the key steps in this proof and explain the significance of parameters like $\psi$, $\epsilon$, and $\delta$. 

4. The authors propose a method to select the Î± parameter based on running PA-MCTS with limited iterations. Explain this approach and why it seems to work well in approximating the optimal $\alpha$. What are some limitations?

5. Compare and contrast the proposed PA-MCTS approach with AlphaZero. What are similarities and differences in how they incorporate learning and search? Why does PA-MCTS outperform AlphaZero in some experiments?

6. The core idea of PA-MCTS is fairly simple, yet it demonstrates strong empirical performance. In your opinion, what is the key insight that contributes to its effectiveness? How might you extend or modify the approach?

7. Discuss the theoretical bound derived on the deviation between following the PA-MCTS policy versus an optimal policy. How is this result proven? How tight is this bound and how might it be improved? 

8. The experiments consider different ways of inducing non-stationarity in the environments. Pick one method and explain how the dynamics change and why that creates a challenge for decision-making.

9. The paper defines a new class of problems called transition-bounded non-stationary MDPs. Explain this formulation and how it differs from prior representations of non-stationarity. What are its limitations?

10. The empirical evaluation relies heavily on using simple toy environments from OpenAI Gym. Discuss the pros and cons of this evaluation approach. How might you design additional experiments to better validate the real-world applicability of PA-MCTS?
