# [One-Time Universal Hashing Quantum Digital Signatures without Perfect   Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.1132)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether quantum keys with imperfect secrecy (i.e., partial information leakage) can be used for quantum digital signatures (QDS) without compromising security. The key hypothesis is that imperfect quantum keys with some secrecy leakage can still protect the authenticity and integrity of messages when combined with almost XOR universal (AXU) hash functions in a QDS scheme. This is in contrast to previous work that required quantum keys with perfect secrecy (no information leakage) for secure QDS.The paper proposes and analyzes a new QDS protocol using imperfect keys and AXU hashing, aiming to show that:1) Imperfect keys are sufficient for secure authentication based on AXU hashing, despite some leakage.2) A QDS scheme can exploit this to directly use imperfect keys from quantum key distribution, without the need for complete privacy amplification that introduces delays. 3) This allows significant improvements in efficiency and practicality of QDS, with security still preserved.In summary, the central hypothesis is that imperfect keys can be securely used in QDS by utilizing AXU hash functions, enabling more efficient and practical schemes. The analysis and simulations aim to support this.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new quantum digital signature (QDS) scheme that utilizes imperfect quantum keys with partial secrecy leakage to sign multi-bit messages. Unlike previous QDS protocols that require perfect quantum keys generated through full quantum key distribution (QKD) procedures, this scheme removes the need for complex and time-consuming privacy amplification in the key distribution stage. The users just need to perform key generation and error correction to share keys with correctness but some secrecy leakage. These imperfect keys are proven to be sufficient for signing messages through one-time almost XOR universal hashing, providing information-theoretic security. Simulations show the proposed protocol significantly improves signature rates and transmission distances compared to conventional single-bit QDS schemes. For instance, it achieves a signature rate nearly eight orders of magnitude higher for signing a megabit message. Based on twin-field QKD it reaches 650 km with 0.01 signatures per second. This work reduces the resource cost of QDS and is highly practical and compatible with future quantum networks. It also presents a new approach of applying imperfect quantum keys to cryptographic tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new quantum digital signature (QDS) protocol that utilizes imperfect quantum keys without privacy amplification to sign multi-bit messages. Previous QDS protocols required perfect quantum keys generated through complex privacy amplification, making them computationally expensive and slow. This new protocol removes the need for privacy amplification by using quantum keys with some information leakage. It is based on the framework of one-time universal hashing (OTUH) QDS, which signs the hash of a message rather than each bit individually. The distribution stage generates correlated bit strings through quantum key distribution without privacy amplification. In the messaging stage, the hash of the message is encrypted using the imperfect quantum keys and sent as the signature. Security analysis shows the protocol provides information-theoretic security for signing multi-bit messages despite the imperfect keys. Simulations demonstrate the protocol has superior signature rates compared to previous QDS schemes, with negligible impact from message length. For signing 1 Mb messages it achieves over 8 orders of magnitude higher rate. By removing privacy amplification it also significantly reduces computational cost and delays. This is the first protocol to use imperfect quantum keys for an information-theoretically secure cryptographic task, providing a practical approach to QDS implementation.In summary, this paper puts forth a new QDS protocol that utilizes imperfect quantum keys to achieve higher efficiency in signing multi-bit messages. By removing the need for complex and slow privacy amplification, it enables a practical approach to implementing digital signatures with information-theoretic security. The ability to use imperfect keys is a novel concept that could be extended to other quantum cryptographic protocols as well.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a quantum digital signature (QDS) protocol that uses imperfect quantum keys with partial secrecy leakage instead of keys with perfect secrecy. In the distribution stage, the users generate correlated bit strings through quantum key distribution without performing privacy amplification. This results in keys that are fully correct but have some secrecy leakage. In the messaging stage, the users utilize these imperfect keys to sign the hash value of a message using one-time almost XOR universal hashing. The paper shows that despite the leakage, the authentication based on hashing is still information-theoretically secure. By removing the need for privacy amplification, which requires cumbersome matrix operations, the proposed protocol significantly reduces computational cost and delays compared to previous QDS schemes requiring perfect keys. Overall, the main method is using imperfect quantum keys with bounded secrecy leakage and proving this is sufficient for secure authentication via hashing in order to improve the efficiency of QDS.
