# [One-Time Universal Hashing Quantum Digital Signatures without Perfect   Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.1132)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether quantum keys with imperfect secrecy (i.e., partial information leakage) can be used for quantum digital signatures (QDS) without compromising security. The key hypothesis is that imperfect quantum keys with some secrecy leakage can still protect the authenticity and integrity of messages when combined with almost XOR universal (AXU) hash functions in a QDS scheme. This is in contrast to previous work that required quantum keys with perfect secrecy (no information leakage) for secure QDS.The paper proposes and analyzes a new QDS protocol using imperfect keys and AXU hashing, aiming to show that:1) Imperfect keys are sufficient for secure authentication based on AXU hashing, despite some leakage.2) A QDS scheme can exploit this to directly use imperfect keys from quantum key distribution, without the need for complete privacy amplification that introduces delays. 3) This allows significant improvements in efficiency and practicality of QDS, with security still preserved.In summary, the central hypothesis is that imperfect keys can be securely used in QDS by utilizing AXU hash functions, enabling more efficient and practical schemes. The analysis and simulations aim to support this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Proposes a new quantum digital signature (QDS) protocol that uses imperfect quantum keys without privacy amplification. This removes the need for complex and time-consuming post-processing steps like privacy amplification. 2. Proves that keys with partial secrecy leakage can still protect the authenticity and integrity of messages when combined with almost XOR universal (AXU) hash functions. This enables the use of imperfect keys in the proposed protocol.3. Demonstrates through simulations that the proposed protocol has superior signature rates compared to previous single-bit QDS schemes, especially for long messages. It is also robust against message size and achieves transmission distances of 650 km.4. Provides a general framework compatible with any quantum key distribution protocol, making the scheme versatile. 5. First demonstration of using quantum keys with imperfect secrecy for an application (digital signatures) with information-theoretic security. Opens up possibilities for other applications of such imperfect keys.6. Significantly reduces computational cost and delays compared to schemes like one-time universal hashing QDS that require perfect keys, making the protocol more practical.In summary, the key innovation is using imperfect quantum keys for digital signatures by combining it with AXU hashing, which removes cumbersome post-processing and results in a practical high-rate QDS scheme. This presents a new approach for quantum cryptography.
