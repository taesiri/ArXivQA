# [Data-Free Hard-Label Robustness Stealing Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05924)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Data-Free Hard-Label Robustness Stealing Attack":

Problem:
- Machine learning models deployed as services (MLaaS) are vulnerable to model stealing attacks where attackers can query the model to train a clone. 
- Most prior work assumes availability of soft labels from the target model and a proxy dataset with similar distribution to the private target data.
- However, in reality MLaaS often only provides hard labels without any soft outputs, and obtaining similar proxy data is difficult.  
- Furthermore, prior attacks mainly steal accuracy rather than robustness which is crucial for security-sensitive applications. Improving robustness necessitates expensive techniques like adversarial training.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper introduces a novel Data-Free Hard-Label Robustness Stealing (DFHL-RS) attack to steal both accuracy and robustness using only hard labels without any natural data.
- It proposes High-Entropy Examples (HEE) which can better characterize the classification boundaries compared to prior approaches like Uncertain Examples. 
- A two stage framework is designed:
   - Stage 1: Train a generator to synthesize substitute data guided by the clone model. Apply techniques like label smoothing and data augmentation to prevent overfitting.
   - Stage 2: Construct HEE using the synthetic data, query target model for hard labels, and use them to train the clone model to mimic predictions of target model on HEE.

Main Contributions:
- First work to achieve robustness stealing under the challenging data-free and hard-label black-box setting.
- Concept of High-Entropy Examples that can effectively characterize classification boundaries.  
- A two stage training framework relying only on hard labels from the target model.
- Extensive experiments validate effectiveness and stability of the attack framework, significantly outperforming baselines.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel data-free hard-label robustness stealing attack that can effectively steal both accuracy and robustness of a target model by only querying it for hard labels without using any natural data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. For the first time, they explore a novel attack namely Data-Free Hard-Label Robustness Stealing (DFHL-RS) to achieve both accuracy and robustness stealing by leveraging only hard labels without any natural data.

2. They propose the concept of High-Entropy Examples (HEE), which can better characterize the complete shape of the classification boundary. 

3. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of their proposed attack framework under various configurations.

The paper proposes a novel data-free hard-label robustness stealing (DFHL-RS) attack to steal both accuracy and robustness of a target model by only querying it for hard labels, without needing any natural data. Key concepts include using high-entropy examples to characterize the decision boundaries, generating substitute data to approximate the target data distribution, and alternately optimizing the substitute data generator and training the clone model. The method aims to steal model robustness in addition to accuracy, in a challenging black-box setting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new concept called High-Entropy Examples (HEE). How are HEE constructed and why are they better at characterizing the classification boundaries compared to prior work like Uncertain Examples (UE)?

2. The method operates in a data-free setting without access to any natural training data. What techniques are used to generate substitute training data and how is overfitting to the clone model prevented? 

3. The method consists of two alternating stages - substitute data generation and clone model training. Explain the objectives and techniques used in each of these stages. What is the motivation behind separating them?  

4. The clone model is used to guide the training of the generator in the first stage. Wouldn't this cause the distribution of synthetic data to shift over epochs as the clone model improves? How does the method address this?

5. What is the motivation behind using a memory bank to store all previously generated substitute data? Why can't the clone model just be trained on the current batch in each epoch?

6. High-Entropy Examples (HEE) are used to query the target model when training the clone model. Why are strong augmentations applied before constructing the HEE? 

7. How does the proposed method eliminate catastrophic forgetting, a common issue in prior data-free knowledge distillation techniques?

8. The method aims to achieve both accuracy and robustness stealing. What modifications could be made to focus more on stealing either accuracy or robustness?

9. How does the query budget of this method compare to prior data-free approaches? What are the main hyperparameters controlling the query budget?

10. The method assumes a hard-label black-box setting. What changes would need to be made if soft-labels were available from the target model?
