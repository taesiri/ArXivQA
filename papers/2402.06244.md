# [Quantifying and Enhancing Multi-modal Robustness with Modality   Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06244)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-modal models that combine information from different modalities (e.g. text, images, audio) have shown promising capabilities but can be vulnerable to perturbations like attacks on individual modalities or missing modalities. 
- There is a lack of theoretical understanding of what makes multi-modal models robust and why they can be vulnerable to attacks on specific modalities.

Key Ideas and Contributions:

- The paper theoretically analyzes the robustness of multi-modal models and identifies two key components: 
    1) larger uni-modal representation margins 
    2) reasonable integration across modalities
that lead to higher certified robustness to perturbations.

- It discovers that multi-modal models often exhibit preference towards a particular modality which impacts the two components:
    1) Preferred modality limits learning from other modalities, resulting in smaller margins
    2) Large integration factors for preferred (but potentially vulnerable) modality amplifies effects of attacks

- These factors explain why multi-modal models can be especially vulnerable to attacks on specific preferred modalities.

- The paper proposes a Certifiable Robust Multi-modal Training (CRMT) method with two steps:
    1) Enlarging representation margins for unreliable modalities to alleviate imbalance
    2) Adjusting integration factors across modalities to improve certified bound

- Experiments show CRMT enhances both performance and robustness over baselines. The method generalizes well by combining with other robust training techniques like adversarial training.

In summary, the key contributions are - (i) Theoretical analysis quantifying how uni-modal margins and integration factors impact multi-modal robustness, (ii) Explaining origin of vulnerability towards certain modalities due to modality preference, (iii) A new training method CRMT that demonstrably improves robustness.
