# [Low-Cost Teleoperation with Haptic Feedback through Vision-based Tactile   Sensors for Rigid and Soft Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16764)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Haptic feedback is essential for humans to successfully perform complex and delicate manipulation tasks. However, bringing camera-based tactile sensor data into affordable hardware for teleoperating robots is still an open challenge.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel Tactile-to-Haptic (T2H) teleoperation framework that translates tactile sensor readings into haptic vibration feedback on a consumer-grade virtual reality controller (Oculus Quest 2). 
- The framework enables teleoperating a Franka robot equipped with low-cost DIGIT tactile sensors using the VR controller.
- The controller's 6D motion is mapped to robot end effector velocities. Trigger buttons control the gripper.
- Tactile images are processed to detect pixel-level variation compared to a background. More variation leads to higher vibration amplitude on the controller.
- A slippage prevention behavior is introduced where the grasp automatically tightens when slippage is detected autonomously.

Main Contributions:
- Novel T2H algorithm to provide intuitive haptic feedback from vision-based tactile sensors during teleoperation.
- Demonstration of teleoperating real robot to successfully manipulate 9 objects (rigid and delicate) using proposed framework. Tests conducted by 3 users.
- Introduction of slippage prevention behavior to improve efficiency and prevent damage.
- Utilization of only affordable, off-the-shelf hardware, enhancing cost-effectiveness.
- Publicly available implementation to ensure reproducibility.

In summary, the paper enables affordable yet effective teleoperation for delicate tasks by innovatively connecting vision-based tactile sensing with consumer haptics. The real-world demonstration with fragile objects highlights the framework's applicability.
