# [HICO-DET-SG and V-COCO-SG: New Data Splits for Evaluating the Systematic   Generalization Performance of Human-Object Interaction Detection Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09948)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces two new sets of data splits for the popular HICO-DET and V-COCO human-object interaction (HOI) detection datasets, named HICO-DET-SG and V-COCO-SG. These new splits are designed to evaluate the systematic generalization capability of HOI models - i.e. their ability to generalize to novel combinations of known objects and interactions at test time. The train and test sets of the new splits contain non-overlapping combinations of objects and interactions. The authors evaluated several recent HOI detection models on the new splits and found significant performance drops compared to the original splits, highlighting the difficulty of systematic generalization in this task. By analyzing the results, they identified increasing train set diversity, using modular model architectures, leveraging pretraining, and integrating commonsense knowledge as promising future directions. Overall, this paper presents the first benchmarks for systematically evaluating generalization in HOI detection and provides analysis and insights to guide further research towards models that can generalize compositionally. The new splits and evaluation results reveal systematic generalization as a challenging open problem in HOI detection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The authors created new data splits for two human-object interaction detection datasets to evaluate models on their ability to systematically generalize to novel combinations of known objects and interactions, and found that current models perform much worse on these new splits compared to the original splits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Creation of two new sets of HOI detection data splits named HICO-DET-SG and V-COCO-SG based on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets, respectively. These new splits serve for studying systematic generalization in HOI detection by ensuring no overlapping object-interaction combinations between train and test data.

2. Evaluation of systematic generalization performances of four representative HOI detection models (HOTR, QPIC, FGAHOI, STIP) on the new data splits. The results revealed a large degradation compared to the original splits, highlighting the difficulty of systematic generalization in HOI detection.

3. Analysis of the results to gain insights for improving systematic generalization performance of HOI models. Four possible future research directions were identified: (1) increasing diversity of train data, (2) introducing modular model structures, (3) utilizing pretraining, (4) integrating commonsense knowledge.

In summary, the key contribution is the creation of new benchmark splits to enable studying an important but previously unevaluated capability (systematic generalization) of HOI detection models, along with analysis to provide directions for future work in this area.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes new systematic generalization (SG) splits of the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets. What were the key considerations and steps when creating these new SG splits? How do they differ from the original splits?

2. The paper finds a large performance gap between the original splits and SG splits across different HOI detection models. What architectural or algorithmic factors do you think contribute most to this performance gap? 

3. The two-stage model STIP performs better on the SG splits compared to one-stage models. How might the modular architecture provide benefits for systematic generalization? What refinements could be made to one-stage models to improve performance?

4. Pre-training the encoders and decoders is shown to boost performance on the SG splits. What benefits does pre-training provide in terms of representations or optimization that may aid systematic generalization? 

5. The paper identifies increasing train data diversity as one way to potentially improve systematic generalization. What specific strategies could be used to increase diversity? How might synthetic data augmentation help?

6. External knowledge is suggested to potentially help with systematic generalization. What kinds of knowledge sources do you think would be most useful? How can they be effectively integrated into models?

7. The paper analyzes some common failure cases on the SG splits. What other error analysis could be done to further understand performance on SG splits?

8. How well do you expect state-of-the-art HOI detection models to perform on the proposed SG splits compared to models analyzed in the paper? What advances might help close this performance gap?

9. Beyond the directions identified in the paper, what other modifications could be made to model architectures, training procedures, or evaluation protocols to measure and improve systematic generalization of HOI detection models? 

10. The SG splits require detecting novel combinations of seen objects and interactions. How do you expect current models to perform on detecting completely novel objects or interactions not seen during training? What capabilities would be needed to recognize unseen concepts?
