# [Deep Dict: Deep Learning-based Lossy Time Series Compressor for IoT Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10396)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Internet of Things (IoT) devices generate massive volumes of time series data that is costly to store and transmit. Efficient data compression techniques are needed. 
- Lossy compression can achieve much higher compression ratios compared to lossless compression by allowing some bounded error.
- Existing autoencoder-based compressors encode time series into real-valued latent states, limiting compression ratio due to large size of latent states.  
- Common regression losses like L1/L2 have limitations in handling noise and outliers.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes Deep Dict, a deep learning based lossy time series compressor with two key components:
  1) Bernoulli Transformer Autoencoder (BTAE): Learns compact Bernoulli distributed latent states instead of real-valued states. This significantly reduces size of latent states.
  2) Distortion Constraint: Limits prediction error of BTAE to desired range by quantizing the residual and losslessly compress it.

- Introduces Quantized Entropy Loss (QEL) tailored to compression task - directly minimizes entropy of quantized residual for higher compression ratio. More robust to outliers than L1/L2 loss.

- Decoder architecture includes relative positional encoding to capture meaningful patterns in truncated time series segments.


Main Contributions:

- Novel BTAE framework to reduce size of latent states via Bernoulli distribution
- Distortion constraint to bound reconstruction error  
- Custom loss function QEL that enhances compression ratio by minimizing residual entropy

- Evaluation over 10 diverse time series datasets shows Deep Dict achieves over 50% higher compression ratio than state-of-the-art methods

- QEL demonstrates better compression ratio than L1/L2 losses

- Transfer learning retains high compression ratio to accelerate Deep Dict

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative deep learning framework for IoT time series compression that significantly advances compression ratio over existing methods via compact latent state representation and custom entropy minimization loss function.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a deep learning-based lossy time series compression method called Deep Dict that achieves high compression ratios for IoT sensor data by using a Bernoulli transformer autoencoder and a novel loss function tailored to minimize the compressed size.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A new compression framework called Deep Dict is proposed for lossy compression of time series data generated from IoT devices. Results show it achieves higher compression ratios than state-of-the-art compressors.

2. A novel Bernoulli transformer-based autoencoder (BTAE) is proposed that can effectively reduce the size of latent states and reconstruct IoT time series from the Bernoulli latent states. 

3. A new loss function called quantized entropy loss (QEL) is introduced, which is tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem. QEL outperforms conventional regression losses like L1 and L2 in terms of resulting compression ratio. The loss function is adaptable for use with any prediction-based compression method employing uniform quantization and an entropy coder.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) the Deep Dict compression framework, (2) the BTAE model, and (3) the QEL loss function, which together enable improved lossy compression performance on IoT time series data.
