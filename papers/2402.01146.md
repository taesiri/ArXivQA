## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Online pairwise learning is important for problems like AUC maximization, metric learning, etc. where the loss function is defined on pairs of examples. However, the computational complexity grows quadratically with number of examples.
- Prior buffer-based online methods assume iid data and have limits in generalization bounds or computational efficiency. 
- Kernelized online pairwise learning has received little attention but suffers from computational challenges in kernel calculations.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose an online gradient descent algorithm called AOGD that works with kernelized pairwise models.
- Maintain a moving average of past data and randomly sample an example to compute gradients. This avoids handling entire history.
- Approximate kernels using Random Fourier Features to enable efficient computation. Use only O(sqrt(T)logT) features.  
- Analysis shows AOGD works for non-iid data, gets sublinear regret bound with buffer size of O(1) under reasonable assumptions, and low kernel approximation error.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces lightweight online kernelized pairwise learning algorithm that works for non-linear models and non-iid data
- Handles non-iid data by using moving average and random example for gradient computation  
- Uses only O(sqrt(T)logT) Fourier features to approximate kernel with sublinear error
- Validation on real-world datasets shows improved AUC maximization over state-of-the-art online and batch pairwise methods
- Provides theoretical analysis to show sublinear regret bounds under reasonable assumptions

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient online gradient descent approach for kernelized pairwise learning that works for non-linear models and non-iid data streams. It makes key contributions in areas of computational efficiency, regret analysis and empirical performance for problems like AUC maximization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a lightweight online kernelized pairwise learning algorithm that handles non-iid data, approximates kernels efficiently using random Fourier features to reduce complexity, and achieves sublinear regret bounds.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces an online pairwise learning algorithm that can handle non-linear models and does not require the independence assumption on the example arrivals. 

2. It addresses the issue of non-iid data on regret by using both a random sample and a moving average to estimate the gradient. This helps enhance the regret rate.

3. For kernelized learning, it shows that using only $O(\sqrt{T}\log{T})$ random Fourier features is enough to approximate the Gaussian kernel while still ensuring a sublinear regret bound. This significantly reduces the complexity compared to previous approaches that required $O(T)$ features.

4. It validates the proposed algorithm on several real-world datasets and shows improved performance over state-of-the-art methods on AUC maximization.

In summary, the key innovations are in developing an online kernelized pairwise learning algorithm that can handle non-iid data with low complexity for kernel approximations. The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The paper proposes an online pairwise learning algorithm that works with non-linear models by using kernel methods. It uses online gradient descent with a moving average and random examples to efficiently compute the gradients. Random Fourier features are used to approximate the kernel functions to reduce computational complexity. Theoretical regret bounds are provided, showing the algorithm can achieve sublinear regret with only O(sqrt(T) log T) random features under certain conditions, compared to O(T) features normally needed. The method is designed to handle non-IID data in adversarial environments. Experiments demonstrate improved AUC maximization performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.

In summary, the key focus is on an efficient online pairwise learning approach for non-linear kernels that scales well and handles non-IID data. The main techniques used are kernel approximation with random Fourier features and online gradient descent with dynamic averaging.
