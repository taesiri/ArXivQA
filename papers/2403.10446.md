# [Enhancing LLM Factual Accuracy with RAG to Counter Hallucinations: A   Case Study on Domain-Specific Queries in Private Knowledge-Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10446)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end system to improve the factual accuracy of large language models (LLMs) when answering domain-specific and time-sensitive queries related to private knowledge bases. 

The key problem being addressed is that LLMs often hallucinate or generate unreliable, incorrect, or irrelevant answers to queries. To counter this, the authors integrate a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to provide relevant contextual information to guide the LLM.

The system has three main components:

1. Dataset Creation: A web crawler gathers raw data from CMU websites which is cleaned and processed into a corpus focused on CMU and the Language Technologies Institute. Additional academic papers are integrated and an annotation process generates question-answer pairs tailored to this context.

2. RAG Pipeline: This connects the LLM to the external dataset. A context retriever identifies and returns relevant snippets for a given query. A generative LLM model then utilizes this to generate an accurate, contextualized answer.

3. Experiments: Evaluations demonstrate the system can reliably answer specialized, time-sensitive queries related to CMU/LTI by grounding the LLM in the curated dataset. Ablation studies reveal benefits of fine-tuning different components.

In summary, the system effectively addresses LLM hallucinations for domain-specific queries by coupling the external knowledge in the dataset with the reasoning capabilities of a large language model. The context retriever and curated dataset are critical to improving factual accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an end-to-end system design for utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation to improve the factual accuracy of large language models on domain-specific and time-sensitive queries related to private knowledge bases. The system integrates a RAG pipeline with upstream data processing and downstream performance evaluation to address the challenge of language model hallucinations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Creation of a Specialized Dataset: The authors curated a comprehensive and accurate dataset focused on Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the Language Technology Institute (LTI), using a custom web crawler and automated annotation process.

2. Development of a RAG Pipeline: The authors innovated a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipeline utilizing state-of-the-art research findings to ensure advanced linguistic pattern handling capabilities. 

3. Extensive Experiment-based Evaluation: Through rigorous experiments, including ablation studies and case studies, the authors demonstrated the performance of their system in providing factually accurate and contextually relevant answers to domain-specific and time-sensitive queries.

In summary, the key contribution is the development and evaluation of a question-answering system that leverages a tailored dataset and RAG pipeline to address the challenge of factual inaccuracies/hallucinations in large language models when answering specialized queries. The system shows potential for improving performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.
