# [Bootstrapping Objectness from Videos by Relaxed Common Fate and Visual   Grouping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08025)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we learn to segment objects in videos in a completely unsupervised manner, without relying on manually annotated data?

The key hypothesis is that object segmentation can be learned by:

1) Bootstrapping objectness from motion cues based on a relaxed version of the Gestalt principle of "common fate", allowing parts of objects to move at slightly different speeds. 

2) Then refining the motion-based object segments using visual appearance grouping cues within and across images, to handle issues like object articulation and reflections.

The authors propose a two-stage approach called RCF that implements this idea of bootstrapping objectness from relaxed common fate cues and then refining via visual appearance grouping. Their experiments demonstrate RCF can learn to segment objects in an unsupervised manner and outperforms prior unsupervised methods by significant margins.

In summary, the paper addresses the challenge of unsupervised video object segmentation by proposing a novel approach to bootstrap objectness from motion cues and refine it using visual appearance, without requiring any manually annotated supervision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The key contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel unsupervised video object segmentation method called RCF (Relaxed Common Fate) that segments objects in videos without using any human annotations. 

2. Introducing a motion-supervised object discovery stage that follows the principle of "relaxed common fate". It allows parts of an articulated or deformable object to move at slightly different speeds, overcoming the limitation of strict "common fate" assumption.

3. Presenting an appearance refinement stage that leverages both low-level and high-level visual cues to correct misconceptions from motion supervision.

4. Developing a label-free hyperparameter tuning technique based on motion-appearance alignment, enabling tuning critical hyperparameters like number of masks without human labels. 

5. Achieving new state-of-the-art performance on common UVOS benchmarks like DAVIS16, SegTrackv2 and FBMS59. The gains over previous methods are substantial, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed ideas.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel unsupervised video object segmentation framework that can discover full objectness from videos without using any labels at training or inference time. This is enabled by the concepts of relaxed common fate and joint motion-appearance learning.
