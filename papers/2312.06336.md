# [Vehicle Lane Change Prediction based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings and   Bayesian Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06336)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a vehicle lane change prediction method based on contextual linguistic information, knowledge graphs, and Bayesian reasoning. It converts numerical input data like vehicle velocity and time-to-collision risk levels into semantic categories. These are used to build a knowledge graph linking vehicles, intentions, risks, etc. The graph is embedded using TransE, allowing probabilistic Bayesian inference for prediction. The key novelty is utilizing symbolic knowledge and reasoning, instead of just trajectories, for more generalized, interpretable predictions. Evaluated on the HighD highway dataset, it maintains 97.95% F1 score predicting 2 seconds before a lane change, and 93.60% accuracy 3 seconds before, outperforming previous trajectory-based approaches. The interpretable predictions enable explaining the rationale, facilitating trust. Potential limitations are reliance on thresholded categories and assuming accurate sensory inputs. Key future work is testing on more datasets and integrating uncertainty modeling. Overall, it demonstrates the promise of knowledge representations and reasoning for intention prediction.
