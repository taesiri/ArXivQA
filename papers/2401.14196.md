# [DeepSeek-Coder: When the Large Language Model Meets Programming -- The   Rise of Code Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14196)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have transformed code intelligence, but most state-of-the-art models are closed-source, restricting research and development.  
- There is a significant performance gap between existing open-source code models and proprietary models like Codex and GPT-3.5.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce DeepSeek-Coder (DSC), a series of open-source code models ranging from 1.3B to 33B parameters, trained from scratch on a high-quality 2 trillion token code corpus.
- Models employ a fill-in-the-blank pretraining task with 16K context window to enhance code generation and completion.  
- Data is organized at the repository level during pretraining to improve cross-file understanding.
- An instructed version, DSC-Instruct, is created via fine-tuning on high-quality human instructions to boost few-shot capabilities.

Main Contributions:
- DSC models achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source code models, surpassing CodeLLama and StarCoder across benchmarks.
- DSC-Base 33B outperforms proprietary GPT-3.5 Turbo model on most tasks.
- Despite 5x fewer parameters, DSC-Base 7B is competitive with CodeLLama-33B.  
- Analysis provides insights into efficacy of fill-in-middle strategies for code model pretraining.
- DSC models are available under a permissive license, enabling research and commercial use.

In summary, this paper introduces the DeepSeek-Coder series to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in open-source code models while narrowing the gap to proprietary models like GPT-3.5 and Codex. The models, data and analyses open up new possibilities for code intelligence research and applications.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a "fill-in-the-blank" pre-training objective to enhance code infilling capabilities. Can you elaborate on why this approach is more effective than just relying on next token prediction? What are the tradeoffs?

2. Repository-level data construction is utilized during the pre-training phase to better capture dependencies between files. Can you explain the algorithm used for the topological sort and how cycles in the dependency graph are handled? 

3. What is the motivation behind using the PSM mode rather than the SPM mode for the Fill-In-The-Middle (FIM) objective? How do the dynamics differ between these two modes?

4. When employing the FIM objective, the paper finds that a 100% FIM rate results in the best FIM capabilities but weakens code completion performance. Can you discuss this tradeoff further and how you settled on the 50% FIM rate? 

5. The model architectures utilize innovations like FlashAttention v2 and Grouped-Query-Attention. Can you explain the benefits of these components and how they improve efficiency?

6. The learning rate scheduling employs a three-stage policy adapted from DeepSeek LLM. What were the considerations behind this design choice? How does it differ from a cosine or linear decay schedule?

7. The model is extended to support a 16K context length. What modifications were made to the Rotary Position Embedding formula to achieve this? What empirical results validated that 16K is a reliable context limit?

8. Can you discuss the motivation and data sources used for the additional pretraining of DeepSeek-Coder-v1.5? Why is pretraining on general domain data important for code models?

9. The fine-tuning data uses the Alpaca instruction format. What are the key strengths of this format compared to alternatives? Does it allow disambiguating instructions over multiple turns?

10. The model shows promising performance on out-of-domain LeetCode contest problems. How do you prevent or estimate potential data leakage from the test set into the training data in an ongoing pretraining scenario?
