# [Physics-informed neural network for modeling dynamic linear elasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15175)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the challenge of solving dynamic problems in solid mechanics which involve high computational costs when using traditional numerical methods like finite element methods (FEM). This is especially an issue for problems like material parameter identification which require running simulations repeatedly. Hence the authors explore using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a faster surrogate model.

Proposed Solution:
The authors develop a tailored PINN framework to solve forward, inverse and surrogate modeling problems for linear elastic dynamics. Their model combines physics equations for momentum balance, constitutive relations and kinematic relations along with available data to train a neural network. This allows bypassing repetitive numerical simulations.

Key Contributions:

- Show PINN can accurately solve the forward problem of predicting displacements and stresses over time with minimal training data 
- Demonstrate PINN's capability for inverse identification of material parameters, albeit limited practical use due to needing internal stress data
- Main contribution is using PINN as extremely fast surrogate model for unseen material parameters. Case studies on 2D and 3D dynamic problems prove accuracy close to FEM but 3600Ã— faster predictions
- Framework is readily adaptable for more complex geometries, boundary conditions, excitation types for industrial use
- Overall, paper successfully proves PINN's potential for alleviating computational expenses associated with dynamic analysis in solid mechanics

In summary, the paper introduces a PINN modeling framework tailored for linear elastic dynamics and conclusively shows its strengths for surrogate modeling industrial problems to bypass expensive iterative FEM simulations. The approach shows promising adaptability for practical scenarios.
