# [Designing Heterogeneous Robot Fleets for Task Allocation and Sequencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07234)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies the problem of designing optimal heterogeneous robot fleets for complex multi-robot missions involving spatially distributed tasks with diverse requirements and time windows. Given a set of robot types with different capabilities, speeds, battery lives and costs, along with a set of tasks and a budget limit, the goal is to select which subset of robots to deploy so as to maximize the number of tasks that can be serviced before their deadlines while keeping fleet cost under budget. The authors formally characterize the computational complexity of this problem, provide a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation, and propose a heuristic Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS) algorithm involving tour improvement and robot replacement moves. Through simulations with different problem setups, they demonstrate the capability of their LNS method to consistently find substantially stronger solutions that require lower budgets to achieve the same level of task servicing compared to a naive greedy fleet selection approach. The strength of the LNS lies in its integrated manner of simultaneously optimizing fleet composition and routing tours for each robot.
