# [No Prior Mask: Eliminate Redundant Action for Deep Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06258)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel redundant action filtering mechanism called No Prior Mask (NPM) to address the challenge of large action spaces in reinforcement learning. NPM eliminates redundant actions that have similar effects on state transitions without requiring any prior knowledge. It constructs a similarity factor by estimating the distance between state distributions induced by two actions using a modified inverse model, avoiding extensive computation. Theoretical analysis shows eliminating redundant actions based on this similarity factor has minimal impact on policy performance. The algorithm has two phases - first it trains the no prior mask consisting of the inverse model and N-value network, then it uses the mask to filter actions during policy optimization. Experiments across various domains with synthetic, combined, and state-dependent action redundancy demonstrate NPM's effectiveness. Unlike other methods, NPM scales to high-dimensional pixel inputs, transfers across tasks, and handles stochastic environments. The proposed unsupervised mechanism to uncover action space structure advances the applicability of reinforcement learning to real-world problems involving large action spaces.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) methods suffer from large action spaces in real-world applications. The numerous redundant actions cause agents to make repeated invalid attempts, even leading to task failure. Prior methods rely heavily on rule-based systems or expert demonstrations, limiting applicability. Therefore, the paper examines the key question - how to eliminate redundant actions without any prior knowledge.

Method: 
The paper provides theoretical analysis revealing actions with similar state transition distributions can be classified as redundant. Based on this, a similarity factor is proposed using the KL divergence between next state distributions. To make this computationally feasible, the similarity factor is reformulated using an inverse dynamics model. This allows estimating redundancy between action pairs based on transitions observed in the environment.

A practical algorithm called No Prior Mask (NPM) is introduced. It has two phases - first, an inverse model and N-value network are trained to estimate the similarity factor. Second, a policy is optimized by masking redundant actions identified using the learned similarity factors. This allows efficiently focusing exploration on non-redundant actions.

Contributions:
1) Proposes a theoretical foundation for eliminating redundant actions without any prior knowledge.

2) Introduces a practical NPM algorithm combining an inverse model and N-value network to identify redundant actions based on state transition similarities.

3) Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on tasks with synthetic, combined and state-dependent action redundancy. Also shows transfer learning capabilities across tasks.

4) Provides extensive analysis and ablation studies examining the similarity factors learned, impact of key hyperparameters and components like the modified inverse model.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in formally analyzing and practically realizing an unsupervised approach for action space reduction in RL without relying on any prior knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel redundant action filtering mechanism called No Prior Mask (NPM) that eliminates redundant actions in reinforcement learning without requiring any prior knowledge by estimating the similarity between actions based on the distance between resulting state distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a mask-based reinforcement learning framework without any prior knowledge, which can scale up to high-dimensional pixel-based observations. To the best of their knowledge, this is the first study of constructing no prior state-dependent action masks, leading to better performance than other methods.

2. It provides a novel theoretical analysis revealing what kind of mask is reasonable and feasible. The work stands out as the first attempt to bridge the gap between the practical technique of action masks and the theoretical foundations of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).  

3. The mask learning phase is reward-free, indicating the mask mechanism is unrelated to policy and easily transfers across multi-tasks. The effectiveness, simplicity, and transferability of the method are validated on both single-tasks and multi-tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel state-dependent action mask learning framework without relying on any prior knowledge, along with theoretical analysis, that outperforms existing methods and transfers well across tasks.

The paper proposes a novel redundant action filtering mechanism called "No Prior Mask" (NPM) that eliminates redundant actions in reinforcement learning without requiring any prior knowledge. It introduces the concept of a similarity factor to identify redundant actions based on the distance between state distributions. A key contribution is developing a modified inverse dynamics model to efficiently estimate this similarity factor. Experiments demonstrate NPM's effectiveness on tasks with different types of action redundancy, including in high-dimensional pixel environments. The learned action masks also exhibit transferability across multiple tasks.
