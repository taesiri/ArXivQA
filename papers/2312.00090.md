# [Tree-based Forecasting of Day-ahead Solar Power Generation from Granular   Meteorological Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00090)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation are crucial for electricity grid stability and optimization given the rise in renewable energy penetration. 
- Existing methods do not fully account for the nonlinear effects of various meteorological and astronomical features on PV power, especially across granular spatial locations.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a comprehensive forecasting framework using tree-based machine learning models like regression trees, random forests and gradient boosting to capture complex relationships.
- Carefully select relevant meteorological (radiation, temperature, humidity etc.) and astronomical features (zenith, azimuth angles) based on solar engineering domain knowledge.
- Allow meteorological effects to vary across a fine-grained spatial grid of locations in Belgium obtained via clustering.  

Main Contributions:
- Compare multiple ML methods and spatial configurations to show XGBoost model with granular meteorological data performs best.
- Visualize forecast errors over time to reveal model deficiencies and importance of spatial granularity.
- Conduct extensive feature importance analysis using SHAP values to identify key locations and predictors.
- Provide practical guidelines and visualizations to help model selection and spatial feature engineering.
- Show value of tree-based ML with spatial meteorological data for solar forecasting to facilitate renewable grid integration.

In summary, the paper puts forward a comprehensive solar forecasting framework using meteorology-informed machine learning that can assist utilities and policy makers with electricity grid management and clean energy technology.
