# [Zippo: Zipping Color and Transparency Distributions into a Single   Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11077)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-image diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion have shown impressive ability in generating high-quality images guided by text prompts. However, directly translating such generative models to visual perceptive tasks like image matting tends to make them forget the versatile image generation capabilities. 

- Existing image matting methods often suffer from scarce training data, resulting in poor generalization. Leveraging the knowledge learned by generative models can help address this issue.

- Generating transparent images with both photo-realistic RGB content and accurate alpha mattes has immense practical value, but is challenging.

Proposed Solution - Zippo:

- Proposes a unified framework to zip color and transparency distributions into a single diffusion model, retaining both image generation and perceptual capabilities. 

- Expands the diffusion latent space to jointly represent RGB images and alpha mattes. Allows alternating between modalities as condition and target to enable both RGB-to-matte and matte-to-RGB tasks.

- Introduces a learnable distribution identifier for task routing between the two modalities.

- Enables joint modeling of color and transparency distributions using a modality-aware noise reassignment strategy. Allows generating RGB image and alpha matte pairs guided by text prompts.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrates translating a text-to-image diffusion model to an image matting model without losing versatile generative capabilities.

- Showcases efficient text-conditioned transparent image generation by modeling joint distribution of RGB and alpha mattes. 

- Provides plausible results for matte-to-RGB generation and RGB-to-matte prediction tasks.

- Offers a simple and flexible framework for generating editable and transparent images with practical applications.
