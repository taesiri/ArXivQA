# [SC-Diff: 3D Shape Completion with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12470)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- 3D shape completion from partial scans is an important task with applications in VR/AR, robotics, etc. But it faces challenges due to sensor noise, varying levels of incompleteness, and the ill-posed nature of generating complete shapes from partial inputs.
- Existing learning methods like 3D encoder-decoders can overfit. Generative methods like GANs often compromise accuracy. 
- Recently, diffusion models have shown promising results for image generation tasks, but extending them to high-resolution 3D data is computationally challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a latent diffusion model for 3D shape completion that works with Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) shape representation.
- A Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is used to encode the 3D TSDF input into a compact latent code. The VQ-VAE uses both 3D and 2D losses.
- The latent code is then completed by a diffusion model conditioned on (1) CLIP image features via cross-attention (2) Spatial features from partial 3D scans.
- This allows working at higher resolutions of 64^3 unlike previous diffusion works, and learns a single model for multiple shape categories.

Main Contributions:
- VQ-VAE compression with joint 3D and 2D losses to enable efficient high-res diffusion model.
- Novel application of latent diffusion models for conditional 3D shape completion.
- Dual conditioning strategy using cross-attention on images and spatial aggregation of 3D features.
- Single diffusion model to generate high quality and detailed completions for multiple categories at 64^3 voxels.
- Strong quantitative and qualitative results on established shape completion benchmarks like 3D-EPN and PatchComplete.
