# [Synapse: Learning Preferential Concepts from Visual Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16689)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of learning preferential concepts (e.g. "good parking spot", "convenient drop-off location") from visual input. Such concepts are subjective, vary from person to person, and require learning from limited per-user demonstrations. This makes it fundamentally harder than learning factual concepts which have objective ground truth and abundant training data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Synapse, a neuro-symbolic framework to learn preferential concepts from visual demonstrations. Key ideas:

(1) Represent preferences as executable neuro-symbolic programs in a DSL operating over images. Programs have if-then-else structure like decision trees.

(2) Learn programs incrementally from user demonstrations, each containing visual data (images, LiDAR scans) and natural language explanation of preference.

(3) Use visual parsing and large language models to ground concepts from natural language. Query user when new concepts arise.  

(4) Generate "sketch" of preference program from language explanation. Sketch has missing numeric constants.

(5) Synthesize suitable numeric constants for sketch based on visual demonstrations, using a constraint solving approach.

Main Contributions:

(1) Synapse - A novel neuro-symbolic framework for learning preferential concepts from limited per-user demonstrations

(2) Technique to perform hierarchical, lifelong learning of concepts from paired visual-language demonstrations  

(3) Comprehensive evaluation including comparison to baselines and ablations. Case study demonstrating alignment to multi-user preferences.

The key insight is to leverage both language and visual input available from demonstrations to learn structured neuro-symbolic preference programs that align well to individual preferences. The representation also allows incremental learning and reasoning about failures.
