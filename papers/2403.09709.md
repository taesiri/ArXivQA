# [Exploratory Data Analysis on Code-mixed Misogynistic Comments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09709)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Online hate speech and cyberbullying have worsened with the rise of social media. Manual content moderation is insufficient, especially for under-resourced and code-mixed languages. 
- There is a lack of robust datasets for misogyny detection in code-mixed languages like Hinglish (Hindi+English).
- Women face disproportionate amounts of online harassment and abuse.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present a new dataset of 2,229 YouTube comments in code-mixed Hinglish, collected from videos discussing social issues in India. 
- Comments are weakly labeled as 'Misogynistic' (181 comments) or 'Non-misogynistic' (2,048 comments) by a single annotator.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are applied on the dataset to uncover insights and patterns that can guide future modeling decisions for misogyny detection.

Key EDA Techniques Used:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing 
- Keyword analysis
- Polarity and sentiment analysis 
- Histogram analysis of comment length
- Box plots to compare classes
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and clustering

Key Findings:
- Misogynistic comments tend to be much longer than non-misogynistic comments on average.
- Most comments are slightly positive in sentiment.
- Three clusters were obtained from PCA - one contained mostly code-mixed tokens.
- Valuable insights were gained through EDA to guide the modeling process.

Main Contributions:
- First dataset for misogyny detection in Hinglish code-mixed language
- Analysis providing insights on data patterns to guide future modeling 
- Framework and methodology for applying EDA on new dataset

The paper demonstrates the value of EDA in analyzing a new dataset to uncover key characteristics before building machine learning models. The insights obtained will help guide the development of models for misogyny detection in this under-resourced code-mixed language.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new YouTube comment dataset of 2,229 samples in code-mixed Hinglish for misogyny detection, performs exploratory data analysis like sentiment analysis and PCA to uncover insights like longer average length for misogynistic comments, and seeks expert feedback to guide future modeling.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution seems to be:

1) Presenting a novel dataset of 2,229 YouTube comments for misogyny detection in code-mixed Hinglish. 

2) Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on this new dataset to gain insights into its characteristics and patterns, such as sentiment scores, word clouds, average word counts, etc.

3) Using the findings from the EDA to help guide future modeling decisions for misogyny detection on this dataset. For example, noting that misogynistic comments tend to be longer than non-misogynistic ones.

4) Discussing the potential of using EDA techniques more broadly to uncover valuable insights from code-mixed datasets for tasks like hate speech and misogyny detection.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a new Hinglish dataset for misogyny detection and demonstrating the usefulness of applying EDA to gain a better understanding of the data to inform future modeling work.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper include:

- Code-mixed languages - The paper focuses on analyzing comments in Hinglish, which is a code-mixing of Hindi and English.

- Machine learning - The paper mentions using machine learning and deep learning models for misogyny detection on the Hinglish dataset. 

- Natural language processing - NLP techniques are mentioned for automatically filtering toxic content.

- Misogyny detection - The main focus of the paper is on detecting misogynistic comments in the Hinglish YouTube dataset.

- Exploratory data analysis - Various EDA techniques like word clouds, sentiment analysis, PCA etc. are used to analyze the dataset.

- Hate speech - The paper touches upon the link between misogyny detection and the broader problem of online hate speech.

- Social media - The comments dataset is collected from YouTube videos discussing social issues in India.

So in summary, the key terms cover code-mixing, machine learning, NLP, misogyny detection, EDA, hate speech and social media analysis. Let me know if you need any other keywords for this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the dataset has only been annotated by a single annotator so far. What are some of the issues with having a dataset labeled by just one annotator? How could the authors mitigate these issues?

2. The authors perform sentiment analysis on the comments using TextBlob. What are some of the limitations of using a tool like TextBlob for sentiment analysis on code-mixed data? Would a multilingual sentiment analysis tool tailored for code-mixing be more appropriate?

3. The paper finds that misogynistic comments tend to be longer than non-misogynistic ones on average. Could this insight be leveraged to build a simple baseline classifier for misogyny detection based on comment length? What would be some challenges with this approach?

4. Principal component analysis is used for dimensionality reduction and visualization of patterns. What are some other techniques the authors could have used instead of PCA? What are the comparative advantages and disadvantages? 

5. The paper does not perform an inter-annotator agreement study. What metric could the authors use to quantify the agreement between multiple annotators once the second annotator finishes labeling? How could disagreements be resolved?

6. The paper focuses only on YouTube comments. Would the findings generalize to other platforms like Twitter or Reddit? What differences might we expect across platforms in terms of language use?

7. The data has been collected from videos about specific controversial topics. Could the dataset have an inherent topical bias? How could the authors address this?

8. The paper does not discuss the annotation guidelines used. What should the guidelines cover to ensure consistent annotation quality for a complex phenomenon like misogyny?

9. How suitable is the size of this dataset for training deep learning models? What techniques could the authors use to increase the size of the dataset?

10. The paper does not discuss ethical considerations around using this dataset. What are some ethical issues the authors need to address regarding consent, privacy, stereotyping etc.?
