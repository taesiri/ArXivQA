# [Structural Knowledge-Driven Meta-Learning for Task Offloading in   Vehicular Networks with Integrated Communications, Sensing and Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15972)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Vehicular networks have strict latency and reliability requirements for computation-intensive applications like automotive driving assistance. However, limited on-board computing resources lead to unacceptable latency when processing large volumes of sensor data locally. 
- Offloading sensor data to roadside units (RSUs) with edge computing introduces high upload latency due to the large data size. This dilemma will become more severe with increasing volumes of high-resolution sensor data.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage an integrated communication, sensing and computing (I-CSC) paradigm, where vehicles can offload either sensor data or lightweight computation instructions to RSUs equipped with their own sensors.
- Investigate joint computation mode selection and resource allocation to minimize the total cost (energy and resource payment) while meeting latency constraints of each task.
- Propose a Structural Knowledge-Driven Meta-Learning (SKDML) method that combines the model-based Alternating Minimization (AM) algorithm with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks.

Key Contributions:
- Formulate the joint computation mode selection and resource allocation problem with three offloading modes: local computing, data transmission-based MEC, and instruction transmission-based MEC.
- Propose the SKDML method that utilizes the AM algorithm's iterative update structure as inductive bias to learn an LSTM optimizer, achieving faster convergence and better solutions. 
- Update LSTM parameters using the global loss function to pull solutions out of local optima, improving performance over AM algorithm and meta-learning without knowledge.
- Simulation results demonstrate superior convergence time and cost reduction compared to benchmark algorithms under various parameter configurations.

In summary, the paper introduces an I-CSC based vehicular edge computing framework to alleviate upload latency, and develops a creative synergistic optimization algorithm combining model-based methods and meta-learning to enhance efficiency.
