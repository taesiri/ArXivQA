# [Structural Knowledge-Driven Meta-Learning for Task Offloading in   Vehicular Networks with Integrated Communications, Sensing and Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15972)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Vehicular networks have strict latency and reliability requirements for computation-intensive applications like automotive driving assistance. However, limited on-board computing resources lead to unacceptable latency when processing large volumes of sensor data locally. 
- Offloading sensor data to roadside units (RSUs) with edge computing introduces high upload latency due to the large data size. This dilemma will become more severe with increasing volumes of high-resolution sensor data.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage an integrated communication, sensing and computing (I-CSC) paradigm, where vehicles can offload either sensor data or lightweight computation instructions to RSUs equipped with their own sensors.
- Investigate joint computation mode selection and resource allocation to minimize the total cost (energy and resource payment) while meeting latency constraints of each task.
- Propose a Structural Knowledge-Driven Meta-Learning (SKDML) method that combines the model-based Alternating Minimization (AM) algorithm with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks.

Key Contributions:
- Formulate the joint computation mode selection and resource allocation problem with three offloading modes: local computing, data transmission-based MEC, and instruction transmission-based MEC.
- Propose the SKDML method that utilizes the AM algorithm's iterative update structure as inductive bias to learn an LSTM optimizer, achieving faster convergence and better solutions. 
- Update LSTM parameters using the global loss function to pull solutions out of local optima, improving performance over AM algorithm and meta-learning without knowledge.
- Simulation results demonstrate superior convergence time and cost reduction compared to benchmark algorithms under various parameter configurations.

In summary, the paper introduces an I-CSC based vehicular edge computing framework to alleviate upload latency, and develops a creative synergistic optimization algorithm combining model-based methods and meta-learning to enhance efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a structural knowledge-driven meta-learning algorithm that combines model-based optimization and neural networks to efficiently solve the non-convex problem of minimizing cost for environment-aware task offloading in vehicular networks under latency constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It investigates a task offloading problem with a novel paradigm called integrated communication, sensing and computing (I-CSC) for vehicular networks. This allows utilizing both the computing resources at roadside units (RSUs) and the environmental data sensed by RSU sensors for computation offloading.

2. It formulates an optimization problem to minimize the total cost caused by resource consumption while ensuring the latency requirement of each task. The formulated problem jointly optimizes the computation mode selection, task offloading ratio, transmission power, and resource allocation.

3. It proposes a creative structural knowledge-driven meta-learning (SKDML) method to solve the non-convex optimization problem efficiently. The proposed method combines the model-based alternating minimization (AM) algorithm and long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based meta-learning. It leverages the iterative structure of AM as structural knowledge and uses LSTM networks to learn adaptive optimizers for updating variables in each sub-problem.

4. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SKDML method outperforms both the AM algorithm and meta-learning without knowledge in terms of convergence time and cost performance. It also shows superior performance compared to the conventional integrated communication and computing paradigm.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the SKDML method for efficient and cost-effective computation offloading in vehicular networks with the novel I-CSC paradigm.

The paper investigates an environment-aware task offloading problem in vehicular networks with integrated communication, sensing and computing capabilities. It aims to minimize the total offloading cost under latency constraints by jointly optimizing computation modes, resource allocation, and offloading ratios.

The key goal is to achieve faster convergence and better performance compared to using the AM algorithm or meta-learning alone. The proposed approach is evaluated on vehicular networking scenarios with varying task requirements and resource constraints.
