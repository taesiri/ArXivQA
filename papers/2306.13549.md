## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest are:- Improving the perception capabilities of current MLLMs to acquire more complete and accurate visual information. They suggest using large vision foundation models to more efficiently compress visual information for the LLM.- Enhancing the multimodal reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The paper notes that the reasoning chain can sometimes break in MLLMs when incorporating visual information. More research is needed on strengthening multimodal reasoning.- Upgrading the instruction-following abilities of MLLMs through covering more tasks during instruction tuning. The paper notes some MLLMs fail to follow explicit instructions, indicating more generalization is needed.- Mitigating the object hallucination issue by performing more fine-grained alignment between visual and textual modalities during pre-training. This can improve reliability. - Developing more parameter-efficient training methods to unlock the potential of MLLMs under limited compute. Both modality bridging approaches explored so far are preliminary and can be improved.- Constructing more comprehensive benchmarks to systematically evaluate and compare MLLMs.- Continuing to build the core techniques like multimodal instruction tuning, in-context learning, and chain of thought reasoning.In summary, the main suggestions involve improving multimodal perception and reasoning, strengthening instruction following, developing more efficient training, building better benchmarks, and advancing the core techniques that make up MLLMs. As this is an emerging field, there are many open research questions to explore as MLLMs continue maturing.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a survey on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs refer to large language model (LLM)-based models that can receive and reason with multimodal information, especially visual and textual data. The paper categorizes recent MLLMs into four main types: Multimodal Instruction Tuning (M-IT), Multimodal In-Context Learning (M-ICL), Multimodal Chain of Thought (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). M-IT involves finetuning LLMs on instruction-formatted multimodal datasets to improve their generalization ability. M-ICL is used at inference time to provide demonstrations for few-shot learning. M-CoT aims to elicit reasoning chains from LLMs. LAVR systems utilize LLMs as controllers, decision makers, or semantics refiners to build visual reasoning systems. The paper discusses key techniques, applications, and evaluations for each type, and points out challenges like limited perception, fragile reasoning, and the object hallucination problem.

MLLMs utilize powerful large language models (LLMs) as a reasoning module and equip them with the ability to understand and reason about multimodal inputs like images and videos. The paper categorizes recent representative MLLMs into four main techniques: Multimodal Instruction Tuning (M-IT), Multimodal In-Context Learning (M-ICL), Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). M-IT finetunes LLMs on instruction-formatted multimodal datasets to improve generalization. M-ICL provides LLMs with few examples to learn new tasks.
