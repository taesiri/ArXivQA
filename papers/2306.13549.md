# A Survey on Multimodal Large Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper summary, it seems the main goals of this survey paper are:1. To provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The paper categorizes existing representative MLLMs into four main types - Multimodal Instruction Tuning (M-IT), Multimodal In-Context Learning (M-ICL), Multimodal Chain of Thought (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). 2. To introduce key techniques and applications of MLLMs, including M-IT for adapting LLMs to multimodality, M-ICL for few-shot learning, M-CoT for complex reasoning, and LAVR systems using LLMs as core components.3. To summarize existing challenges and limitations of current MLLMs, and point out promising future research directions to further advance the field.Overall, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey and overview of the emerging research area of MLLMs. The central goals are to summarize progress so far, delineate key techniques, discuss applications, and highlight open challenges to guide and inspire future research in this exciting new direction for artificial intelligence. The paper does not appear to propose a specific hypothesis to test, but rather seeks to synthesize and assess the current state of MLLM research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper summary, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It provides the first survey and taxonomy of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The paper categorizes recent MLLMs into four main types - Multimodal Instruction Tuning (M-IT), Multimodal In-Context Learning (M-ICL), Multimodal Chain of Thought (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). 2. It offers a comprehensive review of techniques for adapting LLMs to multimodality, including data collection methods, modality bridging techniques, and evaluation approaches for MLLMs. Key methods like learnable interfaces, expert models, benchmark adaptation, self-instruction, etc. are explained and connected to representative works.3. It summarizes the roles LLMs play in LAVR systems, such as controller, decision maker, and semantics refiner. Different training paradigms and evaluation methods for LAVR are also discussed.4. It provides insights into current limitations of MLLMs and points out promising future research directions, such as improving perception capabilities, reasoning abilities, instruction following, and reducing the object hallucination issue.5. The paper connects and structures the scattered recent progress on MLLMs, offering readers a systematic understanding of this emerging field. The taxonomy figures and abundant citations make it a helpful reference.In summary, this paper contributes the first dedicated survey on the nascent field of MLLMs, summarizing key techniques, applications, evaluation methods, and opportunities for future work. The comprehensive review and insights provided are valuable for researchers interested in this area.
