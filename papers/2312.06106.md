# [AUGCAL: Improving Sim2Rreal Adaptation by Uncertainty Calibration on   Augmented Synthetic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06106)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes AugCal, a method to reduce the miscalibration of sim-to-real (syn to real) adapted models, often caused by highly-confident incorrect predictions. AugCal modifies an existing syn-to-real adaptation framework by making two minimally invasive changes: (1) augmenting the synthetic images via transformations like PAST or RandAugment that reduce the distributional distance between synthetic and real images, and (2) optimizing for an additional calibration loss on the augmented synthetic predictions during training. Through experiments on semantic segmentation (GTAV to Cityscapes) and object recognition (VisDA) using methods like entropy minimization, self-training, and domain adversarial training, AugCal is shown to retain or improve adaptation performance while reducing miscalibration, overconfidence, and improving reliability of confidence scores on real data. The improvements are demonstrated across CNN and transformer architectures. AugCal provides a simple, task-agnostic framework to obtain accurate, calibrated, and reliable predictions from sim-to-real adapted models.
