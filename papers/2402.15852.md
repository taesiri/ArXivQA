# [NaVid: Video-based VLM Plans the Next Step for Vision-and-Language   Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15852)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to navigate in diverse, unseen environments by following free-form linguistic instructions. While much progress has been made in simulated environments, VLN models still struggle to generalize across datasets and to the real world. This is due to reliance on imperfect inputs like odometry, depth sensors, and maps. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes NaVid, the first video-based Vision Language Model (VLM) for VLN that only requires RGB video as input. NaVid encodes each frame with an instruction-queried token to extract instruction-relevant features and multiple instruction-agnostic tokens to globally encode visual details. By modeling trajectories as video, NaVid provides richer spatial-temporal context compared to prior works. The model is trained on 550K navigation samples from VLN-CE and 665K captioning samples. 

Key Contributions:
- NaVid achieves SOTA results on VLN-CE benchmarks without any odometry, depth sensor, or map inputs - only RGB video. This advances towards more realistic human-like VLN.

- NaVid demonstrates superior cross-dataset generalization, improving R2Râ†’RxR success from 16.8% to 23.8% absolutely over prior arts.

- In real-world tests across diverse scenes, NaVid completes 84% of simple instructions and 48% of complex instructions requiring several steps. This showcases impressive sim-to-real transferability.  

- As the first VLM approach to continuous VLN, NaVid sets a strong benchmark for future research into leveraging large models for more generalizable embodied agents. Its video-based formulation provides a more practical paradigm compared to discrete modeling.

In summary, by harnessing a VLM trained on abundant data, NaVid advances VLN research through its SOTA performance, generalization ability, and realistic formulation, representing an exciting step towards deployable VLN.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes NaVid, a video-based large vision language model for vision-and-language navigation that achieves state-of-the-art performance using only RGB video input from a robot camera, without reliance on maps, odometry or depth data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing NaVid, the first video-based large vision language model for vision-and-language navigation (VLN) in continuous environments. Specifically:

1) NaVid is the first model that showcases the capability of large vision language models to achieve state-of-the-art VLN performance using only monocular RGB input, without relying on maps, odometer or depth data. This eliminates several generalization issues faced by prior VLN methods.

2) NaVid represents the observation history as visual tokens in a video form rather than using odometry or textual descriptions. This provides more informative spatio-temporal contexts for navigation planning. 

3) The paper collects 550k navigation samples from VLN-CE trajectories and 665k large-scale web data to train NaVid. Experiments show NaVid achieves SOTA performance on VLN benchmarks and impressive robustness in real-world deployment across different scenes.

In summary, NaVid is the first work to effectively transfer the knowledge in large vision language models to generalizable vision-and-language navigation in continuous environments, advancing the state-of-the-art.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN): The core task that this paper focuses on, where agents navigate unseen environments by following natural language instructions.

- Generalization: A critical challenge in VLN that this paper aims to address, including generalization across different scenes and from simulation to the real world (sim2real). 

- Video-based Vision Language Model (VLM): The proposed model, NaVid, is a video-based VLM that takes RGB video frames as input and outputs next-step actions.

- Low-level actions: The paper focuses on VLN in continuous environments, where the agent outputs executable low-level actions rather than selecting high-level waypoints.

- Instruction following: A key capability required for VLN agents to successfully navigate by interpreting free-form linguistic instructions.

- RGB-only: NaVid relies solely on RGB video frames as input, without odometry, depth sensors, or maps. This makes it more practical and closer to human navigation.

- Pre-training and fine-tuning: NaVid incorporates general knowledge from pre-training a large foundation model, then fine-tunes on collected VLN navigation data for the downstream task.

- Sim-to-real: Evaluating the agent's ability to transfer from simulation environments to real-world robot experiments.

In summary, the key focus is using video-based VLMs for generalizable vision-and-language navigation in continuous environments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes NaVid, a video-based large vision language model for vision-and-language navigation. How does encoding the video observations as a sequence of visual tokens allow NaVid to effectively represent the navigation history and current observations?

2. NaVid predicts low-level executable actions instead of waypoints. What are the advantages of predicting actions directly instead of waypoints? How does this facilitate real-world deployment?

3. The paper mentions that NaVid achieves navigation akin to human behavior by relying solely on RGB inputs. What are the challenges in using RGB inputs alone without depth, odometry or map information? How does NaVid overcome these challenges?

4. NaVid is pre-trained on a large dataset of 550k navigation samples from VLN-CE trajectories and 665k web data samples. What is the motivation behind using this hybrid pre-training strategy? How does it improve generalizability?

5. The training methodology utilizes non-oracle trajectories from a DAgger-based technique and auxiliary tasks like instruction reasoning. Explain the intuition behind using these strategies and how they boost navigation performance.

6. NaVid encodes the current and history frames using varying numbers of instruction-agnostic tokens. What is the rationale behind using more tokens for current frames versus history? How does this encoding strategy help?

7. Special tokens like [NAV], [HIS] and [OBS] are used to demarcate different types of input information. Analyze the effect of using these tokens - do they actually help NaVid's understanding and why?

8. How does directly predicting low-level actions in continuous environments rather than abstract actions or waypoints make NaVid more amenable to real-world deployment? What are the limitations?

9. The paper demonstrates SOTA performance on VLN benchmarks like R2R and RxR. Analyze the cross-dataset generalization ability of NaVid - why is it able to generalize better than other methods?

10. NaVid shows impressive Sim-to-Real transfer capabilities. Speculate on what intrinsic attributes of large vision-language models facilitate sim-to-real transfer and how video-based modeling aids this further.
