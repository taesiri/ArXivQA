# [Teaching language models to support answers with verified quotes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11147)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on a close reading of the introduction, it seems this paper focuses on developing language models that can generate answers to factual questions alongside supporting evidence in the form of verbatim quotes. The key objectives appear to be:

1) Teaching language models to support their answers by citing relevant quotes from source documents, in order to increase trustworthiness. 

2) Using reinforcement learning from human preferences to align the models to produce high quality evidence that verifies and substantiates their claims.

3) Enabling the models to abstain from answering questions when unsure, rather than generating potentially incorrect responses. 

4) Evaluating these "open book QA" models on their ability to provide plausible, supported answers on subsets of the Natural Questions and ELI5 datasets.

5) Analyzing the strengths and limitations of supporting claims with evidence quotes, including failures on more adversarial datasets, to motivate further research into ensuring truthful responses.

In summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that training language models to provide supporting evidence can increase the plausibility and trustworthiness of their factual claims, although this alone does not guarantee truthfulness. The paper aims to demonstrate successes on this self-supported QA task while also delineating the need for further techniques to achieve fully truthful and reliable language agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a language model called GopherCite that can generate answers to factual questions along with supporting evidence from documents. The key ideas are:

- Using an "inline evidence" approach where the model generates the answer and supporting quote together in a single string. This allows scoring and conditional generation.

- Retrieving supporting documents with a search engine rather than relying solely on the model's parameters. 

- Training with a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human preferences to align the model to produce plausible, supported answers.

- Enabling the model to abstain from answering questions it is uncertain about, to improve reliability.

The authors demonstrate that GopherCite can produce answers that human evaluators rate as supported by evidence 80% of the time on a subset of Natural Questions, approaching human performance. The inline evidence approach provides a way to make large generative models more transparent. Limitations are that evidence quoting alone doesn't ensure truthfulness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main points from the paper:

The paper describes an open-book question answering system called GopherCite that is trained to provide factual answers supported by verbatim quotes from retrieved documents, which enables users to verify the system's responses.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper on teaching language models to support answers with verified quotes makes several notable contributions compared to prior work:

- It presents a new task formulation called "Self-Supported Question Answering" (SQA) which requires models to provide both an answer to a question and a direct supporting quote from a document. This is more demanding than typical QA settings which only require an answer.

- The paper introduces a straightforward but effective "Inline Evidence" approach to SQA which formats the answer and evidence quote into a single response for conditional language modeling. This contrasts with more complex pipeline or dual encoder architectures.  

- The method trains 280B parameter models that can provide high quality evidence from web documents. This scales up evidence provision substantially compared to prior works with smaller models like 16B WebGPT.

- The paper demonstrates that reinforcement learning from human preferences leads to better alignment than pure supervised learning, mirroring results in concurrent work.

- It studies model abstention, showing the system can decline to answer when uncertain. Prior work focused more on compulsory answering.

- The paper thoroughly investigates limitations around truthfulness, highlighting that evidence quoting alone is insufficient to ensure truthful responses. This level of critical analysis is rare.

Overall, this paper makes solid incremental progress in scaling up and improving the quality and reliability of evidence provision from large language models. The limitations analysis provides a thoughtful guide to open problems for future work on truthfulness.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the introduction, some future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Enriching the setting with debate or recursive reward modeling to address limitations like misleading quotations or cherry-picking evidence. They suggest debate could help detect when evidence is cherry-picked.

- Investigating protocols that go beyond quoting evidence to support statistical or negative claims, which are difficult to support with brief quotations. 

- Addressing the reliability and potential biases of sources. The authors note that even sources like Wikipedia can contain errors or biases. They suggest techniques like amplification could help users make good judgments about sources.

- Providing more nuanced, qualified answers rather than binary true/false claims. The authors note this could help with contentious claims.

- Combining citation of evidence with other techniques like common sense reasoning to provide stronger justification and avoid limitations of the evidence quoting approach alone.

- Exploring more subtle alignment approaches like debate that could provide better training signals compared to quoting evidence. This could help ensure quotes are not misleading or cherry-picked.

In summary, the main future directions relate to handling unreliable sources, providing more nuanced justification beyond quotation, and combining evidence quoting with other methods like debate and common sense reasoning for better training and evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper describes a system called GopherCite that is trained to generate factual answers to questions along with supporting evidence from documents. GopherCite is built on top of the 280B parameter Gopher language model and uses a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human preferences to teach the model to produce high quality, supported answers. The authors introduce an "inline evidence" approach where the model outputs an answer and a verbatim quote from a document in a single string. This allows easy verification of the evidence by users. GopherCite retrieves multiple documents related to a question using Google Search and conditions the model on long contexts from these documents. The authors demonstrate that GopherCite can produce plausible, supported answers 80% of the time on a subset of NaturalQuestions and 67% on a subset of ELI5 when attempting all questions. By declining to answer the 30% of questions it is least confident on, quality can be further improved, exceeding human performance on the subsets. The authors discuss limitations around cherry-picking evidence and truthfulness, and situate inline evidence as one component of developing more trustworthy AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper describes a system called GopherCite that generates answers to factual questions along with supporting evidence from documents. GopherCite uses a 280 billion parameter version of the Gopher language model that is fine-tuned using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human preferences. At inference time, GopherCite retrieves relevant documents using Google Search and provides large contexts drawn from multiple documents to the language model. The model generates an answer and a verbatim quote from one of the documents to support it. 

The authors evaluate GopherCite on subsets of the NaturalQuestions and ELI5 datasets. Without declining to answer any questions, GopherCite achieves plausible and supported answers 80% of the time on NaturalQuestions and 67% on ELI5. By declining to answer the hardest third of questions, these rates increase to 90% and 80% respectively. However, analysis on the adversarial TruthfulQA dataset shows that citation alone is not sufficient for truthfulness - models can still select misleading evidence from authoritative sources. The authors suggest enhancements like evaluating source reliability, qualifying answers carefully, and techniques like debate to better align models. Overall, the work demonstrates that large language models can learn to provide supported answers, but thoughtful combination of citation with other methods is needed for robust truthfulness.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper describes a system called GopherCite that is trained to generate self-supported question answering responses. GopherCite finetunes a large generative language model called Gopher using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human preferences (RLHP). During training, GopherCite is presented with questions and relevant documents retrieved from Google Search. It is taught to generate an answer to the question along with a supporting quote from the documents, all represented as a single string using a special "inline evidence" syntax. The quality of the responses is evaluated by having humans rate whether the answers are plausible and whether they are supported by the accompanying quote evidence. These ratings are used to train a reward model that predicts human judgments. GopherCite is then optimized using RLHP to generate responses that maximize the predicted reward. By generating answers with inline supporting evidence quotes, the system aims to provide responses that can be more easily verified as correct.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of getting language models to produce factual claims that users can trust, without needing to manually verify them. It proposes an approach called "self-supported question answering" where the model provides supporting evidence from documents along with its answers. This is intended to make it easier for users or data raters to evaluate the correctness of the claims. The paper describes a system called GopherCite that is trained to provide inline verbatim quotes from retrieved documents to support its answers to questions.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces GopherCite, a large language model trained to generate answers supported by verbatim evidence quotes. The authors frame this as a form of "self-supported question answering" (SQA). The model is trained to produce responses using a special syntax that separates an answer claim from supporting evidence extracted from retrieved documents. Training data is generated by crowdsourcing ratings of quality for model samples. The 280B parameter GopherCite model is finetuned using a combination of supervised learning on high-rated samples, and reinforcement learning to optimize a reward model predicting human preferences. When evaluated on subsets of NaturalQuestions and ELI5, GopherCite produces plausible and supported responses 80% and 67% of the time, approaching human performance. The authors demonstrate the ability to improve reliability by declining to answer questions scoring below a confidence threshold. Limitations are analyzed, including unsupported answers on an adversarial dataset, showing citing evidence alone is insufficient for truthfulness. Overall, the work demonstrates that large language models can learn to provide evidentiary support for their claims, which aids human evaluation. Key remaining challenges are handling unreliable sources and contentious claims.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main points from the paper:

This paper introduces a method for training language models to generate answers to factual questions along with supporting evidence from documents. The authors develop a system called GopherCite which is finetuned from a large 280 billion parameter Gopher model using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human preferences (RLHP). GopherCite generates answers with inline verbatim quotes extracted from documents found via Google search, using a special syntax to constrain its outputs. Through human evaluation, the authors find GopherCite produces high quality evidence 80% of the time on a subset of NaturalQuestions and 67% on ELI5 questions. By having the model abstain from answering questions it is less confident in, quality can be improved to 90% and 80% respectively.
