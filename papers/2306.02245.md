# [SAM3D: Zero-Shot 3D Object Detection via Segment Anything Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02245)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can we adapt the zero-shot capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 3D object detection?The key points are:- SAM is a recently proposed vision foundation model that shows strong zero-shot ability on many 2D vision tasks. - Whether SAM can be adapted to 3D vision tasks like 3D object detection has yet to be explored.- The authors propose SAM3D, which utilizes SAM to segment Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps of LiDAR data and predicts 3D boxes from the segmentation masks.- Experiments on Waymo dataset show promising results, indicating SAM's potential for zero-shot 3D object detection. So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the zero-shot capability of SAM can be adapted to the task of 3D object detection, which the authors explore through the proposed SAM3D method. The experiments provide an initial positive signal, though more work is needed to fully validate the hypothesis.
