# [Focused Transformer: Contrastive Training for Context Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03170)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, it seems this paper introduces a new method called "Focused Transformer" to address the issue of models getting distracted by irrelevant context when scaling up the attention context length. 

The key points I gathered are:

- Large language models have great capability to incorporate new information contextually, but their effective context length is limited. Using external memory can help extend the context length. 

- However, as more documents are added to the memory, the proportion of relevant to irrelevant keys decreases, leading to a "distraction issue" where overlapping keys become hard to distinguish.

- This paper proposes the Focused Transformer technique to address the distraction issue. It uses a training process inspired by contrastive learning to shape the key-value space, helping the model differentiate between keys linked to semantically different values.

- They demonstrate the method by fine-tuning large OpenLLaMA checkpoints (3B and 7B parameters) which they call LongLLaMA. These models show improved performance on tasks needing longer context, like TREC and WebQS question answering.

- The key benefits seem to be: 1) Mitigates the distraction issue for scaling context length 2) Simple to implement by fine-tuning existing models 3) Enables handling very long context lengths like 256k tokens.

In summary, the central hypothesis appears to be that using their proposed contrastive-inspired training approach called "Focused Transformer" will improve the structure of the key-value space and allow language models to effectively handle much longer attention context lengths.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, the main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a method called "Focused Transformer" to extend the effective context length of transformer language models. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- Using "memory attention layers" that can retrieve relevant information from an external memory bank to augment the model's context.

- A training procedure called "crossbatch training" that exposes the model to keys from the current context as well as unrelated contexts, inspired by contrastive learning. This is designed to allow the model to differentiate between relevant and distracting keys.

- Applying this method to fine-tune existing large models like OpenLLaMA to extend their context length without modifying their architecture. 

- Introducing LongLLaMA, versions of OpenLLaMA fine-tuned with this Focused Transformer approach that achieve strong performance on long context tasks like passkey retrieval over 100k+ tokens.

So in summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the Focused Transformer technique to enhance transformer models' ability to handle long contexts by improving the structure of the key-value memory space. The method is shown to be effective at scaling up the context length of large existing models through fine-tuning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper proposes a novel method called Focused Transformer (FoT) for extending the effective context length of transformer language models. This adds to existing work on techniques like sparse attention, conditional computation, and external memory to handle long contexts. The FoT specifically targets the "distraction issue" that arises in multi-document scenarios.

- The FoT training procedure draws inspiration from contrastive learning methods like SimCLR. Using in-batch negatives is a common technique in contrastive learning, but the authors apply it in a novel way to the training of memory-augmented transformers. 

- The paper shows how FoT can be used to effectively fine-tune existing models like LLaMA to extend their context length, without changing the model architecture. This is similar to other works like RETRO and Memorizing Transformer that adapt LLMs through fine-tuning.

- FoT achieves strong results on long context tasks like passkey retrieval, extrapolating to 256k tokens after training on just 8k tokens. This demonstrates better generalization beyond the training context length compared to standard fine-tuning.

- The released LongLLaMA checkpoints attain state-of-the-art results on datasets like TREC and WebQS that benefit from longer context. This demonstrates the viability of the FoT fine-tuning approach on large models.

- The analysis experiments provide insights into design choices like differentiable memory, negatives, and training techniques. The code-based implementation enables easy integration into existing models.

Overall, FoT introduces a novel training technique and shows promising results, both through fine-tuning large LLMs like LLaMA and analysis on smaller models. The transformer memory augmentation space remains active, and FoT provides a useful method and insights for extending context length.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Scaling up memory: Developing methods to handle larger memory sizes, potentially using distributed and approximate nearest neighbor search.

- Scaling up crossbatch training: Increasing the crossbatch dimension d and exploring training on multi-node setups. 

- Exploring contrastive learning techniques: The authors suggest trying more advanced contrastive learning methods like hard negative mining to improve the key structure.

- Combining with other long context methods: The authors propose combining their method with other techniques like sparse attention to further extend the context length.

- Exploration of training protocols: The authors suggest exploring protocols that combine the benefits of crossbatch training and non-differentiable memory access during training.

- Applications: Applying the method to scale up the context length of large language models for tasks like summarization, translation, question answering, etc.

In summary, the main future directions are developing techniques to scale the method to much larger memory sizes and context lengths, exploring ways to improve the training procedure, and applying the approach to boost the long-range modeling capabilities of large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes the Focused Transformer (FoT), a novel technique to extend the effective context length of transformer language models. FoT uses memory attention layers that can retrieve relevant information from a large external memory bank to expand the context available to the model. The key innovation is a training procedure inspired by contrastive learning, named crossbatch training. During training, the memory attention layers are exposed to keys from the current context as well as keys from other unrelated documents, acting as negative samples. This enhances the structure of the key-value space, enabling the use of much larger memory banks. The authors demonstrate that FoT training allows fine-tuning existing models like OpenLLaMA to handle longer contexts. They introduce LongLLaMA models fine-tuned with FoT that achieve strong performance on tasks requiring long-range modeling, including accurately retrieving information from contexts over 100k tokens. Overall, the proposed FoT technique provides a simple and effective approach to expanding the context length of transformers without arduous architectural changes or full re-training.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Focused Transformer (FoT), a technique for extending the effective context length of Transformer models. FoT uses memory attention layers that can access an external memory bank for retrieving relevant context. During training, FoT employs a novel contrastive learning-inspired approach called crossbatch training. Specifically, the memory attention layers are exposed to keys from the current context (positives) as well as keys from other unrelated documents (negatives). This enhances the structure of the key/value space, enabling the model to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant keys. 

The authors demonstrate FoT by fine-tuning OpenLLaMA models, producing LongLLaMA checkpoints that can handle much longer contexts. Experiments show significant improvements on tasks requiring longer context modeling, such as TREC question classification. Notably, the fine-tuned models can extrapolate far beyond their training context length. For example, a 3B LongLLaMA model achieves high accuracy on passkey retrieval even with 256k tokens, despite only being trained on 8k context. Additional analysis examines FoT's ability to mitigate the distraction issue and improve perplexity on diverse long-context datasets. The proposed method provides a simple yet effective approach to augmenting existing transformers with longer context.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces the Focused Transformer (FoT), a technique to extend the effective context length of transformer models. The key ideas are:

- Use memory attention layers that can retrieve relevant information from an external memory bank of (key, value) pairs using nearest neighbors lookup. This allows extending the context available to the model during inference. 

- Train the model using a novel crossbatch training procedure. During training, the memory attention layers are exposed to keys from the current context as well as keys from previous contexts of the same document (positive examples) and other documents (negative examples). This is inspired by contrastive learning and helps the model structure the key space to mitigate the "distraction issue", enabling the use of much larger memory banks.

- Show that FoT can be used to effectively fine-tune existing models like OpenLLaMA to extend their context length, without modifying the base architecture. The resulting LongLLaMA models demonstrate improved performance in tasks requiring longer context such as passage retrieval, question answering, and long-context language modeling while maintaining strong performance on short context.

In summary, the Focused Transformer introduces memory augmentation and a tailored training process to extend transformer models' effective context length, providing a simple way to add long-context capabilities to existing architectures. The method is shown to allow scaling up to contexts with hundreds of thousands of tokens.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, this paper seems to be addressing the issue of limited effective context length in large language models. The key points are:

- Large language models like LLMs have great capability to incorporate new information contextually. However, their full potential is restrained due to limits on effective context length. 

- One solution is to use an external memory of key-value pairs. But as the number of documents increases, the proportion of relevant keys decreases, causing models to focus more on irrelevant keys. 

- The paper identifies this issue of getting distracted by overlapping keys linked to different values as the "distraction issue". It makes it hard for models to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information when scaling up context length.

- The paper proposes a new technique called Focused Transformer (FoT) to address this issue. It uses a training process inspired by contrastive learning to enhance the structure of the key-value space.

- This allows extending the effective context length by fine-tuning existing large models like OpenLLaMA with FoT. The resulting LongLLaMA models demonstrate improvements on tasks needing long context.

In summary, the key problem is the distraction issue that limits scaling up context length in transformers. The paper proposes FoT to improve key-value structure and address this, enabling longer effective context length.
