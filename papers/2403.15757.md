# [User-Side Realization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15757)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper tackles the problem of user-side realization, which refers to implementing or executing features on the end-user's side of a service. The key motivation is that users often want additional features or customizations that service providers do not offer. For example, a user may want a fair or diverse recommender system even if the official system does not provide it. 

The paper first discusses the requirements and challenges of user-side realization:

- Limited resources - End-users lack access to internal data or systems unlike official developers. This introduces limitations when building user-side systems.

- Generality - User-side algorithms should abstract conditions and interfaces to apply to many services, rather than being designed only for specific services. 

- Lightweight - User-side algorithms run on end-user devices, so they need to be simple and efficient.

The paper introduces two general approaches for user-side realization:

1. Wrapper methods: These wrap the official functionality and modify the inputs and/or outputs to add new features. For example, post-processing the outputs.

2. Reverse methods: These "reverse engineer" the service, make a copy, and add features by applying traditional algorithms to the copied version. However, usually only a relevant part rather than the full service is copied in practice.

The paper then proposes several user-side algorithms across domains like recommender systems, search engines, and translation systems. Some key methods are:

- Private recommender systems: Allow building personal fair/diverse recommender systems using official unfair systems
- Tiara: Enables customized image search engines with user-defined scoring 
- CLEAR: A lightweight user-side image search system with real-time performance
- Seafaring: Uses web images for more effective active learning of models
- PRISM: Adds privacy features to translation systems on the user-side

The proposed methods are evaluated in-the-wild on real systems like Twitter, IMDb, Flickr and ChatGPT. The paper also provides a live demo of the CLEAR system.

The key contributions are formally defining the concept of user-side realization, providing common approaches/solutions, and proposing various novel user-side algorithms that are empirically shown to be effective on real-world systems while meeting requirements like efficiency. The paper helps establish user-side realization as a promising research area.
