# [ContraNeRF: Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Synthetic-to-real   Novel View Synthesis via Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11052)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the generalization ability of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from synthetic data to real data for novel view synthesis. 

The key hypothesis is that models trained on synthetic data tend to predict sharper but less accurate volume densities when applied to real data. This results in rendered images with more artifacts. To address this, the authors propose a new method called ContraNeRF that introduces geometry-aware contrastive learning to learn multi-view consistent features with geometric constraints. This is hypothesized to help the model better capture scene geometry and improve generalization from synthetic to real data.

In summary, the main research question is how to enable NeRF models to generalize better from synthetic training data to real test data for novel view synthesis. The key hypothesis is that contrastive learning with geometric constraints can help the model learn more consistent multi-view features and improve geometry perception, leading to better generalization.
