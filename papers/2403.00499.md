# [Do Zombies Understand? A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Exploration of   Machine Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00499)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is an ongoing debate on whether large language models (LLMs) truly "understand" text. Some claim they show signs of understanding, while others argue they merely observe patterns without meaning.
- The paper argues that the disagreement stems from differing notions of what constitutes "understanding". Specifically, there are differences in views on whether subjective conscious experience is necessary for understanding, beyond just excelling on benchmarks.

Thought Experiment:
- The paper proposes a hypothetical chatbot called Z that excels on every conceivable language benchmark, seemingly without having subjective experiences. 
- It then asks whether Z can be said to "understand", showing the question elicits different responses from different AI research communities based on their view of the role of consciousness.

Proposed Definitions:
- "Functional Understanding": Based solely on performance - if Z exceeds human abilities on language tasks, it can be said to functionally understand language.  
- "Conscious Understanding": Requires both high performance on tasks as well as subjective conscious experience.

Connections to Literature:
- The paper reviews quotes from seminal works in AI (Turing, Searle) that tie understanding to internal subjective states, supporting the "conscious understanding" view.
- It also shows how benchmarks like chess and Go have been "solved" by AI systems that purely focus on functional performance, supporting the alternate perspective.

Implications: 
- The paper argues the disagreement on whether systems like LLMs understand text stems from conflating these two notions of understanding.
- Making the distinction explicit could better frame progress, debates and research directions around machine cognition.
