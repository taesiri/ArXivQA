# [Do Zombies Understand? A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Exploration of   Machine Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00499)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is an ongoing debate on whether large language models (LLMs) truly "understand" text. Some claim they show signs of understanding, while others argue they merely observe patterns without meaning.
- The paper argues that the disagreement stems from differing notions of what constitutes "understanding". Specifically, there are differences in views on whether subjective conscious experience is necessary for understanding, beyond just excelling on benchmarks.

Thought Experiment:
- The paper proposes a hypothetical chatbot called Z that excels on every conceivable language benchmark, seemingly without having subjective experiences. 
- It then asks whether Z can be said to "understand", showing the question elicits different responses from different AI research communities based on their view of the role of consciousness.

Proposed Definitions:
- "Functional Understanding": Based solely on performance - if Z exceeds human abilities on language tasks, it can be said to functionally understand language.  
- "Conscious Understanding": Requires both high performance on tasks as well as subjective conscious experience.

Connections to Literature:
- The paper reviews quotes from seminal works in AI (Turing, Searle) that tie understanding to internal subjective states, supporting the "conscious understanding" view.
- It also shows how benchmarks like chess and Go have been "solved" by AI systems that purely focus on functional performance, supporting the alternate perspective.

Implications: 
- The paper argues the disagreement on whether systems like LLMs understand text stems from conflating these two notions of understanding.
- Making the distinction explicit could better frame progress, debates and research directions around machine cognition.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a thought experiment involving a hypothetical chatbot that excels on all language tasks yet lacks subjective experience, in order to highlight differing perspectives on whether consciousness is required for language understanding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper argues that there are two different definitions of "understanding" that underlie the debate about whether language models can truly understand text:

1) "Functional understanding" - Understanding is defined based solely on the model's external behaviors and performance on benchmarks. This notion holds that if a model can match or exceed human performance on language tasks, it can be said to "understand" those tasks.

2) "Conscious understanding" - Understanding requires not just task performance, but also subjective conscious experience on the part of the model. This notion ties understanding to concepts like awareness, intentions, beliefs, emotions, etc.

The paper clarifies that proponents on both sides of the debate about language models and understanding hold one of these definitions, leading them to different conclusions. The paper aims to highlight this terminological disagreement and lay out research agendas associated with each definition. Overall, it tries to inject the question of consciousness, which has been extensively debated in philosophy, into the AI debate on understanding.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms are:

- Machine cognition
- Language models
- Understanding
- Consciousness
- Functional understanding
- Conscious experience
- Philosophical zombies
- Neural correlates of consciousness
- Subjective experience
- Thought experiment
- Mind-body problem
- Intelligence
- Qualia

The paper discusses debate around whether large language models (LLMs) truly understand text, and argues that differing notions of "understanding" underlie this debate. In particular, the authors highlight differing views on whether consciousness or subjective experience is required for understanding, versus a purely functional/behavioral notion of understanding measured through performance on tasks. 

The paper proposes a thought experiment involving a hypothetical chatbot "Z" that excels on all language tasks without possessing consciousness, connecting this to philosophical zombies. Two definitions of understanding are proposed - one solely requiring task performance ("functional understanding") and one also requiring consciousness ("conscious understanding"). Connections are drawn to literature in philosophy of mind, psychology, and cognitive neuroscience on the role of consciousness in understanding.

So in summary, the key terms have to do with machine cognition, notions of understanding, consciousness and subjectivity, philosophical thought experiments, and connections to cognitive science literature. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two distinct definitions of "understanding" - functional understanding and conscious understanding. What are the key differences between these definitions and what are the implications for AI research under each definition?

2. The paper draws a parallel between the "zombie argument" in philosophy and the debate around whether language models truly understand text. What are the similarities and differences between philosophical zombies and language models that exhibit intelligent behavior without conscious experience?

3. The authors claim that the question of whether conscious experience is necessary for understanding underlies much of the debate around language model capabilities. What evidence do they provide to support this claim? How convincing is this evidence?

4. The paper outlines a research agenda focused on the neural correlates of consciousness to work towards conscious understanding in machines. What are some of the challenges facing this approach and why might it be difficult to validate achievements in machine consciousness? 

5. The functional understanding definition relies on performance on external benchmark tasks as a proxy for understanding. What are some of the limitations of this approach? Are there alternative ways to define and measure functional understanding?

6. The paper discusses historical examples like chess and Go where machines have achieved "functional understanding". What new benchmark tasks could drive progress under this definition of understanding going forward? What criteria should these tasks meet?

7. The authors claim that natural language inference went through a similar cycle to chess and Go, from proxy for understanding to solved problem. Is NLI truly a "solved problem" and what evidence supports or contradicts this claim?

8. What objections to the paper's central question or assumptions do the authors attempt to address in Section 4? Are there additional objections not covered that could undermine the dichotomy presented?

9. The paper focuses narrowly on language understanding tasks. Could the arguments be extended to other aspects of intelligence like reasoning, creativity, and general world knowledge? What considerations are unique to natural language?

10. The authors invite researchers to examine their own definitions of understanding through the lens of the zombie thought experiment. What insights does this thought experiment provide when applied to your own position? How useful is this philosophical tool for clarifying debates in AI?
