## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new method for learning hierarchical representations of sentences using reinforcement learning. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Presenting a model that learns task-specific tree structures for representing sentences, without relying on supervised syntax annotations. The tree structures are optimized via reinforcement learning to improve performance on downstream NLP tasks.

2) Demonstrating through experiments that learning these task-specific composition orders outperforms sequential encoders and parsers based on syntactic treebanks.

3) Analyzing the induced trees and showing they discover some linguistically intuitive structures like noun phrases and simple verb phrases, but are overall different from conventional English syntax trees.

In summary, the core contribution is a reinforcement learning framework for learning sentence representations based on hierarchical tree structures tailored to improve performance on downstream NLP tasks. The key advantage is not needing explicit supervision in the form of syntax annotations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using reinforcement learning to learn tree-structured neural networks for representing sentences. How does the use of reinforcement learning for this task differ from more traditional supervised learning approaches? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

2. The reward signal used in the reinforcement learning algorithm comes from performance on downstream tasks. What impact could the choice of downstream task have on the types of tree structures learned? Could the trees be overfitting to a particular downstream task?  

3. The induced trees discover some linguistically intuitive structures but are different from conventional English syntactic trees. What might account for these differences? Could the trees be incorporating semantic aspects rather than just syntax?

4. Error analysis is shown for the downstream tasks but no direct analysis is provided of the induced trees themselves. What further analysis could be done to better understand the linguistic properties captured by the learned trees?

5. How sensitive is the tree learning process to different model architectures and hyperparameters? Could advances in underlying neural architectures lead to improved tree learning?

6. For the setting using external parser supervision, how much do the final learned trees differ from the initial seed trees from the parser? Is there a way to quantify this structural drift?

7. The model is evaluated on sentence-level tasks. How well might the approach scale to learning representations for paragraphs, documents or larger bodies of text? Would the training remain feasible?

8. Could the proposed approach be integrated as a component in a larger model rather than training from scratch? Would pre-training or multi-task learning help? 

9. Error analysis shows the model struggles with longer and more complex sentences. Are there any modifications to the approach that could improve performance on longer sequences?

10. The approach is evaluated on English text only. How well might it transfer to other languages, including low-resource languages without explicit syntactic supervision? Are there any required modifications to enable multilingual learning?
