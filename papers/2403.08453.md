# [Better Fit: Accommodate Variations in Clothing Types for Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08453)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper focuses on the problem of unpaired virtual try-on, where the target clothing image is different from the original clothing worn by the person in the image during training. Existing methods fail to preserve the type of the target clothing during such unpaired try-on due to the correlation between the try-on area and the original clothing.  

Proposed Solution
The paper proposes a novel adaptive mask training paradigm to break the correlation between the try-on area and the original clothing. This is done by dynamically adjusting the training masks to simulate unpaired try-on scenarios. Specifically, the training samples are classified based on whether the top clothing interferes with the bottom clothing. Different masks are then applied - retaining the bottom clothing for interfered samples, and extending the mask downwards for non-interfered samples. This enables the model to learn more accurate semantic correspondences for inpainting the try-on area.

Main Contributions
1. Proposes adaptive mask training to make the model capable of preserving clothing type during unpaired virtual try-on.

2. Proposes two new evaluation metrics specifically for unpaired try-on:
   - Semantic-Densepose-Ratio (SDR) to measure clothing type accuracy
   - Skeleton-LPIPS (S-LPIPS) to measure clothing texture accuracy

3. Constructs a new cross try-on benchmark called Cross-27 with 729 combinations covering diverse try-on situations to evaluate unpaired try-on performance.

Experiments show that the proposed adaptive mask training paradigm significantly enhances unpaired try-on performance in preserving clothing type. The new SDR and S-LPIPS metrics also consistently reflect try-on quality compared to existing metrics like FID and KID.
