# [Learning Federated Visual Prompt in Null Space for MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16181)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively tackle three key issues in federated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction: 

1) Insufficient amount of local training data due to the difficulty of acquiring ground truth MRI images. 

2) Limited communication bandwidth between clients and the server due to unbalanced regional development.

3) Catastrophic forgetting caused by data heterogeneity from different MRI scanner protocols used by different clients.

The paper proposes a new federated learning paradigm called FedPR to address these issues by only learning and communicating a small set of parameters called "prompts" that are optimized to lie in the null space of global prompts. This allows competitive performance with limited local data while preventing catastrophic forgetting.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that learning federated visual prompts in the null space can effectively address the key challenges of insufficient/heterogeneous local data and limited communication in federated MRI reconstruction. The experiments aim to validate whether FedPR can achieve superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art federated learning methods under these constrained real-world conditions.
