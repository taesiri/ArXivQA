# [Learning Federated Visual Prompt in Null Space for MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16181)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively tackle three key issues in federated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction: 

1) Insufficient amount of local training data due to the difficulty of acquiring ground truth MRI images. 

2) Limited communication bandwidth between clients and the server due to unbalanced regional development.

3) Catastrophic forgetting caused by data heterogeneity from different MRI scanner protocols used by different clients.

The paper proposes a new federated learning paradigm called FedPR to address these issues by only learning and communicating a small set of parameters called "prompts" that are optimized to lie in the null space of global prompts. This allows competitive performance with limited local data while preventing catastrophic forgetting.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that learning federated visual prompts in the null space can effectively address the key challenges of insufficient/heterogeneous local data and limited communication in federated MRI reconstruction. The experiments aim to validate whether FedPR can achieve superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art federated learning methods under these constrained real-world conditions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes FedPR, a new federated learning paradigm for MRI reconstruction that tackles three key issues: insufficient local training data, limited communication bandwidth, and catastrophic forgetting due to data heterogeneity. 

2. It introduces federated visual prompts that leverage powerful pre-trained models and only update/communicate small prompt parameters rather than the whole model, significantly reducing communication costs.

3. It optimizes local prompts in the approximate null space of global prompts to prevent catastrophic forgetting by avoiding overriding previously acquired global knowledge from past communication rounds. 

4. Experiments demonstrate FedPR achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art federated learning methods in complex scenarios with less local data, lower communication costs, and faster convergence.

In summary, the key novelty is proposing a new federated learning approach tailored for MRI reconstruction that addresses common challenges like limited data and communication through federated visual prompts and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by updating local prompts in the global prompt's null space. Experiments validate the effectiveness of FedPR for federated MRI reconstruction.
