# [Primer: Searching for Efficient Transformers for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08668)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we efficiently search for transformer architectures that achieve high performance on language modeling tasks?

In particular, the paper focuses on developing a search space and search method to find efficient transformer architectures for language modeling that have a good trade-off between model parameter size, training cost, and modeling performance. The key ideas are:

- Defining a search space of transformer architectures that modifies factorizations of the attention mechanism and feedforward layers to improve parameter and compute efficiency.

- Using a Bayesian optimization search method to efficiently search this architecture space, evaluating promising candidates on language modeling benchmarks.

- Developing a new transformer model called Primer discovered through this search process that achieves strong language modeling performance with improved efficiency compared to baseline transformers.

So in summary, the main research question is how to find efficient transformer architectures for language modeling, and the paper proposes techniques to effectively search the architecture space for such models. The end result is a new model called Primer that demonstrates these efficiency improvements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting Primer, an efficient transformer model for language modeling that was found through neural architecture search. The key points are:

- They perform neural architecture search over transformer architectures to find an efficient model for language modeling called Primer. This involves searching over hyperparameters like number of layers, hidden sizes, attention heads, feedforward dimensions, etc.

- Primer achieves state-of-the-art results on language modeling benchmarks like LM1B and PG-19 with fewer parameters and FLOPS compared to previous models like GPT-3 and T5.

- They propose a new objective called the "implicit efficiency objective" which guides the architecture search towards more efficient models without explicitly optimizing for efficiency.

- Primer uses a new sparsely activated feedforward block called MDHA which improves efficiency.

- They demonstrate the transferability of Primer by showing it can be adapted to other tasks like summarization while maintaining efficiency gains over other models.

In summary, the main contribution is using neural architecture search to find an efficient transformer model for language modeling called Primer that achieves strong performance with fewer computational resources. The search process and proposed techniques like the implicit efficiency objective and MDHA block are key to this result.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on efficient transformers for language modeling:

- The paper introduces a new sparse attention mechanism called MDHA (Multi-Depth Hierarchical Attention), which is designed to reduce the computational complexity of attention in transformers. This compares to other work on sparse attention like Sparse Transformers, Longformer, BigBird, etc.

- The paper searches over various model architectures, attention mechanisms, and training techniques using an automated search procedure. This allows efficiently exploring a large design space. Other work has also looked at automated search for efficient architectures, but this paper searches over a wider set of parameters.

- The model Primer they propose achieves state-of-the-art results on language modeling benchmarks like LAMBADA while using fewer parameters and FLOPs than comparable models. This demonstrates the effectiveness of their automated search procedure at finding efficient architectures. 

- They also propose a distilled model Primer-EZ which achieves solid results with very low resource requirements. This compares favorably to other distillation techniques for producing highly efficient models.

- The focus on transformers for language modeling compares to other work that has looked at efficient architectures for computer vision or speech tasks. The techniques here are specialized for the text domain.

Overall, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in efficient transformers for language tasks through extensive architecture search and a new sparse attention mechanism. The results compare favorably to previous work while illuminating new directions for efficiency improvements.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other search spaces beyond the low-rank factorization of the feedforward layer, such as searching over kernel sizes, attention configurations, etc. There may be further gains from expanding the search space.

- Searching directly on larger datasets like C4 rather than WikiText-103, which may reveal architectures specialized for greater capacity and generalization.

- Developing methods to efficiently search over conditional computation, as the Primer models still use fixed computation. Allowing computation to vary based on inputs could improve efficiency.

- Exploring ways to reduce training costs to enable larger-scale architecture search, such as via weight sharing or predictive hyperparameter search.

- Applying the search methodology to multilingual models and other modalities beyond text.

- Developing theoretical understandings of why the discovered architectures work well compared to hand-designed transformers.

In summary, the main directions are expanding the search space, scaling up search to larger datasets, incorporating conditional computation, reducing training costs, applying to new domains, and developing theory.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Primer, a new Transformer-based language model that is designed to be more efficient and scalable than previous models like BERT. The authors perform a large-scale neural architecture search to find an optimal Transformer configuration for language modeling. They constrain the search space to make it more efficient, for example by limiting model size and removing components like layer normalization. The resulting Primer model matches the performance of BERT while using fewer parameters and FLOPs. Primer also scales better to larger model sizes. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art results on GLUE and SQuAD compared to models of similar size. Overall, this work presents a method to automatically design more efficient Transformer architectures for language tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Primer, a new method for searching for efficient transformers for language modeling. The authors define a novel search space consisting of factors like model depth, width, decoder cross-attention, MLP width ratio, and attention key dimension. They then use evolutionary search to efficiently explore this large discrete search space and find improved transformer architectures specialized for language modeling. Their best found model, Primer, matches the performance of previous state-of-the-art models while using 55-75% fewer parameters and outperforming predecessors in compute efficiency.  

Primer achieves these gains through an evolved architecture that is much shallower and narrower than previous transformers. It has an MLP-Mixer stem, followed by just 6 transformer encoder blocks with reduced hidden size. The decoder avoids full cross-attention, further reducing compute. This architecture shows that large transformer models are significantly over-parameterized for language modeling. By efficiently searching a novel discrete space, Primer finds a specialized design using far fewer parameters and FLOPs while maintaining high performance. The authors conclude that further progress in efficient transformers is possible through architecture search rather than simply scaling model size.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces Primer, an efficient transformer model for language modeling. The key method used is as follows:

The authors perform neural architecture search to find an efficient transformer architecture specialized for language modeling. The search space consists of standard transformer components like multi-head attention and feedforward layers, but also includes proposed components like MDHA (Multi-DConv Head Attention). The search is done using an evolution-based method with a population of models that are iteratively updated across generations by mutating the model hyperparameters and architecture, evaluating on a proxy task, and selecting the top performing models for the next generation. The proxy task uses a smaller model trained on a subset of data to evaluate architectures efficiently. After search, the best architecture Primer is scaled up and fine-tuned on the full dataset. This automated search allows finding a specialized architecture that is more efficient than standard transformers for language modeling.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem the authors are trying to address is how to efficiently search for Transformer architectures that achieve strong performance on language modeling tasks. 

The paper introduces a new model called Primer and a method for automatically searching over Transformer architectures to find efficient configurations optimized for language modeling. The goal is to develop architectures that match or exceed the performance of standard Transformers with significantly better efficiency (i.e. lower computational cost).

- How can we automate architecture search to find optimal Transformer configurations for language modeling instead of relying on manual tuning?

- Can we develop Transformer architectures that are much more efficient but still achieve competitive performance on language modeling benchmarks?

So in summary, the core focus is developing methods to automatically find efficient Transformer architectures for language modeling tasks. The paper aims to show this is possible and introduces a model called Primer found through their automated search technique.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

The paper introduces TensorFlow Primitives, a set of low-level TensorFlow operations that can be composed to construct neural network architectures. The primitives include basic math operations (add, subtract, multiply, etc.), reductions (mean, sum, min, max), convolutions, dense layers, activations, and more. These primitives are used to define a search space for neural architecture search. Candidate architectures are represented as programs composed of these primitives. The primitives are designed to construct architectures like Transformers, by including operations needed for self-attention, layer normalization, feedforward layers, etc. The paper also proposes a vocabulary of relative tensor shapes instead of explicit dimensions, allowing architectures to be resized.
