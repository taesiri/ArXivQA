# [INSPECT: Intrinsic and Systematic Probing Evaluation for Code   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05092)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a probing framework called INSPECT to evaluate the capabilities of pre-trained source code models. The authors defined 15 probing tasks covering syntactic, semantic, and structural characteristics of Java code to assess what intrinsic code properties are learned by models during pre-training. They evaluated 8 transformer-based source code models from the HuggingFace Model Hub, including CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, etc., against a BERT baseline not trained on code. The results show that while models perform well on syntactic and some semantic tasks, they struggle significantly on tasks requiring structural reasoning, even sophisticated models like GraphCodeBERT. CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT were the top performers, likely due to their code-specific pre-training objectives, outperforming purely NLP-based objectives. Surprisingly, BERT was competitive or even outperformed source code models on some structural tasks. The study highlights opportunities for better encoding intrinsic structural characteristics in code models, and that care must be taken in choosing layers that encode relevant information. The extensible INSPECT framework automates probing so models can be systematically evaluated on their learned code knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces INSPECT, a framework for probing the source code knowledge encoded within pretrained source code language models using 15 tasks across 5 categories spanning syntactic, semantic, and structural characteristics of code.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) The authors introduce a framework called INSPECT for probing and intrinsically evaluating pre-trained source code models. INSPECT allows easily probing models available on the Huggingface hub on a set of predefined tasks, and also supports adding new probing tasks.

2) The authors define a suite of 15 probing tasks in Java that cover various code characteristics like identifiers, structure, semantics, surface features etc. This allows thoroughly evaluating source code models on their ability to encode key aspects of code. 

3) The authors use INSPECT and the task suite to probe 8 Transformer-based source code models and compare them to a baseline BERT model. They analyze the results to identify strengths and weaknesses of current models.

4) Key findings are that models tend to do well on syntactic and semantic tasks but struggle with structural tasks. GraphCodeBERT performs the best overall. The training objective seems to play a key role. Models show varied learning patterns across layers.

5) The authors discuss implications like using NLP models as baselines, the need for more structural pre-training objectives, studying impact on downstream tasks etc. They also relate their findings to other studies.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a framework plus benchmark and using it to gain insight into what source code models learn, illustrating some current limitations. The probing framework and suite can serve to evaluate future models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Probing - Using diagnostic tasks to evaluate what implicit knowledge neural network models acquire during pre-training.

- Source code models - Transformer-based language models that are pre-trained on large corpora of source code, such as CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5.

- Intrinsic evaluation - Assessing the inherent capabilities of a model by probing what linguistic concepts it has implicitly learned, rather than evaluating performance on downstream tasks.  

- INSPECT - The probing framework and suite of 15 tasks introduced in this paper to evaluate source code models' understanding of identifiers, structure, semantics, etc.

- Token-based tasks - Probing tasks focused on classifying individual code tokens, like identifiers and keywords.

- Metrics-based tasks - Tasks involving reasoning about code characteristics like operator counts, variables, complexity metrics.  

- Incorrect-code tasks - Tasks requiring models to detect bugs, mistakes, or unnatural constructs in code.

- Source code characteristics - The syntactic, semantic, and structural properties of code that probing tasks are designed to assess knowledge of.

- Model analysis - Evaluating and comparing probe performance across different pre-trained models. 

- Layer analysis - Analyzing how probe performance varies across the internal layers of neural models.

So in summary - probing, source code models, intrinsic evaluation, the INSPECT framework, and analysis of different linguistic characteristics, models, and layers are key ideas.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a framework called INSPECT for probing source code models. What are some of the key capabilities and features of this framework? How does it help automate and simplify the probing process?

2. The paper evaluates the models on 15 different probing tasks spread across 5 categories - token-based, metrics-based, incorrect-code, count-based, and complexity-based. Why is it important to have tasks spread across multiple categories to effectively evaluate source code models?

3. The authors find that models generally struggle with structural tasks compared to syntactic and semantic tasks. Why do you think this is the case? What architectural changes can be made to models to better capture structural characteristics of code?  

4. The paper compares source code models against a BERT baseline not trained on code. In what all tasks does BERT perform surprisingly well? What does this indicate about the current source code models?

5. The authors hypothesize that the training objective likely influences how well models capture intrinsic code characteristics. What evidence do they present in favor of this hypothesis? How can this be further tested?

6. The paper finds a diversity of learning patterns across models, with peak performance coming in early, middle or late layers depending on the model. What are some potential explanations for these differing patterns? 

7. How robust are the conclusions from the layer-analysis conducted in the paper? What cautions need to be exercised in interpreting these results?

8. The paper introduces a suite of 15 tasks but mentions several additional possible tasks in the Appendices. Pick any 3 of those suggested tasks and explain why probing on those would provide value.

9. The authors note that probes focus only on the pre-training stage of models. How important is it to study if better pre-trained representations translate to better downstream task performance?

10. The paper has several limitations acknowledged by the authors such as focusing only on encoders. Pick any 2 limitations and suggest ways to address them in future work.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large-scale pre-trained models of source code like CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, etc. have shown impressive performance on various software engineering tasks. However, there is limited understanding of what these models actually learn about the characteristics and structure of source code. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose using probing - simple diagnostic tasks that evaluate models on specific characteristics, without further training them. They design an extensible framework called INSPECT with 15 probing tasks spanning identifiers, structure, semantics, complexity etc. of Java code. They use these probes to evaluate 8 pre-trained code models and a BERT baseline on how well they represent code concepts.

Key Contributions:

- Definition of a suite of 15 probing tasks under INSPECT framework to evaluate intrinsic representation of code concepts like identifiers, structure, semantics in pre-trained models

- Evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art code models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT etc) and a BERT baseline using probes 

- Finding that code models struggle with structural tasks compared to semantic tasks, even best models have marginal gains over BERT

- Observation that model architecture and training objectives impact probing performance 

- Releasing INSPECT framework and datasets to facilitate further probing research into code models to better understand their capabilities

Overall, the paper demonstrates the utility of probing for intrinsic evaluation of code models. It highlights limitations of existing models in learning structural code concepts and provides insights into factors impacting quality of learned representations. The work enables further research through the released framework and tasks.
