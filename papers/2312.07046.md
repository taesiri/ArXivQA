# [Rethinking Compression: Reduced Order Modelling of Latent Features in   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07046)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a novel approach called LLM-ROM for compressing large language models (LLMs) that is more effective and practical than existing methods like pruning and quantization. LLM-ROM works by performing localized reduced order modeling of the latent features in each layer of the LLM through low-rank decomposition of the feature space and reparameterization of the weights. A key advantage is that it operates layer-wise and does not require GPU resources, enabling the compression of billion-scale models under tight time and memory constraints. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-ROM outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-Pruner method without any fine-tuning at compression rates of 80% and 50% on the LLaMA-7B model, even surpassing fine-tuned LLM-Pruner at 80%. The simplicity and efficacy of LLM-ROM provides a significant advancement for practical LLM compression. Overall, the paper presents reduced order modeling of latent features as a promising new technique for effectively compressing LLMs in a highly resource-efficient manner without compromising accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel approach for practical compression of large language models through reduced order modeling of latent features via low-rank decomposition in the feature space and re-parameterization in the weight space.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is a new approach for compressing large language models (LLMs) called LLM-ROM. Specifically:

- LLM-ROM performs layerwise reduced order modeling of the latent features in LLMs through low-rank decomposition in the feature space and re-parameterization in the weight space. This allows compression without needing full model updates or a GPU.

- LLM-ROM is able to compress extremely large, billion-scale models within tight time and memory constraints. The authors compress the 7B parameter LLaMA model on a CPU in 15-30 minutes.

- LLM-ROM outperforms existing compression techniques like pruning on zero-shot evaluations, even without fine-tuning. At 80% compression, LLM-ROM beats fine-tuned pruning on average across common sense reasoning tasks.

- LLM-ROM provides a practical and simple way to compress LLMs that is architecture-agnostic and does not require manual tuning per model like pruning does.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing layerwise reduced order modeling of latent features as an efficient and effective new technique for compressing massive language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the proposed method operates layerwise. Why is a layerwise approach preferred over compressing the entire model simultaneously? What challenges would compressing the entire model present?

2. The eigenvalue decomposition of the symmetric covariance matrix is used to compute the principal components. Walk through the math of this eigenvalue decomposition. Why is decomposing the covariance matrix a sensible approach? 

3. The paper finds that setting a uniform compression budget across all modules initially leads to significant performance deterioration. Why might this be the case? What is the proposed solution to account for this?

4. The choice of calibration dataset used to compute the principal components is found to impact model performance after compression. Explain this result. What properties might an ideal calibration set have?  

5. The paper states the computational cost of the method is small since operations are done on CPU. Quantify what you mean by "small" - provide rough estimates of memory, time and hardware requirements.

6. How exactly does the layerwise low-rank decomposition and reparameterization compress the model? Walk through the mathematical details of how the smaller linear layers are derived.

7. The method is shown to outperform prevailing state-of-the-art pruning techniques. What are the key advantages of this proposed approach over pruning methods?

8. The batch size used to compute the principal components influences generalization capability. Explain why larger batch sizes are beneficial in this context.

9. What challenges might arise when trying to scale this method to even larger models with trillions of parameters? How feasibly could tricks like layerwise loading be extended?  

10. The paper demonstrates strong zero-shot task performance after compression. How might this method perform in a task-specific fine-tuning setting? Would gains from fine-tuning be expected?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have hundreds of billions of parameters, making them computationally expensive for inference despite their high accuracy. 
- Existing compression techniques like pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation have limitations in terms of hardware constraints, massive compute requirements for training, and significant performance drops.
- There is a need for a practical compression technique specially designed for large models like LLMs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new compression approach called LLM-ROM that performs layerwise reduced order modeling (ROM) of the latent features in LLMs. 
- It computes the principal components of the layer outputs using eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix. Only top principal components are retained to get a low-rank approximation of the layer.  
- Each layer is re-parameterized into two smaller linear layers using the retained principal components. This decomposes the original layer into lower-rank layers, compressing the model.
- Since decomposition is layerwise, no full model updates are needed. Entire compression uses CPU, not needing GPUs.

Main Contributions:
- First work to use ROM for compressing LLMs by decomposing layers into low-rank approximations. Operates layerwise on CPU for memory and compute efficiency.
- Outperforms prevailing pruning methods without any fine-tuning at 80% and 50% compression rates. Matches fine-tuned pruning at 80% budget.
- Agnostic to model architecture. No manual effort needed like pruning methods to identify structures.
- Demonstrates the efficacy of matrix decomposition in extracting smaller neural components from larger counterparts.
- Opens up potential for compressed LLM design without extensive resources.

In summary, the paper introduces a practical LLM compression technique using reduced order modeling of layerwise latent features. By retaining only critical components, it decomposes layers into lower-rank approximations in a resource-efficient manner, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
