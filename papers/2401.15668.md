# [Lips Are Lying: Spotting the Temporal Inconsistency between Audio and   Visual in Lip-Syncing DeepFakes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15668)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deepfakes, especially lip-syncing deepfakes, are being used for malicious purposes like fraud and falsified information. Lip-syncing deepfakes synchronize fake lip movements with real audio to create forged videos that appear authentic.
- Existing deepfake detection methods fail to effectively detect lip-syncing deepfakes which do not manipulate identity or introduce visible artifacts. The subtle forged lip movements are challenging to spot.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes LipFD, a novel lip-syncing deepfake detection method that exploits the temporal inconsistency between lip movements and accompanying audio signals.  
- It introduces a dual-headed architecture with Global Feature Encoder to capture long-term correlations between video frames and audio spectrograms.
- The Global-Region Encoder focuses on local regions of interest like lips, guided by a Region Awareness module to emphasize important areas.

Main Contributions:
- First specialized approach for detecting challenging lip-syncing deepfakes which pose a significant real-world threat.
- Achieves over 95% accuracy on lip-sync deepfakes, significantly outperforming prior works. Demonstrates high efficacy on diverse datasets.
- Constructs AVLips, a large-scale lip-sync dataset with 100K real and forged samples. Provides a benchmark for further research.  
- Extensive experiments prove high accuracy (90%+) in real-world video chat scenarios and robustness against various perturbations.

In summary, the paper proposes a pioneering lip-syncing deepfake detection technique that captures audio-visual inconsistencies over time combined with focused local feature analysis. Rigorous experiments demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance and reliability. The novel ideas, extensive evaluations and constructed dataset advance research in this critical direction.
