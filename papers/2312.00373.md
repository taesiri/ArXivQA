# [Streaming Bayesian Modeling for predicting Fat-Tailed Customer Lifetime   Value](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00373)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper develops a method to enable Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian modeling for large streaming datasets that may have concept drifts. The authors propose techniques for online categorical encoding and adapting HMC/NUTS samplers to operate online while being robust to changes in data distribution. They also develop a model for predicting customer lifetime value that uses a Student-t distribution to account for potential fat tails in the data. Their approach combines online learning, Bayesian modeling, and robust estimation to create LTV models on tall/wide datasets that can adapt to non-stationary data streams. The paper demonstrates this on a mobile app customer cohort revenue prediction task. Their method generalizes between thin and fat-tailed data via estimated Student-t degrees of freedom. Compared to a Gaussian model baseline, their approach better fits heavy-tailed empirical data and evaluates well on metrics like LPPD and RMSE. The contributions allow retaining interpretability of hierarchical Bayesian models while making them scalable for streaming commercial applications with concept drift.
