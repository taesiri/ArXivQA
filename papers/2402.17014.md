# [Z-AGI Labs at ClimateActivism 2024: Stance and Hate Event Detection on   Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17014)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of hate speech and stance detection in the context of climate change activism on social media. Specifically, it addresses 3 sub-tasks: (1) Hate speech detection - identifying if a tweet contains hate speech or not, (2) Targets of hate speech - categorizing the targets of hate speech into individuals, organizations or communities, (3) Stance detection - determining if a tweet supports, opposes or is neutral towards climate activism. The ability to accurately detect hate speech and stance is crucial to fostering a constructive discourse on social issues.

Proposed Solution:
The authors experiment with several classical ML models like LSTM, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, etc. using TF-IDF features on the tweet text. They also employ a BiLSTM model with attention for capturing sequential dependencies. The models are evaluated on standard metrics like F1-score, accuracy, precision and recall. Hyperparameter tuning is done to optimize each model.  

Key Contributions:
- CatBoost emerges as the top performer for subtask B (target detection) with F1 of 0.5604 and subtask C (stance detection) with F1 of 0.7081
- LGBM achieves the best F1 score of 0.8684 for subtask A (hate speech detection)
- The study provides insights into choosing appropriate classical ML techniques for the 3 subtasks related to climate activism discourse on social media
- Results improve over competitive transformer-based baseline models, demonstrating the efficacy of classical models
- The models contribute towards building more constructive social media conversations on climate change.

In summary, the paper explores classical ML models to further research on detecting hate speech and stance in the climate activism domain, guiding future work towards mitigating negative discourse.
