# [Disentangling Writer and Character Styles for Handwriting Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14736)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The main research question this paper addresses is how to disentangle writer and character styles for improving handwriting generation. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that disentangling the overall writer style and detailed character styles can lead to more realistic and diverse synthesized handwritings.The key hypotheses are:1) Handwritings by the same person exhibit overall uniformity in some aspects (e.g. slant, aspect ratio), but still have subtle style inconsistencies between characters (e.g. stroke length, curvature). 2) Separately capturing the overall writer style and detailed character styles enables generating handwritings that better match the exemplar writer.3) Using contrastive learning objectives can guide the model to learn disentangled representations for the two styles.To test these hypotheses, the paper proposes a new model called Style-Disentangled Transformer (SDT) which uses a dual-head style encoder and contrastive losses to extract separate writer and character style representations. Experiments on Chinese, English, Japanese and Indic scripts demonstrate SDT's effectiveness in realistic handwriting synthesis compared to prior arts. The results support the hypotheses that disentangling and explicitly modeling writer vs character styles improves quality and diversity of generated handwritings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes to disentangle the style representations at both writer and character levels from individual handwritings to synthesize realistic stylized online handwritten characters. 2. It presents the style-disentangled Transformer (SDT), which employs two complementary contrastive objectives to extract the style commonalities of reference samples and capture the detailed style patterns of each sample.3. It develops an offline-to-offline framework building on SDT to produce more plausible offline handwritten Chinese characters.4. Extensive experiments on various language scripts demonstrate the effectiveness of SDT for handwriting generation. The empirical findings reveal that the two learned style representations provide information at different frequency magnitudes.In summary, the key novelty of this paper is the idea of disentangling writer and character level styles using contrastive learning objectives in the Transformer architecture. This allows generating handwritten text that better captures both the overall writing style of a person as well as subtle stylistic variations between different characters. The offline-to-online framework further improves the quality of synthesized offline handwritten Chinese characters.
