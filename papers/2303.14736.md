# [Disentangling Writer and Character Styles for Handwriting Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14736)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The main research question this paper addresses is how to disentangle writer and character styles for improving handwriting generation. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that disentangling the overall writer style and detailed character styles can lead to more realistic and diverse synthesized handwritings.The key hypotheses are:1) Handwritings by the same person exhibit overall uniformity in some aspects (e.g. slant, aspect ratio), but still have subtle style inconsistencies between characters (e.g. stroke length, curvature). 2) Separately capturing the overall writer style and detailed character styles enables generating handwritings that better match the exemplar writer.3) Using contrastive learning objectives can guide the model to learn disentangled representations for the two styles.To test these hypotheses, the paper proposes a new model called Style-Disentangled Transformer (SDT) which uses a dual-head style encoder and contrastive losses to extract separate writer and character style representations. Experiments on Chinese, English, Japanese and Indic scripts demonstrate SDT's effectiveness in realistic handwriting synthesis compared to prior arts. The results support the hypotheses that disentangling and explicitly modeling writer vs character styles improves quality and diversity of generated handwritings.
