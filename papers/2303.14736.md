# [Disentangling Writer and Character Styles for Handwriting Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14736)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The main research question this paper addresses is how to disentangle writer and character styles for improving handwriting generation. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that disentangling the overall writer style and detailed character styles can lead to more realistic and diverse synthesized handwritings.

The key hypotheses are:

1) Handwritings by the same person exhibit overall uniformity in some aspects (e.g. slant, aspect ratio), but still have subtle style inconsistencies between characters (e.g. stroke length, curvature). 

2) Separately capturing the overall writer style and detailed character styles enables generating handwritings that better match the exemplar writer.

3) Using contrastive learning objectives can guide the model to learn disentangled representations for the two styles.

To test these hypotheses, the paper proposes a new model called Style-Disentangled Transformer (SDT) which uses a dual-head style encoder and contrastive losses to extract separate writer and character style representations. Experiments on Chinese, English, Japanese and Indic scripts demonstrate SDT's effectiveness in realistic handwriting synthesis compared to prior arts. The results support the hypotheses that disentangling and explicitly modeling writer vs character styles improves quality and diversity of generated handwritings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes to disentangle the style representations at both writer and character levels from individual handwritings to synthesize realistic stylized online handwritten characters. 

2. It presents the style-disentangled Transformer (SDT), which employs two complementary contrastive objectives to extract the style commonalities of reference samples and capture the detailed style patterns of each sample.

3. It develops an offline-to-offline framework building on SDT to produce more plausible offline handwritten Chinese characters.

4. Extensive experiments on various language scripts demonstrate the effectiveness of SDT for handwriting generation. The empirical findings reveal that the two learned style representations provide information at different frequency magnitudes.

In summary, the key novelty of this paper is the idea of disentangling writer and character level styles using contrastive learning objectives in the Transformer architecture. This allows generating handwritten text that better captures both the overall writing style of a person as well as subtle stylistic variations between different characters. The offline-to-online framework further improves the quality of synthesized offline handwritten Chinese characters.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main point of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called style-disentangled Transformer (SDT) that disentangles writer-level and character-level styles from handwritten samples to generate realistic and stylistically diverse online handwritings in multiple languages.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in Chinese character generation:

- It focuses specifically on disentangling writer and character styles for handwriting generation. Many previous works have focused only on capturing the overall writing style at a writer level, while neglecting subtle style inconsistencies between different characters from the same writer. This paper is novel in separately extracting both an overall writer style and detailed character styles.

- It proposes a new model architecture called style-disentangled Transformer (SDT) to achieve the style disentangling. This uses a dual-head style encoder with contrastive objectives to extract the two complementary style representations. Most prior works have used RNN or GAN architectures without such an explicit disentangling approach.

- It achieves state-of-the-art results on Chinese datasets for online character generation. The quantitative metrics and user study show SDT generates handwriting of higher quality than previous models like Drawing, FontRNN, DeepImitator and WriteLikeYou.

- The style disentangling approach is shown to generalize well to other scripts like Japanese, Indic and English. Most prior work has focused only on Chinese or Latin script generation. Evaluations on these additional datasets demonstrate the wider applicability.

- Analysis reveals the two learned style representations capture different frequency information, with writer style focusing on lower frequencies and character style capturing more high frequency details. This provides insight into their complementary roles.

- The paper further proposes an offline generation framework building on SDT. This generates realistic offline handwritten characters through an online-to-offline process, outperforming prior offline generation methods.

Overall, the style disentangling approach and strong results across multiple languages set this work apart from prior research. The analysis also provides valuable insights into how overall writer style and detailed character styles contribute in different ways to handwriting generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions the authors suggest:

- Extending SDT for generating offline handwritten characters. The authors propose an offline-to-offline generation framework to produce offline Chinese characters by first generating online characters using SDT and then decorating them with realistic stroke width, ink blots, etc. They suggest this framework could be further improved and extended.

- Applying SDT to other generative tasks such as font generation. The authors state that although SDT was designed for handwriting generation, it has potential for extension to other generative tasks like font generation.

- Exploring the use of different backbone architectures besides Transformer. The authors used Transformer as the backbone architecture but note that exploring other architectures could be interesting future work.

- Investigating the effect of different combinations of writer-wise and character-wise style features. The paper studied combining the two style features but the authors suggest further exploring different ways to combine them. 

- Extending the method to generate cursive handwriting or handwritten words/text. The current work focuses on generating isolated characters. Generating cursive writing or full words/sentences could be an impactful extension.

- Applying the disentangled style representations to tasks beyond generation, such as handwriting recognition. The authors suggest the learned representations could be useful for other applications besides generation.

- Exploring unsupervised or weakly supervised methods for learning the disentangled styles. The current method relies on labeled data. Removing this requirement could make it more widely applicable.

In summary, the main future directions are extending SDT to new tasks and contexts, investigating alternative architectures and learning schemes, and applying the representations to other applications like recognition.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel method called style-disentangled Transformer (SDT) for synthesizing realistic and diverse online handwritings. The key idea is to disentangle style representations at both writer and character levels from individual handwriting samples. At the writer level, style consistency among a person's handwriting is captured. At the character level, subtle style variations between characters are modeled. This is achieved through two complementary contrastive objectives that guide the model to learn writer-wise and character-wise styles, respectively. SDT consists of a dual-head style encoder to extract the two style representations, a content encoder to learn the textual feature, and a Transformer decoder that generates stylized handwriting trajectories in an autoregressive manner. Experiments demonstrate SDT's effectiveness in modeling various language scripts and its superiority over previous state-of-the-art methods. Building on SDT, an offline-to-offline framework is further introduced to synthesize realistic offline handwritten Chinese characters.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called style-disentangled Transformer (SDT) for generating stylized online handwritten characters. The key idea is to disentangle the style information in handwritten characters into two components - an overall writer style that captures commonalities across a writer's samples, and a detailed character style that captures subtle differences between characters from the same writer. 

To achieve this, the SDT uses a dual-head style encoder with contrastive learning objectives to extract the two style representations. It also uses a Transformer architecture for the decoder to generate handwritten characters in an autoregressive manner based on the textual content signal and aggregated style information. Experiments on Chinese, English, Japanese and Indic scripts demonstrate the approach can generate characters that better match the target style compared to prior arts. The method is also extended to generating offline handwritten Chinese characters by first generating online trajectories and then adding width, blot and other effects.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel method called style-disentangled Transformer (SDT) to generate realistic and diverse online handwritings. The key idea is to disentangle the style representations at both writer and character levels from individual handwriting samples. Specifically, the method employs a dual-head style encoder to extract a writer-level style that captures the overall uniformity across a writer's handwriting samples, and a character-level style that captures subtle inconsistencies between different characters from the same writer. To guide the learning of the two complementary styles, the method uses two contrastive objectives called WriterNCE and GlyphNCE that treat samples from the same writer or character as positives and others as negatives. The disentangled style representations, along with a content feature from a separate encoder, are fed into a Transformer decoder to generate the output handwriting in an autoregressive manner. Experiments on various language scripts demonstrate the method's effectiveness in capturing both high-level and fine-grained styles for realistic handwriting synthesis.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of generating realistic and diverse handwritten characters that mimic the style of a given writer. The key challenges are:

1. Capturing both the overall writing style of a person (e.g. slant, glyph shapes) as well as subtle stylistic inconsistencies between characters written by the same person (e.g. small variations in stroke length, curvature). 

2. Disentangling the style representation into writer-level and character-level components from a limited number of handwritten samples.

3. Generating authentic cursive handwriting for scripts with large vocabularies and complex structures, like Chinese characters. 

4. Generalizing the handwriting generation model to diverse scripts beyond Latin alphabets.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a Style-Disentangled Transformer (SDT) approach to disentangle writer-wise and character-wise style representations and generate realistic online handwritten characters in various scripts.
