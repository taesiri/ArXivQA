# [Interactive Prompt Debugging with Sequence Salience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07498)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Interactive Prompt Debugging with Sequence Salience":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being widely used via prompting, where practitioners provide carefully constructed inputs to elicit desired behaviors from the models. However, interaction with LLMs is typically in a black-box manner, with no visibility into why the model generates a particular output. This makes debugging and iterating on prompts challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces Sequence Salience, an interactive visual tool for prompt debugging using input salience methods. It builds on token-level salience methods like Integrated Gradients and extends them to work well with long, complex LLM prompts.

- Key capabilities:
  - Aggregation of token-level salience to word, sentence or paragraph levels, making interpretation of salience over long texts tractable.
  - Rapid iteration by editing prompts and re-running salience on the new outputs.

- Implemented on the Learning Interpretability Tool (LIT) platform. Provides editable prompts, choice of salience methods, controls over display density and granularity.  

Main Contributions:
- First system tailored for debugging complex LLM prompts using salience methods. Significantly reduces cognitive load compared to raw token-level attributions.
- Flexible aggregation scheme aligns better with practitioner's mental models. Running-text representation also aids scanability. 
- Supports rapid iteration for refining prompts. Easy to switch models, methods, and compare examples side-by-side.
- Includes case studies demonstrating usefulness for debugging few-shot prompts, assessing constitutional principles, and comparing model behavior.
- Open source system compatible with multiple LLMs. Code, notebooks and tutorials provided to increase adoption.
