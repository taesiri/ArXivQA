# [From Covert Hiding to Visual Editing: Robust Generative Video   Steganography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00652)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Traditional video steganography methods lack robustness against common distortions like compression and noise that can occur when videos are shared on online platforms. They embed secret messages by directly modifying the pixel values or other overt embedding spaces in the video, which are susceptible to erasure from distortions. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Robust Generative Video Steganography (RoGVS) method that embeds secret messages in the semantic feature space during video editing instead of the overt embedding space. Specifically, they embed the message in the identity feature for face swapping application. This allows leveraging the generative capabilities of neural networks to produce high quality and undistorted stego videos even after message embedding.

Key Components:
1) Information Encoding Module: Extracts identity feature from reference image, video feature from cover video frames, and encodes secret message.

2) Secret Message Embedding & Extraction Module: Embeds encoded message into identity feature of reference image by adaptive addition. Face swaps cover video using this modified identity feature to generate stego video. Extracts message from stego video using a CNN.

3) Attacking Layer: Simulates distortions like compression, noise, blur etc. to train the model to be robust.

Main Contributions:
1) Novel generative video steganography method using semantic feature modification for embedding messages instead of overt space modification.

2) Significantly more robust against distortions compared to prior arts while retaining high capacity and security.

3) Generalizable approach that can be extended to other video editing tasks beyond face swapping demonstrated in the paper.

Overall the paper presents an innovative and practical direction for robust video steganography using semantic edits. The proposed RoGVS method advances the state-of-the-art in handling real world distortions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a robust generative video steganography method that embeds secret messages by modifying the semantic facial features of videos during face swapping to achieve visual editing effects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose a novel generative video steganography method based on visual editing, which modifies semantic features to embed secret messages rather than modifying the covert space directly. This provides a new direction for steganography research. 

2) The proposed method demonstrates robustness against common distortions in social media platforms, allowing accurate extraction of the embedded secret message. 

3) The method achieves better security for anti-steganalysis compared to state-of-the-art methods, effectively evading detection by steganalysis systems.

In summary, the key contribution is the idea of embedding secret messages through semantic feature modification during visual editing of videos. This makes the steganography more robust and secured while opening up new research directions.

The paper proposes a robust generative video steganography method that embeds secret messages by modifying the semantic identity feature of faces during face swapping visual editing of videos.
