# [Architecture Singularity Distance Computations for Linear Pentapods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09160)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an algorithm for computing the closest "architecturally singular" design to a given linear pentapod robot. Architecturally singular robots have legs that are always linearly dependent, making them uncontrollable, so it's important for engineers to design robots that are far from these configurations. The algorithm uses techniques from numerical algebraic geometry to search through the space of possible singular designs and identify the one that requires the minimal change in leg lengths and joint positions to match the given design. These minimal distances can guide engineers in the design process and help optimize robot stability. Different classes of singularities are considered, which allows breaking the optimization problem into more tractable pieces. Two numerical examples demonstrate the approach - one for a planar-base pentapod and one for a non-planar manipulator. The computed distances agree logically with an existing quality measure and can provide more nuanced design guidance. The general framework could enable optimization procedures that improve as-designed linear pentapods by leveraging information about their closest architectural singularities.
