# [ResEnsemble-DDPM: Residual Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for   Ensemble Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01682)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes ResEnsemble-DDPM, a new framework that combines denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and existing end-to-end models for image segmentation through an ensemble learning strategy. The key idea is to define a residual term between the end-to-end model output and the ground truth, and train a DDPM to learn the distribution of this residual. Specifically, the DDPM is trained to model the "ground truth minus residual" instead of the ground truth itself. During inference, the outputs of the end-to-end model and DDPM are combined by taking their average. This allows the DDPM to complement the end-to-end model by reducing the residual error. Experiments demonstrate improved performance over using either approach alone. The method is generalizable beyond segmentation to other image generation tasks. A key advantage is the ability to leverage existing end-to-end models rather than training a DDPM from scratch. By employing two learners with symmetric residual distributions, ResEnsemble-DDPM effectively narrows the gap to the ground truth.
