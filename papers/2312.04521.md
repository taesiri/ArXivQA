## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework for efficient and effective multimodal anomaly detection using both RGB images and 3D point clouds. The core idea is to learn crossmodal mapping functions between image features extracted by a 2D Transformer model and point cloud features from a 3D Transformer. Specifically, one mapping predicts 3D features from 2D features and vice versa. These are trained on nominal (non-defective) data to capture normal crossmodal relationships. At test time, anomalies manifest as inconsistencies between predicted and extracted features. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MVTec 3D-AD benchmark for both anomaly detection and segmentation, while requiring much less memory and faster inference compared to prior arts like M3DM that use large memory banks. The authors further introduce a layer pruning technique to reduce feature dimensionality with marginal performance loss, enabling even faster and more memory-efficient models. They also demonstrate promising few-shot capability by learning effective mappings from just a few nominal samples per category. Overall, this crossmodal mapping paradigm enables highly accurate, lightweight, and generalizable multimodal anomaly detection.
