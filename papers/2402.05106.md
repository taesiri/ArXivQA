# [Image captioning for Brazilian Portuguese using GRIT model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05106)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents early development of an image captioning model for the Brazilian Portuguese language. The goal is to automatically generate descriptive captions for images in Brazilian Portuguese. The model is based on the GRIT (Grid - and Region-based Image captioning Transformer) architecture, which utilizes both grid features and region features extracted from images to generate better image captions compared to methods that use only one type of feature. 

The GRIT model has two main components - a visual feature extraction module and a caption generation module. The visual module first extracts initial image features using a Swin Transformer backbone, then generates region features using a DETR-based decoder and grid features from the backbone's output. The caption module takes these dual features as input and generates the caption text autoregressively using a transformer encoder-decoder structure.

For the experiments, the authors use a Brazilian Portuguese translated version of the COCO dataset with over 120k images and 5 reference captions per image. They compare one epoch of training of their model to the full 10 epoch training of the original English GRIT model. The Portuguese model achieves strong but slightly lower metrics than the English version, with BLEU score of 0.758, METEOR of 0.268, ROUGE-L of 0.557 and CIDEr of 1.100. This shows the model can generate legible image captions in Portuguese even with only 1 epoch of training.

In conclusion, the paper presents initial promising results for adapting the state-of-the-art GRIT image captioning model to Brazilian Portuguese through translated datasets. Key future work is to train the model for more epochs and also explore caption generation without relying on a predefined vocabulary list.
