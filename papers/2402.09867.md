# [Characterizing Accuracy Trade-offs of EEG Applications on Embedded HMPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09867)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- EEG applications like seizure detection and sleep stage classification require continuous processing of sensor data on wearable devices. However, wearables have limited computation resources and battery capacity. 
- Using heterogeneous multi-core processors (HMPs) on edge devices can provide better performance for EEG apps within power constraints. 
- Combining system-level power/performance tradeoffs in HMPs and application-level accuracy/performance tradeoffs requires searching a large design space to find optimal operating points. This is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- Characterize accuracy tradeoffs of 3 EEG apps (seizure detection, sleep stage, stress) on HMP-based Odroid XU3 board.
- Use approximations like changing FFT parameters in Welch method to create app-level accuracy vs performance tradeoffs.
- Evaluate power, performance and accuracy at different DVFS levels and core mappings to explore optimization space.

Key Contributions:
- Showed approximation techniques like reducing window overlap in Welch method can improve EEG application performance with minimal accuracy loss
- Characterized accuracy vs power/performance tradeoffs for 3 apps under different approximation levels and hardware (DVFS/core) configurations
- Analyzed optimization spaces and showed overlapping configurations indicating flexibility in choosing operating points
- Showed 4 LITTLE cores can provide better performance per watt than 1 big core for EEG applications
- Demonstrated approximations can enable better energy efficiency for EEG apps on embedded HMPs

In summary, the paper explores accuracy/power/performance optimization spaces for error-resilient EEG apps on embedded multi-core systems to provide insights for disciplined approximate computing.
