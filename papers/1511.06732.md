# [Sequence Level Training with Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06732)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel training algorithm called Mixed Incremental Cross-Entropy Reinforce (MIXER) to address two major deficiencies in training recurrent neural network (RNN) models for text generation: exposure bias and a loss function that operates at the word-level instead of sequence-level. MIXER borrows ideas from reinforcement learning to enable sequence-level training that directly optimizes metrics used at test time like BLEU. However, a key challenge is that reinforcement learning struggles with the large action spaces in text generation. MIXER deals with this by first pretraining the model with cross-entropy loss to start from a good policy, and then gradually transitions to its own predictions. Experiments on text summarization, machine translation, and image captioning show MIXER outperforms strong baselines, producing better generations using greedy search than even beam search approaches. A key advantage of MIXER is also that it remains highly efficient by relying only on greedy decoding at test time.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a novel training algorithm called Mixed Incremental Cross-Entropy Reinforce (MIXER) to address exposure bias and optimize sequence-level metrics for text generation models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the Mixed Incremental Cross-Entropy Reinforce (MIXER) algorithm for sequence level training of recurrent neural networks for text generation. Specifically:

- MIXER combines reinforcement learning (REINFORCE algorithm) with cross-entropy training to allow directly optimizing text generation metrics like BLEU/ROUGE, while overcoming the difficulty REINFORCE has with large action spaces like in text. 

- MIXER starts off with the optimal policy learned from cross-entropy training, and slowly shifts to using more of the model's own predictions. This incremental approach makes REINFORCE effective for text generation.

- Experiments on summarization, machine translation, and image captioning show MIXER outperforms strong baselines in terms of BLEU/ROUGE scores. The method is competitive to beam search while being much faster due to greedy decoding.

In summary, the key innovation is developing an effective recipe to make reinforcement learning viable for training recurrent neural network text generators at the sequence level for any desired evaluation metric.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Mixed Incremental Cross-Entropy Reinforce (MIXER) - The novel training algorithm proposed in the paper that combines cross-entropy loss and REINFORCE to optimize sequence generation models.

- Exposure bias - The discrepancy between how models are trained (on ground truth words) versus how they are tested (on model's own predictions), which makes generation brittle. MIXER aims to avoid this.

- Sequence level training - Training the model to optimize metrics that evaluate the overall generated sequence quality (e.g. BLEU, ROUGE), rather than just the next word prediction accuracy. 

- Reinforcement learning - Key technique leveraged in MIXER, based on the REINFORCE algorithm, to enable optimizing for non-differentiable sequence metrics.

- Curriculum learning/incremental learning - Gradually moving from an easier task (cross-entropy loss) to the full task (sequence metric) over the course of MIXER training.

- Text summarization, machine translation, image captioning - Three sequence generation tasks used for evaluating MIXER algorithm.

Other terms: greedy search, beam search, recurrent neural networks, BLEU score, ROUGE score.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new training algorithm called MIXER. What are the two key ideas behind MIXER that make it suitable for training reinforcement learning models on large action spaces like text generation?

2. How does MIXER address the issue of exposure bias during training? Explain the annealing schedule used and why it is important.

3. What is the interpretation of the REINFORCE gradient update equations (Eq. 5 and 6)? How do they relate to standard backpropagation and what role does the baseline reward play?

4. Why does the paper argue that directly optimizing metrics like BLEU and ROUGE with reinforcement learning is better than turning sequence decisions into differentiable operations (like in the E2E model)?

5. On the summarization task, the paper shows results with both BLEU and ROUGE. What do these results demonstrate about the importance of matching training and test metrics?

6. How competitive is the performance of MIXER with greedy decoding compared to the baselines using beam search? What does this imply about speed and accuracy tradeoffs?  

7. Qualitatively comparing the greedy decoding examples in Figure 3, what differences can be observed between the MIXER generations and those of the baseline models?

8. Why did MIXER outperform the other exposure bias techniques like DAD on measures such as BLEU? What limitations of DAD does MIXER address?

9. The paper mentions combining MIXER and beam search. What complementary benefits do these two approaches provide? How does their combination fare across the three tasks?

10. The paper argues that pretraining with cross-entropy is important for MIXER to work well. How do you think a purely REINFORCE-based approach would perform on these text generation tasks? Why?
