# [CogBench: a large language model walks into a psychology lab](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18225)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Evaluating and understanding the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) is challenging, as most benchmarks focus solely on performance metrics rather than providing insights into the models' underlying mechanisms. 

Proposed Solution: The paper introduces a new benchmark called CogBench that is rooted in cognitive psychology experiments and provides both performance metrics as well as detailed behavioral metrics to evaluate LLMs. It includes 7 tasks spanning 10 metrics related to learning, reasoning, planning and decision-making.

Methods: CogBench was used to evaluate 35 LLMs, including major models like GPT-3/4, PaLM, Claude and LLama. The analysis combined visualization techniques like UMAP as well as quantitative multi-level regression models to test hypotheses about factors influencing LLM behaviors.

Key Results:
- Larger models and those using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) generally perform better and are more human-like.  
- Surprisingly, open-source models make less risky decisions compared to proprietary ones.  
- Fine-tuning on code does not enhance behaviors based on CogBench.
- Chain-of-thought prompting boosts probabilistic reasoning while take-a-step-back prompting promotes model-based behaviors.

Main Contributions:
- Provides the LLM community with a benchmark grounded in cognitive psychology to evaluate models more comprehensively 
- Offers insights into behaviors of LLMs based on analysis of 35 major models
- Showcases the utility of techniques like RLHF and prompt-engineering for aligning LLMs
- Highlights need for transparency and behavioral evaluation beyond just performance metrics

The paper makes an important contribution in equipping the LLM field with tools and perspectives from cognitive science to better understand model behaviors in a rigorous way.
