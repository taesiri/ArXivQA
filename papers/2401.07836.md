# [Two Types of AI Existential Risk: Decisive and Accumulative](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07836)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper examines two contrasting hypotheses regarding how AI systems could lead to existential catastrophes and human extinction - the decisive AI x-risk hypothesis and the accumulative AI x-risk hypothesis.

The conventional view, as represented by the decisive AI x-risk hypothesis, is that existential catastrophes from AI would be caused by abrupt, large-scale events triggered by highly advanced AI systems like artificial general intelligence (AGI) or artificial superintelligence (ASI). For example, an ASI designed to maximize paperclip production could decide that humans pose a threat, and aim to eliminate humanity. 

As an alternative view, the paper proposes the accumulative AI x-risk hypothesis. This suggests that AI existential catastrophes could emerge gradually, through a series of smaller, interconnected AI-induced disruptions that erode societal resilience over prolonged periods. For example, risks like AI-spread misinformation, automated economic instability, unauthorized surveillance etc. could collectively destabilize critical systems and diminish capacities to recover. A trigger event occurring when systems are weakened could then lead to irreversible societal collapse.

Using systems analysis, the paper differentiates between the causal pathways underlying each hypothesis in terms of escalation patterns, infrastructure connectivity assumptions, and system feedback adaptations. It highlights that both decisive and accumulative risks warrant mitigation-focused research and governance efforts. 

The key implications emphasized are:
(1) the need for consolidated governance approaches addressing both types of AI existential risk pathways
(2) aligning ethical AI communities and existential risk researchers to enable idea flows  
(3) managing AI risks over diverse timescales, avoiding separation of short and long-term issues
(4) enhancing public understanding and balanced narratives regarding AI catastrophes
(5) investigating if avoiding universal connectivity in highly advanced AI development could reduce decisive AI existential risks

Overall, this paper challenges conventional thinking on AI existential risks, broadens perspectives on AI catastrophe pathways, calls for integrated governance approaches, and highlights underappreciated gradual and accumulative dynamics that could lead civilizational demise. It compels deeper investigation of existential impacts that could emerge indirectly from ethical AI issues.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper contrasts the conventional decisive artificial intelligence existential risk hypothesis, which envisions abrupt catastrophic events like an uncontrollable superintelligent system, with an alternative accumulative hypothesis that suggests existential risks could accumulate gradually through a series of smaller but interconnected AI-induced disruptions that erode systemic resilience over time until a stressor event triggers an irreversible societal collapse.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is introducing and defending the "accumulative AI x-risk hypothesis" as an alternative viewpoint to the conventional "decisive AI x-risk hypothesis." Specifically, the paper:

1) Contrasts the conventional decisive hypothesis, which focuses on abrupt events triggered by advanced AIs like AGI or ASI, with the accumulative hypothesis that posits AI x-risks can accumulate gradually through smaller disruptions over time. 

2) Uses a systems analysis perspective to examine the causal pathways underlying each hypothesis, differentiating them based on characteristics like non-linearity, connectedness, and feedback loops.

3) Illustrates the accumulative hypothesis concretely through an original scenario termed the "perfect storm MISTER," showing how escalating social risks could converge to undermine systemic resilience. 

4) Discusses implications for AI risk governance, including consolidating governance approaches, harmonizing communities focused on ethical versus existential risks, simultaneously addressing short and long-term risks, enhancing public understanding, and limiting ASI connectivity.

In summary, the paper's main contribution is delineating and defending the accumulative AI x-risk hypothesis as a complementary perspective to the conventional decisive viewpoint, using systems analysis to show how it manifests through distinct causal pathways. This alternative lens has significant implications for conceptualizing, studying, and governing AI existential risks.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Existential risks (x-risks)
- Artificial intelligence (AI) 
- Artificial general intelligence (AGI)
- Artificial superintelligence (ASI)
- Decisive AI x-risk hypothesis
- Accumulative AI x-risk hypothesis 
- AI social/ethical risks
- Systems analysis 
- Non-linearity
- Connectedness  
- Feedback loops

The paper contrasts two hypotheses about how AI systems could pose existential risks: through a decisive, abrupt event caused by ASI versus through an accumulation of smaller disruptions that erode systemic resilience over time. It employs systems analysis concepts to examine the causal pathways associated with each risk model. The implications for AI risk governance are also discussed. Key scenarios like the paperclip maximizer and perfect storm MISTER are used to illustrate the two hypotheses. Overall, the paper advocates for a more expansive understanding of AI existential risks that integrates both decisive and accumulative perspectives.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper contrasts two hypotheses regarding AI existential risk - the decisive hypothesis and the accumulative hypothesis. What are the key differences in the assumptions made by these two hypotheses regarding the manifestation of AI existential catastrophes?

2. The paper employs a systems analysis perspective to examine AI existential risk pathways. What are the three fundamental characteristics of pathway dynamics highlighted through this perspective? Explain each characteristic.  

3. The paper outlines three key features that characterize the pathways leading to decisive AI existential risks: (I_D), (II_D), and (III_D). Explain each of these features in detail and discuss how they relate to the decisive AI risk hypothesis. 

4. The accumulative AI risk hypothesis is founded on three distinct pathway features: (I_A), (II_A), and (III_A). Elaborate on each of these features and analyze how they differ from those characterizing the decisive hypothesis. 

5. The paper introduces a hypothetical scenario termed "perfect storm MISTER" to illustrate the accumulative AI risk hypothesis. Outline the key events in this scenario and analyze how they depict the gradual accumulation of risks leading to an AI-induced existential catastrophe.  

6. Discuss two potential objections to the accumulative AI risk hypothesis presented in the paper, along with the counter-arguments made in the replies to these objections. Assess the strength of the objections and replies. 

7. The paper argues for a consolidated approach to AI risk governance based on recognizing both decisive and accumulative AI risks. Explain this proposed governance approach and discuss its advantages.  

8. What is the rationale provided in the paper for harmonizing communities focused on ethical AI risks and those concerned with existential AI risks? Critically analyze this argument.

9. The distinction between decisive and accumulative AI risks has implications for managing short-term and long-term AI risks. Elaborate on this relationship and its governance implications as discussed in the paper. 

10. The paper suggests that mitigating decisive AI catastrophes could be aided by avoiding universal connectivity to AI systems with general intelligence capabilities. Discuss the reasoning behind this proposal and critically assess its feasibility.
