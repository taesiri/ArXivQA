# [Performance Comparison of Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms on   Computational Fluid Dynamics Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16455)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper performs a computational comparison of 11 recent state-of-the-art single-objective surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) on two real-world computationally expensive optimization problems from computational fluid dynamics (CFD). 

The problems: 
The two CFD problems are PitzDaily (10 dimensions) which aims to minimize energy losses by optimizing the geometry of a backward-facing step, and Electrostatic Precipitator (49 dimensions) which optimizes the configuration of a gas distribution system to improve particle removal efficiency. Evaluating these objective functions requires running expensive CFD simulations.

The methods:
11 recent SAEAs published in top venues since 2018 are selected, including SHPSO, SSL-A-PSO, GORS-SSLPSO, MS-MTO, TL-SSLPSO, BiS-SAHA, IKAEA, SAMSO, TS-DDEO, ESA, and LSADE. They combine evolutionary algorithms like PSO and DE with surrogate models like RBF and Kriging to reduce function evaluations.

The experiments: 
The SAEAs are run 24 times on each problem with a budget of 1000 function evaluations. Performance is compared based on solution quality, robustness across runs, and convergence over time. Statistical tests determine significant differences.

The results:
LSADE, ESA, TS-DDEO and IKAEA perform the best overall. All are recent methods (after 2021) using DE, showing the promise of this class of SAEAs. Convergence plots and tests show strong early performance for some methods which then stagnate. 

The contributions:
The paper provides one of the first computational comparisons of state-of-the-art SAEAs on real-world expensive problems instead of artificial benchmarks. The CFD problems, data and code are all made publicly available to facilitate future benchmarking and development of SAEAs.
