# [Can GNN be Good Adapter for LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12984)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Modeling text-attributed graphs (TAGs), where graph nodes have associated text, is an important problem with applications like social networks. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great capabilities for understanding text. However, existing methods to combine LLMs and graphs have limitations:

1) Cascaded GNN-LM models incur huge computational costs to process all node texts with LMs. 
2) Self-supervised methods like GIANT separate LM and graph training, leading to sub-optimal utilization.
3) Very large models like Llama 2 with billions of parameters cannot be effectively adapted with existing approaches.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes GraphAdapter, which uses a graph neural network (GNN) as an efficient adapter to incorporate structural information into language models. The key ideas are:

1) The GNN adapter has very few (millions) trainable parameters compared to large LMs (billions), enabling efficient tuning.
2) The entire framework is trained via language modeling objectives on node texts, supervised by human language. This aligns GNN capabilities to leverage LMs.
3) A residual learning strategy focuses model improvements on graph-related tokens.

Once pre-trained, the framework can be conveniently prompt-tuned for various downstream node classification tasks.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes idea of using GNNs as efficient adapters to harness frozen large language models for modeling interconnected text and graphs.

2) Achieves new state-of-the-art on multiple text-attributed graph datasets, improving 5% over previous approaches.

3) Demonstrates consistent improvements with GNN adapters over RoBERTa, GPT-2 and Llama 2 language models, showing generalizability.

4) Validates various design choices with extensive ablations towards an effective text-graph modeling approach.

In summary, this paper presents GraphAdapter, a novel and scalable approach to effectively incorporate semantic knowledge from large language models into graph representation learning through lightweight graph neural network adapters. The method achieves significant improvements in modeling interconnected textual and graphical data across diverse real-world datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes GraphAdapter, a novel approach that uses graph neural networks as efficient adapters to harness large language models for modeling text-attributed graphs without fine-tuning the language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes GraphAdapter, a novel approach that uses graph neural networks (GNNs) as efficient adapters to harness large language models (LLMs) for modeling text-attributed graphs (TAGs) without fine-tuning the LLMs. 

2. It introduces a residual learning procedure to pre-train the GNN adapter together with the LLMs using the auto-regression objective on node texts. This aligns the GNN and LM and enhances the GNN's ability to model graph structure.

3. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world TAGs, it demonstrates that GraphAdapter can effectively model TAGs and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It is also more parameter-efficient and scalable to larger LLMs.

4. Ablation studies validate the effects of different components of GraphAdapter. Case studies further demonstrate its ability to flexibly utilize both textual and graphical information.

In summary, the key innovation is using GNNs as adapters to enable parameter-efficient integration of graphical structure and language knowledge from LLMs for modeling interconnected text-graph data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Text-attributed graphs (TAGs): Graphs where nodes have associated textual features/data, such as social networks or citation networks. Modeling the correlation between textual and structural data in TAGs is a key challenge.

- Large language models (LLMs): Powerful deep learning models like GPT-3 that have shown superior capabilities for language tasks and few-shot learning. Exploring how to effectively utilize LLMs for modeling TAGs is a focus of the paper.  

- Graph neural networks (GNNs): Neural network architectures designed for graph data that aggregate neighboring node features. GNNs are explored in the paper as efficient "adapters" for interfacing LLMs with graph data.

- Parameter-efficient tuning: Approaches like adapters that can interface and specialize LLMs for downstream tasks with many fewer trainable parameters than full fine-tuning. Enables leveraging very large LLMs efficiently.

- Language-structure pretraining: Novel pretraining approach proposed that uses language modeling objectives over node textual data to simultaneously teach LLMs to understand graphs and teach GNN adapters to incorporate LLM knowledge.

- Node classification: Key downstream task used to evaluate model performance on TAGs by making label predictions for nodes based on both textual and graph features.
