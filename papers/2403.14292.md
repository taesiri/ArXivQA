# [HySim: An Efficient Hybrid Similarity Measure for Patch Matching in   Image Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14292)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Image inpainting aims to fill missing or damaged regions in images by reconstructing them. However, common model-driven approaches like diffusion-based and patch-based methods have limitations in handling large regions or preserving intricate details. 

- Specifically, the seminal patch-based approach by Criminisi et al. relies on sum of squared differences (SSD) to select similar patches for filling, which can cause mismatch errors and quality degradation, especially for complex textures.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a refined similarity measure called HySim that combines strengths of both Minkowski and Chebyshev distances. This allows considering patches locally and globally for improved matching accuracy. 

- HySim seamlessly integrates within Criminisi's framework without changing the core priority algorithm, retaining computational efficiency.

Contributions:
- Provides clearer definition and relationship between similarity measures and distances in context of patch-based inpainting.

- Introduces hybrid HySim similarity measure for patch selection, enhancing visual quality by reducing mismatch errors.

- Showcases HySim results on various image types, from basic shapes to complex textures. Demonstrates visually superior performance over existing model-driven techniques.

- Discusses potential to further explore linking between high-quality image inpainting and improved time series forecasting accuracy.

In summary, this paper presents an efficient hybrid similarity measure for exemplar-based image inpainting that reduces mismatches and improves visual quality, with scope for advancement in forecasting tasks.
