# [SDDGR: Stable Diffusion-based Deep Generative Replay for Class   Incremental Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17323)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. However, applying CIL to more complex scenarios like class incremental object detection (CIOD) is challenging due to multiple object labels per image.

- Existing CIOD methods rely heavily on real data from previous tasks, either via knowledge distillation or replay buffers. However, storing real data has limitations. 

- Generative replay has shown promise in mitigating catastrophic forgetting by generating synthetic data mimicking previous tasks. But applying generative models like GANs and VAEs to complex CIOD scenarios requires substantial compute resources for training the model itself.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes SDDGR - a stable diffusion-based deep generative replay approach tailored for CIOD. 

- It utilizes a pre-trained stable diffusion model to generate synthetic images encompassing objects from old classes. The generation leverages text prompts designed based on label counts and bounding box locations to recreate complex scenes.

- An iterative refinement strategy adjusts quality thresholds to balance image fidelity and quantity per class. Additional tailored generation focuses on classes lacking images.  

- For effective knowledge transfer, SDDGR uses the synthetic data to distill information from the previous model into the new model, rather than direct training.

- A pseudo-labeling technique identifies and prevents misclassification of old objects in new images as background elements.

Main Contributions:
- First application of diffusion models for generative replay in CIOD using stable diffusion.

- A series of techniques including iterative refinement, class-wise regulation, knowledge distillation and pseudo-labeling to properly incorporate stable diffusion for preventing catastrophic forgetting.

- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over existing methods on COCO dataset for various CIOD scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel class incremental object detection method called SDDGR that uses stable diffusion to generate synthetic images of old classes which are refined iteratively and used to train the new detector via knowledge distillation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes, for the first time, to apply a diffusion-based generative model (stable diffusion) for class incremental object detection (CIOD). 

2. It introduces a series of methods to improve the quality of generated images for CIOD, including iterative refinement, class-wise regulation, and pseudo-labeling. These address issues that arise when naively applying stable diffusion to CIOD.

3. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO dataset through the proposed stable diffusion-based deep generative replay (SDDGR) strategy. SDDGR mitigates catastrophic forgetting in CIOD by leveraging high-quality synthetic images of old classes.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of SDDGR, a novel strategy to leverage a pre-trained stable diffusion model for generative replay in CIOD. This is enabled by a set of techniques to enhance image quality and an effective training methodology. SDDGR sets a new state-of-the-art for CIOD on COCO.
