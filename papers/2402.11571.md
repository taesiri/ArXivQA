# [Ain't Misbehavin' -- Using LLMs to Generate Expressive Robot Behavior in   Conversations with the Tabletop Robot Haru](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11571)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Social robots aim to have long-term engaging conversations with humans, but relying on scripted interactions often falls short. 
- Existing social robots lack dynamic and expressive behavior generation to convey emotions and facilitate effective human-robot interactions.

Proposed Solution:
- Integrate large language models (LLMs) into social robots to achieve more dynamic and expressive conversations. 
- Develop a system that leverages LLMs to generate robot responses with appropriate expressive behaviors congruent with the robot's personality.
- Incorporate robot behavior generation in two modalities: 
   1) Text-to-speech (TTS) with various delivery styles
   2) Physical actions using a library of expressive routines
- Create a custom state-of-the-art emotion recognition model (EmoCast) to dynamically select robot's tone of voice
- Utilize emojis from LLM output as cues to generate suitable robot physical actions

Main Contributions:
- Novel application of LLMs to enable social robots to participate in open-ended conversations while generating context-appropriate expressive robot behaviors
- Emo-text module to generate robot actions from emoji and select TTS voice genres based on detected emotions
- Custom textual emotion recognition model (EmoCast) optimized for conversation with improved accuracy
- Character card prompt engineering to shape LLM responses consistent with robot's personality 
- Pilot study with human participants chatting with social robot to demonstrate effectiveness and enjoyability of proposed LLM-based system
- Detailed analysis of participant feedback and conversation transcripts providing insights on issues for LLM application in social robots
