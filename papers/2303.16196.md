# [SparseNeRF: Distilling Depth Ranking for Few-shot Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16196)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it addresses is: 

How can we learn high-quality neural radiance fields from only a few input views of a scene?

The key challenge is that neural radiance fields (NeRFs) typically require many input views of a scene in order to reconstruct it well. But capturing many views is often impractical or expensive. So the paper aims to develop techniques to allow NeRFs to work well even with only sparse input views. 

To address this, the paper proposes a new framework called SparseNeRF. The main ideas are:

1) Distill depth ranking information from readily available coarse depth maps to provide useful geometric cues to guide NeRF training. This is done through a local depth ranking loss.

2) Distill spatial continuity information from the coarse depth maps through a spatial continuity loss. This preserves coherent geometry. 

3) Combine these losses with a standard NeRF reconstruction loss to train the full SparseNeRF model end-to-end from only a few views.

The central hypothesis is that by distilling these geometric cues from readily available coarse depth maps, SparseNeRF can learn high-quality neural radiance fields from only sparse input views where standard NeRFs fail. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate this hypothesis and show state-of-the-art results for few-shot novel view synthesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper appears to be proposing a new framework called SparseNeRF for few-shot novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields. The key ideas are:

- Using coarse depth maps from pre-trained depth estimation models or consumer depth sensors as weak supervision. This provides sparse geometric constraints to complement the limited views.

- Proposing a local depth ranking regularization that distills robust relative depth information from the coarse depth maps into the NeRF. This relaxes the need for accurate absolute depth.

- Adding a spatial continuity regularization that encourages the NeRF depth to have spatial coherence similar to the coarse depth maps. 

- Showing that this approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets like LLFF and DTU, as well as a new real-world dataset NVS-RGBD collected by the authors.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be presenting SparseNeRF, a simple and effective way to incorporate weak depth priors from readily available sources to significantly improve few-shot novel view synthesis with NeRFs. The key ideas are the local depth ranking and spatial continuity regularizations for effectively distilling useful relative depth information from coarse/inaccurate depth data.
