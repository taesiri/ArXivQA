# [SparseNeRF: Distilling Depth Ranking for Few-shot Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16196)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it addresses is: 

How can we learn high-quality neural radiance fields from only a few input views of a scene?

The key challenge is that neural radiance fields (NeRFs) typically require many input views of a scene in order to reconstruct it well. But capturing many views is often impractical or expensive. So the paper aims to develop techniques to allow NeRFs to work well even with only sparse input views. 

To address this, the paper proposes a new framework called SparseNeRF. The main ideas are:

1) Distill depth ranking information from readily available coarse depth maps to provide useful geometric cues to guide NeRF training. This is done through a local depth ranking loss.

2) Distill spatial continuity information from the coarse depth maps through a spatial continuity loss. This preserves coherent geometry. 

3) Combine these losses with a standard NeRF reconstruction loss to train the full SparseNeRF model end-to-end from only a few views.

The central hypothesis is that by distilling these geometric cues from readily available coarse depth maps, SparseNeRF can learn high-quality neural radiance fields from only sparse input views where standard NeRFs fail. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate this hypothesis and show state-of-the-art results for few-shot novel view synthesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper appears to be proposing a new framework called SparseNeRF for few-shot novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields. The key ideas are:

- Using coarse depth maps from pre-trained depth estimation models or consumer depth sensors as weak supervision. This provides sparse geometric constraints to complement the limited views.

- Proposing a local depth ranking regularization that distills robust relative depth information from the coarse depth maps into the NeRF. This relaxes the need for accurate absolute depth.

- Adding a spatial continuity regularization that encourages the NeRF depth to have spatial coherence similar to the coarse depth maps. 

- Showing that this approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets like LLFF and DTU, as well as a new real-world dataset NVS-RGBD collected by the authors.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be presenting SparseNeRF, a simple and effective way to incorporate weak depth priors from readily available sources to significantly improve few-shot novel view synthesis with NeRFs. The key ideas are the local depth ranking and spatial continuity regularizations for effectively distilling useful relative depth information from coarse/inaccurate depth data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper presents SparseNeRF, a method to improve novel view synthesis from only a few input views by using depth ranking and spatial continuity constraints derived from coarse depth maps to complement the limited 3D information.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on few-shot novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields:

- The paper focuses on distilling depth priors from inexpensive and readily available sources like consumer depth sensors and pre-trained monocular depth estimators. This contrasts with other works that use expensive, specialized equipment like laser scanners or assume access to accurate ground truth depth. 

- Instead of directly supervising the neural radiance field with coarse depth maps, the paper proposes novel losses based on depth ranking and spatial continuity. This provides a more robust way to leverage noisy/inaccurate depth inputs compared to simply scaling or regressing the depth values.

- The depth ranking and spatial continuity losses are simple yet effective additions that build on top of existing neural radiance field architectures. This makes the approach modular and compatible with other advances in few-shot novel view synthesis.

- The paper introduces a new real-world dataset (NVS-RGBD) with consumer depth sensor data. This complements existing datasets and benchmarks which are often synthetic or use specialized equipment.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on standard datasets like LLFF and DTU. The method also generalizes well to the new NVS-RGBD scenes captured with different consumer depth sensors.

- The approach does not require pretraining on external datasets like other methods. It also does not increase inference time, only using the depth priors during training.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way to effectively leverage inexpensive and readily available depth data to address the challenging few-shot novel view synthesis problem. The depth distillation approach is simple, modular, and achieves superior results compared to recent published methods.
