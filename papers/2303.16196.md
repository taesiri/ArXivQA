# [SparseNeRF: Distilling Depth Ranking for Few-shot Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16196)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it addresses is: How can we learn high-quality neural radiance fields from only a few input views of a scene?The key challenge is that neural radiance fields (NeRFs) typically require many input views of a scene in order to reconstruct it well. But capturing many views is often impractical or expensive. So the paper aims to develop techniques to allow NeRFs to work well even with only sparse input views. To address this, the paper proposes a new framework called SparseNeRF. The main ideas are:1) Distill depth ranking information from readily available coarse depth maps to provide useful geometric cues to guide NeRF training. This is done through a local depth ranking loss.2) Distill spatial continuity information from the coarse depth maps through a spatial continuity loss. This preserves coherent geometry. 3) Combine these losses with a standard NeRF reconstruction loss to train the full SparseNeRF model end-to-end from only a few views.The central hypothesis is that by distilling these geometric cues from readily available coarse depth maps, SparseNeRF can learn high-quality neural radiance fields from only sparse input views where standard NeRFs fail. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate this hypothesis and show state-of-the-art results for few-shot novel view synthesis.
