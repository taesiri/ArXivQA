# [Weakly-supervised Single-view Image Relighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13852)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is: 

How to relight a single image of real-world objects under novel lighting conditions, which enables inserting photographed objects into new scenes with proper illumination effects for augmented reality applications?

The key challenges are:

1) Inverse rendering from a single image is highly ill-posed, as it requires estimating geometry, materials, and lighting from just one observation. 

2) Re-rendering objects under novel lighting requires handling non-Lambertian materials and environment lighting.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes:

1) A weakly-supervised inverse rendering pipeline trained with a novel low-rank loss on real image datasets. This helps resolve the ill-posed inverse rendering problem.

2) A differentiable non-Lambertian rendering layer that can render low-frequency specular materials under environment lighting represented with spherical harmonics. This enables re-rendering of materials from diffuse to glossy.

The overall approach enables realistic relighting and insertion of photographed objects into new scenes from just a single input image, which could benefit mobile augmented reality applications. The effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments and a mobile app implementation.
