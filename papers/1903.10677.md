# [Generalized Convolution and Efficient Language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10677)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to represent and reason about strings, languages, and functions on strings in a generic, extensible, and composable way using algebraic structures like semirings and related abstractions. Specifically, the paper explores using semirings and related algebraic structures to represent and reason about:- Languages (sets of strings)- Weighted languages (functions from strings to values) - Regular expressions- Tries (prefix trees)- Parsing and recognition algorithms- Polynomials and power series- Discrete convolution and Fourier transformsThe main hypothesis seems to be that using this algebraic approach can lead to simple, generic, and reusable implementations of algorithms and data structures for strings, languages, parsing, etc. The paper aims to demonstrate this by developing a unified framework based on semirings and examining several specific instances like languages, weighted languages, tries, etc within that framework.The goal is to show that the algebraic framework provides a high level of abstraction while still allowing efficient concrete implementations. The paper tries to validate this claim by providing executable Haskell code for the framework and examples, along with some basic benchmarks.In summary, the central research question is whether semirings and related algebraic abstractions can provide a useful unifying framework for representing and reasoning about strings, languages, parsing, and related problems in a simple, generic, composable, and efficient way. The paper aims to demonstrate the viability of this approach through concrete examples and implementations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of the paper seems to be presenting a systematic framework for generalizing classic algorithms and data structures like regular expressions and tries to arbitrary semirings. The key ideas include:- Representing languages, automata, transducers etc. as functions into an arbitrary semiring instead of just booleans. This enables generalizing algorithms like Brzozowski derivatives from language recognition to more general computations.- Decomposing list functions using "atEps" and "deriv", allowing representing tries and automata compositionally. - Showing how convolutions, polynomials, power series etc. can be viewed as special cases of semiring-generalized structures like tries and regular expressions.- Defining type classes characterizing algebraic structures like semirings, and using them to write generic algorithms that can be instantiated to different representations.- Demonstrating that common data structures like tries and regular expressions are homomorphisms between suitable semiring-generalized algebras.Overall, the paper develops a broad framework for generalizing a variety of classic computability concepts using the abstraction of semirings. It shows how identifying compositionality and homomorphisms enables generic and reusable implementations. The generics and modularity should make these algorithms widely applicable.
