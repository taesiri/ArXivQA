# [Vision-Based Force Estimation for Minimally Invasive Telesurgery Through   Contact Detection and Local Stiffness Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18172)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In minimally invasive robotic surgery, lack of haptic feedback and inability to measure forces applied by the surgical tools makes it difficult to develop force-based metrics to evaluate tissue handling skills. 
- Obtaining accurate force information is challenging due to difficulties in implementing force sensors on the surgical tools.
- Vision-based deep learning approaches to estimate force have limitations in generalization and require large datasets with force sensor labels which are difficult to obtain.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a hybrid model- and learning-based approach to estimate tool-tissue forces from visual information alone, without needing force sensors.
- Use crowd-sourced non-expert labels instead of force sensors to train vision-based contact detection. 
- Estimate stiffness using robot state information (when available) to map tissue deformation to forces.
- For clinical settings with no robot state access, train vision-based tool position estimator using robot state data from other source. Use this along with crowd-sourced labels for contact-conditional force estimation.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate crowd-sourced labels can effectively replace labels derived from force sensors
- Contact-conditional force estimator outperforms prior model-based and vision-based estimators
- Vision-based position estimator enables force estimation from visual data alone with no robot state information
- Approach is adaptable to new surgical scenes using small amounts of additional crowd-sourced labels 
- Can estimate tool-tissue forces in clinical setting using only visual data, with potential uses in skill evaluation and sensory substitution haptic feedback

In summary, the key innovation is a scalable and adaptable approach to estimate tool-tissue forces using crowd-sourcing and vision-based learning that does not require expert labels or force sensors. It has promising applications in surgical skill analysis and virtual force feedback.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents a hybrid model- and learning-based approach to estimate forces during robotic surgery using visual data and crowd-sourced labels, with applications for automated skill evaluation and sensory substitution haptic feedback.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel hybrid model- and learning-based approach for vision-based force estimation in minimally invasive telesurgery. The key aspects are:

1) A contact-conditional force estimation method that uses visual contact detection to trigger a local stiffness model for estimating force from visual position data. This allows force estimation without direct force measurements.

2) The contact detection and position estimation models are trained in a data-efficient supervised manner using crowd-sourced human labels and robot position data. This eliminates the need for expensive and difficult to obtain force sensor data.

3) The learning-based position estimator generalizes well to novel surgical scenes, enabling the contact-conditional force estimation approach to be quickly adapted. Fine-tuning can be done with as little as 100-300 additional examples.

4) The proposed methods demonstrate potential for applications in surgical skills evaluation and haptic sensory substitution, with normalized force estimation errors below 10%. The ability to operate with no robot state data makes the approach suitable for clinical video-only datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is a scalable, data-efficient vision-based approach to force estimation that has useful accuracy for skill evaluation and sensory substitution haptics in surgical teleoperation systems.
