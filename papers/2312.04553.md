# [SPIDeRS: Structured Polarization for Invisible Depth and Reflectance   Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04553)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Structured Polarization (SPIDeRS), a novel 3D sensing method for simultaneously capturing object shape, surface normals, and reflectance using imperceptible patterns of polarized light. The key idea is to modulate the angle of linear polarization (AoLP) of the projected structured light patterns at each pixel using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator. This allows the light patterns to be invisible to the human eye and to regular cameras. The paper shows how to build a polarization projector system and derive a method to robustly extract the polarized light patterns from the captured polarimetric images of the object, which contain both specular and diffuse reflection components. Experiments demonstrate that SPIDeRS can reconstruct high quality depth maps of objects with different materials that are comparable to classic visible structured light methods. Notably, SPIDeRS can also directly estimate dense surface normals and BRDF reflectance from the polarization and color information, allowing relighting of the captured object with novel illumination. The ability to perform stealth 3D capture while recovering reflectance details is a unique capability enabled by SPIDeRS over previous structured light techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel 3D sensing method called Structured Polarization for Invisible Depth and Reflectance Sensing (SPIDeRS) that uses patterns of polarized light to simultaneously capture object shape, surface normals, and reflectance in a completely stealth way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Structured Polarization (SPIDeRS), a novel invisible 3D sensing method using polarized light with per-pixel modulation of the angle of linear polarization. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Proposing the idea of projecting structured patterns by modulating the angle of linear polarization (AoLP) at each pixel using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator. This makes the patterns invisible while allowing recovery of depth, surface normals, and reflectance.

- Deriving a method to robustly extract the projected AoLP patterns from the captured polarimetric images of the object, taking into account specular reflection, diffuse reflection, and ambient light.

- Implementing a prototype SPIDeRS system using off-the-shelf components like an SLM and polarimetric camera.

- Evaluating the system on real objects and showing successful reconstruction of shape and reflectance that can be used for relighting.

In summary, it introduces the novel concept of structured polarization patterns and shows their utility for completely stealth 3D and reflectance sensing, which opens new possibilities for applications compared to past structured light methods.

The main contribution of the paper is a novel structured light method called "Structured Polarization for Invisible Depth and Reflectance Sensing" (SPIDeRS). It projects patterns of varied angle of linear polarization, instead of intensity patterns, to simultaneously reconstruct 3D shape, surface normals, and reflectance properties in a way that is invisible to the human eye. Key components include the polarization projector using a liquid crystal SLM, decoding method to extract polarization patterns from polarimetric images, joint estimation of shape/normals/BRDF, and demonstration of relighting using the estimated surface properties. So the key terms reflect this proposed approach and its components.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM) to modulate the angle of linear polarization (AoLP) of light at each pixel. How is the relation between applied voltage and modulation of AoLP characterized for the SLM? What are the key factors that affect this relation?

2. The paper models diffuse and specular polarimetric reflection using Mueller matrices. How do the matrices for diffuse and specular reflection differ? What assumptions went into deriving the simplified matrices? 

3. The paper proposes a method to extract the projected AoLP pattern from the observed polarimetric images. How does it account for the effects of diffuse reflection and ambient light? Explain the key steps involved.

4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using structured polarization patterns compared to classic structured light patterns? Discuss properties like invisibility, surface appearance preservation, accuracy, robustness etc.

5. What considerations need to be made in selecting and calibrating the polarization projector and camera system? What effects do non-idealities like noise, calibration errors etc have on the overall depth/normal/BRDF estimation pipeline?

6. How does the encoding and decoding strategy for the AoLP patterns compare with strategies used in classic structured light methods? What determines the choice of patterns used?

7. Explain how surface normals and BRDF can be estimated by exploiting polarimetric reflection. What assumptions are made and what are the limitations? 

8. For joint estimation of surface properties, the paper optimizes an objective function with intensity, DoLP and Stokes vector errors. Explain the rationale behind including these different terms and their relative weights.

9. The method requires a nearly co-axial setup between projector and camera. How does deviation from perfect co-axial alignment affect the accuracy of estimation? Is there a way to account for small misalignments?

10. A polarization projector with per-pixel AoLP modulation enables new applications like stealth sensing. What other novel applications can you envision with such hardware capability?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing structured light methods for 3D shape sensing alter the appearance of the target surface as the projected patterns need to be visible to the camera. This is undesirable for many applications like AR/VR.
- Methods using infrared light avoid interference in the visual spectrum but surface reflection in infrared differs from visible light. So an additional RGB camera is needed to capture texture.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Structured Polarization (SPIDeRS), a novel 3D sensing method using imperceptible patterns of polarized light. 
- The key idea is to modulate the angle of linear polarization (AoLP) of light at each pixel in the projector. This makes the patterns invisible.

- An SLM (liquid crystal panel) is used to modulate AoLP per pixel based on applied voltage. No analyzing polarizer is needed unlike in LCD projectors.

- A robust method is presented to extract the projected AoLP pattern from the polarimetric reflection captured by the camera. This accounts for specular reflection, diffuse reflection and ambient light.

- In absence of ambient light, surface normals and BRDF can also be estimated from the polarimetric images. This enables relighting of the object.

Main Contributions:
- First imperceptible structured light method for simultaneous depth and texture sensing
- Direct recovery of surface normals from polarization, unlike differentiation of noisy depth maps
- Joint estimation of depth and BRDF for relighting
- Robust extraction of projected patterns from polarimetric images
- Demonstration of real object depth/normal/BRDF estimation and relighting

The method opens up an new avenue for use of polarization in 3D vision and serves as a foundation for future research.
