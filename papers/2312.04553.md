# [SPIDeRS: Structured Polarization for Invisible Depth and Reflectance   Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04553)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Structured Polarization (SPIDeRS), a novel 3D sensing method for simultaneously capturing object shape, surface normals, and reflectance using imperceptible patterns of polarized light. The key idea is to modulate the angle of linear polarization (AoLP) of the projected structured light patterns at each pixel using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator. This allows the light patterns to be invisible to the human eye and to regular cameras. The paper shows how to build a polarization projector system and derive a method to robustly extract the polarized light patterns from the captured polarimetric images of the object, which contain both specular and diffuse reflection components. Experiments demonstrate that SPIDeRS can reconstruct high quality depth maps of objects with different materials that are comparable to classic visible structured light methods. Notably, SPIDeRS can also directly estimate dense surface normals and BRDF reflectance from the polarization and color information, allowing relighting of the captured object with novel illumination. The ability to perform stealth 3D capture while recovering reflectance details is a unique capability enabled by SPIDeRS over previous structured light techniques.
