# [Quadcopter Team Configurable Motion Guided by a Quadruped](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14029)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on developing a model for safe coordination of a heterogeneous robotic system consisting of a quadruped robot guiding a team of quadcopter drones to navigate constrained environments. The key challenges are: (1) ensuring the quadruped is always enclosed by the quadcopter team, and (2) enabling the team to deform its shape to safely pass through narrow passages by following the quadruped.

Proposed Solution: 
The quadcopter team is modeled as a 2D deformable body. Their coordination is defined by a 2D affine transformation consisting of:
(1) A translation by the quadruped's position 
(2) Deformation specified by a nonsingular Jacobian matrix.  

The Jacobian matrix is planned to meet safety objectives. Its polar decomposition enables separating rotation from deformation. Constraining the eigenvalues of the deformation component ensures collision avoidance. 

Two experimental evaluation methods are proposed:
(1) Hardware-based: Global positions of all entities measured 
(2) Mixed virtual-hardware: Quadcopter positions measured locally w.r.t quadruped, with environment virtually approached using Gazebo

Contributions:
1) Model for coordination of quadcoped-quadcopter team as 2D deformable body via affine transformation 
2) Planning of Jacobian matrix to enable safe navigation
3) Two experimental methods - purely hardware and mixed virtual-hardware
4) Successful demonstration of proposed approach

In summary, the key innovation is the affine transformation-based modeling and control of a quadruped-drone team, with experimental validation, to achieve safe navigation in constrained spaces.
