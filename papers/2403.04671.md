# [Greater than the sum of its parts: The role of minority and majority   status in collaborative problem-solving communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is an important 21st century skill, but underrepresented minority (URM) students often face barriers that hinder their participation and benefit from CPS activities compared to majority students. 
- Communication patterns during CPS can provide insights into these barriers, but limited research has examined race/ethnicity differences in communication or distinguished between Asian and non-URM students.

Proposed Solution:  
- Use Group Communication Analysis (GCA), a computational linguistics technique, to analyze the sociocognitive linguistic patterns of URM, non-URM, and Asian students during an online CPS task.
- Examine both individual URM status and group racial/ethnic composition impacts on communication patterns.

Key Findings:
- Asian students participated the most but had lower internal cohesion than non-URM students, suggesting less consistent contributions.  
- Group composition affected individuals' internal cohesion, social impact and responsiveness more than individual URM status. 
- Individuals in Asian majority groups displayed the lowest levels of those productive communication behaviors compared to other groups.
- The homogeneity of Asian groups may have reduced engagement, while diversity may have benefited non-URM groups.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrated URM/non-URM status and group composition differences in online CPS communication patterns
- Distinguished Asian students from non-URM students as a separate demographic group
- Used GCA computational linguistics method to uncover subsurface communication dynamics related to minority/majority status in diverse teams

The results highlight the complex role of both individual and group diversity factors in shaping collaborative interactions and suggest implications for better supporting URM students in CPS activities.
