# [Human Guided Ground-truth Generation for Realistic Image   Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13069)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a new approach for generating training data (ground truth images) for realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR). 

- The key hypothesis is that the perceptual quality of existing HR images used as ground truths can be further improved, and incorporating human perception into ground truth generation can help train better Real-ISR models.

- To test this hypothesis, the paper introduces a human guided ground truth generation pipeline involving:
  - Training multiple image enhancement models to improve HR image quality.
  - Having humans annotate enhanced HR patches as positive (higher quality) or negative (lower quality) samples.
  - Constructing a dataset with positive and negative ground truth pairs.
  - Training Real-ISR models on this dataset and evaluating performance.

- The main research questions are:
  - Can enhancing and manually annotating HR images provide better ground truths for Real-ISR?
  - Can the proposed human guided dataset help train Real-ISR models that generate sharper and more realistic details with less artifacts?

- Experiments on benchmark datasets and models validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and dataset in improving perceptual quality of Real-ISR results.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that incorporating human perception through guided annotation of enhanced HR images can lead to improved ground truths and Real-ISR performance. The paper introduces and validates a pipeline to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a human guided ground-truth (GT) generation method for realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) training. 

2. Training multiple image enhancement models to generate enhanced HR images with improved perceptual quality.

3. Extracting textural patches from the enhanced HR images and having human subjects annotate them as positive or negative GTs.

4. Constructing a human guided GT (HGGT) dataset with both positive and negative samples.

5. Proposing training strategies to utilize the positive and negative GTs in the HGGT dataset.

6. Validating the effectiveness of the HGGT dataset and the training strategies through experiments on multiple Real-ISR models.

In summary, this paper makes the key contribution of introducing human perception guidance into the GT generation process for Real-ISR training. By annotating the enhanced HR images as positive and negative samples, the resulting HGGT dataset enables training more perceptually realistic Real-ISR models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a human guided ground truth image dataset for training realistic image super-resolution models, where multiple image enhancement models are used to improve the perceptual quality of high resolution images and human subjects annotate positive and negative samples to provide guidance for avoiding artifacts during training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper on human guided ground-truth generation for realistic image super-resolution compares to other works:

- Most prior works use simple bicubic downsampling or other predetermined degradation models to generate LR-HR training pairs. This paper argues these do not capture the complex degradations in real images. Recently some works have used more complex degradation models, but still rely on solely algorithmic generation of training data. 

- This paper is unique in introducing human guidance through annotation of enhanced HR images into the ground-truth generation process. Volunteers label enhanced HR patches as positive, similar or negative compared to the original HR. This incorporates human perception into deciding better/worse quality.

- The proposed dataset contains positive and negative ground-truths for each LR image. No prior dataset has included negative examples to help avoid artifacts. The negative labels are used to update the model during training.

- Experiments show training on this dataset improves perceptual quality over models trained on standard datasets like DF2K+OST. Both conventional and GAN-based state-of-the-art super-resolution models benefit from training on the human annotated ground-truths.

- The idea of generating multiple enhanced HR images for each LR and having humans select the best quality patches is novel. This helps address the issue of limited perceptual quality in original HR images used for super-resolution.

- Overall, this work makes an important contribution in ground-truth generation by incorporating human perception through annotation. The dataset and training approach leads to perceptually improved super-resolution results.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

1. Expanding the human guided ground truth (HGGT) dataset to cover more diverse image content and degradation types. The current HGGT dataset focuses on natural images with common blur and noise degradations. The authors suggest expanding it to include other image types like human faces, texts, low-light images, etc. as well as other degradations like JPEG compression artifacts, downsampling effects, etc. 

2. Exploring semi-/weakly-supervised learning strategies to reduce the annotation cost. The current HGGT dataset relies on exhaustive human annotation which is expensive. The authors suggest exploring semi-supervised or weakly supervised approaches to reduce the amount of human labeling needed. This could involve techniques like using a smaller labeled subset plus pseudo-labeling.

3. Investigating the transformer architecture for the enhancer and super-resolver models. The current work uses CNN and transformer architectures for the enhancers but only CNN for the super-resolvers. The authors suggest exploring pure transformer or CNN-transformer hybrid architectures for the super-resolver models.

4. Extending the framework to other image restoration tasks beyond super-resolution, such as denoising, deblurring, jpeg artifact reduction, etc. The proposed human-in-the-loop pipeline could be beneficial for creating perceptually improved ground truths for various image restoration problems.

5. Exploring the use of other no-reference quality metrics beyond LPIPS/DISTS for evaluation. The authors suggest investigating other perceptual metrics to better evaluate the visual quality gains.

In summary, the main future directions are around expanding the dataset diversity, reducing annotation cost, exploring transformer architectures, applying to other tasks, and leveraging more perceptual metrics. The core idea is to further improve the perceptual realism of image restoration models using human guidance.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a human guided ground-truth (GT) generation method for training realistic image super-resolution (ISR) models. The key ideas are: 1) Train multiple image enhancement models to improve the perceptual quality of high-resolution (HR) images and generate multiple enhanced versions for each HR image. 2) Extract image patches with rich textures and details from the enhanced images. 3) Have human annotators label the perceptual quality of the enhanced patches compared to the original patches as positive (better), similar, or negative (worse). 4) Build a dataset with positive and negative GT patches. 5) Train ISR models on this dataset using both positive and negative GTs - positive GTs to generate realistic details and textures, and negative GTs to avoid artifacts. Experiments validate that ISR models trained on this human annotated dataset produce more realistic and perceptually pleasing results compared to models trained on standard datasets. The main novelty is introducing human perception into GT annotation to guide ISR model training.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a human guided ground truth (GT) generation method for training realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models. First, the authors train multiple image enhancement models to improve the perceptual quality of high resolution (HR) images and generate enhanced versions as candidate GTs. They then extract patches with rich textures and details from the enhanced images for human annotation. Human subjects label the patches as "Positive" (better quality than original), "Negative" (worse quality), or "Similar" (comparable quality). This results in a dataset with positive and negative GT pairs. 

The authors show training on the positive GTs improves perceptual quality over models trained on original HR images. Further training on both positive and negative pairs helps reduce artifacts and false details. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed human guided GT dataset. Models trained on it produce sharper textures and richer details compared to state-of-the-art Real-ISR models trained on standard datasets. The annotated negative samples provide useful guidance to avoid visual artifacts. Overall, the human-in-the-loop GT generation process improves Real-ISR model performance.

This paper proposes a human guided ground-truth generation method for training realistic image super-resolution models. The key steps are: 1) Train multiple image enhancement models to improve the perceptual quality of high-resolution images. 2) Extract image patches with rich textures and details from the enhanced images. 3) Have human subjects annotate the extracted patches as positive (higher quality than original), similar, or negative (lower quality). 4) Construct a dataset with positive and negative ground-truth image pairs. 5) Train super-resolution models on this dataset using a loss function that leverages the positive and negative ground-truths - positive pairs encourage generating sharper details while negative pairs penalize visual artifacts.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem and contributions of this paper are:

- The paper focuses on the problem of generating realistic training data for image super-resolution (ISR) models. Existing methods have limitations in terms of the quality and diversity of training data.

- The main limitation is that existing methods directly use HR images as ground truth, but their perceptual quality may not be high enough. The trained ISR models tend to produce over-smoothed results or artifacts. 

- The paper proposes a human guided ground truth (HGGT) generation method to improve training data quality:

  - Train multiple image enhancement models to enhance HR image quality

  - Extract structural/textural patches and get humans to annotate as positive/negative samples

  - Positive samples have better perceptual quality than original

  - Negative samples contain artifacts and can guide models to avoid them

- The key contributions are:

  - A human annotated dataset with enhanced positive and negative ground truth pairs

  - Training strategies using positive and negative pairs

  - Experiments showing trained models produce more realistic details and fewer artifacts

In summary, the main problem is improving training data quality for ISR through human guidance and annotation. The key ideas are enhancing HR images and getting human input on positive/negative patches to train better ISR models.
