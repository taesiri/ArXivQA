# [Human Guided Ground-truth Generation for Realistic Image   Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13069)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a new approach for generating training data (ground truth images) for realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR). 

- The key hypothesis is that the perceptual quality of existing HR images used as ground truths can be further improved, and incorporating human perception into ground truth generation can help train better Real-ISR models.

- To test this hypothesis, the paper introduces a human guided ground truth generation pipeline involving:
  - Training multiple image enhancement models to improve HR image quality.
  - Having humans annotate enhanced HR patches as positive (higher quality) or negative (lower quality) samples.
  - Constructing a dataset with positive and negative ground truth pairs.
  - Training Real-ISR models on this dataset and evaluating performance.

- The main research questions are:
  - Can enhancing and manually annotating HR images provide better ground truths for Real-ISR?
  - Can the proposed human guided dataset help train Real-ISR models that generate sharper and more realistic details with less artifacts?

- Experiments on benchmark datasets and models validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and dataset in improving perceptual quality of Real-ISR results.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that incorporating human perception through guided annotation of enhanced HR images can lead to improved ground truths and Real-ISR performance. The paper introduces and validates a pipeline to test this hypothesis.
