# [Task Planning for Multiple Item Insertion using ADMM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of task planning for inserting multiple items into a storage bin that already contains existing items. The goal is to find optimal poses and trajectories to insert new items while minimizing the displacement of existing items. This is challenging because it requires dealing with discrete decisions like item ordering and continuous decisions like item poses, resulting in a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. MINLPs are difficult to solve efficiently.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the MINLP formulation. ADMM divides the problem into a mixed-integer programming (MIP) subproblem and a nonlinear programming (NLP) subproblem. It then alternates between solving these two subproblems and updating dual variables until reaching consensus between the MIP and NLP solutions. This allows leveraging efficient commercial solvers. It does not require good warm starts like complementary constraint methods.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates the multi-item insertion task planning as an MINLP problem with objectives, constraints and decision variables related to item poses, contacts, forces etc.
- Proposes an ADMM-based approach to divide the MINLP into MIP and NLP subproblems and solve them iteratively.
- Shows experimentally that the ADMM approach achieves 94.6% success rate and solves 4-item problems in 3.7 seconds on average, outperforming complementary constraint methods.
- Implements the method on hardware, generating heuristics-based trajectories and controlling a 6-DOF manipulator to insert items, validating the approach.

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions in using optimization and control methods to automate multi-item insertion tasks while avoiding rearrangement of existing items. The ADMM approach demonstrates high success rates and faster solving times compared to other MINLP solution methods.
