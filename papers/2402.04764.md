# [Code as Reward: Empowering Reinforcement Learning with VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04764)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) agents require carefully designed reward functions to learn efficiently. However, manually designing good rewards is challenging, especially for real-world problems with visual observations. 
- Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for understanding images and describing tasks, but directly using them to compute rewards is computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a framework called "Code as Reward" (CaR) which uses VLMs to generate code implementing reward functions. 
- CaR prompts the VLM with images of initial and goal states to produce executable programs that check for subtask completions. This leads to dense, interpretable reward signals.
- An automated verification pipeline validates the generated programs using expert and random trajectories. Refinement prompts are used when needed.
- The processed programs provide auxiliary rewards to train RL agents more efficiently than sparse environment rewards.

Main Contributions:
- Proposing the idea of using VLMs to generate code for reward functions in RL.
- Method for verifying and iteratively refining the generated programs.
- Demonstrating that the dense, VLM-generated rewards accelerate RL training across several environments with visual observations.
- Viewing the approach as an automated way to produce options and termination conditions, with the VLM providing the key components.
- The approach makes real-world RL problems more feasible by leveraging VLMs to create dense and meaningful reward signals.

In summary, the paper puts forth an innovative technique to automate reward design for RL through code generation from VLMs. The automated and interpretable nature of the approach is valuable for tackling visually complex real-world problems.
