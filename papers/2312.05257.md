# [Autonomous Port Navigation With Ranging Sensors Using Model-Based   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05257)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous shipping is important for sustainable transport, but there is a shortage of human operators. Autonomous control is needed, especially for inland and port navigation which have unique challenges like dynamic obstacles that don't broadcast their location (small vessels, kayaks, buoys).

Proposed Solution: 
- Use model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to learn an optimal policy for navigating safely to a goal while avoiding collisions. MBRL combines learning a dynamics model with planning algorithms.

- Formulate the navigation problem as an Markov Decision Process (MDP). Learn a policy to take sequential actions based on observations to optimize long-term rewards.

- Use ranging sensors for observations, include path following errors, obstacle distances, ownship odometry, and relative path coordinates in the state representation.  

- Shape rewards to encourage path following while strictly avoiding collisions. Add domain randomization during training to generalize over many possible port layouts.

Main Contributions:

- Show MBRL can learn a generalized policy for safe autonomous port navigation, outperforming the dynamic window approach.

- Demonstrate successful avoidance of dynamic obstacles like vessels and buoys in complex simulated port scenarios never seen during training.

- Provide both qualitative trajectory plots and quantitative metrics showing the trained policy sticks to the global path when safe while diverging to avoid collisions when necessary.

- Compare with a model-free RL algorithm and show better final performance and data efficiency for MBRL.

In summary, the key innovation is using the latest MBRL algorithms to produce an autonomous ship navigation policy that can generalize safely over a wide variety of complex port environments. This is a significant advance towards practical autonomous operation.
