# [Can Reinforcement Learning support policy makers? A preliminary study   with Integrated Assessment Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06527)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores using modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to probe integrated assessment models (IAMs) of climate change and test potential policy decisions. The authors train RL agents with various reward functions on a simplified IAM called AYS, showing they can learn effective policies that reach desirable end states. Key findings include: (1) different RL algorithms and rewards produce diverse policies that explore the IAM in different ways, (2) reward design significantly impacts policy behavior, with a "policy cost" signal yielding more conservative actions, (3) learned policies depend heavily on starting conditions, with some initial states guaranteeing failure, revealing limitations of the IAM, and (4) RL helps gain insight into model dynamics and emergent properties like the benefits of early emissions reductions. While results use a basic IAM, the approach demonstrates promise for using RL to deeply analyze more complex IAMs. The authors propose extensions like multi-agent RL and explainable RL to better simulate real-world policy making. Overall, this work makes a case for RL-based tools to support climate policy analysis.
