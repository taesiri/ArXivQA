# [MAFIA: Multi-Adapter Fused Inclusive LanguAge Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07519)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pretrained language models (PLMs) exhibit harmful societal biases such as gender, race, and religious biases due to being trained on web-scale corpora.
- Most prior debiasing methods address only a limited set of biases independently. 
- They typically finetune the entire model which is computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a method to modularly debias PLMs across multiple dimensions using adapters - small neural modules inserted into transformer blocks.
- Use counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) to generate diverse, inclusive training data across gender, race, religion and profession. Leverage Wikidata and generative models.  
- Train individual debiasing adapters (DBAs) for each bias dimension using this CDA data. 
- Propose MAFIA model that combines multiple DBAs using AdapterFusion, exploiting synergy amongst societal biases.

Main Contributions:
- Diverse counterfactual dataset for debiasing across multiple dimensions 
- Improved bias-specific DBAs trained on this dataset
- MAFIA model that fuses multiple DBAs to simultaneously debias across dimensions
- Shows gains on toxicity classification even for unseen intersectional biases
- Evaluates on multilingual STS-B dataset across high/low resource languages - observes multilingual debiasing from English DBAs
- Releases new multilingual evaluation benchmark mBias-STS-B

In summary, the paper presents an effective approach to modularly debias PLMs across multiple societal bias dimensions by exploiting their interactions, while retaining performance on downstream tasks. The method is computationally efficient, languages-agnostic, and shows positive results on unseen biases.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a modular approach to debias pretrained language models across multiple dimensions like gender, race, religion, and profession using counterfactual data augmentation and adapter fusion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. An inclusive and diverse counterfactual pair dataset for gender, race, religion, and profession bias. The dataset considers non-binary genders and is more diverse compared to previous US-centric datasets.

2. \sysnamesingle\ - An improved bias-specific debiasing model trained on the diverse counterfactual dataset.

3. \sysname\ - A way to softly combine multiple debiasing adapters to exploit the synergy between different societal biases. This leads to improvements in both fairness and performance on downstream tasks.

4. The paper shows that \sysname\ can reduce unintended intersectional biases on unseen dimensions during training, like mental health.

5. The paper demonstrates zero-shot transfer of gains in fairness and performance from debiasing a multilingual model in English to other languages. A new evaluation dataset called mBias-STS-B is introduced for this.

In summary, the main contribution is a new modular and inclusive multi-bias debiasing method for language models, along with evaluations demonstrating its effectiveness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Pretrained language models (PLMs)
- Societal biases (gender, race, religion, profession, intersectional) 
- Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA)
- Debiasing adapters (DBAs)
- AdapterFusion 
- Multidimensional debiasing
- Performance tradeoffs
- Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer
- Toxicity classification
- Useful fairness metric

The paper proposes methods to modularly debias PLMs across multiple societal bias dimensions simultaneously using CDA and adapter modules. It introduces the concept of "useful fairness" to account for both fairness and performance, and shows zero-shot debiasing transfer to multiple languages. The case study on toxicity classification demonstrates the model's ability to reduce unintended biases on unseen intersections of identities. Key terms like CDA, DBAs, AdapterFusion, multidimensional debiasing, and useful fairness seem most relevant to summarizing the core focus and contributions of this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a semi-automated method to generate counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) pairs using generative models and structured knowledge bases. Can you elaborate on why this method is more scalable and inclusive compared to manually creating CDA pairs? What are some limitations of this approach?

2. The paper trains individual debiasing adapters (DBAs) for each bias dimension like gender, race, etc. using CDA. Why is a modular approach of having separate DBAs better than just having one DBA trained on all bias dimensions? How does it help exploit synergies between biases?

3. The paper proposes a model called MAFIA that combines multiple DBAs using AdapterFusion. Walk me through the architecture and training process for MAFIA. Why is this proposed as a better debiasing approach compared to just using individual DBAs?

4. The evaluation results show that individual DBAs can worsen performance on downstream tasks while reducing bias. Why does this happen? How does MAFIA overcome this limitation? Explain with examples.

5. The paper evaluates debiasing on both intrinsic bias metrics like Stereoset as well as downstream tasks like toxicity detection. What are the pros and cons of both these evaluation paradigms? Which one do you think is more robust?

6. One of the key claims is that MAFIA provides zero-shot debiasing gains on unseen intersectional biases and languages. Analyze the results behind this claim. What additional experiments could be done to further validate it?  

7. The paper mentions societal biases like gender, race, religion and profession. Do you think there are any other important bias dimensions that should have been considered for debiasing here?

8. One limitation mentioned is that AdapterFusion makes MAFIA task-specific. How can the framework be extended to create a more generic multi-bias mitigation technique?

9. The paper performs ablation experiments to determine the best set of DBAs to fuse. Critically analyze this process and results. What are some ways the ablation method could have been made more rigorous?

10. What do you think are the most promising future work directions that can build on top of the method proposed in this paper? Suggest a few concrete ideas or extensions.
