# [MixPHM: Redundancy-Aware Parameter-Efficient Tuning for Low-Resource   Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01239)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we efficiently adapt pretrained vision-language models to low-resource visual question answering while achieving better performance than full finetuning?Specifically, the paper proposes a redundancy-aware parameter-efficient tuning method called MixPHM to address two key challenges:1) Reducing parameter redundancy while maintaining model capacity. The paper notes that existing parameter-efficient methods like adapters dramatically reduce tunable parameters but there is still a performance gap compared to full finetuning. The proposed MixPHM method aims to strike a balance between parameter efficiency and model capacity.2) Reducing task-irrelevant redundancy while promoting task-relevant correlation in representations. The paper argues that pretrained models contain redundant/irrelevant information that hinders performance on downstream tasks. MixPHM aims to reduce this task-irrelevant redundancy while promoting task-relevant correlation via a proposed "redundancy regularization".The central hypothesis is that by addressing these two challenges, the proposed MixPHM method can outperform full finetuning of vision-language models on low-resource VQA by tuning only a tiny fraction of parameters in a redundancy-aware manner. Experiments on several VQA datasets appear to validate this hypothesis.In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates a redundancy-aware parameter-efficient tuning approach to efficiently adapt vision-language models to low-resource VQA while achieving better performance than full finetuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing MixPHM, a redundancy-aware parameter-efficient tuning method to adapt pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to the visual question answering (VQA) task under low-resource settings. Specifically, the key points are:1. MixPHM is a lightweight module inserted into pretrained VLMs, implemented with multiple Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication (PHM) experts in a mixture-of-experts manner.2. To reduce parameter redundancy, MixPHM reparameterizes expert weights into a low-rank subspace and shares weights globally across experts and locally within each expert. 3. Motivated by a redundancy analysis, MixPHM proposes a novel Redundancy Regularization to reduce task-irrelevant redundancy while promoting task-relevant correlation in representations.4. Extensive experiments show MixPHM achieves better performance and parameter efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods and full finetuning. It consistently outperforms them on VQA v2, GQA and OK-VQA under various low-resource settings.5. The proposed MixPHM provides a new perspective on how to better adapt pretrained VLMs to downstream tasks by maximizing acquisition of task-relevant information and minimizing task-irrelevant redundancy from VLMs.In summary, the main contribution is proposing MixPHM, an effective and parameter-efficient method for low-resource VQA by reducing redundancy and improving correlation in representations. The experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes MixPHM, a redundancy-aware parameter-efficient tuning method that inserts lightweight module MixPHMs into pretrained vision-language models to adapt them to downstream visual question answering tasks; MixPHM reduces task-irrelevant redundancy and promotes task-relevant correlation in representations through a proposed redundancy regularization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in visual question answering (VQA):- It focuses on low-resource VQA, where only a small amount of training data is available. Much prior work in VQA has focused on high-resource settings with large datasets. Studying low-resource VQA is important for making these methods more practical in real applications.- It proposes a parameter-efficient tuning method called MixPHM that outperforms full finetuning of large vision-language models (VLMs) on low-resource VQA. Most prior work has focused on full finetuning. Parameter-efficient tuning makes adapting VLMs more feasible.- MixPHM uses a mixture-of-experts approach with redundancy reduction techniques like low-rank parameterization and weight sharing. This is a fairly novel way to improve parameter efficiency compared to methods like adapter tuning.- It introduces a redundancy regularization method to reduce task-irrelevant information and promote task-relevant correlation in the MixPHM representations. Regularization to improve feature relevance is an important area lacking in much VQA research.- Experiments show MixPHM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art parameter-efficient methods across multiple VQA datasets. Many recent VQA methods have struggled to outperform full finetuning, so this is a notable result.- The method is evaluated on multiple standard VQA datasets like VQA v2, GQA, and OK-VQA. Testing across datasets helps demonstrate the generalizability.Overall, I would say the key novelties are in proposing an effective parameter-efficient VLM tuning approach tailored to low-resource VQA, and using redundancy reduction techniques along with a relevance-focused regularization method. The consistent gains over full finetuning and other state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the promise of this research direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper suggests several future research directions:1. Exploring more parameter-efficient tuning methods for visual question answering (VQA) that can outperform full finetuning with fewer trainable parameters. The paper proposes MixPHM which shows promising results, but there is room for further improvements.2. Investigating how to explicitly delimit and minimize task-irrelevant redundancy when adapting vision-language models to downstream tasks. The paper points out that redundancy is a double-edged sword - it can contain both useful and irrelevant information. Developing techniques to precisely reduce irrelevant redundancy could further enhance performance. 3. Applying the proposed MixPHM method to other vision-language tasks beyond VQA, such as visual reasoning, image captioning, etc. Assessing the generalization ability of MixPHM across different vision-language domains.4. Extending the redundancy analysis conducted in the paper to quantify the relevance and redundancy of information in different layers and components (e.g. self-attention) of vision-language models. This could provide more fine-grained insights for improving parameter-efficient tuning.5. Exploring optimal strategies to regularize and transfer knowledge from large-scale pretrained vision-language models to downstream tasks. The redundancy regularization proposed in this paper is one attempt along this direction.6. Developing more advanced routing mechanisms for the mixture-of-experts architecture to better utilize expert capacities and reduce computational redundancy.In summary, the main future directions are around developing more parameter-efficient tuning techniques, quantifying and reducing task-irrelevant redundancy, transferring knowledge from pretrained models, and improving routing mechanisms. Advances in these areas could further push the performance boundaries for adapting vision-language models to downstream tasks in low-resource settings.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes MixPHM, a redundancy-aware parameter-efficient tuning method for adapting pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to low-resource visual question answering (VQA). MixPHM is implemented with multiple parameterized hypercomplex multiplication (PHM) experts in a mixture-of-experts manner. To reduce parameter redundancy, MixPHM decomposes and reparameterizes expert weights into a low-rank subspace and shares weights globally and locally. To reduce task-irrelevant redundancy and promote task-relevant correlation, MixPHM incorporates a redundancy regularization loss that decorrelates MixPHM representations from VLM representations while maximizing mutual information between MixPHM and final task representations. Experiments on VQA v2, GQA, and OK-VQA show MixPHM consistently outperforms full finetuning and other state-of-the-art parameter-efficient methods. The proposed redundancy analysis and regularization enable MixPHM to achieve better performance with substantially fewer parameters compared to finetuning the entire VLM.
