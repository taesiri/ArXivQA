# [An Axiomatic Approach to Model-Agnostic Concept Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06890)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for concept explanations, which aim to determine the importance of a human-interpretable concept for a model's prediction, are tailored to specific models and require white-box access. This limits their applicability. 
- There is a lack of clarity on how to interpret different concept explanation methods and what specific aspects they evaluate.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop an axiomatic approach to concept explanations that is model-agnostic. Specifically:
   - Axiom 1: Linearity w.r.t examples. Impact should be summed over all examples.
   - Axiom 2: Recursivity. Impact should be linear w.r.t probability.  
   - Axiom 3: Similarity. Alignment of concept and prediction indicates higher impact.
- Derive measures for concept impact based on the axioms. 
   - Symmetric measure: Alignment of concept and prediction
   - Class-conditioned measure: Necessity of concept for class  
   - Concept-conditioned measure: Sufficiency of concept for class
- Propose efficient algorithm to estimate these measures.
- Establish connections with prior concept explanation methods like TCAV and Completeness-Aware.

Main Contributions:
- First axiomatic approach to model-agnostic concept explanations
- New measures that capture necessity and sufficiency relationships  
- Understanding of semantic meanings behind prior methods
- Efficient implementation compared to prior techniques
- Demonstrated applications:
   - Model selection between LR and RF
   - Optimizer selection between SGD and AdamW
   - Improving vision-language models via prompt editing

The key advantage is the model-agnostic axiomatic approach, which provides formally grounded and interpretable measures of concept importance that can be efficiently estimated.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an axiomatic approach to develop model-agnostic measures for concept explanations that satisfy linearity, recursivity, and similarity axioms, connects these measures to prior work like TCAV and completeness-aware explanations, and shows applications in model selection, optimizer selection, and improving models via prompt editing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel axiomatic approach for concept explanations that is model-agnostic. The key contributions are:

1) It establishes three natural axioms - linearity, recursivity, and similarity - for measuring the importance of a human-interpretable concept to a model's predictions. 

2) It shows connections between the proposed axiomatic approach and prior concept explanation methods like TCAV and completeness-aware explanations, offering insight into their varying semantic meanings. 

3) It demonstrates the utility of the new method through applications like model selection, optimizer selection, and improving vision-language models via prompt editing. 

4) The proposed method is efficient to implement as it does not require learning a concept representation like in some prior works.

5) Overall, it provides an axiomatically justified, model-agnostic framework for concept explanations that integrates previous research and enables a better understanding of explanation methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Concept explanations - Explaining model predictions by assessing the influence of human-interpretable concepts. The main focus of the paper.

- Model-agnostic - The proposed measures for concept explanation are model-agnostic, meaning they can work with any model without needing access to the model internals.  

- Axiomatic approach - The paper develops concept explanation measures based on three axioms: linearity, recursivity, and similarity. This provides a principled foundation.

- Necessity and sufficiency - Two of the proposed measures capture the necessity and sufficiency of a concept for a prediction. This provides semantic insight.

- TCAV - Testing with Concept Activation Vectors, an influential prior method for concept-based explanations. The paper shows connections between TCAV and the new axiomatic approach.

- Completeness-aware explanations - Another prior concept explanation method that is shown to have connections with the new approach.

- Model selection - One application is using the new measures for selecting between machine learning models.

- Optimizer selection - The concept explanations can also choose between optimizers based on the concepts learned.  

- Prompt editing - Demonstration of improving vision-language models via editing prompts to reduce spurious concept associations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The axiomatic approach introduces three axioms - linearity, recursivity, and similarity. Can you explain the intuition behind each axiom and why they are important for concept explanations?

2. The class-conditioned measure captures the necessity of a concept for a prediction while the concept-conditioned measure captures the sufficiency. Can you elaborate on the differences in semantics between necessity and sufficiency in the context of concept explanations?

3. Theorem 1 shows that the completeness-aware explanation method proposed in previous work is a special case of the concept-conditioned measure. What assumption needs to be satisfied for this equivalence result to hold? Does this provide any additional insight into the completeness-aware method?

4. The efficient estimation algorithm for the proposed measures seems quite simple. Does the simplicity come at the cost of accuracy compared to previous concept explanation methods? If not, why is the algorithm still reliable?

5. You showed connections between the proposed approach and two previous methods - TCAV and completeness-aware explanations. Are there any other existing methods that could potentially be analyzed within this axiomatic framework?

6. The concept-conditioned measure requires a threshold Î¸ to determine when a concept is present enough to influence the prediction. How should this threshold be chosen in practice and how does it impact the resulting explanation? 

7. You focused on binary classification problems in this work. What changes would be needed to extend the axiomatic framework and proposed measures to multi-class classification settings?

8. The experiments section explores some interesting applications like model selection, optimizer selection, and prompt editing. Can you think of any other potential use cases that could benefit from the proposed model-agnostic concept explanation method?

9. The prompt editing experiment improves model performance by reducing the influence of irrelevant concepts. However, it requires access to ground truth concept labels. What are some ways to automatically identify irrelevant concepts without human labeling?

10. A key advantage of this method is being model-agnostic. But how do you ensure that the resulting concept explanations are reliable when the model itself is a black-box? Are there ways to validate the trustworthiness of explanations without internal model access?
