# [SmartBrush: Text and Shape Guided Object Inpainting with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05034)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform high-quality text and shape guided object inpainting using diffusion models. Specifically, the paper aims to address three key challenges in existing inpainting methods:

1. Mask misalignment - Existing methods fail to generate objects that align well with the shape of the input mask.

2. Text misalignment - Methods tend to generate background content instead of objects described by the text prompt. 

3. Background preservation - When inpainting objects into coarse masks like bounding boxes, the background pixels inside the mask are often changed even though they should be preserved.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a new diffusion model called SmartBrush with the following key features:

1. It utilizes text and shape guidance from rich instance segmentation datasets to encourage alignment between generated objects and text/mask inputs.

2. It allows control over mask precision, from accurate object shapes to coarse boxes, to give users flexibility. 

3. It predicts a foreground mask during inpainting to preserve background pixels inside coarser masks.

4. It uses a multi-task training strategy to improve robustness and leverage more data.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that by incorporating text and shape guidance in a novel way, and adding mask prediction and multi-task training, the proposed SmartBrush diffusion model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on text and shape guided object inpainting, improving alignment, flexibility, and background preservation. Experiments validate the superiority of the approach over existing methods.
