# [Can't Remember Details in Long Documents? You Need Some R&amp;R](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05004)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Long context language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 Turbo struggle with document-based question answering (QA) when relevant context is in the middle of a long document (the "lost in the middle" effect). Their performance deteriorates as document length increases.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a prompt-based method called "R&R" that combines two techniques - reprompting and in-context retrieval (ICR) - to mitigate the lost in the middle effect.

Reprompting: 
- Repeat the QA instructions periodically in the document to remind the LLM of the task, reducing distance between instructions and relevant context.

In-Context Retrieval:
- First prompt LLM to retrieve most relevant passages to the question. Then do QA with abbreviated context from retrieved passages. Retrieval is simpler than QA.

- R&R combines both techniques. Reprompt retrieval instructions during passage retrieval prompt.

Contributions:
- Show reprompting and ICR each independently improve performance on long document QA with GPT-4 Turbo and Claude-2.1. R&R improves further.
- Analyze reprompting and show proximity of instructions to relevant context improves performance. 
- Compare to chunk-based methods for limited context models. Show R&R enables larger chunks (fewer calls, less cost) with minimal accuracy loss.

In summary, the paper demonstrates R&R can extend the effective context length for document QA with long context models by mitigating the lost in the middle effect. The analysis provides insights into the mechanism behind reprompting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a prompt-based method called R&R, combining reprompting and in-context retrieval, to mitigate the "lost in the middle" effect and improve long context language models' performance on document-based question answering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The introduction of R&R, a novel prompt-based method combining "reprompting" and "in-context retrieval" (ICR) to improve the performance of long-context language models on document-based question answering. Reprompting involves periodically repeating the question instructions in the document context. ICR involves first retrieving the most relevant passages and using those as a shortened context for QA.

2) Experimental results showing that R&R boosts QA accuracy by up to 16 percentage points on average for models like GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 2.1 on document lengths up to 80k tokens. The analysis suggests R&R works by reducing the distance between question instructions and relevant context.

3) A comparison to chunk-based methods on limited-context models, showing R&R enables the use of larger chunks to reduce computational cost while minimizing loss of accuracy. This helps soften the accuracy vs. cost tradeoff.

In summary, the main contribution is a new prompt-based method to improve long document QA through reprompting and retrieval, along with extensive analysis and comparison to alternatives.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed reprompting method help mitigate the "lost in the middle" effect for long context language models? Does periodically repeating the question and instructions remind the model of the task at hand?

2. What is the motivation behind using in-context retrieval before question answering? Does retrieving relevant passages first simplify the task compared to directly answering from the full context? 

3. How was the optimal reprompt rate (every 10k tokens) determined? Does this relate to the way answer positions were varied in the datasets used for evaluation?

4. Why does only reprompting right before relevant context lead to higher accuracy than uniform reprompting? Does this support the hypothesis about reducing distance between instructions and relevant context?

5. Could the proposed methods be adapted for other long-context tasks like summarization? Would position bias also be an issue there that could be addressed with reprompting?

6. How do the methods compare when using reprompting and retrieval in a chunkwise manner? Does reprompting enable using larger chunks to reduce cost?

7. What architectural modifications to long context language models could be inspired by analyzing the mechanisms behind why reprompting is effective? 

8. How exactly does attention change when reminders of the original instructions are injected periodically? More analysis is needed here.

9. Would combining reprompting with other prompt-based methods lead to further gains? What other techniques could complement it?

10. Can the ideas presented here be adapted to work for non-English languages or multilingual models? Would the optimal reprompting rate need adjustment?
