# [Segmentation is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13300)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we achieve accurate and robust object detection in images, especially for images with extreme cases like complex occlusion, poor illumination, and large-scale small objects, without relying on anchor boxes and non-maximum suppression (NMS)? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Using segmentation models instead of anchor-based detection models can help overcome issues like environment noise in bounding box annotations and limitations of NMS. 2) Converting bounding box annotations to multimodal pixel-level annotations can provide more representative information and topological structure to handle complex cases.3) Designing a contour tracing algorithm to localize objects from segmentation maps can avoid the need for NMS and anchor boxes.4) Using a multi-scale segmentation model (MSP-Seg) can further improve segmentation accuracy especially for small objects.In summary, the central research question is how to achieve highly accurate and robust object detection without anchor boxes or NMS, even on images with extreme cases. The key hypothesis is that using weakly supervised segmentation with multimodal annotations and contour tracing can accomplish this.
