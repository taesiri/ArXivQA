# [Wildest Dreams: Reproducible Research in Privacy-preserving Neural   Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03592)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper provides a comprehensive systematization of knowledge (SoK) on privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) techniques for neural network training based on homomorphic encryption (HE) and secure multiparty computation (SMPC). 

The key motivation is to analyze the landscape of machine learning as a service (MLaaS) in data-sensitive contexts by employing HE and SMPC techniques to preserve privacy during model training. The authors focus on HE and SMPC due to their strong cryptographic privacy guarantees compared to other approaches like federated learning or differential privacy.  

The paper first provides necessary background on HE schemes like partially, somewhat, leveled, and fully homomorphic encryption along with their capabilities, limitations, and popular implementations. Similarly for SMPC, background on secret sharing, garbled circuits, oblivious transfer and related security definitions like privacy, correctness, fairness etc. are covered. 

The authors then present a taxonomy and comparative analysis of 9 state-of-the-art HE-based and 17 SMPC-based PPML protocols for neural network training. These protocols are analyzed along several dimensions like threat model, supported layers, techniques used, evaluation datasets, accuracy, efficiency, communication overhead etc. 

A key contribution is attempting to reproduce results for some open source implementations. However, lack of code availability, documentation issues, hardware constraints posed significant challenges. Still authors managed to replicate results for 4 frameworks, providing valuable reproducibility analysis.  

The paper also highlights importance of open source availability to address gap between theory and practice, by encouraging researchers to prioritize sharing implementations. This can accelerate progress through collaboration, transparency and long term maintainability.

Other key takeaways include the high computational and communication costs of existing techniques limiting real-world adoption, lack of possible attack analysis assuming semi-honest model, and lack of regulatory frameworks for cryptographic privacy techniques. 

Finally, the paper discusses limitations of current approaches and outlines future research directions like hybrid HE-SMPC methods, combining with federated learning, split learning and function secret sharing to improve efficiency, security and applicability.
