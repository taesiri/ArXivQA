# [MLLM-Tool: A Multimodal Large Language Model For Tool Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10727)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Tool-LMM: A Large Multi-Modal Model for Tool Agent Learning":

Problem:
- Recent works have extended large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to interact with external tools, enabling new capabilities. However, existing methods rely only on textual prompts, which can be ambiguous in conveying the user's true intention.  
- LLMs need to be able to perceive and understand multimodal inputs (text + image/video/audio) to resolve ambiguity and correctly identify the user's goals.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose Tool-LMM, a novel system incorporating multi-modal encoders with open-source LLMs like LLaMA, ViCuNa, etc.
- It leverages fixed image/video/audio encoders to extract multi-modal features and aligns them to the LLM's feature space. 
- The fine-tuned LLM then processes the prompt and projected multi-modal embeddings to predict suitable tools from a corpus of 932 APIs.

Main Contributions:
- Develop Tool-LMM system to make LLMs aware of multi-modal inputs for tool selection.
- Construct ToolMMBench dataset with over 4000 multi-modal prompt-tool pairs from HuggingFace APIs. Has text ambiguity cases and one-to-many mappings.
- Propose evaluation metrics like subset accuracy and recall for different ambiguity types and modalities.
- Experiments show Tool-LMM achieves 88.19% accuracy in tool recommendation, demonstrating effectiveness.

In summary, the paper enables LLMs to handle multi-modal inputs for accurate tool identification through the Tool-LMM model and benchmark dataset. This is a step towards more versatile tool-based agents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Tool-LMM, a system that integrates multi-modal encoders with large language models to enable the models to perceive visual and audio information in instructions and accurately select appropriate tools and APIs based on multi-modal input.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors develop Tool-LMM, a multi-modal tool agent system that can perceive visual or audio instructions to recommend appropriate tools by incorporating multi-modal encoders and open-source large language models.

2. They construct a new multi-modal benchmark, called ToolMMBench, for evaluating LLMs' awareness and selection ability of external tool usage. This benchmark provides content-aware multi-modal instructions and one-to-many instruction-answer pairs. 

3. They design evaluation metrics tailored for this dataset, conduct experiments on multiple popular LLMs, and show the effectiveness of their proposed method in selecting appropriate tools, achieving 88.19% accuracy.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel multi-modal tool agent system Tool-LMM and a new benchmark to facilitate research in this direction. The experiments demonstrate the promise of using large language models for external tool recommendation based on multi-modal inputs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Tool-LMM - The name of the proposed large multi-modal model system for tool agent learning.
- Multi-modal encoders - Used to encode inputs from different modalities like images, video, and audio. 
- Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) - Technique used to fine-tune the language models in a parameter-efficient way.
- Text ambiguity - Cases where textual prompts alone are ambiguous and extra context from other modalities is needed. Five types identified in the paper.  
- Instruction matching - Mapping instruction prompts to suitable tools/APIs, supporting one-to-many matching.
- ToolMMBench dataset - Novel multi-modal benchmark dataset collected from HuggingFace for evaluating tool selection capability.
- Evaluation metrics - Custom metrics proposed including ambiguity type accuracy, modality performance, hallucination rate, etc.
- Qualitative visualization - Example shown of tool selection by model based on ambiguous text + clarifying image input.

The key focus is on developing and evaluating the Tool-LMM model to handle multi-modal inputs for appropriate tool/API selection, enabled by the new dataset and metrics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel system called Tool-LMM that incorporates multi-modal encoders with open-source large language models (LLMs). What is the motivation behind developing such a system? Why is it important to empower LLMs with multi-modal capabilities?

2. The paper constructs a new benchmark dataset called ToolMMBench. What are some key features of this benchmark compared to prior datasets for tool learning? Why was it necessary to create a new dataset instead of using existing ones?

3. The paper finds that performance on text-only instructions lags behind multi-modal instructions. What reasoning do the authors provide to explain this counter-intuitive result? What implications does this have for future work?

4. Tool-LMM incorporates a linear projection layer to align multi-modal features to the LLM's feature space. What is the purpose of this projection? How does it aid in multi-modal learning? Are there any alternatives you can think of?

5. The paper designs several subsets to analyze model performance, including subsets based on ambiguity type, number of API options, and modality. Can you think of any other interesting subsets that could provide additional insights into model behavior?

6. The recall metric is proposed to assess the coverage of ground truth APIs over multiple inferences. What are the limitations of using accuracy alone for the multi-API matching task? How does recall provide a more nuanced measure? 

7. The paper finds lowest performance on the Domains and Categories ambiguity types. What intrinsic challenges do you think contribute to poor handling of these ambiguity types compared to others like Conditions?

8. Surprisingly, the paper shows higher performance on one-to-many cases versus one-to-one. What reasoning do the authors provide? Do you think this result would hold for more complex one-to-many cases?

9. Tool-LMM incorporates a trainable linear projection layer while keeping the multi-modal encoders fixed. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of fine-tuning the encoders themselves?

10. The paper focuses on single-turn dialogues presently. What challenges do you foresee in extending Tool-LMM's capabilities to multi-turn conversations? How could the method be adapted to handle dialog state tracking?
