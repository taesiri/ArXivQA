## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes ColonNeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction of long-sequence colonoscopy scans. A key challenge is addressing the dissimilarity among colon segments due to its convoluted shape. To tackle this, ColonNeRF utilizes a region division and integration module to divide the colon into consistent geometric blocks and fuse them smoothly. Additionally, a multi-level fusion module is introduced to progressively model both simple and complex colon structures from coarse to fine details. To handle sparse viewpoints in the colonoscopy data, the DensiNet module densifies camera poses by incorporating original, spinning around, and helix rotating views under semantic consistency supervision. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate ColonNeRFâ€™s superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Quantitatively, it achieves significant LPIPS improvements of 67-85% on synthetic data. Qualitatively, the reconstructions exhibit clearer textures, accurate geometric details, and depth maps. By effectively addressing key challenges in long-sequence colonoscopy reconstruction through purpose-built modules, ColonNeRF establishes a new state-of-the-art for this task.
