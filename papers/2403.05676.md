# [PipeRAG: Fast Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Algorithm-System   Co-design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05676)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models by periodically retrieving relevant content from external databases during text generation. However, frequent retrievals from large databases can substantially slow down the overall generation process. The paper asks: can we optimize RAG's efficiency (balancing generation quality and system performance) via an algorithm-system co-design?

Key Ideas: 
The paper proposes PipeRAG, a novel approach to improve RAG efficiency through concurrent pipeline execution of retrievals and inferences. PipeRAG is based on three key observations:
(1) Hardware underutilization due to dependencies between sequential retrievals and inferences. 
(2) Increasing per-token inference latency with sequence length in transformers.
(3) Tradeoffs between retrieval quality and latency based on search space.

To address these, PipeRAG comprises:
(1) Pipeline parallelism between retrieval and inference systems, enabled by prefetching database content using stale queries.
(2) Flexible retrieval intervals in the attention mechanism to maximize pipeline efficiency. 
(3) A performance model guiding the search space in retrieval to balance quality and latency.

Main Results:
Experiments using large Wikipedia/C4 databases demonstrate PipeRAG's superior efficiency over Retro baseline:
- Up to 2.6x speedup without compromising perplexity
- 0.93 perplexity reduction given same latency constraint
- Near baseline latency despite integrating retrievals  

Contributions:
- First algorithm-system co-design for efficient RAG via concurrent pipeline execution 
- Enhances Retro with flexible intervals and performance-driven search space configuration
- Showcases the promise of co-design in scaling future RAG systems

The summary highlights the key problem, the proposed PipeRAG solution and its three components, main experimental results proving efficiency gains, and the main contributions around concurrent pipeline execution for the first time in RAG systems.
