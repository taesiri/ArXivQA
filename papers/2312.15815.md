# [Compositional Generalization in Spoken Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15815)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- State-of-the-art spoken language understanding (SLU) models struggle with compositional generalization, i.e. understanding new combinations of seen components. 
- Two key issues: (1) identifying novel combinations of slot types unseen during training, and (2) generalizing to utterances with more slots than seen during training.
- Existing models rely on spurious slot correlations and fail on new slot combinations. They also struggle on longer utterances due to poor slot representations.

Proposed Solution:
- Created the first compositional splits of ATIS and SNIPS SLU datasets to systematically evaluate model compositionality.
- Proposed a compositional SLU model with two key components:
  1) New compositional loss that encourages attention to focus on informative words, reducing reliance on spurious slot correlations.  
  2) Paired training data augmentation that improves length generalization by exposing model to longer, novel utterances.

Main Contributions:
- First compositional splits of standard SLU datasets for benchmarking.
- In-depth analysis showing reliance on spurious correlations and inability to generalize to new combinations and lengths.
- Novel compositional loss and paired training techniques to improve compositional generalization. 
- Significantly improved performance (up to 5% F1) over BERT baseline on compositional splits of ATIS and SNIPS datasets.

The paper makes important contributions in analyzing issues with state-of-the-art SLU models and proposing practical and scalable solutions to improve compositional generalization on real-world datasets.
