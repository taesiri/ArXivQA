# [Differentially Private Gradient Flow based on the Sliced Wasserstein   Distance for Non-Parametric Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08227)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a novel differentially private generative modeling approach based on parameter-free gradient flows in the space of probability measures. The proposed algorithm operates through a discretized flow with particle updates derived from the sliced Wasserstein distance computed privately via Gaussian smoothing. Compared to generator-based models, experiments demonstrate that this gradient flow approach can generate higher fidelity data at low privacy budgets. Theoretically, the paper proves this evolution is the gradient flow minimizing a functional with the Gaussian-smoothed sliced Wasserstein distance and entropy regularization terms. It provides a differential privacy analysis by tracking parameters of the discretization. Overall, with strong theory and experimental viability, this principled privacy-preserving generative modeling method via gradient flows establishes a promising foundation for future research.
