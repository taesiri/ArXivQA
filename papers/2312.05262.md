# [Model Copyright Protection in Buyer-seller Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05262)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is computationally expensive. Buying pre-trained models from sellers with large computing resources is common. 
- However, the buyer-seller environment is not always trusted. The bought DNN models are at risk of being stolen and their commercial value damaged.
- Existing solutions like encryption have high computational overhead during inference. Model watermarking cannot prevent model access upon theft.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel input-sensitive neural network (ISNN) based copyright protection scheme. 
- The key idea is to make the DNN model sensitive to the input data based on a secret key. Inputs stamped with the correct perturbation (relying on the key) are treated as legal and lead to correct classification. Other inputs are illegal and misclassified.
- This allows only buyers with the correct key to utilize the model, without needing encryption during inference.

Main Contributions:
- The scheme enables model utilization verification and copyright protection without requiring expensive computation or decryption.
- Three potential attacks - retraining, forging copyright, reverse iteration attacks - are analyzed. Experiments show the scheme is secure against them.
- The accuracy on legal inputs is maintained close to original DNN performance. But illegal inputs lead to poor accuracy even with model parameters exposed.
- The perturbation added to legal inputs is constrained to be imperceptible, achieving model fidelity and crypticity.
- Analyses and experiments demonstrate the scheme is effective, valid and secure for copyright protection in untrusted environments.

In summary, the paper proposes an input-sensitive DNN scheme for model copyright protection without encryption overheads that provably achieves security, fidelity and flexibility goals.
