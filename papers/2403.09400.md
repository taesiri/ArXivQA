# [ConDiSR: Contrastive Disentanglement and Style Regularization for Single   Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09400)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Medical imaging data often suffers from distribution shifts across different centers due to differences in equipment, protocols etc. This causes performance degradation when models trained on data from one center are applied to data from another center.

- Domain generalization (DG) methods aim to address this by training models that can generalize to new unseen domains. Single domain generalization (SDG) setting is especially relevant for medical imaging due to privacy and logistics constraints in accessing multi-center data. 

- Existing SDG methods rely heavily on dense structural information from segmentation masks. But classification tasks do not provide such dense supervision, making SDG more challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a SDG method called ConDiSR that combines contrastive disentanglement with style regularization for robust medical image classification.

- It extracts shallow level style and structure related features from original and augmented images using a disentanglement module. Style features are regularized via reconstruction loss against downscaled images.

- Contrastive loss minimizes distance between structure features and maximizes distance between style features of original and augmented images.

- The structure features are used for classification while style features are regularized, which improves disentanglement.

Main Contributions:
- A new SDG method using reconstruction-based style regularization for improved style/structure disentanglement, suited for classification tasks. 

- An integrated training criterion combining reconstruction, contrastive and cross-entropy losses.

- First benchmark for a challenging multi-center histopathology classification task in SDG setting. ConDiSR outperforms state-of-the-art with more stable performance across domains.

- Analysis highlighting importance of exploring specialized SDG methods for classification problems.
