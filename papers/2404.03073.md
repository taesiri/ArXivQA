# [Mai Ho'omƒÅuna i ka 'Ai: Language Models Improve Automatic Speech   Recognition in Hawaiian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03073)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has mostly benefited high-resource languages like English. Low-resource languages like Hawaiian have lacked access to high-quality ASR systems. This hampers efforts to preserve and revitalize the Hawaiian language.

- Existing ASR "foundation models" like Whisper have shown the ability to transfer to new languages with zero shot learning. However, they do not leverage large amounts of text that may be available for low-resource languages.

Method:
- The authors evaluated Whisper, a state-of-the-art speech foundation model, on its ability to perform zero-shot speech recognition on Hawaiian without using any Hawaiian training data.

- They created a separate Hawaiian language model (LM) trained on 1.5 million words of Hawaiian text data. This LM was used to rescore the outputs of Whisper using weights to balance the contributions of the Whisper model and the LM.

- Speech recognition performance was evaluated using a manually-curated test set with Hawaiian speech recordings and ground truth transcripts. Word error rate (WER) was the main metric.

Results: 
- The largest Whisper models achieved ~22% WER without using the external Hawaiian LM.

- By rescoring Whisper's outputs with the Hawaiian LM, the WER improved significantly to ~20%. Though a small absolute improvement, this demonstrates the utility of leveraging available text data.

- Analyses revealed Whisper struggles with Hawaiian words containing glottal stops and vowel length distinctions, suggesting fine-tuning is needed.

Main Contributions:

1) First systematic evaluation of a speech foundation model (Whisper) on low-resource Hawaiian speech recognition.

2) Demonstrated incorporating a text-based language model can provide small but significant gains over state-of-the-art models like Whisper.

3) Opened up future research directions for improving low-resource ASR using unlabeled speech and text.
