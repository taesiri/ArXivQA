## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Image dehazing is important for computer vision tasks but suffers from efficiency issues when using Transformer architectures which have large computational complexity. 
- Efficient modeling of long-range dependencies in images remains an unresolved challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a U-shaped Vision Mamba (UVM-Net), an efficient single-image dehazing network.
- It is based on an encoder-decoder U-Net structure with UVM blocks in the encoder and convolution blocks in the decoder. 
- The UVM block integrates a Bi-SSM module which models long-range dependencies by passing features through Structured State Space Model (SSM) layers.
- This captures both local features via convolutions and global context via the SSM.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes UVM-Net that combines CNN and SSM to efficiently model both local features and long-range dependencies for image dehazing.
- Introduces Bi-SSM module to pass features through SSM over the channel dimension to better capture dependencies.  
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on image dehazing with lower computational complexity compared to Transformer architectures.
- Demonstrates UVM-Net's potential as an efficient backbone for other image restoration tasks.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in designing an efficient network (UVM-Net) for image dehazing that integrates CNN and SSM to model both local and global context well, outperforming previous approaches. The ideas can be extended to other low-level vision tasks.

The paper proposes a new architecture called U-shaped Vision Mamba (UVM-Net) for efficient single image dehazing. It uses State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) to capture long-range dependencies in images combined with convolutional neural networks for local feature extraction in an encoder-decoder structure.
