# [A tutorial on multi-view autoencoders using the multi-view-AE library](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07456)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Modelling multi-modal or multi-view data, where data has different complementary representations or "views", has become increasingly important across research fields. Multi-view autoencoders are a popular approach for jointly modelling such multi-view data. However, existing multi-view autoencoder implementations have inconsistent notation, are built on different code frameworks, and can be difficult to access and compare. This limits the wider application and further research into multi-view autoencoders.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors present the multi-view-AE software library - an open-source Python package implementing over 15 multi-view autoencoder variants using a unified framework and notation. The library aims to increase accessibility and further research into multi-view autoencoders through:

- Simple and flexible API for training, evaluation and reconstruction 
- Modular code structure to easily swap model components 
- Suitable for both beginners and experts to use and extend
- Use of PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning for state-of-the-art deep learning functionality

The authors describe the mathematical formulation for each implemented model in a consistent notation and highlight modelling considerations. Benchmarking experiments demonstrate the library's implementations match or outperform previous implementations.

Main Contributions:

- Consolidated mathematical formulation of over 15 multi-view autoencoder models using consistent notation 
- Open-source multi-view-AE library implementing these models with simple interface and modular structure
- Description of software architecture and key functionality of the library
- Benchmarking to validate performance of implementations
- Educational resources on multi-view autoencoders through documentation and tutorials

Overall, this paper and the multi-view-AE library significantly advance accessibility and research into multi-view modelling, providing both an educational resource and practical tool for the field.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the Joint Multi-modal Variational Autoencoder (JMVAE) model combine the latent representations from different modalities? What is the motivation behind including additional KL divergence terms compared to the standard JMVAE model?

2) What are the key differences in formulation between the Deep Canonically Correlated Autoencoder (DCCAE) and Deep Variational CCA (DVCCA) models? What are the tradeoffs between using batch versus minibatch optimization for DCCAE? 

3) Explain the Inverse-Variance Weighting (IVW) approach used to compute the parameters of the joint posterior distribution in the Multi-modal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE). Why might this method be prone to issues with overconfident experts?

4) What modifications does the Variational Mixture-of-Experts Autoencoder (mmVAE) make compared to MVAE to try to address potential issues with combining expert distributions? What limitations still exist with the mmVAE training procedure?

5) How does the Multi-View Total Correlation Autoencoder (MVTCAE) differ in its objective function and modeling of the joint posterior distribution compared to previous multi-view VAE methods? What is the motivation behind using conditional variational information bottleneck terms?

6) Explain the Mixture-of-Products-of-Experts (MoPoE) approach for modeling the joint posterior distribution. How does the training procedure and objective function differ between MoPoEVAE and the multi-modal VAE with subsampling?

7) What is the motivation behind using a Jensen-Shannon divergence term in the objective function for the mmJSD model? How is the "dynamic prior" defined and how does this relate to the choice of divergence measure?

8) What modifications does the Mixture-of-Experts multi-modal VAE Plus (MMVAE+) model make compared to the original mmVAE? How are the private and shared latent variables used differently for same-modality and cross-modality reconstruction?

9) How does the Disentangled Multi-modal Variational Autoencoder (DMVAE) define and make use of private and shared latent variables? What is the motivation behind using separate reconstruction terms based on different latent variable combinations?

10) What are the key differences in objectives between the Multi-view Adversarial Autoencoder (mAAE) and Multi-view Adversarial Autoencoder with Wasserstein loss (mWAE) models? What are the potential benefits of using a Wasserstein loss?
