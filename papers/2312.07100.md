# [Lightweight high-resolution Subject Matting in the Real World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07100)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes PSUNet, a lightweight deep neural network for salient object detection and matting in high-resolution images. To improve performance on high-resolution images while minimizing computation cost, the authors propose a symmetric pixel shuffle module to efficiently upsample and downsample feature maps, as well as a tiny residual U-block that controls network width for efficiency. They also construct a new high-resolution salient object matting dataset (HRSOM) with over 13,000 images to improve real-world performance. A two-stage training strategy using a hybrid loss function helps PSUNet robustly handle open-world scenarios. Experiments show state-of-the-art objective results on high-resolution datasets compared to 13 other methods, with 4.15M parameters and 12.38 GMACS only. Subjective evaluations also demonstrate better performance than iOS 16 Quick Matting in capturing complete salient objects with accurate edges. With optimizations, PSUNet achieves fast 113ms inference on mobile platforms, enabling high-quality salient object matting on high-resolution images in real-time mobile applications.
