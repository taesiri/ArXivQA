 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a voice-based smart assistant system for vehicles using the open-source RASA framework. The goal is to improve road safety by reducing driver distractions through automating routine in-vehicle tasks using speech. The system architecture comprises modules for general interaction, news, weather updates, navigation, music playback, and communication. User speech input is converted to text using speech recognition, analyzed to extract intents and entities with natural language understanding, and used to trigger appropriate actions and responses. The response time for intent identification is 0.08 seconds and overall accuracy is 93.67%. Key metrics like average response time per module and accuracy of intent classification quantify the system's performance. Limitations exist due to noisy environments, regional accents, and limited training data. Potential future enhancements include expanded language support, vehicle systems integration over IoT, and additional in-car control functionalities. In summary, this research implements and tests a conversational agent to facilitate safe vehicle operation by enabling hands-free access to information and entertainment via voice.
