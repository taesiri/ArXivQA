# [A GAN Approach for Node Embedding in Heterogeneous Graphs Using Subgraph   Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06519)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes FlashGAN, a novel framework for addressing the class imbalance problem in heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) by generating synthetic minority class nodes and edges. The core innovation is the integrated training of a generator module that concurrently learns node features and graph structure distributions. This avoids relying on separate pre-trained models. FlashGAN handles two key challenges: 1) establishing reasonable connections between new nodes and the graph, and 2) the edge imbalance issue arising when connecting synthetic nodes. It introduces an edge-dropping threshold strategy to automatically find optimal edge quantities during augmentation. Additionally, FlashGAN uses localized node embedding and subgraph sampling techniques to alleviate the edge imbalance problem and enable higher-quality edge generation. Experiments on Amazon and Yelp review datasets demonstrate FlashGAN's ability to boost minority class identification performance. Compared to state-of-the-art oversampling methods, FlashGAN achieves superior metric scores while minimizing graph size increase. The results highlight its potential for addressing class imbalance in real-world GNN tasks.
