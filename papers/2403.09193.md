# [Are Vision Language Models Texture or Shape Biased and Can We Steer   Them?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09193)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Vision language models (VLMs) have recently emerged as powerful multimodal models, but it is unclear if they adopt human-induced visual biases (like the texture vs shape bias) through multimodal fusion or simply inherit biases from their vision encoders. 
- Understanding if text influences visual biases, and if biases can be steered through language prompting, has important implications for aligning VLMs with human perception.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper conducts a large-scale study analyzing the texture vs shape bias in diverse VLMs on visual question answering and image captioning tasks using a cue-conflict dataset.
- It investigates if biases can be influenced through visual input preprocessing or language prompting.

Key Findings:
- VLMs are more shape-biased than their vision encoders, indicating text modulates visual biases to some extent rather than simply inheriting them.
- VLMs appear to learn multimodal associations between visual concepts like shape/texture and corresponding terms, enabling bias steering through language.
- Vision preprocessing strongly steers bias between 6-91% shape, whereas prompting alone achieves 49-72%.
- Language steering preserves accuracy unlike vision modifications, providing an intuitive interface for practitioners to align biases.  

Main Contributions:
- First large-scale analysis showing VLMs modulate, rather than directly inherit, visual biases from encoders through text.
- Demonstration that language prompts can steer visual texture/shape bias in VLMs without hurting accuracy.
- Extensive benchmark of bias and steerability across diverse latest VLMs to understand current landscape.

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the texture versus shape bias in vision language models, finding that language can influence and steer this visual bias to some extent, though not as strongly as directly modifying the visual inputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. Text appears to influence visual texture/shape bias. Through a large-scale study, the authors report that vision language models (VLMs) are often more shape-biased than their vision encoders, even though they rely on texture more than humans would. 

2. VLMs have learned a multimodal understanding of the concepts of "shape" and "texture" which allows steering of the texture/shape bias. Given that multimodal models do not simply inherit visual biases, the authors are able to steer visual biases through language. For example, shape bias is steered from 49% to 72% through prompting alone.

3. While visual steering has a stronger effect, language-based steering allows intuitively tweaking biases without hurting accuracy. This insight could be harnessed to align models more closely with human perception.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that visual biases like the texture/shape bias can be influenced through multimodal fusion with language, and specifically that language allows steering biases in an intuitive way through prompts.

The paper examines the texture vs shape bias in VLMs, finding that they tend to be more shape-biased than their vision encoder backbones. It also shows that visual biases like texture/shape can be steered to some extent through modifications to the textual prompt. Overall, it provides an analysis of how well VLMs align with human visual perception and biases.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 detailed questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using the cue-conflict dataset to measure texture/shape bias in vision language models (VLMs). How exactly is this dataset constructed and why is it well-suited for analyzing this bias?

2. The paper measures both shape bias and accuracy on the cue-conflict dataset. Explain the definitions and formulas used to calculate these metrics. Why is it important to measure both?

3. The paper conducts experiments using two main VLM tasks - visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning. What are the key differences between these tasks and how do the authors extract responses to measure shape bias/accuracy for each one?

4. The authors find that most VLMs tested are more shape-biased than their vision encoders alone. What evidence supports the claim that text is influencing the visual texture/shape bias in these models?

5. For the VQA experiments, the authors utilize the token probabilities to analyze the confidence of predictions. Summarize what they found regarding confidence levels and how this provides insights into the VLM decision process.  

6. The paper ablates the effect of the vision encoder architecture and training methodology on shape bias. What do they conclude about which factors of the encoder influence shape bias in VLMs?

7. The authors test manually steering the shape bias higher/lower through handcrafted prompts. How much can the bias be influenced through prompts alone and how does this compare to human behavior? 

8. Explain the automated prompt engineering approach utilized to optimize prompts for maximizing/minimizing shape bias. How well does this work compared to handcrafted prompts?

9. For the vision-based steering experiments, the paper utilizes image patching and adding Gaussian noise. Explain how these approaches influence shape bias and discuss the extent to which bias can be steered through vision alone.

10. The authors provide an analysis of results on the image captioning task. Discuss some of the challenges and potential limitations they point out regarding analyzing open-ended textual responses.
