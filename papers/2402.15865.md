# [HIR-Diff: Unsupervised Hyperspectral Image Restoration Via Improved   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15865)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover clean images from degraded observations. Existing model-based methods rely on handcrafted priors and are limited in modeling complex image characteristics. Deep learning methods require a lot of training data and suffer from poor generalization. Recently proposed unsupervised diffusion models take a long time to exploit image structure for each dataset. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes an unsupervised HSI restoration framework called HIR-Diff that utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model. The key idea is to decompose the HSI into the product of a reduced image and a coefficient matrix, which are estimated separately. Specifically:

1) The reduced image with low spectral dimension lies in the image domain and is estimated using an improved diffusion model with a novel exponential noise schedule and guidance loss with TV prior. This allows faster and better sampling. 

2) The coefficient matrix is robustly estimated from the degraded image's SVD and band selection using RRQR factorization. This avoids noise and ensures the matrix is well-conditioned.

3) The final HSI is restored by multiplying the estimated reduced image and coefficient matrix. The framework is unsupervised, leverages prior knowledge, and generalizes across datasets.

Main Contributions:
- An unsupervised HSI restoration framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion model and tensor decomposition 
- A conditional diffusion model with novel exponential schedule and guidance loss for reduced image estimation
- A noise-robust coefficient matrix estimation technique using SVD and RRQR
- Significantly improved restoration performance and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods on tasks like denoising, super-resolution, inpainting

The proposed HIR-Diff framework achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple standard HSI datasets and different tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization ability. The unsupervised nature also makes it widely applicable without requiring training data.
