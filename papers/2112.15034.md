# [Self Reward Design with Fine-grained Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15034)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a novel approach for designing interpretable and self-optimizing reinforcement learning agents through a framework called Self Reward Design (SRD). The key ideas are:1. The agents are designed in a bottom-up, modular fashion using standard neural network components like convolutional and fully-connected layers. But the components are arranged and initialized in an interpretable way, with each neuron or module having a specific semantic meaning. 2. The agents have a mechanism to reward themselves (compute their own "loss") based on assessing the correctness of their actions. This allows them to optimize themselves through backpropagation on the self-generated rewards, improving performance beyond the initial human design.3. The approach balances human expertise in problem-specific design with the power of neural network optimization. It aims to achieve both interpretability and good performance without needing to specify arbitrary rewards.4. The approach is demonstrated on simple 1D and 2D navigation tasks as well as a simulated MuJoCo agent. The interpretability is fine-grained, with direct manipulation of weights and biases to induce bias towards human-understandable concepts.So in summary, the key hypothesis is that reinforcement learning agents can be made interpretable through deliberate and modular neural network design, and then optimized through a self-assessing reward mechanism. The paper aims to provide a general framework and demonstrate the viability through simple examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a framework called Self Reward Design (SRD) for creating interpretable reinforcement learning agents. The key idea is to manually design neural network architectures where each component has a clear semantic meaning, rather than using end-to-end blackbox models.2. It demonstrates the SRD framework on several test problems - a 1D toy example of a robot fish, a 2D robot navigating a gridworld, and controlling a simulated half-cheetah robot. For each problem, interpretable network components are designed and shown to solve the task without any training.3. The designed networks can be further optimized using a self-reward mechanism, where the agent effectively rewards itself for taking correct actions. This allows improving the performance beyond the initial human design.4. The approach emphasizes transparency and interpretability. By deliberately designing each network component and connection, the behavior and decision making of the agent is intended to be understandable at a fine-grained level.5. The paper argues that targeted human design can be more efficient than blackbox end-to-end training, by avoiding long training times and leveraging human knowledge and inductive biases. The interpretable design also facilitates inspection for undesirable behaviors.In summary, the key novelty is using carefully hand-designed neural architectures for transparent and interpretable reinforcement learning agents. This is demonstrated on a few simple but illustrative test problems. The focus is on advocating for more interpretable approaches over blackbox methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper proposes a framework called Self Reward Design (SRD) which integrates highly interpretable human-centric design of neural network components with trainable parameters to create transparent and explainable reinforcement learning solutions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on Self Reward Design compares to other research on interpretable and explainable reinforcement learning:- It focuses on very fine-grained, low-level interpretability by directly manipulating the weights and biases of neural network components. Most other interpretability methods operate at a higher level of abstraction, like visualizing saliency maps or decomposing rewards. - The design process leads to targeted, specialized neural network architectures for each problem context. This differs from more general-purpose interpretability techniques meant to work across problems.- It advocates for humans to leverage domain knowledge and hand-design components, rather than relying solely on black-box training. Other approaches tend to focus more on training techniques and algorithms.- The self-reward mechanism gives the agent internal goals and values, unlike traditional RL reward functions specified externally by humans. This provides a different way to inject interpretability.- It aims for both interpretability and performance, using the power of neural networks while keeping explanations accessible. Some interpretability methods introduce trade-offs with accuracy.- The approach is presented more as a framework for encouraging interpretable designs rather than a single rigid technique. It allows flexibility based on the problem context.Overall, the emphasis is on human-centric, glass-box design rather than deciphering black-box models. By hand-crafting transparent components grounded in the problem semantics, this enables fine-grained explanations all the way down to individual network units. It's a unique perspective compared to most post-hoc interpretability methods.
