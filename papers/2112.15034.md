# [Self Reward Design with Fine-grained Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15034)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a novel approach for designing interpretable and self-optimizing reinforcement learning agents through a framework called Self Reward Design (SRD). The key ideas are:

1. The agents are designed in a bottom-up, modular fashion using standard neural network components like convolutional and fully-connected layers. But the components are arranged and initialized in an interpretable way, with each neuron or module having a specific semantic meaning. 

2. The agents have a mechanism to reward themselves (compute their own "loss") based on assessing the correctness of their actions. This allows them to optimize themselves through backpropagation on the self-generated rewards, improving performance beyond the initial human design.

3. The approach balances human expertise in problem-specific design with the power of neural network optimization. It aims to achieve both interpretability and good performance without needing to specify arbitrary rewards.

4. The approach is demonstrated on simple 1D and 2D navigation tasks as well as a simulated MuJoCo agent. The interpretability is fine-grained, with direct manipulation of weights and biases to induce bias towards human-understandable concepts.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that reinforcement learning agents can be made interpretable through deliberate and modular neural network design, and then optimized through a self-assessing reward mechanism. The paper aims to provide a general framework and demonstrate the viability through simple examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a framework called Self Reward Design (SRD) for creating interpretable reinforcement learning agents. The key idea is to manually design neural network architectures where each component has a clear semantic meaning, rather than using end-to-end blackbox models.

2. It demonstrates the SRD framework on several test problems - a 1D toy example of a robot fish, a 2D robot navigating a gridworld, and controlling a simulated half-cheetah robot. For each problem, interpretable network components are designed and shown to solve the task without any training.

3. The designed networks can be further optimized using a self-reward mechanism, where the agent effectively rewards itself for taking correct actions. This allows improving the performance beyond the initial human design.

4. The approach emphasizes transparency and interpretability. By deliberately designing each network component and connection, the behavior and decision making of the agent is intended to be understandable at a fine-grained level.

5. The paper argues that targeted human design can be more efficient than blackbox end-to-end training, by avoiding long training times and leveraging human knowledge and inductive biases. The interpretable design also facilitates inspection for undesirable behaviors.

In summary, the key novelty is using carefully hand-designed neural architectures for transparent and interpretable reinforcement learning agents. This is demonstrated on a few simple but illustrative test problems. The focus is on advocating for more interpretable approaches over blackbox methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes a framework called Self Reward Design (SRD) which integrates highly interpretable human-centric design of neural network components with trainable parameters to create transparent and explainable reinforcement learning solutions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on Self Reward Design compares to other research on interpretable and explainable reinforcement learning:

- It focuses on very fine-grained, low-level interpretability by directly manipulating the weights and biases of neural network components. Most other interpretability methods operate at a higher level of abstraction, like visualizing saliency maps or decomposing rewards. 

- The design process leads to targeted, specialized neural network architectures for each problem context. This differs from more general-purpose interpretability techniques meant to work across problems.

- It advocates for humans to leverage domain knowledge and hand-design components, rather than relying solely on black-box training. Other approaches tend to focus more on training techniques and algorithms.

- The self-reward mechanism gives the agent internal goals and values, unlike traditional RL reward functions specified externally by humans. This provides a different way to inject interpretability.

- It aims for both interpretability and performance, using the power of neural networks while keeping explanations accessible. Some interpretability methods introduce trade-offs with accuracy.

- The approach is presented more as a framework for encouraging interpretable designs rather than a single rigid technique. It allows flexibility based on the problem context.

Overall, the emphasis is on human-centric, glass-box design rather than deciphering black-box models. By hand-crafting transparent components grounded in the problem semantics, this enables fine-grained explanations all the way down to individual network units. It's a unique perspective compared to most post-hoc interpretability methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Generalizability and scalability: The authors note that their approach may face challenges in scaling up to more complex problems like computer vision tasks with high-dimensional state spaces. They suggest further research is needed to tackle these more complex problems. 

- Controlling weights and biases: The authors propose investigating techniques for regularizing the training of weights and biases to maintain interpretability and consistency. 

- Formulating a general SRD framework: The authors used different components and arrangements tailored to each specific problem. They suggest it may be useful to identify more general formulations or frameworks for SRD that can be applied across problems.

- Understanding noisy/complex states: The authors note that further research is needed to understand how to properly map noisy or complex states to appropriate actions in SRD models.

- Comparison with deep RL methods: The authors suggest that while performance comparison with deep RL is difficult, comparing interpretability levels could be an interesting direction for future work. However, quantifying interpretability remains an open challenge.

- APIs for model parallelization: The authors encountered limitations with existing APIs for parallelizing the imaginative/planning portions of SRD training, suggesting more research in this area could help.

- Effects of different data augmentation techniques: The authors proposed implicit contrastive learning for data augmentation but suggest further study on the impacts of different techniques is needed.

Overall, the key suggestions focus on improving the generalizability, scalability, frameworks, training techniques, and quantification of interpretability for the SRD approach. Advancing these aspects could help broaden the applicability of highly interpretable SRD models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called Self Reward Design (SRD) for creating interpretable reinforcement learning agents. The key ideas are:

- SRD advocates designing neural network models in a transparent, human-understandable way where each component has clear semantic meaning. This is in contrast to standard deep RL models which are often black boxes. 

- With SRD, the model is initialized with hand-designed components and weights to solve the problem to some extent. Then it can be optimized further like a standard DNN via "self reward", i.e. the model rewards its own actions.

- The approach is demonstrated on several problems: a 1D robot fish, a 2D robot navigating a gridworld, controlling a simulated half-cheetah, and a fish auction scenario. The models use common DNN modules like convolutions and FC layers arranged in an interpretable way.

- A key benefit claimed is efficiency - targeted network design avoids the need for massive models and datasets like in deep RL. The semantically meaningful components also make the models more amenable to human understanding.

In summary, the paper advocates for highly transparent and human-centric design of RL agents using NN components, in contrast to end-to-end black box deep RL.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called Self Reward Design (SRD) for creating interpretable reinforcement learning agents. The key idea is to design neural network architectures in a very transparent way, where each neuron or layer has a specific understandable meaning and purpose. This allows the full model to be interpretable at a very fine-grained level. The authors demonstrate the SRD framework on several examples, including a 1D robot fish, a 2D robot traversing a gridworld, and controlling a simulated half-cheetah robot. 

In the SRD framework, the agent's neural network decides actions and also contains a prefrontal cortex (PFC) module that facilitates self-rewarding. The models are initialized with hand-designed weights and biases to solve the problem to some extent out of the box. Then, the models can be further optimized like standard deep neural networks using techniques like stochastic gradient descent. The paper shows how targeted human design choices allow simple and efficient models to solve problems without needing large datasets or long training times like conventional deep RL methods. A key benefit highlighted is the interpretability afforded by the deliberate design process. The paper advocates developing transparent and interpretable RL solutions rather than relying solely on black-box neural networks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents the Self Reward Design (SRD) framework for developing interpretable reinforcement learning agents. The key idea is to manually design neural network models with semantically meaningful neurons, so that each component has a clear purpose that is understandable to humans. 

The method is demonstrated through several examples. In the 1D robot fish example, neurons are designed to detect food location, hunger level, etc. The weights are set so these neurons activate appropriately, allowing the robot fish to take basic actions like eating when hungry. A prefrontal cortex module rewards correct actions like eating food when hungry. The network can then be optimized through standard deep learning techniques like backpropagation to improve performance while retaining interpretability.

Similar principles are applied in the more complex 2D robot navigation and MuJoCo control tasks. Tile-specific neurons detect map features, and deconv layers create action preferences leading towards the target. The prefrontal cortex supervises based on whether actions move closer to the target. Overall, this enables interpretable controllers without needing an explicit reward function. While performance may be limited compared to black-box deep RL, interpretability is retained through deliberate architecture design and semantically meaningful neurons.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem the authors are trying to address is how to create reinforcement learning (RL) agents and models with high interpretability and transparency. Specifically:

- They propose a framework called "Self Reward Design" (SRD) that allows for highly interpretable neural network design for RL agents. The goal is to have models where each component has clear semantic meaning and utility that corresponds to humanly understandable concepts. 

- This is in contrast to standard deep RL models which tend to be opaque black boxes that are difficult to interpret. The authors argue SRD can solve problems in a transparent and human-centric way while still leveraging the power of neural networks.

- They demonstrate the SRD framework on several examples like a 1D robot fish, a 2D robot navigating a grid, and controlling a simulated half-cheetah robot. In each case, they design interpretable neural network components and show how the agent can learn via self-reward mechanisms.

- A key application they highlight is a fish auction scenario where interpretability is important to detect potentially malicious/harmful bidding strategies. They argue standard deep RL may not be suitable here due to lack of interpretability.

In summary, the key focus is on developing more interpretable and transparent reinforcement learning systems through deliberate neural network design and self-reward optimization, as an alternative to opaque deep RL methods. The authors aim to encourage this style of human-centric, interpretable RL system development.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning approach called Self Reward Design (SRD) that combines highly interpretable human-centric design with the power of deep neural networks. The key idea is to design neural network models in a very transparent way where each neuron or layer has a specific, humanly understandable meaning and purpose.
