# [Adversarial Infrared Curves: An Attack on Infrared Pedestrian Detectors   in the Physical World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14217)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Security of deep neural networks is an important issue, with extensive work on visible light physical attacks but limited exploration in the infrared domain. 
- Existing infrared physical attack methods like white-box attacks using bulb boards and QR suits lack realism and stealthiness. Black-box methods with cold/hot patches often struggle with robustness.
- There is a need to balance stealthiness and robustness in infrared physical attacks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Adversarial Infrared Curves (AdvIC), a novel black-box physical attack against infrared pedestrian detectors.
- AdvIC uses Particle Swarm Optimization to optimize two Bezier curves to create adversarial infrared curve patterns. 
- In the physical world, cold patches are strategically placed inside pedestrian clothing to generate stealthy physical samples.

Main Contributions:
- Achieves high attack success rates of 94.83% (digital) and 67.2% (physical), demonstrating effectiveness.
- Enhanced stealthiness compared to baseline methods based on analysis of digital/physical samples.
- Superior robustness versus baselines shown by average 76.84% attack success rate against advanced detectors.
- Thorough experimental analysis including ablation studies on curve shapes, transfer attacks, and defense investigations.
- Balances stealthiness and robustness for infrared physical attacks. Poses significant security implications for real-world applications.

In summary, the paper proposes a stealthy and robust infrared physical attack using adversarial curves, analyzes it extensively, and highlights the need for further attention and mitigation efforts due to its security impact.
