# [Neural Architecture Search using Particle Swarm and Ant Colony   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03781)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Choosing optimal neural network architectures and hyperparameters is difficult and time-consuming. Using default settings often leads to suboptimal performance. 
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in particular take very long to train and evaluate different architectures.
- There is a need for efficient neural architecture search (NAS) tools to automate the search for good CNN architectures.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop an open source system called OpenNAS that integrates several NAS approaches:
    - Transfer learning using pre-trained models (VGG, ResNet etc)
    - Network morphism using AutoKeras
    - Swarm intelligence using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO) to search the architecture space
- The focus is on using PSO and ACO to find good CNN architectures for image classification tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Implementation and evaluation of an integrated open source NAS system OpenNAS using different search strategies.
- Comparison of PSO and ACO for NAS to determine which method results in better CNN architectures.
- Testing on CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST datasets shows PSO finds better models than ACO, achieving over 90% on CIFAR-10 and 94% on Fashion MNIST.
- The PSO and ACO models are competitive or better than other published NAS systems like psoCNN and DeepSwarm.
- Analysis of impact of different swarm hyperparameters like number of iterations, particles, ants etc. on accuracy and training time.

In summary, the paper proposes OpenNAS, an open source tool that integrates different NAS techniques and shows that PSO is more effective for CNN architecture search than ACO, achieving state-of-the-art performances on image classification datasets.
