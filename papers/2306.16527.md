## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on large-scale multimodal datasets:

- Scale and diversity: This paper introduces OBELICS, a new large-scale dataset of 141 million multimodal documents with 353 million images. This is similar in scale and diversity to other recent multimodal datasets like LAION, ALIGN, and the Multimodal C4 dataset. However, OBELICS focuses specifically on multimodal documents rather than image-text pairs.

- Filtering process: A key contribution is the detailed filtering process to create high-quality multimodal documents from raw web data. The paper puts more emphasis on carefully filtering data compared to some other multimodal dataset papers. For example, it uses opt-out image filtering, extensive text quality checks, and aggressive deduplication.

- Benchmark performance: The paper shows that models trained on OBELICS can achieve strong performance on multimodal benchmarks, comparable to models trained on other large datasets like Flamingo and OpenFlamingo. This helps validate OBELICS as a viable training set.

- Accessibility: OBELICS and the models are publicly released, whereas some other large multimodal datasets are not open. However, Multimodal C4 was also recently opened.

- Multimodal documents: Most prior datasets focus on image-text pairs. OBELICS specifically extracts longer multimodal documents which better capture the contextual relationships between images and text.

Overall, this paper introduces a large-scale filtered dataset comparable in key metrics like size and diversity to others in this space. A core novel contribution is the focus on curating multimodal documents over individual image-text pairs. The open release also helps advance research in this area.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on large-scale multimodal datasets:

- This paper introduces OBELICS, a new large-scale dataset of 141M multimodal documents with 353M images extracted from Common Crawl. This is one of the largest publicly available datasets of its kind, compared to other multimodal document datasets like mmc4 (103M docs, 585M images).

- The paper provides comprehensive details on the dataset creation process, including filtering strategies and content analysis. Many other large web-crawled datasets lack transparency into how the data was collected and processed. 

- OBELICS focuses on preserving the original document structure with full paragraphs of text interleaved with images. Other multimodal datasets like LAION and Conceptual Captions extract alt-text only. Keeping longer text contexts is useful for training multimodal models.

- The authors demonstrate training multimodal models like IDEFICS on OBELICS can reach performance comparable to models trained on private datasets like Flamingo. This helps validate OBELICS as a viable alternative open resource.

- The paper discusses efforts to filter out undesirable content and respect image licenses, an important ethical consideration lacking in some web dataset papers. More analysis of biases would be useful.

- Compared to other multimodal document datasets, OBELICS has a higher proportion of unique images, indicating less duplication. Deduplication is another area addressed more thoroughly.

Overall, OBELICS moves forward the state of large-scale multimodal research by providing a huge filtered resource with transparency, while also addressing important ethical considerations and analysis. As one of the largest open datasets of its kind, it enables further research in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing additional filtering and curation techniques for extracting higher quality multimodal documents from web sources. The authors mention that using stricter filters did not necessarily yield higher quality documents in their experiments, so more research is needed on optimizing filtering strategies.

- Exploring even larger scale multimodal datasets. The authors note that bigger datasets are likely to benefit future multimodal models.

- Conducting more thorough data audits and bias analyses. The authors acknowledge the risks of biases in web crawled data and suggest audits are needed, especially for multimodal documents. 

- Developing models capable of leveraging the full image context available in multimodal documents rather than just image-text pairs. The benefits of the document structure could be further exploited.

- Training models that can generate long, coherent text conditioned on documents with multiple images. The authors suggest their dataset can help enable these types of generative models.

- Replicating recent state-of-the-art multimodal models using this open dataset as an alternative to private datasets. The authors demonstrate this with their IDEFICS models.

- Exploring different multimodal architectures, objectives, and pretraining procedures enabled by this dataset.

In summary, the authors propose their dataset can open up research avenues in scaling up models, reducing biases, better utilizing document structure, improving generation, and replicating recent models with an open dataset. Advancing techniques in these areas is suggested as critical future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Producing variations and subsets of the dataset based on different needs. For example, users may want smaller or filtered versions.

- Performing rigorous data auditing and bias analysis. The authors suggest the transparent nature of OBELICS could support studies on unintended biases in large web datasets.

- Exploring societal impacts and ethical considerations of large multimodal models trained on web data. The authors note concerns about privacy, consent, and bias that should be investigated.

- Comparing models trained on different types of multimodal data, like OBELICS vs. image-caption data. The authors show initial comparisons but more could be done.

In summary, the authors propose leveraging the scale and open nature of OBELICS to support research on larger multimodal models, new applications to other modalities, improved data curation, auditing and analysis of social impacts.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces OBELICS, a new open web-scale filtered dataset of multimodal documents for training large vision and language models. The dataset contains 141 million web pages extracted from Common Crawl, along with 353 million associated images. To create OBELICS, the authors first collected a large number of raw HTML files from Common Crawl dumps. They simplified and cleaned these HTML files using strategies like tag unwrapping, node removal, and modification of specific nodes. The simplified HTML files were then transformed into structured multimodal web documents consisting of interleaved text paragraphs and images, while preserving the original structure of the web pages. Multiple filters were applied at the node, paragraph, and document levels to remove low-quality or irrelevant content. Additional responsible filtering steps were taken to exclude opted-out images, remove NSFW content, and extensively deduplicate the data. In total, the resulting OBELICS dataset contains 115 billion text tokens, providing a new large-scale open resource to enable research into multimodal models trained on documents rather than isolated image-text pairs.
