# [OBELICS: An Open Web-Scale Filtered Dataset of Interleaved Image-Text   Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16527)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper aims to address is how to create a high-quality, large-scale, open dataset of multimodal documents to support training more capable multimodal AI models. Specifically, the key aspects the paper focuses on are:- How to extract and filter a massive amount of web documents to create a dataset of multimodal documents that interleave images and long-form text.- Documenting the dataset creation process in detail, including collection, filtering, and responsible data practices. - Analyzing the resulting dataset to shed light on its properties and content.- Demonstrating the viability of the dataset by training multimodal models on it and evaluating their performance.The overall goal is to provide the community with a new open benchmark dataset that can enable further progress in multimodal AI, akin to how other large datasets like ImageNet or SQuAD have driven vision and language research. The paper highlights the need for such a dataset, provides a methodology for its construction, analyzes its characteristics, and shows its utility through trained models.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to create an open, large-scale, high-quality dataset of multimodal documents to support training advanced multimodal models. Specifically, the authors aim to:- Collect a large dataset of multimodal documents by extracting text and images from Common Crawl web crawl data.- Apply careful filtering and processing to the raw HTML data to extract high-quality multimodal documents while removing undesirable content. - Release the resulting dataset openly to support research and development of multimodal models.- Demonstrate the viability of the dataset by training multimodal models on it and evaluating performance on standard benchmarks.The key hypothesis is that a thoughtfully constructed dataset of multimodal documents, orders of magnitude larger than previous options, will enable more capable multimodal models. The paper details the methodology to create such a dataset and provides experiments validating its usefulness.In summary, the core research question is how to build an open, large-scale dataset of multimodal documents to advance multimodal AI capabilities, which the authors address through the design and release of the OBELICS dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of OBELICS, an open web-scale filtered dataset of multimodal documents. Specifically:- The paper describes the process of creating a large-scale dataset of 141 million multimodal web documents containing 353 million images by extracting and filtering webpages from Common Crawl. - It provides details on the filtering strategies and steps taken to extract high-quality multimodal documents while removing undesirable content. This includes image filtering, paragraph filtering, document filtering, and additional deduplication.- The authors analyze the dataset contents through perplexity analysis, topic modeling, and manual inspection. This sheds light on the diversity of topics and quality of the documents.- To demonstrate the viability of the dataset, the authors train multimodal models of 9 billion and 80 billion parameters named IDEFICS. These models achieve competitive performance on various multimodal benchmarks compared to other large models.- The dataset creation methodology and filtering techniques are comprehensive and aim to produce a high-quality corpus. The release of this large-scale open dataset enables further research on training multimodal models.In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and release of OBELICS, a large-scale open dataset of curated multimodal documents to support training the next generation of multimodal models. The paper details the careful crafting of this dataset and shows it is a viable alternative to closed datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of OBELICS, an open web-scale dataset of 141 million multimodal documents extracted from the web. The key highlights are:- OBELICS contains 141 million web documents with 353 million associated images, providing 115 billion text tokens. This makes it one of the largest open multimodal document datasets.- The paper documents the careful process of extracting and filtering multimodal web documents from Common Crawl snapshots. This includes HTML simplification, text and image filtering, and responsible deduplication.- Analysis of OBELICS shows it has high textual quality based on perplexity, covers diverse topics based on LDA modeling, and mostly contains news articles based on top domains.- To demonstrate the viability of the dataset, the authors train IDEFICS, a multimodal model reaching 80B parameters, on OBELICS plus other data. IDEFICS achieves competitive performance compared to models trained on private multimodal document datasets.- The dataset creation process balances scale and quality while addressing ethical concerns around consent and undesirable content.In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and release of a large-scale, open multimodal document dataset to support research on vision-and-language models. The paper provides transparency into the dataset creation and demonstrates its utility by training competitive multimodal models.
