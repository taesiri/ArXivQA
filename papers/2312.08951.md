# [Multi-Scene Generalized Trajectory Global Graph Solver with Composite   Nodes for Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08951)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes CoNo-Link, a novel framework for multi-object tracking that constructs a partially connected graph with composite nodes to enable effective modeling of long-range temporal information. It first uses a NodeNet to generate detection nodes and trajectory nodes with initial lengths, capturing objects and short tracklets. Then it establishes candidate connections between these nodes based on motion and appearance cues. This results in a sparse graph structure that retains meaningful links while reducing computational costs. CoNo-Link processes this graph using a message-passing GNN with an edge re-learning strategy, allowing it to gradually refine trajectories by fusing sub-tracklets. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on MOT and DanceTrack benchmarks. The core ideas are using composite nodes and partial connections to build an efficient graph domain, and a GNN solver that associates objects globally. This provides a new direction for tackling long videos in graph-based tracking.
