## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Image restoration (IR) aims to convert degraded, low-quality images into high-quality versions. Recent IR methods using generative priors struggle to further improve visual quality due to constraints on model scale. 

Proposed Solution - SUPIR:
- Proposes a breakthrough IR method called SUPIR that harnesses massive model scaling (2.6B parameters), advanced generative prior, and multi-modality.

- Uses Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) as a powerful generative prior. Designs a large-scale adaptor (600M parameters) to steer SDXL for image restoration.

- Collects 20M high-quality, high resolution images to train the model. Images have descriptive text annotations to enable textual control of restoration.  

- Incorporates negative quality images and prompts during training to further enhance visual quality. Proposes restoration-guided sampling to ensure fidelity.

Main Contributions:  
- Pioneers model scaling for image restoration, setting new benchmarks for restoration quality.

- Exceptional performance across various restoration tasks, especially for complex real-world degradations.

- Novel capacity for flexible control over restoration through textual prompts.

- Comprehensive strategies including architecture design, data collection, training techniques, and sampling methods to effectively scale up the model.

In summary, the paper pushes the frontiers of image restoration via scaling, generative priors and multi-modality, allowing enhanced quality and controllability. The techniques and analysis provide a framework to spur future advancements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces SUPIR, a pioneering image restoration method empowered by scaling up a generative diffusion model to 2.6 billion parameters, training it on 20 million high-quality images with descriptive text annotations, and designing specialized techniques to steer the model for controlled, high-fidelity restoration guided by textual prompts.
