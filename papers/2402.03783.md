# [Exploring Low-Resource Medical Image Classification with Weakly   Supervised Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03783)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most advances in medical image recognition rely on manual annotations by clinicians, which is expensive and scarce. This low-resource problem can be alleviated by leveraging large-scale pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP. However, applying such models requires carefully designing textual prompts for each dataset, which still depends heavily on clinicians. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes MedPrompt, a weakly supervised prompt learning framework to automatically generate high-quality medical prompts. It has two key components:

1) An unsupervised pre-trained vision-language model using 600K unlabeled medical images and reports, learning transferable representations by matching image-text similarities.

2) A prompt generator with a lightweight neural network and learnable context/class embeddings. It's trained using only class labels to guide the learning of class vectors. The context vectors are learned without manual supervision.  

Main Contributions:

1) First model to automatically generate medical prompts, freeing clinicians from time-consuming manual design.

2) Utilizes large-scale unlabeled medical images/texts for pre-training and transfers representations to downstream tasks via automatic prompts.

3) Outperforms all hand-crafted prompt baselines in fully supervised learning on four medical datasets. Also achieves better zero-shot performance in three datasets.

4) With only 4/16 labeled samples, outperforms all hand-crafted prompts in zero-shot/fully supervised learning respectively.  

5) Lightweight prompt generator can be embedded into any network architecture.

In summary, the proposed MedPrompt framework enables end-to-end low-cost medical image classification by reducing dependence on manual annotations and prompt design by clinicians. Both the pre-training and automatic prompt generation are key to its effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a weakly supervised prompt learning method called MedPrompt that can automatically generate medical text prompts to assist in transferring pre-trained vision-language models to downstream tasks like medical image classification, alleviating the reliance on manual prompt design by clinicians.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It proposes a weakly supervised prompt learning framework called MedPrompt, which can automatically generate high-quality medical text prompts to assist in transferring pre-trained vision-language models to downstream clinical tasks such as medical image classification.

2. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first model that can automatically generate medical prompts, freeing clinicians from manually designing prompts which is time-consuming and expert-dependent. 

3. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot and zero-shot classification of unseen classes on four medical image classification benchmark datasets.

4. The prompt learning module used to automatically generate prompts is lightweight, accounting for only 0.0480% parameters and 0.0007% FLOPs of the entire model, thus having the potential to be embedded into any network architecture.

5. The weakly supervised learning approach adopted, which only uses class labels rather than exact labels to train the prompt generator, effectively alleviates the problem of expensive and limited manual labeling and excessive reliance on domain experts in the low-resource medical field.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an end-to-end framework to automatically generate medical prompts in a weakly supervised manner, which achieves excellent few-shot and zero-shot classification performance on medical images while reducing reliance on manual annotation and prompt design by clinicians.

The paper proposes a weakly supervised prompt learning method called MedPrompt to automatically generate medical text prompts for pre-trained vision-language models. The goal is to support medical image classification tasks, especially in low-resource scenarios, with capabilities like few-shot learning and zero-shot inference. The method only requires image class labels for training and does not need manually annotated prompt text. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on multiple medical imaging datasets for classification. The lightweight prompt module has potential for integration into various network architectures.

In summary, the key focus areas are weakly supervised and automated prompt learning to enable sample-efficient transfer learning on medical images using vision-language models. Enabling classification in low-data regimes is a major goal.
