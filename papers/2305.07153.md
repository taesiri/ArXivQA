# [Towards best practices in AGI safety and governance: A survey of expert   opinion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07153)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question this paper seeks to address is: What safety and governance practices do leading experts think AGI labs should implement? The authors surveyed 51 experts from AGI labs, academia, and civil society organizations. They presented these experts with 50 statements about potential safety and governance practices that AGI labs could implement. The experts were then asked to indicate their level of agreement with each statement. The central goal was to gauge expert opinions on what AGI labs should do to safely develop artificial general intelligence (AGI). The results provide insights into areas of consensus and disagreement among experts regarding best practices for AGI labs. This can help inform efforts by the industry, regulators, and standard-setting bodies to establish safety protocols, regulations, and standards for organizations pursuing AGI development.In summary, the key research question is focused on eliciting expert opinions on safety and governance best practices that should be implemented by companies/labs trying to develop AGI. The authors aggregate these expert views to provide guidance on emerging consensus in this important area.
