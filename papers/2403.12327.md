# [GT-Rain Single Image Deraining Challenge Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12327)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Images degraded by weather conditions like rain can negatively impact computer vision models which are typically trained on clear images. Therefore, single image de-weathering is an important capability to enable robust computer vision.  
- However, existing techniques are limited due to low-quality datasets. It's impossible to capture the same real-world scene with and without rain. Simulated data fails to model complex rain effects.

Solution - The GT-RAIN Dataset:  
- Contains 31.5K pairs of real rainy images and corresponding ground truth clean images captured closely in time when rain stopped.
- Images show diverse, real-world conditions like cities, nature, various rain densities, etc. Strict filtering used to remove issues like motion between pairs.

GT-RAIN Challenge:
- 275 participants competed to develop best single image deraining model when trained on GT-RAIN dataset. Additional datasets allowed. 
- Quantitative evaluation done on new test set with 15 scenes and 4500 images. Teams ranked based on average of PSNR and SSIM metric ranks.

Key Methods:
- Most methods were transformer-based, building on top of models like Uformer and Restormer. 
- Top team used two-stage approach with video deraining to generate pseudo GT pairs for fine-tuning. Customized for GT-RAIN dataset statistics.  
- Second team built multi-module pipeline with specialized Restormer variants, median filtering, weighted averaging and brightness adjustment.

In summary, the paper introduced a novel, high-quality dataset of real-world rainy/clean image pairs and used it to conduct a challenge pushing state-of-the-art in single image deraining through innovative techniques.
