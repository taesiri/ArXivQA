# [Artificial intelligence to automate the systematic review of scientific   literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10917)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a survey of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques proposed in the last 15 years to automate the systematic literature review (SLR) process. A SLR is a secondary study that follows a rigorous methodology to analyze scientific literature on a topic, in order to synthesize current knowledge, discuss existing proposals, and identify trends. Performing a SLR manually is time-consuming and costly. The paper focuses on analyzing AI techniques that can automate the different tasks in the SLR methodology, which is divided into planning, conducting, and reporting phases.

The key research questions addressed in the survey are: which SLR phases have been automated using AI, which are the AI techniques used, and to what extent is human involvement required in AI-based SLR automation. To answer these questions, the authors performed a systematic search that retrieved over 9,000 papers, finally selecting 34 relevant primary studies. 

The findings reveal that most works focus on automating the conducting phase, specifically the selection of primary studies from a pool of candidate papers. This task has been addressed with machine learning techniques, mainly supervised learning (e.g. SVM) and active learning. The planning and reporting phases have received less attention. Regarding AI techniques, machine learning is predominant, while other areas like knowledge representation and natural language processing are less common. In terms of human intervention, most approaches are fully automated, with some active learning methods envisioning a human oracle to provide labels.  

The paper identifies several open issues and challenges, including the need to automate undiscovered tasks, apply alternative AI techniques, use more complete information, increase human-AI cooperation, address interpretability and reproducibility, compare performance across fields, and promote open science.

In summary, this paper provides a thorough analysis of the state-of-the-art in AI-based SLR automation, the techniques applied so far, and open research lines to continue advancing in the field. The survey responds to the lack of studies evaluating the potential benefits of AI automation and the challenges it presents.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a survey of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques proposed in the last 15 years to help researchers conduct systematic analyses of scientific literature, focused on automating the tasks involved in a systematic literature review (SLR). 

Specifically, the paper:

- Analyzes 34 primary studies on using AI to automate SLR tasks. It classifies them by the SLR phase(s) automated, the AI techniques used, the level of human involvement, and other characteristics.

- Discusses which SLR phases are currently supported by AI, the most commonly used AI techniques, and the extent of human involvement in automated SLR tasks based on the analyzed studies.

- Identifies open issues and challenges related to the predominance of certain tasks, the need to explore additional AI techniques, increasing human involvement, comparing performance across fields, reproducibility, and other aspects.

In summary, it provides a comprehensive overview of research into using AI to automate SLRs, the current state of the field, and future directions and challenges. The survey serves as a useful reference for researchers interested in developing or adopting AI techniques to accelerate conducting systematic literature reviews.
