# [AutoMMLab: Automatically Generating Deployable Models from Language   Instructions for Computer Vision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15351)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "AutoMMLab: Automatically Generating Deployable Models from Language Instructions for Computer Vision Tasks":

Problem:
Automated machine learning (AutoML) aims to automate the machine learning development process to make AI more accessible. However, most AutoML systems focus on optimizing specific steps rather than the full pipeline. There lacks an end-to-end AutoML system that can automatically produce deployable CV models solely based on natural language instructions from users without requiring manual effort or AI expertise.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes AutoMMLab, an innovative LLM-powered AutoML system that achieves end-to-end automation in the model production workflow for CV tasks using language instructions. It consists of 5 key modules:

1. Request Understanding Module: Proposes RU-LLaMA to parse user requests into structured configs using a fine-tuned LLaMA model.

2. Data Selection Module: Automatically selects suitable training data from a built-in dataset zoo based on parsed configs.

3. Model Selection Module: Chooses the optimal model meeting user constraints from a model zoo.

4. Model Training & HPO Module: Proposes HPO-LLaMA, a novel LLM-based hyperparameter optimizer to find optimal hyperparameters.

5. Model Deployment Module: Leverages MMDeploy to deploy trained models based on hardware specifications.

By connecting these modules using LLMs, AutoMMLab enables non-experts to easily build customized CV models for tasks like classification, detection, segmentation and keypoint estimation simply through natural language instructions.

Main Contributions:

- First end-to-end LLM-empowered AutoML system for prompt-based CV model production 

- Proposes RU-LLaMA for request understanding and HPO-LLaMA for efficient hyperparameter optimization

- Constructs comprehensive dataset and model zoos to facilitate automation

- Develops LAMP benchmark to evaluate AutoML systems on end-to-end prompt-based model training

The proposed AutoMMLab system significantly advances the automation and accessibility of machine learning, allowing non-experts to unlock AI capabilities simply through language.
