# [FRAPPÃ‰: A Post-Processing Framework for Group Fairness Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02592)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called $\ours$ for post-processing models to improve group fairness. The key idea is to train the post-processing method using the penalized optimization objective of an in-processing technique. This allows the resulting post-processing approach to match the performance of in-processing methods on the fairness-accuracy tradeoff, while also enjoying the flexibility and efficiency benefits of post-processing. A theoretical result shows that the in-processing and post-processing objectives lead to identical solutions. Experiments demonstrate that $\ours$ post-processing matches multiple state-of-the-art in-processing methods across datasets and fairness definitions. Unlike prior post-processing techniques, the proposed approach does not require the sensitive attributes at inference time and can handle continuous sensitive features. Additionally, $\ours$ mitigates a newly uncovered failure mode of in-processing methods in the small sensitive data regime. The post-processing transformation is analyzed and shown to depend on both the sensitive attribute and features predictive of outcomes. Overall, the $\ours$ framework enables harnessing the complementary strengths of both in-processing and post-processing for group fairness.
