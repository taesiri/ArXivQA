# [FRAPPÉ: A Post-Processing Framework for Group Fairness Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02592)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called $\ours$ for post-processing models to improve group fairness. The key idea is to train the post-processing method using the penalized optimization objective of an in-processing technique. This allows the resulting post-processing approach to match the performance of in-processing methods on the fairness-accuracy tradeoff, while also enjoying the flexibility and efficiency benefits of post-processing. A theoretical result shows that the in-processing and post-processing objectives lead to identical solutions. Experiments demonstrate that $\ours$ post-processing matches multiple state-of-the-art in-processing methods across datasets and fairness definitions. Unlike prior post-processing techniques, the proposed approach does not require the sensitive attributes at inference time and can handle continuous sensitive features. Additionally, $\ours$ mitigates a newly uncovered failure mode of in-processing methods in the small sensitive data regime. The post-processing transformation is analyzed and shown to depend on both the sensitive attribute and features predictive of outcomes. Overall, the $\ours$ framework enables harnessing the complementary strengths of both in-processing and post-processing for group fairness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework to transform any in-processing method for group fairness into a flexible and practical post-processing procedure that matches the performance of its in-processing counterpart while overcoming limitations of prior post-processing approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a general framework to transform any in-processing method for group fairness (with a penalized objective) into a post-processing procedure. The resulting post-processing method matches or even surpasses the fairness-error trade-off of the in-processing counterpart, while also overcoming some limitations of prior post-processing approaches. Specifically, the post-processing method obtained with this framework:

- Does not require access to the sensitive attributes at inference time.
- Can work with continuous sensitive attributes, unlike most prior post-processing techniques. 
- Enjoys the typical advantages of post-processing such as flexibility, computational efficiency, and not needing access to the model training pipeline.

In summary, the proposed framework allows constructing post-processing methods that harness the advantages of both in-processing and prior post-processing approaches for group fairness.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a general framework to transform any in-processing method with a penalized objective into a post-processing procedure. Can you explain in detail the intuition behind this framework and how it is designed to overcome the limitations of prior post-processing approaches?

2. The paper shows theoretically that the proposed post-processing method matches the performance of the in-processing counterpart. Walk through the key steps in the proof of Proposition 1 and discuss its implications.

9. Analyze the limitations and broader impact discussed in the conclusion. What ethical considerations remain regarding algorithmic fairness interventions?

10. The paper focuses on group fairness notions. Discuss how the core ideas could be extended to other fairness notions like individual fairness. What adaptations would need to be made?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In-processing methods for algorithmic fairness change the training process to encourage fairness but have limitations like requiring access to training data/pipelines, being computationally expensive, and needing sensitive attributes at inference time. 
- Existing post-processing methods are more flexible but perform worse in fairness-accuracy tradeoff, also require sensitive attributes at inference, and cannot handle continuous sensitive attributes.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a framework (FRAPPE) to transform any in-processing method with a penalized objective into a post-processing method. 
- The resulting post-processing method matches or exceeds the in-processing method's fairness-accuracy tradeoff.
- It does not require sensitive attributes at inference time or for the sensitive attributes to be discrete.

Key Technical Details:
- Show a connection between in-processing penalized objectives and bilevel optimization objectives used in post-processing. The two problems have identical solutions.
- Propose adding an additive correction term to the model's outputs at inference time, trained using the in-processing penalized objective.
- Achieve state-of-the-art tradeoffs on several datasets by transforming different in-processing methods into post-processing.

Main Contributions:
- A general framework to transform in-processing methods into post-processing methods that matches or improves on their fairness-accuracy tradeoff.
- First post-processing method that can handle continuous sensitive attributes. 
- Does not require sensitive attributes at inference time.
- Reveals and mitigates a limitation of in-processing methods in the small sample regime.

The paper shows strong empirical performance and provides both theoretical and intuitive justifications for the proposed framework.
