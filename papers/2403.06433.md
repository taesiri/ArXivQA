## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing pillar-based methods for LiDAR 3D object detection are computationally efficient but have inferior accuracy compared to other techniques like voxel-based encoding or PointNet++. This is because pillar-based methods compress all the points within a pillar into a single feature vector, failing to capture the fine-grained spatial and temporal distributions of points within each pillar. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel pillar feature encoding method called Fine-Grained Pillar Feature Encoding (FG-PFE) that captures the fine-grained point distributions within each pillar to improve detection accuracy. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce Spatio-Temporal Virtual (STV) grids to divide each pillar into vertical, temporal and horizontal virtual grids to capture point distributions in these dimensions. 

2) Vertical PFE (V-PFE): Divides each pillar vertically into virtual grids and encodes points in each grid separately using mean pooling. The grids are then aggregated using a learnt weighting.

3) Temporal PFE (T-PFE): Divides points temporally based on LiDAR scan order and encodes points from each scan separately.  

4) Horizontal PFE (H-PFE): Uses multiple horizontal pillar grids with different offsets to capture multiple BEV perspectives.

5) Attentive Pillar Aggregation module to combine the above 3 pillar features using channel attention.

6) Introduce an objectness prediction loss to supervise each module to predict foreground vs background grids.

Main Contributions:

1) A novel fine-grained pillar feature encoding method to capture rich spatial-temporal information within each pillar, enhancing detection accuracy.

2) Spatio-temporal virtual grids to finely quantize points in vertical, temporal and horizontal dimensions within each pillar. 

3) Individual V-PFE, T-PFE and H-PFE modules to encode points using these virtual grids.

4) Experiments show FG-PFE gives 3.7% NDS improvement over PointPillars baseline with minor overhead, highlighting its effectiveness.
