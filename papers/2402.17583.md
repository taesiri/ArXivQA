# [FaultProfIT: Hierarchical Fault Profiling of Incident Tickets in   Large-scale Cloud Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17583)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In large-scale cloud systems, production incidents are inevitable and can cause huge economic losses. To prevent recurring incidents, reliability engineers perform postmortem analysis to categorize incident faults into fault patterns.
- However, manual fault pattern profiling is labor-intensive, error-prone, and results in skewed fault pattern distributions. This limits the reliability improvements achieved through postmortem insights. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FaultProfIT, an automated tool to profile fault patterns from incident tickets using hierarchical text classification and contrastive learning.
- It extracts incident context from tickets and feeds it into a MacBERT encoder to obtain representation vectors. 
- A Graphormer model encodes the hierarchical taxonomy of fault patterns into vectors.
- Using attention weights and gumbel softmax, positive samples are constructed from incident context to retain original labels.
- A contrastive loss pulls positive samples closer while pushing negative samples apart to learn hierarchy-aware incident representations.
- These representations are classified into fault patterns using binary cross-entropy loss.

Main Contributions:
- FaultProfIT is the first automated approach for hierarchical fault pattern profiling of cloud incident tickets.
- It leverages hierarchy-guided contrastive learning to effectively exploit the hierarchical and textual features of fault patterns.
- Extensive evaluation on production incidents shows FaultProfIT achieves 78.3% F1-score, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. 
- Analysis verifies the benefits of contrastive learning and hierarchy encoding.
- FaultProfIT has been deployed for 6 months at a major cloud provider, analyzing 10,000+ tickets and revealing fault trends for reliability improvements.

In summary, the paper tackles the critical problem of automating fault pattern profiling during incident postmortem through a novel deep learning approach. The solution advances the state-of-the-art and provides significant value in practice.
