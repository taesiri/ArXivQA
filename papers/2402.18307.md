# [Feature Denoising For Low-Light Instance Segmentation Using Weighted   Non-Local Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18307)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Instance segmentation is an important computer vision task with applications across many sectors. However, there has been limited research on instance segmentation under low-light conditions, which is challenging due to issues like noise, color distortions, and reduced contrast. Existing methods typically require complex pre-processing pipelines involving low-light image enhancement (LLIE).

Proposed Solution:  
This paper proposes an end-to-end framework for low-light instance segmentation based on Mask R-CNN. The key idea is to integrate weighted non-local (NL) blocks into the feature extractor backbone for inherent feature denoising. This eliminates the need for aligned ground truth images or separate LLIE pre-processing. 

The NL blocks perform non-local means denoising on the feature maps. Additional learnable weights are introduced to let the network adapt to real-world noise characteristics at different feature scales.

The framework is trained on a synthetic low-light dataset generated from COCO using a realistic pipeline. Only the backbone is fine-tuned to specifically learn to denoise features.

Main Contributions:
- End-to-end low-light instance segmentation without complex pre-processing 
- Integration of weighted NL blocks into backbone for feature denoising
- Learnable weights to handle noise characteristics at different feature scales
- Training on synthetic low-light data without requiring aligned ground truth 

Results:
- Outperforms vanilla Mask R-CNN by +10.0 AP
- Further +1.0 AP gain from weighted NL blocks 
- Handles smaller obscured objects better than baselines
- Outperforms two-stage methods with separate LLIE pre-processing

The method enhances the applicability of instance segmentation to real-world low-light scenarios across sectors like autonomous driving, surveillance etc. Avenues for future work include improving small object performance, enhancing other components like the FPN, and evaluation on real low-light datasets.
