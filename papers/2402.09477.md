# [PANORAMIA: Privacy Auditing of Machine Learning Models without   Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09477)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing approaches for auditing the privacy guarantees of machine learning (ML) models have some key limitations:
1) They require retraining the model multiple times, which is computationally expensive, especially for large models. 
2) They require control over the training pipeline, such as adding canary inputs or measuring gradients during training. This prevents auditing models where you only have black-box access.
3) They require access to both training data (members) and comparable data not in the training set (non-members). This data may not always be available.

Proposed Solution - PANORAMIA:
The paper proposes a new auditing scheme called PANORAMIA that addresses the above limitations. The key ideas are:

1) Use a generative model to synthesize non-member data points instead of requiring access to real non-members. The generative model is trained on a subset of the training data.

2) Perform membership inference attacks using the synthesized non-members along with real members from the training set. This quantifies privacy leakage without retraining the target model.

3) Compare attack accuracy to a baseline classifier that predicts membership using only the input data. This accounts for detectability of synthetic data. 

4) Derive privacy guarantees based on the gap between attack accuracy and baseline accuracy. No assumptions are made about the training process.

Contributions:
- First auditing scheme that works with black-box access to a model and requires no retraining.
- Can audit complex ML pipelines where no single actor controls the full pipeline or training data.
- Enables participants in collaborative learning to audit shared models. 
- Allows users of ML models to retroactively measure privacy loss.
- Empirically evaluates the approach on image, text and tabular data. Quantifies privacy leakage comparable to prior art.

In summary, PANORAMIA enables practical privacy auditing in many real-world scenarios by eliminating key constraints around retraining, access to training process, and availability of non-member data. The empirical results demonstrate its ability to provide meaningful privacy guarantees.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces PANORAMIA, a new privacy auditing scheme for machine learning models that quantifies privacy leakage using membership inference attacks with generated "non-member" data, without requiring retraining of the model or control over its training process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing PANORAMIA, a new privacy auditing scheme for machine learning models that relies on membership inference attacks using generated data as "non-members". Key aspects are:

- It quantifies privacy leakage of ML models without needing control over the training process or retraining the model, only requiring access to a subset of the training data. This makes it applicable in settings like federated learning or auditing models after deployment.

- It introduces using a generative model, trained on a subset of the training data, to synthesize "non-member" data points. These are then used along with real training data to mount a membership inference attack and estimate privacy leakage.

- It adapts the theory of differential privacy audits to account for the use of generated non-member data points instead of real data points coming from an independent distribution.

- It demonstrates empirically that the approach can detect meaningful privacy leakage across modalities like images, text, and tabular data. The leakage found is comparable to state-of-the-art methods that require model retraining or access to real non-members.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling practical privacy auditing without model retraining by using generated data in the membership inference attack. This makes privacy auditing possible in new settings previously inaccessible to existing auditing schemes.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Privacy auditing - The paper introduces a new privacy auditing scheme called PANORAMIA that can quantify privacy leakage of ML models without needing to retrain them.

- Membership inference attacks (MIA) - The auditing scheme relies on using membership inference attacks with generated "non-member" data points. The attack performance is related to privacy loss.

- Differential privacy (DP) - The privacy definition used to formalize and quantify privacy leakage. The paper adapts DP theory to analyze the auditing scheme.

- Machine learning (ML) models - The paper evaluates the auditing scheme across different types of ML models, including image classification, language models, and tabular data models. 

- Data generation - A key aspect is using generated synthetic data points as "non-members" in the membership inference attacks, instead of requiring real non-member data.

- Privacy leakage - The auditing scheme aims to quantify the privacy leakage of ML models, i.e. how much training data can be inferred from the model. More leakage implies lower privacy.

So in summary, key terms are privacy auditing, membership inference attacks, differential privacy, machine learning models, data generation, and privacy leakage. The core focus is auditing privacy of ML without retraining.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using generated "non-member" data points rather than real non-members or shadow models for training membership inference attacks. What are the key benefits and potential drawbacks of this approach compared to prior membership inference attack strategies?

2. The paper defines a new metric called "c-closeness" to quantify the similarity between the distribution of generated non-members and the true data distribution. How does this metric relate to the privacy analysis? What are some ways this metric could be improved or alternatives that could be used?

3. The baseline classifier plays an important role in the proposed method by estimating distinguishing ability between real and generated data not due to privacy leakage. What approaches are used in the paper to optimize the baseline classifier and why is this critical?

4. The privacy analysis adapts results from prior work on auditing differential privacy with one training round. What are the key technical changes needed in the analysis to account for the use of generated non-member data?

5. What practical benefits does the proposed auditing scheme provide in terms of not requiring access to the full training data or retraining models? In what real-world scenarios could this be especially useful?

6. The estimated privacy parameter tilde(epsilon) does not provide a pure lower bound on epsilon-differential privacy. What disclaimers or additional analysis would be needed to rigorously interpret the meaning of tilde(epsilon)? 

7. How does the proposed method account for potential deficiencies in the quality of generated data? Could failure modes arise if generated data quality is too low?

8. What approaches are used for training generative models across modalities like images, text, and tabular data? How transferable is the overall pipeline across these domains?

9. The experiments demonstrate non-trivial privacy leakage estimates across modalities. But how could the attack power and theoretical privacy guarantees be further improved?

10. The method does not require retraining models which differs from prior work. What modifications to the privacy analysis would be needed to turn estimates into true lower bounds on privacy loss?
