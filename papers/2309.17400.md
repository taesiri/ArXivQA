## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing improved techniques for reward fine-tuning of diffusion models. The authors propose DRaFT as a simple and efficient approach, but believe there is room for further innovations in this area. They hope their work will inspire new methods.

- Scaling up reward fine-tuning to larger models and datasets. The authors demonstrate promising results but only apply DRaFT to Stable Diffusion 1.4. Applying reward fine-tuning to larger models like Stable Diffusion 2 could further improve image quality.

- Developing better reward functions that align well with human aesthetic judgements but avoid reward hacking failure cases. The authors point out deficiencies in existing rewards revealed by reward hacking during fine-tuning, and suggest improved rewards will aid progress.

- Improving text-to-image alignment with rewards based on captioning models rather than CLIP similarity. The authors tried a CLIP similarity reward but found image quality decreased over training. A captioning model may work better.

- Investigating connections to reinforcement learning methods like DPG. The authors discuss how DPG could incorporate reward gradients but found it currently underperforms DRaFT. Improving DPG could provide a useful hybrid approach.

In summary, the authors point to many exciting opportunities for future work in reward learning for diffusion models, both on the methodology side and in terms of applications. Their proposed techniques help accelerate research in this emerging area.
