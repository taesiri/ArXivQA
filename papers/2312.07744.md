# [How Does Perception Affect Safety: New Metrics and Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07744)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The relationship between perception metrics (e.g. detection rate, quality, latency) and robot performance metrics is unclear, making it difficult to develop and tune perception algorithms. 
- There is a tradeoff between accuracy and speed for perception algorithms that is not well understood.
- Many papers focus only on accuracy metrics not speed, but speed is critical for real-time robotics applications.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a methodology to model robot performance metrics based on perception metrics. Use safety metrics for human-robot collaboration (HRC) as a case study.
- Propose two new metrics - Critical Collision Probability (CCP) and Average Collision Probability (ACP) - to link perception to HRC safety.
- Develop an "attentive processing" strategy to focus computations on key regions of interest in perception input, enabling faster processing with minimal accuracy loss.

Contributions:
- Model relating perception metrics to HRC safety metrics.
- Two new safety metrics - CCP and ACP - incorporating perception speed/accuracy. 
- Attentive processing strategy to selectively process important perceptual features, reducing inference time by 30% with little accuracy loss.
- Demonstrates importance of real-time speed as well as accuracy for robotics perception.
- Addresses lack of understanding between perception and robot metrics, accuracy vs speed tradeoff, and need to consider speed metrics.

In summary, the paper proposes a methodology to model robot metrics using perception metrics, new safety metrics for HRC, and an attentive processing strategy to focus computations on regions of interest. Together these contributions highlight the need to consider speed, accuracy and their tradeoffs for real-time robotics perception.
