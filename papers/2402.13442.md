# [CoFRIDA: Self-Supervised Fine-Tuning for Human-Robot Co-Painting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13442)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing robot painting/drawing systems only allow human input at the start and don't support interactive co-creation during the process. 
- Pre-trained text-to-image models don't understand robot constraints and abilities, causing a "semantic sim2real gap". They also can't perform "canvas continuation" to add to existing drawings without overwriting.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce CoFRIDA, a framework for human-robot collaborative painting that allows iterative co-creation.
- Propose a self-supervised fine-tuning method to adapt pre-trained text-to-image models to: 1) generate images within robot's constraints, 2) perform canvas continuation without overwriting existing content.
- Fine-tuning dataset is created by using FRIDA system to make full/partial simulations of images from text-image datasets.

Key Contributions:
- Introduce "canvas continuation", a new image editing task for human-robot co-creation where robot must add content without destroying existing work.
- Propose CoFRIDA system and self-supervised fine-tuning method to enable iterative human-robot collaborative painting/drawing.
- Show fine-tuning can successfully encode robot constraints into foundation models to reduce sim2real gap.
- Demonstrate CoFRIDA paintings better match text prompts than baselines in user studies.
- CoFRIDA system is open source and available on multiple robot platforms.

In summary, the paper introduces canvas continuation for human-robot co-creation and uses a self-supervised fine-tuning approach to adapt pre-trained models for this task while respecting real-world robot constraints, enabling higher quality co-painting.
