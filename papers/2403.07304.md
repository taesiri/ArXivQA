# [Lumen: Unleashing Versatile Vision-Centric Capabilities of Large   Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07304)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing large multimodal models (LMMs) focus on high-level visual content comprehension and reasoning, but lack capabilities for fundamental visual perception tasks like object detection, instance segmentation and pose estimation. Recent works adapt these tasks' outputs to fit the text generation format of LMMs, but this overlooks tasks' intrinsic characteristics and hinders learning of visual perception. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Lumen, an LMM architecture that decouples task-agnostic and task-specific learning. It has two stages:

1) Task-Agnostic Matching Stage: Unify tasks by reformulating them into a matching problem between instruction text and image regions, outputting a heatmap. The heatmap indicates cross-modal matching probabilities regardless of end task.

2) Task-Specific Decoding Stage: Route the shared heatmap representation to lightweight specialized decoders to generate task outputs (boxes, masks, points, etc.). The routing is based on a task token predicted in stage 1.

By concentrating firstly on multimodal comprehension then specialized decoding, Lumen promotes learning of visual perception capabilities.

Main Contributions:
1) Propose Lumen, an LMM architecture that decouples task-agnostic and task-specific learning to enhance vision capabilities.
2) Significantly expand capabilities of LMMs to tasks like detection, segmentation, pose estimation.
3) Outperform previous LMM methods on COCO detection by a large margin. Achieve comparable performance to specialist models on several tasks.
4) Demonstrate excellent generalization ability to unseen datasets and tasks in experiments.

In summary, the paper presents an effective way to unlock vision-centric capabilities in LMMs by decoupled training, outperforming previous works. The high versatility and generalization highlight Lumen's potential.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Lumen, a large multimodal model that decouples task-agnostic and task-specific learning to enhance versatile vision-centric capabilities of language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Lumen, a large multimodal model architecture that decouples the learning of vision-centric capabilities into task-agnostic and task-specific stages. Specifically:

1) In the task-agnostic stage, Lumen promotes fine-grained vision-language concept alignment by generating a shared representation (heatmap) indicating cross-modal matching probabilities between textual concepts and image regions. 

2) In the task-specific stage, the shared heatmap representation is flexibly routed to lightweight task decoders to generate outputs in diverse formats (e.g. boxes, masks, points) for tasks like object detection, segmentation and pose estimation.

3) Compared to prior works that conform vision tasks to language model outputs, Lumen's decoupled design allows concentrating on multimodal comprehension while easily scaling up to more vision tasks with minimal modifications. Experiments show Lumen significantly outperforms existing LMM approaches on COCO detection and exhibits strong generalization ability.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the Lumen architecture that decouples task-agnostic and task-specific learning to efficiently unleash vision-centric capabilities of large multimodal models.
