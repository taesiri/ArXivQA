# [Imbalance in Regression Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Imbalance in classification data, where some classes are under-represented, is a well-known issue that causes models to perform poorly on minority classes.  
- The paper argues that imbalance in regression data has a similar detrimental effect on model performance, but this issue has been largely overlooked.
- Imbalanced regression data causes models to neglect capturing less common target values, instead only focusing on frequent target values. This results in poor performance on uncommon target values.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper formally defines the notion of "balance" for regression problems using a relevance measure Î¼ on the target domain. This generalizes existing definitions of balance for classification.
- Imbalance metrics are suggested, like Kolmogorov and Wasserstein distance between target distribution and relevance measure, that quantify degree of imbalance.
- Evaluations show high correlation between proposed imbalance metrics and model performance degradation on imbalanced data.

Key Contributions:
- First work highlighting and analyzing the overlooked issue of imbalance in regression.
- Formal definition of balance for regression using relevance measures, generalizing classification definition.  
- Definition of requirements and proposal of candidate metrics to quantify regression imbalance.
- Empirical demonstration of model performance degradation due to regression imbalance.

In summary, the paper makes the important argument that, akin to classification, regression performance suffers due to imbalanced target distributions. It takes first steps addressing this overlooked issue by formally defining and quantifying imbalance for regression problems. The insights lay the groundwork for developing more robust models and countermeasures for handling regression imbalance in the future.
