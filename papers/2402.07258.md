# [Data Quality Aware Approaches for Addressing Model Drift of Semantic   Segmentation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07258)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Semantic segmentation models suffer from "model drift" when deployed in real-world dynamic environments. Model performance degrades over time as new data is continuously added to update and retrain the models.

- Two main causes identified: (1) new data has different distribution or is of poorer quality compared to original training data; (2) new data fails to adequately represent the true underlying domain.

- Addressing model drift is critical for ensuring robustness and reliability of segmentation models when deployed in practice.  

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate two quality-aware strategies to handle model drift:
   1) Data quality assessment using Image Quality Assessment (IQA) metrics to select high quality data
   2) Data conditioning based on prior model knowledge - use feature vectors from existing models to select future data that aligns with prior knowledge

- For quality assessment, use BRISQUE, a referenceless IQA method, to quantify quality of images. Set threshold to distinguish high vs low quality.

- For data conditioning, train SVM on feature vectors from bottleneck layers of existing model to distinguish between true and false predictions. Use this to select compatible new data.

Contributions:
- First study to assess impact of data quality on model drift in segmentation using IQA metrics
- Novel feature learning approach to select data compatible with prior knowledge 
- Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate efficacy of quality-aware strategies in enhancing model performance over time

The paper emphasizes the significant role data quality and alignment with prior knowledge play in sustaining efficacy of AI models facing continuous updates, contributing to advancement of semantic segmentation.
