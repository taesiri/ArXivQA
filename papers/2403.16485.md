# [Real-time Model Predictive Control with Zonotope-Based Neural Networks   for Bipedal Social Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16485)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper addresses the challenge of enabling bipedal robots to navigate in dynamic human-crowded environments in a socially acceptable manner. Bipedal social navigation is difficult due to the complex dynamics of bipedal locomotion and the need to plan movements that are safe and do not disrupt the trajectories of surrounding pedestrians. However, this area remains largely unexplored.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a framework composed of two neural networks - a Pedestrian Prediction Network (PPN) and an Ego-agent Social Network (ESN). The PPN predicts the future reachable sets of surrounding pedestrians, represented as zonotopes. The ESN then plans a path for the ego bipedal robot, avoiding collisions with pedestrians while mimicking learned human trajectories. 

The framework integrates the ESN with a model predictive controller (ESN-MPC) for online footstep planning. The ESN-MPC sends optimal velocity and heading angle commands to a lower-level controller on the Digit biped, which tracks the trajectory through joint control.

Main Contributions:
- Novel PPN and ESN networks to predict pedestrian motions and plan ego robot trajectories as sequences of zonotopes.

- Zonotope loss functions to shape reachable sets capturing future waypoints.

- Integration of neural network, MPC, and passivity control for full-body control of Digit biped.

- Extensive simulations validating navigation safety and performance for varying pedestrian densities.

The framework enables bipedal robots to navigate human environments in a socially compliant manner. Key innovations include neural network architectures and losses for efficient zonotope prediction and planning. Results show the integrated system can effectively avoid pedestrians and reach goals.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework for bipedal robot navigation in human environments using cascaded neural networks to predict pedestrian trajectories and plan socially acceptable paths for the robot, leveraging efficient zonotope reachability analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A zonotope-based prediction and planning framework for bipedal navigation in a social environment. This includes novel pedestrian prediction and ego-agent social networks that output reachable sets represented as zonotopes.

2) Novel loss functions to shape the zonotopes that represent the future social trajectory of the ego-agent. These losses aim to produce interconnected zonotopes that engulf the ground truth socially acceptable path. 

3) A framework for hierarchically integrating the neural networks with a model predictive controller (MPC) and a low-level passivity controller for full-body joint control of the Digit bipedal robot. This enables real-time, socially acceptable navigation on hardware.

So in summary, the key contribution is an integrated learning and control framework, leveraging efficient zonotope formulations, for social navigation of bipedal robots. This addresses an open challenge in legged robot navigation in human environments.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes learning social zonotopes to represent the future trajectories of the ego agent and pedestrians. What are the advantages of using zonotopes over other set representations like polytopes? How does the zonotope parameterization enable efficient collision checking?

2. The paper uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) architecture for the Pedestrian Prediction Network and Ego Agent Social Network. What is the motivation behind using a CVAE over a standard feedforward network? How does the CVAE conditioning allow bidirectional influence between the ego agent and pedestrians? 

3. The zonotope shaping loss functions serve multiple purposes - keeping the centers close to the ground truth, creating intersecting zonotopes, and limiting zonotope size. Can you explain the motivation and details behind each of these loss components? How are they balanced?

4. Social navigation requires capturing complex interactions between multiple agents. This paper uses a simple summation of pedestrian features. What are other potential methods to aggregate multi-agent features while keeping the network architecture real-time capable?

5. The Ego Agent Social Network is conditioned on the goal position and change in ego agent state in addition to pedestrian predictions. Why are these additional conditionings necessary? How do they improve generalization? 

6. What modifications need to be made to the MPC problem formulation to enable hardware experiments on the Digit biped? What discrepancies between the LIP model and full Digit dynamics need to be accounted for?

7. The paper uses a reduced order LIP model for planning. What considerations need to be made in designing the LIP model and its constraints to ensurefeasibility on the Digit hardware?

8. What metrics can be used to quantitatively evaluate the social acceptability of the generated trajectories? How can the network losses be shaped to improve social acceptability?

9. The pedestrian simulation uses SGAN, which is shown to capture realistic human interactions. How sensitive are the navigation results to the fidelity of the pedestrian simulation? What simulator limitations need to be addressed?

10. The environment setup considers an open space with randomly generated humans and goals. How can the framework be extended to more complex spaces with obstacles? What changes are needed in the networks and MPC?
