## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multilingual text detection in natural scenes is challenging due to low accuracy and difficulty in detecting text across multiple languages, fonts, and varying arrangements. 
- Existing methods struggle with handling global context due to limited local receptive fields.

Proposed Solution:
- A multilingual text detection model called SH Cascade Mask R-CNN is proposed.
- It uses a SFM Swin Transformer feature extraction network to enhance robustness in detecting diverse languages and fonts. 
- An AS-HRFPN fusion network with Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion and Spatial Pyramid Pooling modules is introduced to handle multi-scale text.
- A global semantic segmentation branch is added to extract global features and provide more context to guide text detection.

Main Contributions:
- Construction of a new challenging multilingual natural scene text dataset (CEMLT) spanning 6 languages with complex arrangements.
- Introduction of spatial feature fusion in Swin Transformer to improve multi-lingual detection capability.  
- A novel AS-HRFPN fusion network to handle text at multiple scales.
- Addition of a global semantic branch to supplement local receptive fields.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on CEMLT and other datasets. The proposed SH Cascade Mask R-CNN achieves an F-measure of 85.02% on CEMLT.
- Verification of generalization capability by testing on MSRA-TD500, ICDAR2017MLT and ICDAR2015 datasets.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in advancing multilingual text detection by handling complexity across languages, scales and contexts. The proposed model with its novel components sets a new state-of-the-art.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a multilingual text detection model called SH Cascade Mask R-CNN that introduces a Swin Transformer feature extraction network, an adaptive spatial feature fusion network, and a global semantic segmentation branch to address the challenges of detecting diverse multilingual text in complex natural scenes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel multilingual text detection model to address the challenges of low accuracy and difficulty in detecting multilingual text in natural scenes. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) The SFM Swin Transformer feature extraction network is introduced to enhance robustness in detecting characters and fonts across different languages, addressing issues caused by multiple character sets and diverse font styles in multilingual text images. 

2) The AS-HRFPN feature fusion network is presented through incorporating Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion and Spatial Pyramid Pooling modules. This improves the model's ability to detect varying text sizes and orientations, dealing with the considerable variation in scales and arrangements in natural scene text.

3) A Global Semantic Segmentation Branch is proposed to extract and preserve global features to guide text detection. This addresses the complexity of high background diversity and font variations across languages, as well as the limitations caused by restricted local receptive fields in existing methods.

4) A new challenging multilingual natural scene text dataset (CEMLT) is collected and used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which achieves substantially higher accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and competitiveness of the model.

In summary, the key innovation is the propose multilingual text detection algorithm that achieves significantly improved performance through effectively addressing various challenges in detecting complex and diverse multilingual text in natural scenes.
