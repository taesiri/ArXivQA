# [The BigCode Project Governance Card](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03872)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
This paper aims to provide transparency into the governance mechanisms and structures that were developed as part of the BigCode project. BigCode is an open scientific collaboration focused on the responsible development and use of large language models for code. The paper highlights that code LLMs can enable powerful applications but also pose novel challenges related to consent, privacy, and security/safety. 

Proposed Solution - Project Governance:
The paper outlines BigCode's organizational structure, goals, timeline, and key milestones. It was a collaboration led by Hugging Face and ServiceNow, governed by a steering committee and supported by working groups. Goals included creating an evaluation benchmark, developing faster training methods, and addressing legal/ethical issues around code LLMs. The project involved releasing multiple datasets, models like SantaCoder and StarCoder, and tools to empower developers and support responsible development.

Proposed Solution - Data Governance: 
For the core Stack dataset, BigCode aimed to balance implicit consent via licensing with an opt-out mechanism for developers. The paper summarizes the technical tools created to support opt-out, community feedback gathered, and limitations around consent. It also explains the privacy risk mitigation strategy, including PII annotation and automated redaction.

Proposed Solution - Model Governance:
BigCode used a responsible AI license agreement that enables open access but restricts clearly defined harmful use cases. The project also released an attribution tool so users can check if StarCoder's outputs match original training data and respect licences.

Main Contributions:
In summary, the key contributions highlighted are:
1) Transparency into BigCode's organizational governance 
2) Technical innovations to support developer consent and data rights
3) Strategies used to mitigate privacy risks
4) Usage of responsible AI licensing and release of attribution tools

By outlining this governance architecture, the paper aims to demonstrate intentional governance of an open research project and serve as a template for future endeavors in responsible AI development.
