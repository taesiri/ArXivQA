# [The BigCode Project Governance Card](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03872)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
This paper aims to provide transparency into the governance mechanisms and structures that were developed as part of the BigCode project. BigCode is an open scientific collaboration focused on the responsible development and use of large language models for code. The paper highlights that code LLMs can enable powerful applications but also pose novel challenges related to consent, privacy, and security/safety. 

Proposed Solution - Project Governance:
The paper outlines BigCode's organizational structure, goals, timeline, and key milestones. It was a collaboration led by Hugging Face and ServiceNow, governed by a steering committee and supported by working groups. Goals included creating an evaluation benchmark, developing faster training methods, and addressing legal/ethical issues around code LLMs. The project involved releasing multiple datasets, models like SantaCoder and StarCoder, and tools to empower developers and support responsible development.

Proposed Solution - Data Governance: 
For the core Stack dataset, BigCode aimed to balance implicit consent via licensing with an opt-out mechanism for developers. The paper summarizes the technical tools created to support opt-out, community feedback gathered, and limitations around consent. It also explains the privacy risk mitigation strategy, including PII annotation and automated redaction.

Proposed Solution - Model Governance:
BigCode used a responsible AI license agreement that enables open access but restricts clearly defined harmful use cases. The project also released an attribution tool so users can check if StarCoder's outputs match original training data and respect licences.

Main Contributions:
In summary, the key contributions highlighted are:
1) Transparency into BigCode's organizational governance 
2) Technical innovations to support developer consent and data rights
3) Strategies used to mitigate privacy risks
4) Usage of responsible AI licensing and release of attribution tools

By outlining this governance architecture, the paper aims to demonstrate intentional governance of an open research project and serve as a template for future endeavors in responsible AI development.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides an overview of the project structure, goals, values, decision-making processes, funding, data management, and model governance of the BigCode project, an open scientific collaboration working on developing large language models for code responsibly and transparently.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is to provide transparency into the governance mechanisms and decision-making processes of the BigCode project. Specifically, the paper:

- Outlines the project structure, including its goals, values, decision-making processes, timeline, and resourcing. This provides insight into how the project is organized and makes decisions.

- Describes the data governance, including how data was collected, consent mechanisms, and private information handling. This elucidates how the project aimed to give developers more agency over use of their data. 

- Discusses model governance, including licensing and attribution tools. This shows how the project sought to enable responsible use of the models it released.

In summary, by detailing the intentional governance choices made throughout the project, the paper serves as an example that future similar endeavors can reference to help shape their own approach to governance of open research on foundation models like large language models. The transparency provided also supports external accountability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Governance card - The paper serves as an overview of the governance mechanisms and areas for the BigCode project.

- Project structure - Covers the project organization, goals and values, decision processes, funding and resources. 

- Data governance - Decisions relating to consent of data subjects, privacy, and data management.

- Model governance - Decisions around model licensing, attribution tools, and responsible AI. 

- Consent - Discussion of implicit vs explicit consent of data subjects (developers) whose code is used.

- Opt-out - Technical tools developed to allow developers to opt-out of having their code included.

- Privacy - Efforts to detect and redact personally identifiable information (PII) in the training data.  

- Licensing - Use of an open and responsible AI model license for BigCode models.

- Attribution - Development of tools to check if model outputs match original training data.

So in summary - governance, openness, consent, privacy, licensing, attribution seem like the main concepts covered.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods and approaches proposed in the BigCode governance card paper:

1. The paper mentions using permissive licenses as a proxy for consent from data subjects to include their code in the training data. However, many of these licenses were chosen before recent developments in large language models. What additional steps could be taken to better account for changes in technology and uses of data when relying on licenses as indications of consent?

2. Opt-out is presented as an improvement over reliance solely on licenses, but some community feedback indicated a preference for opt-in instead. What are some of the tradeoffs between these two approaches from legal, ethical, and practical perspectives? 

3. The paper acknowledges current technical limitations in completely removing data from model weights after training. What research directions could help enable more granular removal of specific training data from large language models after the fact?

4. What informed the choice of carbon intensity factors and power usage effectiveness values used to estimate emissions from model training? How might these estimates change given different assumptions?

5. The terms of access for the PII annotation dataset require researchers and developers granted access to uphold ethical standards and data protection measures. What specific ethical guidelines or review processes help ensure this? 

6. The model licensing agreement allows modifications but requires modified versions to keep similar use restrictions. How might the scope of "similar" restrictions be defined more precisely? What challenges does this present?

7. The attribution tool provides lineage from model outputs back to origins in the training data. How might this approach be expanded to provide richer attribution while respecting licensor intent and technical limitations?

8. What informed the selection of programming languages, file types, and other filters applied during data collection and preparation of The Stack dataset? How were tradeoffs assessed?

9. The paper discusses involvement from experts in open source legaltech in shaping data collection and management. What specific insights emerged from this collaboration to inform the overall approach?

10. What processes or frameworks were used to identify priority ethical aspects and social impacts highlighted in the paper, such as consent, privacy, and software security? How did these shape technical and organizational decisions?
