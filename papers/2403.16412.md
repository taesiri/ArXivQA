# [Unsupervised Template-assisted Point Cloud Shape Correspondence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16412)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Establishing accurate point-to-point correspondences between two point cloud shapes with non-rigid deformations and unusual poses remains challenging. Existing methods rely on directly computing similarity between point cloud features, which struggles for unconventional point cloud pairs where the overall structure is distorted. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an unsupervised Template-Assisted point cloud shape correspondence Network (TANet) to address this problem. TANet has two main components:

1) Template Generation Module: Generates a set of learnable template shapes with explicit structures by incorporating a template bank and a space aligner. The template bank balances shape complexity while the space aligner enriches templates using point cloud coordinates and features.  

2) Template Assistance Module: Selects the most suitable template using geometric and semantic similarity. It then establishes correspondences by fusing point features with template correlation vectors and enforcing transitive consistency between direct and template-assisted similarity.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a template-assisted framework for point cloud shape correspondence with jointly optimized template generation and assistance modules.

- Introduces template bank and space aligner to produce learnable templates balancing complexity and explicitness.

- Leverages templates to enhance point features, select suitable templates adaptively, and maintain transitive similarity consistency.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TOSCA and SHREC'19 benchmarks. Demonstrates excellent generalization capability on SMAL and SURREAL datasets.

The core idea is to leverage suitable and explicit template shapes to establish more accurate correspondences between unconventional point cloud pairs where direct similarity calculation struggles. Both quantitative and qualitative results validate the effectiveness of the proposed TANet.
