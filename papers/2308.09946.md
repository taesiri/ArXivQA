# [Weakly-Supervised Action Localization by Hierarchically-structured   Latent Attention Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09946)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research goal of this paper is to develop a weakly-supervised action localization method that can learn to effectively localize action instances in videos using only video-level labels. The key hypotheses/claims appear to be:- Modeling the temporal variations of feature semantics can help improve weakly-supervised action localization, as these variations provide cues for detecting the start and end points of actions. - A hierarchically-structured latent model can capture these temporal variations in feature semantics by disentangling the spatial and temporal factors of variation.- Change-points detected from the latent temporal variations can provide candidates for action boundaries. - An attention-based classification module can help select the change-points corresponding to action foregrounds to get the final boundaries.The overall proposed approach is based on these hypotheses and combines a hierarchical VAE model to capture feature variations with an attention module to select foreground change-points for localization. The experiments seem to validate these claims by showing state-of-the-art performance.In summary, the key research question is how to effectively leverage temporal variations in feature semantics in a weakly-supervised setting to improve action localization, with a proposed solution based on hierarchical latent modeling and change-point detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a weakly-supervised action localization method called Attention-based Hierarchically-structured Latent Model (AHLM). The main contributions are:- It proposes to model the temporal variations of feature semantics in videos using a hierarchical generative model. This allows detecting change-points in the features, which provide candidates for action boundaries. - It introduces a new AHLM framework that combines an unsupervised change-point detector based on the hierarchical generative model, with an attention-based classifier to select foreground change-points as action boundaries.- Experiments on THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet datasets show state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous weakly-supervised methods by a large margin. The results demonstrate the benefits of modeling temporal feature variations for weakly-supervised action localization.In summary, the key novelty is the use of a hierarchical latent model to capture temporal feature dynamics and detect change-points in an unsupervised manner, which complements the weakly-supervised classification module. This allows improving action localization performance in the weakly-supervised setting.
