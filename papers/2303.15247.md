# [Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval with Textual Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15247)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we perform composed image retrieval (CIR) without requiring expensive labeled training data?The key points are:- Composed image retrieval (CIR) involves retrieving a target image by providing a reference image and a text caption describing the differences between them. - Current CIR methods rely on supervised learning, which requires expensive manually annotated datasets.- This paper proposes a new task called "zero-shot CIR" that aims to remove the need for labeled training data.- The paper introduces a novel approach called "SEARLE" that can perform zero-shot CIR by mapping the reference image into a learned pseudo-word token and combining it with the relative caption.- SEARLE involves training a textual inversion network on unlabeled images to map images to pseudo-word tokens.- The paper also introduces a new benchmark dataset called CIRCO for evaluating zero-shot CIR.In summary, the central hypothesis is that zero-shot CIR can be achieved without labeled training data by using textual inversion to map reference images to pseudo-words that can be combined with relative captions. The SEARLE method is proposed to test this hypothesis.
