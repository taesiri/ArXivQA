# [Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval with Textual Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15247)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we perform composed image retrieval (CIR) without requiring expensive labeled training data?

The key points are:

- Composed image retrieval (CIR) involves retrieving a target image by providing a reference image and a text caption describing the differences between them. 

- Current CIR methods rely on supervised learning, which requires expensive manually annotated datasets.

- This paper proposes a new task called "zero-shot CIR" that aims to remove the need for labeled training data.

- The paper introduces a novel approach called "SEARLE" that can perform zero-shot CIR by mapping the reference image into a learned pseudo-word token and combining it with the relative caption.

- SEARLE involves training a textual inversion network on unlabeled images to map images to pseudo-word tokens.

- The paper also introduces a new benchmark dataset called CIRCO for evaluating zero-shot CIR.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that zero-shot CIR can be achieved without labeled training data by using textual inversion to map reference images to pseudo-words that can be combined with relative captions. The SEARLE method is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new task called Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) and an approach to tackle it called SEARLE. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Introducing the ZS-CIR task, which aims to perform composed image retrieval without requiring expensive labeled training data. This removes the need for high effort in creating datasets with query triplets.

- Proposing SEARLE, a novel approach involving a textual inversion network to map images to pseudo-words. It has two main stages: an optimization-based textual inversion to generate pseudo-words, and training the textual inversion network via distillation.

- Introducing CIRCO, a new benchmark dataset for ZS-CIR containing multiple ground truth images per query to enable more comprehensive evaluation. The annotation leverages SEARLE to ease collecting multiple ground truths.

- Experiments showing SEARLE achieves significant improvements over baselines on existing CIR datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR, and on the proposed CIRCO.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the ZS-CIR task to remove the need for expensive training data in CIR, and SEARLE as a novel approach to tackle this new task in a zero-shot manner. The introduction of CIRCO also supports benchmarking progress on ZS-CIR.

- The paper introduces a new CIR dataset called CIRCO with multiple ground truth annotations per query. This is unique compared to prior datasets, and provides a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating CIR models.

- The proposed CIRCO dataset creation strategy using SEARLE to retrieve candidate images is novel, and could be useful for scaling up annotation more efficiently.

- Overall, SEARLE pushes forward zero-shot CIR research through its novel training approach, strong empirical results, and new more challenging dataset. It compares favorably to existing supervised and zero-shot methods, demonstrating the viability of the ZS-CIR task.

In summary, this paper makes several notable contributions to advancing zero-shot composed image retrieval compared to prior work, especially in terms of the proposed approach, datasets, and experimental results. The ZS-CIR task remains an open challenge but this paper provides a strong foundation and benchmark for future research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Investigating the potential of their method for personalized image generation. Specifically, they propose that their GPT-based regularization loss could help a generative model better take into account input text when synthesizing personalized images.

- Exploring different architectures and training strategies for the textual inversion network. The authors mention the gap in performance between their network and the optimization-based inversion, suggesting room for improvement in the network design and training.

- Applying their approach to other vision-language tasks like VQA and image captioning. The idea is that their pseudo-word token could provide a way to integrate visual information into language models for these tasks.

- Evaluating their method on more diverse and challenging datasets. The authors propose testing their approach on more varied datasets to assess its ability to generalize.

- Investigating other strategies for generating the pseudo-word tokens, beyond their distillation approach. There may be other effective techniques for training the textual inversion network.

- Studying how to create better training data for the textual inversion network, to improve its representation learning.

- Analyzing the effect of employing multiple pseudo-words per image instead of just one.

- Comparing to other zero-shot learning techniques for integrating vision and language.

In summary, the main suggestions involve leveraging their approach for generative modeling and other V&L tasks, improving the textual inversion network training, and testing their method on more diverse and challenging data. Exploring alternative zero-shot learning techniques is also mentioned.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR), a new task that aims to retrieve a target image from a reference image and relative caption without requiring an expensive labeled training dataset. The proposed method, SEARLE, maps the visual features of the reference image into a pseudo-word token using a textual inversion network. This pseudo-word can be concatenated with the relative caption and fed to CLIP for retrieval. SEARLE is trained in two stages - first generating pseudo-word tokens for unlabeled images using an optimization-based textual inversion with a GPT regularization loss, then distilling this into a feedforward textual inversion network. To support ZS-CIR research, the authors introduce a new benchmark dataset CIRCO with reduced false negatives and multiple annotated ground truths per query. Experiments show SEARLE outperforms baselines on CIRCO, CIRR and FashionIQ datasets. Key contributions are proposing the ZS-CIR task, the SEARLE approach using textual inversion and distillation for zero-shot retrieval, and the new CIRCO dataset.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new task called Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) which aims to perform composed image retrieval without requiring labeled training data. The composed image retrieval task involves retrieving a target image that matches a query composed of a reference image and a relative text caption describing differences between the two images. Existing methods rely on supervised learning which requires expensive labeled datasets. 

To address this, the authors propose an approach called SEARLE which maps the visual features of the reference image into a pseudo-word token in CLIP's text embedding space. This pseudo-word can be combined with the caption and fed to CLIP's text encoder to perform retrieval. They train a textual inversion network in an unsupervised manner to generate the pseudo-words efficiently. The authors also introduce a new dataset called CIRCO for benchmarking ZS-CIR which contains multiple ground truth images per query. Experiments show their approach outperforms baselines on CIRCO and existing CIR datasets, demonstrating the promise of pseudo-word mapping for zero-shot composed image retrieval.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new task called Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) which aims to perform composed image retrieval without requiring labeled training data. The authors introduce a method called SEARLE which maps the visual features of a reference image into a pseudo-word token in the CLIP token embedding space. This pseudo-word token is concatenated with the relative text caption to create a textual query that captures information from both modalities. SEARLE has two main stages: (1) An optimization-based textual inversion is used to generate pseudo-word tokens for unlabeled images by optimizing a loss function involving a cosine loss and a GPT-powered regularization loss. (2) A textual inversion network is trained to predict pseudo-words for images in a feedforward manner by distilling the knowledge from the pre-generated tokens using a contrastive distillation loss and the GPT regularization loss. At inference, the textual inversion network generates the pseudo-word token for the reference image which is combined with the relative caption for retrieval using CLIP.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of composed image retrieval (CIR) without requiring a labeled training dataset. CIR involves retrieving a target image that matches a query composed of a reference image and a text caption describing the desired differences from the reference. Existing approaches rely on supervised learning, which requires expensive manually annotated training data. This limits their applicability. 

To overcome this issue, the paper introduces a new task called zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR), where the goal is to perform CIR without needing any labeled training data. The paper proposes an approach called SEARLE that tackles ZS-CIR by mapping the reference image into a pseudo-word token that can be combined with the text caption for retrieval.

The key questions addressed are:

- How to perform composed image retrieval without requiring manual annotation and labeled training data?

- How to effectively combine visual information from an image with a text caption in a zero-shot manner?

- How to map an image into a pseudo-word token that encapsulates its visual content and can interact with text captions?

So in summary, the paper focuses on removing the dependence on labeled training data for CIR by introducing a zero-shot formulation and a method to combine visual and textual information without supervision.
