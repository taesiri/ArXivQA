# [Efficient Diffusion Policies for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20081)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to make diffusion policies more efficient to train and more compatible with different offline RL algorithms. Specifically, the paper focuses on two main limitations of previous diffusion policies:1) Training efficiency: Previous diffusion policies like Diffusion-QL rely on sampling from a long Markov chain during training, which is very computationally expensive. This makes diffusion policies difficult to train efficiently.2) Algorithm compatibility: Previous diffusion policies are only compatible with Q-learning style algorithms like TD3 where actions can be directly sampled during training. They are not compatible with policy gradient algorithms that require a tractable policy likelihood.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new method called Efficient Diffusion Policy (EDP) that makes the following contributions:- Uses an "action approximation" technique during training to avoid sampling through the full Markov chain, drastically improving training efficiency.- Approximates the intractable policy likelihood to make diffusion policies compatible with policy gradient algorithms like CRR and IQL. - Demonstrates state-of-the-art results on D4RL benchmark by plugging EDP into TD3, CRR and IQL, showing it is an efficient and generic policy class.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by addressing the efficiency and compatibility limitations, diffusion policies can become a generic and superior policy representation for offline RL. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed EDP method.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to make diffusion policies more efficient to train and apply to a wider range of offline RL algorithms. Specifically, the paper focuses on addressing two main limitations of previous diffusion policies:1) Training efficiency - Previous diffusion policies like Diffusion-QL require forwarding and backpropagating through a long Markov chain during training, making them very slow to train. 2) Generality - Previous diffusion policies can only be trained with Q-learning algorithms like TD3 that rely on differentiable sampling. They cannot be used with policy gradient algorithms that require a tractable policy likelihood.To address these issues, the paper proposes Efficient Diffusion Policies (EDP) which uses an action approximation technique to avoid sampling during training. This speeds up training significantly. The paper also shows how EDP can be adapted to work with policy gradient algorithms by approximating the intractable likelihood.The central hypothesis is that by addressing these limitations, EDP will be far more efficient to train than previous diffusion policies while also being compatible with a much wider range of offline RL algorithms. Experiments on D4RL benchmark environments validate these claims.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes Efficient Diffusion Policies (EDP) as a new policy class to address two limitations of previous diffusion policies for offline reinforcement learning:1. Efficiency: Previous diffusion policies like Diffusion-QL are inefficient to train due to the need to repeatedly sample actions from a long Markov chain during training. EDP introduces an "action approximation" technique that avoids sampling and allows training with just one forward and backward pass through the policy network per iteration. This makes EDP much more efficient to train.2. Generality: Previous diffusion policies can only be trained with Q-learning algorithms like TD3 that rely on differentiable sampling. EDP develops a tractable lower bound on the policy log-likelihood that allows it to also be trained with likelihood-based policy optimization algorithms like CRR and IQL. This makes EDP compatible with a broader range of offline RL algorithms.Through extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark, the paper shows that EDP substantially reduces the training time compared to Diffusion-QL (e.g. from 5 days to 5 hours on locomotion tasks) while achieving superior performance. EDP also sets new state-of-the-art results by large margins when combined with TD3, CRR, and IQL across all D4RL domains.In summary, the main contribution is developing a new diffusion policy class that is much more efficient to train and generalizable to different offline RL algorithms. This greatly expands the applicability of diffusion policies for offline reinforcement learning.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a new method for offline reinforcement learning called Efficient Diffusion Policies (EDP). Here are some key comparisons to other related work:- Most prior offline RL methods focus on modifying the policy evaluation or policy improvement steps to address the distribution shift issue. This paper instead proposes a better policy parameterization using diffusion models.- Diffusion-QL (Wang et al. 2022) first introduced diffusion models as policies for offline RL. However, it suffers from computational inefficiency during training/sampling and is limited to Q-learning algorithms. EDP solves these issues through action approximation and likelihood approximation.- EDP builds on top of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). It leverages the closed-form distributions during the diffusion process to efficiently approximate actions. This avoids expensive Markov chain sampling.- To support likelihood-based RL algorithms, EDP derives a tractable lower bound on the policy log-likelihood. This makes diffusion policies compatible with a wider range of offline RL methods.- Experiments show EDP reduces the training time of Diffusion-QL from 5 days to 5 hours on D4RL locomotion tasks. It also outperforms prior methods by large margins when combined with TD3, CRR, and IQL.In summary, this paper makes diffusion policies viable for offline RL by improving their efficiency and generality. The results demonstrate the superiority of diffusion policy over standard Gaussian policies. This contrasts with most existing works that focus on algorithmic modifications rather than better policy parameterization.
