# [Efficient Diffusion Policies for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20081)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to make diffusion policies more efficient to train and more compatible with different offline RL algorithms. Specifically, the paper focuses on two main limitations of previous diffusion policies:1) Training efficiency: Previous diffusion policies like Diffusion-QL rely on sampling from a long Markov chain during training, which is very computationally expensive. This makes diffusion policies difficult to train efficiently.2) Algorithm compatibility: Previous diffusion policies are only compatible with Q-learning style algorithms like TD3 where actions can be directly sampled during training. They are not compatible with policy gradient algorithms that require a tractable policy likelihood.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new method called Efficient Diffusion Policy (EDP) that makes the following contributions:- Uses an "action approximation" technique during training to avoid sampling through the full Markov chain, drastically improving training efficiency.- Approximates the intractable policy likelihood to make diffusion policies compatible with policy gradient algorithms like CRR and IQL. - Demonstrates state-of-the-art results on D4RL benchmark by plugging EDP into TD3, CRR and IQL, showing it is an efficient and generic policy class.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by addressing the efficiency and compatibility limitations, diffusion policies can become a generic and superior policy representation for offline RL. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed EDP method.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to make diffusion policies more efficient to train and apply to a wider range of offline RL algorithms. Specifically, the paper focuses on addressing two main limitations of previous diffusion policies:1) Training efficiency - Previous diffusion policies like Diffusion-QL require forwarding and backpropagating through a long Markov chain during training, making them very slow to train. 2) Generality - Previous diffusion policies can only be trained with Q-learning algorithms like TD3 that rely on differentiable sampling. They cannot be used with policy gradient algorithms that require a tractable policy likelihood.To address these issues, the paper proposes Efficient Diffusion Policies (EDP) which uses an action approximation technique to avoid sampling during training. This speeds up training significantly. The paper also shows how EDP can be adapted to work with policy gradient algorithms by approximating the intractable likelihood.The central hypothesis is that by addressing these limitations, EDP will be far more efficient to train than previous diffusion policies while also being compatible with a much wider range of offline RL algorithms. Experiments on D4RL benchmark environments validate these claims.
