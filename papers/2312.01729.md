# [EdgeConvFormer: Dynamic Graph CNN and Transformer based Anomaly   Detection in Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01729)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning model called EdgeConvFormer for anomaly detection in multivariate time series data. The model integrates Time2Vec embeddings to capture temporal behaviors, dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (EdgeConv) to model spatiotemporal correlations between sensor time series, and Transformers to attend to long-range dependencies. Specifically, Time2Vec learns to encode both periodic and non-periodic patterns underlying each sensor time series. EdgeConv alternates with Transformer layers in a multi-scale architecture, progressively refining the features by combining global temporal signals from Transformer self-attention with the local topological structure searched by EdgeConv in the spatiotemporal state space. This allows exploiting complex interdependencies between sensors across both space and time. Experiments on several real-world multivariate time series datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of EdgeConvFormer for detecting anomalies under various evaluation metrics and thresholds. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of all components. The model strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency. By modeling intricate spatiotemporal correlations, EdgeConvFormer pushes the boundary of anomaly detection in complex multivariate sensor data.
