# [Dual Meta-Learning with Longitudinally Generalized Regularization for   One-Shot Brain Tissue Segmentation Across the Human Lifespan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06774)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a deep learning model that can perform accurate brain tissue segmentation from MRI scans across different age groups, especially for challenging infant and elderly populations. The key hypothesis is that jointly learning an age-agnostic feature extractor and a flexibly adaptable segmentation head through a dual meta-learning approach can enable the model to generalize well across lifespan while achieving accurate segmentation with very limited data from a new age group.Specifically, the paper proposes a dual meta-learning paradigm called DuMeta that unifies meta-feature learning and meta-initialization learning to concurrently learn:1) A plug-and-play feature extractor that can extract longitudinal-consistent anatomical representations across different ages. 2) A well-initialized segmentation head that can be efficiently adapted to different age groups with one labeled sample through fine-tuning.The central hypothesis is that by meta-learning both components jointly, the model can achieve superior generalization and sample efficiency in segmenting brain tissues across lifespan compared to existing methods. Experiments on infant and elderly MRI datasets verify this hypothesis and show state-of-the-art performance.In summary, the key research question is how to enable accurate and consistent brain tissue segmentation from MRI across lifespan, especially infancy and elderly stages. The central hypothesis is dual meta-learning of an age-agnostic feature extractor and adaptable segmentation head can achieve this goal effectively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a dual meta-learning (DuMeta) paradigm for learning longitudinally consistent representations and accurate segmentation models across the lifespan. DuMeta unifies meta-feature learning and meta-initialization learning to jointly learn an age-agnostic feature extractor and a well-initialized segmentation head.2. It designs two class-aware regularizations - intra-tissue temporal similarity and inter-tissue spatial orthogonality - to encourage longitudinal consistency in hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. These regularizations do not require longitudinally paired data.3. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-shot brain tissue segmentation on infant and elderly datasets. It significantly outperforms existing methods for longitudinal consistency, using only one labeled sample from the target age group for fine-tuning.4. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of the proposed DuMeta paradigm and class-aware regularizations. Experiments also analyze the influence of different base/meta-learner splits.In summary, the key innovation is the DuMeta framework and dedicated regularizations for learning longitudinally consistent models that generalize well across ages. With minimal labeled data, DuMeta achieves highly accurate and consistent segmentation throughout the lifespan.
