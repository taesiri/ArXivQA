## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Prostate cancer is a prevalent disease among males worldwide. Particularly, clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) has worse prognosis and requires accurate identification for improved treatment and survival rates. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy is widely used for prostate cancer diagnosis. However, conventional TRUS images have low contrast in differentiating malignant tissues. Therefore, new technological solutions are needed to facilitate TRUS-guided targeted biopsy of csPCa lesions.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a deep learning framework to classify csPCa based on multi-modality TRUS videos containing both B-mode (anatomical) images and shear wave elastography (SWE, stiffness) images. The framework utilizes two 3D ResNet-50 models to extract features from the two modalities. An adaptive spatial fusion module is introduced to aggregate the features in a spatially-aligned manner. Additionally, an orthogonal regularization loss is employed during training to mitigate redundant features.  

Main Contributions:

- A multi-modality TRUS video classification framework for identifying csPCa by fusing B-mode and SWE modalities.

- An adaptive spatial fusion module to combine the multi-modality features effectively in a spatially aligned manner.

- An orthogonal regularization strategy to reduce feature redundancy between modalities.

- Evaluated on a dataset of 512 TRUS scans and achieved favorable classification performance of csPCa with AUC of 0.84.

- Visualized class activation maps indicating locations related to csPCa prediction, suggesting potential for TRUS-guided targeted biopsy.

In summary, the proposed solution aims to fully utilize complementary information from multi-modality TRUS to accurately identify csPCa lesions, thereby facilitating subsequent targeted biopsies. The introduced fusion module and regularization term help boost classification performance.
