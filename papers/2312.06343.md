## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes RankMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning approach for label distribution learning (LDL). LDL is useful for problems with label ambiguity, assigning both labels and their relative importance to instances. However, labeled LDL data is costly to obtain. To address this, RankMatch leverages both limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. It uses an ensemble-inspired averaging strategy to create pseudo-label distributions, enhancing prediction stability. Furthermore, RankMatch incorporates a pairwise relevance ranking loss that captures inter-label correlations, aligning predictions with ground truth distributions. The method is analyzed theoretically with a generalization bound. Extensive experiments on real-world visual datasets demonstrate that RankMatch outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised and supervised LDL techniques. Key strengths are effectively utilizing unlabeled data and modeling label relationships. The success of RankMatch underscores the potential of semi-supervised learning to reduce reliance on expensive labeled data for training deep LDL models.
