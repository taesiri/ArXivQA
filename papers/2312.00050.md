# [Elijah: Eliminating Backdoors Injected in Diffusion Models via   Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00050)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Diffusion models (DMs) have become state-of-the-art generative models due to their ability to generate high-quality images from noise without adversarial training. However, recent studies have shown that they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor defenses designed for classifiers are not suitable for DMs. There is a need for effective backdoor detection and removal techniques tailored for DMs.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Elijah, the first backdoor detection and removal framework for DMs. The key insight is that existing attacks inject a distribution shift in the DMs which gets activated by the trigger. Leveraging this, Elijah performs the following:

1. Trigger Inversion: Inverts a potential trigger based on a distribution shift preservation property along the diffusion chain.

2. Backdoor Detection: Uses the inverted trigger to detect backdoor. Feeds inputs stamped with inverted trigger to DM and measures consistency of generated images using a proposed uniformity score and noise level using TV loss. Models detected as backdoored if consistency is high and noise is low.

3. Backdoor Removal: Reduces distribution shift against inverted trigger to eliminate backdoor. Uses a loss function that aligns distributions for trigger inputs and clean inputs while maintaining distribution on clean inputs learned from full clean data.


Main Contributions:

- First backdoor detection and removal framework tailored for DMs 

- Distribution shift preservation based trigger inversion method

- Uniformity score to measure consistency of images for backdoor detection

- Backdoor removal via distribution shift reduction while preserving benign utility

- Evaluation on 151 clean and 296 backdoored DMs of 3 types, 13 samplers and 3 attacks shows close to 100% detection accuracy and near complete backdoor removal with minimal impact on model utility

The framework does not require any real clean data, making it highly practical.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes the first backdoor detection and removal framework for diffusion models by leveraging the insight that existing attacks inject a distribution shift relative to the trigger.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing the first backdoor detection and removal framework for diffusion models. The framework can work without any real clean data.

2) Devising a distribution shift preservation based trigger inversion method.

3) Proposing a uniformity score as a metric to measure the consistency of a batch of images, which is used together with the TV loss for backdoor detection.

4) Designing a backdoor removal algorithm to mitigate the distribution shift injected in diffusion models to eliminate backdoors. 

5) Implementing the framework called Elijah (Eliminating Backdoors Injected in Diffusion Models via Distribution Shift) and evaluating it extensively on hundreds of clean and backdoored diffusion models of different architectures. The results show Elijah can achieve close to 100% detection accuracy and reduce the backdoor effects to close to zero while largely maintaining model utility.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the first end-to-end backdoor detection and removal framework tailored for diffusion models, along with a set of novel techniques to make it work effectively.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Diffusion models (DMs): The generative models that are the main focus of the paper, including DDPM, NCSN, LDM models.

- Backdoor attacks: Attacks that inject triggers into models to produce target images, which the paper aims to detect and remove from diffusion models.

- Trigger inversion: A method proposed in the paper to invert a potential trigger in a diffusion model that maintains a distribution shift. 

- Uniformity score: A metric devised in the paper to measure the consistency of a batch of images generated by a diffusion model when an inverted trigger is applied. Used for backdoor detection. 

- Total variation (TV) loss: A loss function used along with the uniformity score for backdoor detection to measure the noise level of generated images.

- Distribution shift: The key factor enabling backdoor attacks by shifting the distribution in diffusion models. The paper aims to detect and reduce this shift.

- Backdoor removal: A method proposed in the paper to eliminate injected backdoors by reducing the distribution shift against the inverted trigger.

So in summary, the key focus is on detecting and removing backdoors in diffusion models by analyzing distribution shifts and image properties.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a unified representation of diffusion models as a Markov chain. How is this representation helpful for analyzing existing backdoor attacks and designing the defense framework? What are the key insights gained from this view?

2. The trigger inversion method utilizes a "distribution shift preservation property." Explain this property and how it is applied to invert the trigger. How does this differ from existing trigger inversion methods for classifiers?

3. Explain the motivation behind using a "uniformity score" as one of the features for backdoor detection. How does it allow differentiating clean and backdoored models? What are other potential ways to quantify the consistency of generated images?  

4. The paper claims the framework can work without access to any real clean data. Walk through how both the detection and removal components can operate with fully synthetic data. What are the underlying assumptions that enable this?

5. The backdoor removal method utilizes an additional loss term beyond just aligning distributions. Explain the need and intuition for using the clean diffusion model loss. How does this maintain benign model utility?

6. The paper evaluates the framework extensively across model architectures, datasets, attacks etc. What are some potential gaps? What other model types, datasets, or attacks could be used to further validate the robustness?

7. The threat model assumes white-box access to the model. How would the approach change if only black-box access were available? What components would need modification?

8. The framework targets diffusion models specifically. What aspects exploit diffusion model properties? Could parts of it be generalized to other generative model types like GANs or autoregressive models?

9. The paper claims adaptive attacks that account for the defense still fail to inject effective backdoors. Explain the two attempted attacks and why they could not evade detection/removal.  

10. The runtime performance of the approach is not analyzed in depth. What are major computational bottlenecks? How can efficiency be improved for practical application?
