# [DOZE: A Dataset for Open-Vocabulary Zero-Shot Object Navigation in   Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19007)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing object navigation datasets lack dynamic obstacles, diverse objects, and textual hints, limiting research progress. 
- No existing dataset offers collision detection between agents and moving obstacles to evaluate navigation safety.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new dataset called DOZE with 10 realistic 3D scenes and over 18k tasks for zero-shot object navigation research.
- Incorporate dynamic humanoid obstacles, open-vocabulary objects, distinct-attribute objects, and textual hint objects.
- Implement capability to detect collisions between agent and moving obstacles.

Main Contributions:  
- First object navigation dataset with moving obstacles to evaluate collision avoidance.
- Diverse goal objects including open-vocabulary objects and distinct-attribute objects to validate spatial/visual reasoning.
- Hint objects with texts to provide contextual clues and require multimodal understanding.  
- Comprehensive set of 12 task categories across 3 levels of complexity for method evaluation.
- Proposed a hint-assisted navigation method that leverages textual hints to swiftly locate target objects.
- Benchmarked state-of-the-art methods, revealed limitations in existing approaches regarding efficiency, safety and recognition accuracy.

In summary, the paper introduced a high-quality dataset called DOZE to push object navigation research forwards. DOZE uniquely offers dynamic obstacles, rich object diversity and textual hints to better mimic real-world complexity. Both the dataset and experiments reveal ample opportunities for advancing navigation agents.
