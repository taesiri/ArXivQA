# [Detecting Any Human-Object Interaction Relationship: Universal HOI   Detector with Spatial Prompt Learning on Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03799)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes UniHOI, a novel universal framework for human-object interaction (HOI) detection that leverages large vision-language (VL) foundation models and language models to achieve superior performance and generalizability. The key insight is to treat HOI detectors as comprising three hierarchical levels of features, and introduce an efficient human-object prompt learning method to extract higher-level relational features associated with specific HO pairs from the foundation model. This allows open-category HOI recognition based on descriptive phrases or texts. The method also utilizes a language model to generate richer interpretive descriptions about interactions, further enhancing recognition capability. Experiments demonstrate UniHOIâ€™s state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark datasets, under both supervised and zero-shot settings. The use of foundation models and knowledge retrieval from language models allows UniHOI to understand and recognize a wide range of interactions, breaking free of constraints around fixed labeled categories in datasets. By effectively harnessing large VL and language models, UniHOI points the way towards more universal, flexible HOI detection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a universal HOI detection framework called UniHOI that leverages vision-language foundation models and knowledge retrieval from large language models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in detecting human-object interactions, including in zero-shot and open-world settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes the first visual-textual foundation model-based framework for HOI detection (UniHOI), which significantly improves the accuracy and universality compared to previous HOI detectors that solely rely on training from specific datasets. 

2. It treats the visual HOI detector as a three-tier visual feature hierarchy and appropriately designs an efficient human-object prompt learning method. This enables visual HOI detectors to effectively query interaction tokens associated with specific HO pairs in foundation models, and thus obtain more universal HO relationship representations.

3. It devises a knowledge-based zero-shot HOI recognition method that leverages large models such as GPT to generate descriptive knowledge for specific interaction categories, guiding visual detectors in zero-shot recognition of those categories. This breaks free from the limitations of only using word embeddings, and offers insights for a more universal open-category HOI recognition system.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a more universal HOI detection framework UniHOI that can effectively utilize vision-language foundation models and leverage descriptive knowledge, significantly improving the accuracy and generalization ability for both supervised and zero-shot HOI detection.

The paper proposes a universal HOI detection framework called UniHOI that leverages VL foundation models and LLMs. It introduces concepts like spatial prompt learning to extract high-level relational features associated with HO pairs. For open-world scenarios, UniHOI supports input of interaction phrases or descriptive sentences and can perform zero-shot recognition by retrieving knowledge from LLMs. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on standard HOI detection datasets. So the key terms revolve around exploiting large models for more flexible, universal HOI detection.
