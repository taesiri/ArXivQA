# [Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Pre-Trained Vision Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02242)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Pre-Trained Vision Models: A Survey":

Problem:
With the development of large-scale pre-trained vision models (PVMs) like ViT and Swin Transformer, full fine-tuning has become a popular approach for adapting them to downstream tasks. However, as these models scale to billions or trillions of parameters, full fine-tuning becomes computationally expensive and requires maintaining separate model weights for each task. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper surveys recent methods for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) that update only a small subset of a PVM's parameters to adapt it to new tasks while retaining most of the original parameters fixed. This makes tuning more efficient and facilitates positive transfer of existing knowledge in the PVMs.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a formal problem definition for PEFT.
- Categorizes PEFT methods into:
  (1) Addition-based (adapter, prompt, prefix, side tuning)
  (2) Partial-based (specification, reparameterization tuning) 
  (3) Unified-based tuning.
- Compares PEFT methods on multiple characteristics like parameter overhead, structure preserving, inference/memory efficiency. 
- Analyzes popular PEFT techniques for vision transformers including adapter modules, prompt/prefix tuning, side networks. 
- Discusses datasets, applications and future challenges for visual PEFT like interpretability, generative models, building PEFT libraries.

In summary, the paper offers a comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of the fast-evolving area of parameter-efficient fine-tuning for pre-trained vision models, identifying research gaps and future opportunities.
