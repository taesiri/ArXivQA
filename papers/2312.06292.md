 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents HoLLiE C, an advanced multifunctional bimanual mobile robot supporting various care applications. HoLLiE C builds upon previous generations of the HoLLiE robot developed at FZI to be a friendly humanoid robot for service tasks. The current HoLLiE C adapts both hardware and software modules to enable diverse functionalities for the HoLLiEcares project, where HoLLiE C assists hospital staff with tasks like transport, instructions, and documentation. Upgrades include additional sensors and actuators like force/torque sensors, a projector, speakers, etc. The software architecture follows a 3-layer structure matched to the hardware, enabling compartmentalization and flexible operation. Key topics covered are the navigation stack utilizing Move Base Flex and sensor filtering, force-sensitive control for intuitive user interaction, and the digital twin concept to protect hardware, collaborate externally, and prepare offline. Experiments during hospital trials provided valuable feedback on acceptance criteria regarding appearance and dimensions. Overall, HoLLiE C represents a multifaceted mobile manipulator tailored to care environments via its abstract yet approachable design and adaptable hard-/software.
