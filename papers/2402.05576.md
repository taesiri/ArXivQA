# [Digital Computers Break the Curse of Dimensionality: Adaptive Bounds via   Finite Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05576)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many machine learning models make simplifying assumptions that input and output spaces are infinite continuous spaces like $\mathbb{R}^d$. However, in practice ML models run on digital computers with constraints like finite precision and limited RAM that force inputs/outputs to live on finite discrete grids. This causes a mismatch between theory and practice. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper shows that by carefully accounting for the discrete geometry imposed by digital computers, one can derive tighter generalization bounds that adapt based on the sample size $N$. This is done using a new concentration result for probability measures on finite metric spaces, quantified in the Wasserstein distance. 

Key ideas:
- Digital computers enforce inputs/outputs to live on finite grids $\mathbb{R}^d_{p,M}$.
- Leverage metric embedding theory to map the finite grid into Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^m$. Dimension $m$ balances rate vs distortion.
- Concentration inequalities in $\mathbb{R}^m$ give an adaptive bound on Wasserstein convergence as $N$ grows.
- Adaptive generalization bounds for Lipschitz loss functions follow using duality.

Main Contributions:
- New technique to get adaptive generalization bounds using optimal transport and metric embeddings.
- Explicit dimension-free rates for kernel regressors and MLPs on digital computers.   
- Concentration result for measures on finite spaces with rates adapting to $N$.
- Framework applies broadly as input/output spaces are general metric spaces.

The key insight is that discretization from digital computing changes the geometry, allowing tighter bounds compared to classical statistical learning theory. This helps explain why ML models succeed despite pessimistic continuous theory.
