# [Cooperative vs. Teleoperation Control of the Steady Hand Eye Robot with   Adaptive Sclera Force Control: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01631)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper implements and compares, for the first time, a novel adaptive sclera force control algorithm within a teleoperation framework for the Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER) system using a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based force-sensing instrument. Experiments compare four control modes - cooperative, adaptive cooperative, basic teleoperation, and the new adaptive teleoperation - for a vessel following task inside an eye phantom. Results demonstrate the adaptive teleoperation and adaptive cooperative modes significantly reduce mean and maximum sclera forces and time spent above safe sclera force thresholds compared to basic cooperative and teleoperation modes. This improves safety. Completion times are shorter for cooperative modes due to direct manipulation, but teleoperation enables extra capabilities like motion scaling and repositioning to potentially improve precision and comfort. Future bilateral implementations with force feedback are proposed to further enhance safety and intuitiveness. Overall, the adaptive teleoperation framework provides a good balance of safety, flexibility and performance for advanced retinal microsurgery capabilities.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Physiological hand tremors can negatively impact delicate retinal surgery outcomes. Retinal vein cannulation (RVC) requires high precision manipulation at the scale of retinal veins (~150 μm) which is comparable to typical hand tremors (182 μm RMS). 

- The Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER) can filter hand tremors in cooperative control mode, but cannot minimize tool-sclera contact forces to prevent tissue damage. Minimizing sclera forces requires adaptive force control algorithms which have only been implemented in cooperative mode previously.

- Other capabilities like motion scaling, haptic feedback, and flexibility for the surgeon require a teleoperation framework which has not been explored for SHER with adaptive sclera force control.

Proposed Solution:
- Implement an adaptive sclera force control algorithm within a unilateral teleoperation control framework for the SHER, for the first time. This includes:
   - Kinematic control to map master (Phantom Omni) to slave (SHER)
   - Adaptive sclera force controller using FBG sensor data to minimize sclera forces
   - Hybrid position-force control scheme
   - Joint limit avoidance

- Compare performance of cooperative vs teleoperation modes, with and without adaptive sclera force control, using vessel following experiments.

Main Contributions:
- First implementation of adaptive sclera force control in a teleoperation framework for retinal surgery using SHER robot

- First direct comparison between cooperative and teleoperation control modes equipped with adaptive sclera force control for SHER

- Teleoperation mode with adaptive sclera force control improves safety by reducing sclera forces closer to desired thresholds compared to standard teleoperation  

- Cooperative modes have shorter task completion times currently, but teleoperation provides additional capabilities like scaling and flexibility

- Results demonstrate the feasibility of using adaptive teleoperation frameworks for robot-assisted retinal surgery to improve safety and surgeon capabilities


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents the first implementation of an adaptive sclera force control algorithm in a teleoperation framework for the Steady-Hand Eye Robot and compares its performance with cooperative, adaptive cooperative, and non-adaptive teleoperation control modes in a vessel-following experiment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) For the first time, the authors implemented an adaptive sclera force control algorithm in a teleoperation control mode for the Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER) 2.1 system using a fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based force-sensing surgical instrument. 

2) For the first time in robot-assisted retinal surgery applications, the authors compared the performance of the proposed adaptive teleoperation control mode with three previously developed control modes - cooperative, teleoperation, and adaptive cooperative modes - in a vessel-following experiment inside an eye phantom.

3) The performance comparison was done based on several relevant metrics like tool-sclera interaction force (important for safety), handle force/torque (related to surgeon comfort), and task completion time. The adaptive teleoperation mode showed improved safety in terms of lower mean and maximum sclera forces compared to standard teleoperation.

In summary, the key contribution is the implementation and evaluation of a novel adaptive teleoperation control approach to enhance safety and performance in robot-assisted retinal surgery using the SHER system.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes implementing an adaptive sclera force control algorithm in a teleoperation framework for the first time. What are some key benefits this could provide over the existing cooperative control with adaptive sclera force control?

2. The adaptive sclera force control aims to maintain the sclera contact force under 120mN. What could be some ways to further improve or optimize this force threshold value? 

3. The paper compares four control modes - cooperative, adaptive cooperative, teleoperation and adaptive teleoperation. What additional comparative experiments could provide further insights into the performance of these methods?

4. The vessel following experiment is conducted with a single expert user. How might the results differ with non-expert users still on their learning curve? What experiments could be designed to study this?

5. The paper uses an FBG-based force sensing instrument to estimate sclera forces. What are some limitations of this sensing approach? How could alternative sensing methods compare?

6. The completion times for the teleoperation modes are longer than the cooperative modes. What factors likely contribute to this difference and how could it be minimized?  

7. What additional capability does the proposed adaptive teleoperation framework enable compared to the existing cooperative frameworks? How does this improve surgical safety and outcomes?

8. The experiments are conducted unilaterally without force sensing on the secondary tool. What are some ways bilateral teleoperation could further improve safety and performance?

9. What role could haptics and force feedback play in the proposed teleoperation framework? What human factors studies would help quantify performance benefits?

10. How well would the proposed methods apply to other delicate surgical tasks beyond retinal vein cannulation? What validation experiments would help demonstrate broader applicability?
