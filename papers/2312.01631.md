# [Cooperative vs. Teleoperation Control of the Steady Hand Eye Robot with   Adaptive Sclera Force Control: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01631)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper implements and compares, for the first time, a novel adaptive sclera force control algorithm within a teleoperation framework for the Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER) system using a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based force-sensing instrument. Experiments compare four control modes - cooperative, adaptive cooperative, basic teleoperation, and the new adaptive teleoperation - for a vessel following task inside an eye phantom. Results demonstrate the adaptive teleoperation and adaptive cooperative modes significantly reduce mean and maximum sclera forces and time spent above safe sclera force thresholds compared to basic cooperative and teleoperation modes. This improves safety. Completion times are shorter for cooperative modes due to direct manipulation, but teleoperation enables extra capabilities like motion scaling and repositioning to potentially improve precision and comfort. Future bilateral implementations with force feedback are proposed to further enhance safety and intuitiveness. Overall, the adaptive teleoperation framework provides a good balance of safety, flexibility and performance for advanced retinal microsurgery capabilities.
