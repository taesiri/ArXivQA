# [Cooperative vs. Teleoperation Control of the Steady Hand Eye Robot with   Adaptive Sclera Force Control: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01631)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper implements and compares, for the first time, a novel adaptive sclera force control algorithm within a teleoperation framework for the Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER) system using a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based force-sensing instrument. Experiments compare four control modes - cooperative, adaptive cooperative, basic teleoperation, and the new adaptive teleoperation - for a vessel following task inside an eye phantom. Results demonstrate the adaptive teleoperation and adaptive cooperative modes significantly reduce mean and maximum sclera forces and time spent above safe sclera force thresholds compared to basic cooperative and teleoperation modes. This improves safety. Completion times are shorter for cooperative modes due to direct manipulation, but teleoperation enables extra capabilities like motion scaling and repositioning to potentially improve precision and comfort. Future bilateral implementations with force feedback are proposed to further enhance safety and intuitiveness. Overall, the adaptive teleoperation framework provides a good balance of safety, flexibility and performance for advanced retinal microsurgery capabilities.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Physiological hand tremors can negatively impact delicate retinal surgery outcomes. Retinal vein cannulation (RVC) requires high precision manipulation at the scale of retinal veins (~150 μm) which is comparable to typical hand tremors (182 μm RMS). 

- The Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER) can filter hand tremors in cooperative control mode, but cannot minimize tool-sclera contact forces to prevent tissue damage. Minimizing sclera forces requires adaptive force control algorithms which have only been implemented in cooperative mode previously.

- Other capabilities like motion scaling, haptic feedback, and flexibility for the surgeon require a teleoperation framework which has not been explored for SHER with adaptive sclera force control.

Proposed Solution:
- Implement an adaptive sclera force control algorithm within a unilateral teleoperation control framework for the SHER, for the first time. This includes:
   - Kinematic control to map master (Phantom Omni) to slave (SHER)
   - Adaptive sclera force controller using FBG sensor data to minimize sclera forces
   - Hybrid position-force control scheme
   - Joint limit avoidance

- Compare performance of cooperative vs teleoperation modes, with and without adaptive sclera force control, using vessel following experiments.

Main Contributions:
- First implementation of adaptive sclera force control in a teleoperation framework for retinal surgery using SHER robot

- First direct comparison between cooperative and teleoperation control modes equipped with adaptive sclera force control for SHER

- Teleoperation mode with adaptive sclera force control improves safety by reducing sclera forces closer to desired thresholds compared to standard teleoperation  

- Cooperative modes have shorter task completion times currently, but teleoperation provides additional capabilities like scaling and flexibility

- Results demonstrate the feasibility of using adaptive teleoperation frameworks for robot-assisted retinal surgery to improve safety and surgeon capabilities
