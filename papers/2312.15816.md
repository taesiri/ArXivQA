# [TEILP: Time Prediction over Knowledge Graphs via Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15816)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Time prediction in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) is challenging as timestamps come from a continuous space with intrinsic dependencies like order and distance.  
- Existing embedding-based methods treat time prediction as a ranking problem similar to link prediction. They cannot capture inter-dependencies between timestamps or handle unseen timestamps.
- Symbolic logic methods use only qualitative predicates and have no capability for time prediction. Methods based on temporal point process require all historical events, which is restrictive.

Proposed Solution:  
- Propose TEILP, an inductive logical reasoning framework for time prediction in TKGs. It introduces a temporal event knowledge graph (TEKG) and conditional probability density functions.

- Convert TKG to TEKG where events and timestamps become nodes. Edges represent entities or temporal relations. TEKG enables differentiable random walks for rule learning.

- Learn temporal logical rules on TEKG paths connecting query subject and object. Associate conditional probability density functions with rules to model time gap between query and known events.

- Use a Gaussian mixture model based on learned densities for final time prediction. Provide both event-split and rule-split versions.

Main Contributions:
- First inductive approach to directly learn temporal logical rules and associated conditional densities for time prediction in TKGs.

- Introduce a novel differentiable temporal random walk approach by converting TKG to TEKG with multi-type nodes and edges.

- Achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark TKG datasets. Demonstrate robustness in scenarios with limited/imbalanced training data and future event forecasting.

- Provide interpretable human-readable logical explanations along with accurate time predictions.
