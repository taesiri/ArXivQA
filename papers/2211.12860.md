# [DETRs with Collaborative Hybrid Assignments Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12860)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we improve the training efficiency and performance of DETR-based object detectors, while maintaining their end-to-end detection capability?

The key ideas proposed to address this are:

1. Using a collaborative hybrid assignment training scheme involving auxiliary prediction heads with one-to-many label assignments (e.g. ATSS, Faster R-CNN) to enhance encoder feature learning. 

2. Generating customized positive queries in the decoder using coordinates of positive samples from the auxiliary heads, to improve cross-attention learning.

The overall goal is to enhance both the encoder and decoder components of DETR frameworks through versatile label assignment strategies, without losing the end-to-end merits or adding overhead during inference. Experiments show clear improvements in convergence speed and accuracy over baselines.

In summary, the core research question is how to improve DETR-based detectors using collaborative training schemes, while retaining their end-to-end detection capability. The proposed method involving hybrid label assignments provides a way to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel collaborative hybrid assignments training scheme (Co-DETR) to improve the training efficiency and effectiveness of DETR-based object detectors. The key contributions are:

1. They incorporate auxiliary heads with one-to-many label assignment paradigms like ATSS and Faster R-CNN after the encoder. The dense supervisions from these heads force the encoder to learn more discriminative features. 

2. They generate extra customized positive queries by extracting the foreground coordinates from the outputs of these auxiliary heads. These queries are fed to the decoder to provide more positive samples and improve its attention learning.

3. Extensive experiments show Co-DETR improves various DETR variants, including DAB-DETR, Deformable-DETR, and DINO-Deformable-DETR. It achieves new state-of-the-art detection performance on COCO and LVIS datasets when combined with a ViT-L backbone.

4. Co-DETR reveals the complementarity between conventional one-to-many assignment detectors and end-to-end one-to-one set matching detectors. It is a simple yet effective approach to enhance the learning of DETR-based detectors.

In summary, the core idea is to leverage one-to-many label assignments to provide dense supervisions for the encoder and generate more positive queries for the decoder, thus improving both components in DETR's transformer architecture. The experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of this collaborative training scheme.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel collaborative hybrid assignments training scheme called Co-DETR to improve the training efficiency and effectiveness of DETR-based object detectors by leveraging both one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, while maintaining an end-to-end prediction process during inference.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- This paper presents a new method called collaborative hybrid assignments training (Co-DETR) to improve object detection using DETR models. Other recent works have also aimed to enhance DETR, such as Deformable DETR, DN-DETR, DINO-DETR, etc. However, this paper takes a unique approach of leveraging both one-to-one and one-to-many assignment mechanisms during training.

- The key idea is to use auxiliary prediction heads with one-to-many assignments like ATSS and Faster R-CNN to provide more supervision for the encoder, while also generating more positive queries from these heads to improve decoder training. This is a novel way to combine the benefits of one-to-one and one-to-many assignments.

- Most prior works focused only on improving the decoder (e.g. using deformable attention or denoising training), whereas this paper also aims to enhance the encoder feature learning. The analysis shows the encoder benefits from dense supervisions of one-to-many assignments.

- This approach achieves strong results on COCO and LVIS datasets, improving over Deformable DETR, DINO-DETR, and other recent methods. The simplicity of just adding auxiliary heads during training is also appealing.

- Compared to methods like Group-DETR that use duplicate queries, Co-DETR avoids introducing many extra background queries that increase memory and computation. The positive queries are more selectively generated.

- Overall, Co-DETR presents a simple but effective approach to combining the strengths of one-to-one and one-to-many assignment mechanisms for enhanced DETR training. The results demonstrate clear improvements over existing state-of-the-art detectors.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel training technique to improve DETR-based object detection, achieving new state-of-the-art results in a way that is complementary to other recent advancements. The approach of collaborative training with hybrid assignments is a unique contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing methods for incorporating additional label assignment strategies besides one-to-one (such as one-to-many, or ATSS) into DETR models. The authors show that incorporating auxiliary heads with these label assignment strategies can improve DETR training. Further exploring how to effectively combine different assignment strategies could lead to more powerful models.

- Exploring larger and more powerful vision model backbones. The authors show impressive gains from using a large ViT-L model, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Scaling up DETR models with even larger vision backbones could potentially lead to further gains. 

- Applying DETR models to additional challenging datasets. The authors demonstrate strong performance on COCO and LVIS, but evaluating on more datasets could reveal opportunities for improvement.

- Exploring additional techniques to improve training stability and efficiency for DETR models beyond collaborative training. The authors reduce instability through collaborative training, but more work could be done to understand and improve the DETR training process.

- Developing methods to reduce conflicts between different auxiliary heads during collaborative training. The authors show too many diverse heads can hurt performance - new techniques to align objectives could help increase the gains from collaborative training.

- Continuing to improve run-time efficiency and latency of DETR models to make them more practical. The collaborative training scheme adds overhead during training, so reducing this overhead could be worthwhile.

In summary, the main future directions are developing DETR models that incorporate diverse assignment strategies, leveraging larger backbone models, evaluating on more datasets, further improving training, reducing head conflicts, and improving run-time efficiency. The collaborative training strategy shows promise, but there are many remaining opportunities for advancing DETR model capabilities.

The paper presents a novel collaborative hybrid assignments training scheme called Co-DETR to improve the training efficiency and effectiveness of DETR-based object detectors. The key insight is that the one-to-one set matching in vanilla DETR leads to sparse supervision signals and inefficient optimization of the encoder and decoder. To address this, Co-DETR incorporates auxiliary heads with one-to-many label assignments like Faster R-CNN and ATSS to provide dense supervisions for the encoder. It also generates customized positive queries from the auxiliary heads to facilitate more efficient attention learning in the decoder. Extensive experiments show Co-DETR boosts various DETR variants significantly. For example, it improves Deformable-DETR by 5.8% AP in 12-epoch training on COCO. When equipped with large backbones like Swin Transformers, Co-DETR establishes new state-of-the-art detection performance, achieving 66.0% and 67.9% AP on COCO test-dev and LVIS val respectively.
