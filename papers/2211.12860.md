# [DETRs with Collaborative Hybrid Assignments Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12860)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we improve the training efficiency and performance of DETR-based object detectors, while maintaining their end-to-end detection capability?The key ideas proposed to address this are:1. Using a collaborative hybrid assignment training scheme involving auxiliary prediction heads with one-to-many label assignments (e.g. ATSS, Faster R-CNN) to enhance encoder feature learning. 2. Generating customized positive queries in the decoder using coordinates of positive samples from the auxiliary heads, to improve cross-attention learning.The overall goal is to enhance both the encoder and decoder components of DETR frameworks through versatile label assignment strategies, without losing the end-to-end merits or adding overhead during inference. Experiments show clear improvements in convergence speed and accuracy over baselines.In summary, the core research question is how to improve DETR-based detectors using collaborative training schemes, while retaining their end-to-end detection capability. The proposed method involving hybrid label assignments provides a way to achieve this.
