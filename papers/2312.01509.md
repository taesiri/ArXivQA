# [Tackling Bias in Pre-trained Language Models: Current Trends and   Under-represented Societies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01509)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper argues that while there is growing interest in detecting and mitigating bias in large language models (LLMs), most of the focus is on binary gender classifications and resource-rich countries like the US. This results in a gap concerning the needs of under-represented societies and indigenous populations. The paper uses New Zealand as an example of an under-represented society. Furthermore, ongoing changes to regulations and laws worldwide also impact capabilities for tackling bias. 

Solution:
The paper provides a comprehensive survey synthesizing current trends and limitations in techniques for identifying and mitigating bias in LLMs. It categorizes bias metrics, benchmark datasets, and debiasing techniques. It then analyzes their applicability and adaptability to under-represented societies using New Zealand as a case study. 

The key requirements highlighted for adopting existing techniques to under-represented societies are:
- Resources like attributes, target words, sentence templates, and corpora reflecting the social structure and inequalities of that society
- Involvement of local knowledge and local populations
- Understanding unique regulations like data sovereignty for indigenous groups

The paper also discusses the complex landscape of AI regulations worldwide and implications for bias research.

Main Contributions:
- First survey addressing the gap between bias mitigation techniques and the needs of under-represented societies 
- Analysis of bias metrics, datasets and mitigation methods from the lens of indigenous groups
- Case study of New Zealand society showing requirements for adopting existing methods 
- Discussion on emerging regulations and their impact on capabilities for tackling bias globally

The key message is that current bias mitigation practices cannot simply be "plugged in" for under-represented societies. Modifications incorporating local contexts and participation of local communities are necessary.
