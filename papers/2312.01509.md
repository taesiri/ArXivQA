# [Tackling Bias in Pre-trained Language Models: Current Trends and   Under-represented Societies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01509)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper argues that while there is growing interest in detecting and mitigating bias in large language models (LLMs), most of the focus is on binary gender classifications and resource-rich countries like the US. This results in a gap concerning the needs of under-represented societies and indigenous populations. The paper uses New Zealand as an example of an under-represented society. Furthermore, ongoing changes to regulations and laws worldwide also impact capabilities for tackling bias. 

Solution:
The paper provides a comprehensive survey synthesizing current trends and limitations in techniques for identifying and mitigating bias in LLMs. It categorizes bias metrics, benchmark datasets, and debiasing techniques. It then analyzes their applicability and adaptability to under-represented societies using New Zealand as a case study. 

The key requirements highlighted for adopting existing techniques to under-represented societies are:
- Resources like attributes, target words, sentence templates, and corpora reflecting the social structure and inequalities of that society
- Involvement of local knowledge and local populations
- Understanding unique regulations like data sovereignty for indigenous groups

The paper also discusses the complex landscape of AI regulations worldwide and implications for bias research.

Main Contributions:
- First survey addressing the gap between bias mitigation techniques and the needs of under-represented societies 
- Analysis of bias metrics, datasets and mitigation methods from the lens of indigenous groups
- Case study of New Zealand society showing requirements for adopting existing methods 
- Discussion on emerging regulations and their impact on capabilities for tackling bias globally

The key message is that current bias mitigation practices cannot simply be "plugged in" for under-represented societies. Modifications incorporating local contexts and participation of local communities are necessary.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of current trends and limitations in techniques for identifying and mitigating bias in large language models, arguing that current practices do not address the needs of under-represented societies and providing requirements for adopting existing techniques using New Zealand as an example, while also discussing ongoing changes to regulations and legislation worldwide.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

(i) It presents a survey synthesizing the current trends in, and limitations of, bias-related research for large language models (LLMs). The focus is on techniques that detect and mitigate bias in LLMs, including an overview of bias metrics, benchmark datasets and mitigation techniques.

(ii) It argues that current practices tackling the bias problem do not address the needs of under-represented societies. It uses New Zealand as an example to present requirements for adopting existing techniques to under-represented societies.  

(iii) It provides an overview of the impact of current regulations and legislation on AI, LLM, and bias-related research.

In summary, this paper surveys the landscape of bias research for LLMs, analyzes the gap with respect to under-represented societies, and discusses relevant regulations and legislation. Its main contribution is synthesizing the state-of-the-art and limitations regarding bias in LLMs, especially concerning the needs of marginalized communities.

The paper provides a comprehensive survey synthesizing current trends and limitations in techniques for identifying and mitigating bias in large language models (LLMs). It argues that current practices do not address the needs of under-represented societies and uses New Zealand as an example. The paper categorizes techniques into bias metrics, benchmark datasets, and debiasing methods. It also discusses ongoing changes and implications to regulations and legislation related to AI and bias. Key terms reflect these main topics and components covered in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues that current practices for tackling bias do not address the needs of underrepresented societies. What specific requirements or considerations are needed when adapting existing bias detection and mitigation techniques for use in underrepresented societies?

2. The paper categorizes bias metrics into embeddings-based, probability-based, and generated text-based. What are some of the key limitations of each category of metrics when applied to underrepresented societies? How can these limitations be addressed?  

3. The paper provides an analysis of bias benchmark datasets from the perspective of underrepresented societies. What additional annotation details, data sources, or style of data might be needed to create more relevant datasets? What challenges might arise?

4. Data-related debiasing techniques often rely on pre-defined lists of terms or attributes. Why is acquiring sufficient relevant lists more difficult for underrepresented societies? How else might data-related techniques need to be adapted?  

5. Model parameter-related techniques require additional data and computational resources. What types of partnerships or methodologies could help facilitate the use of these techniques for minorities and indigenous groups?

6. The paper argues decoding algorithms should be carefully considered regarding impacts on underrepresented groups. What types of harms could occur and how might they be safeguarded against?  

7. How feasible would it be to create an LLM specifically tailored to reflect the experience, culture, and history of an underrepresented society? What would be the major obstacles and considerations?   

8. The paper discusses New Zealand regulations needing to honor MƒÅori data sovereignty principles. What exactly do these principles entail and what implications exist for tackling bias?

9. What types of community engagement approaches could help ensure techniques for tackling bias are designed inclusively and address the needs of affected societies? 

10. The paper argues cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural dialogue is essential for successfully regulating AI and mitigating algorithmic harms. What steps could technology companies take to better embed diversity and inclusion across the AI model development process?
