# [SPEAL: Skeletal Prior Embedded Attention Learning for Cross-Source Point   Cloud Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08664)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel learning-based method called SPEAL (Skeletal Prior Embedded Attention Learning) for robust point cloud registration, especially for challenging cross-source scenarios. The key idea is to leverage a medial axis transform (MAT)-based skeletal representation of point clouds to capture geometric intricacies and facilitate accurate correspondences. The method has three main components: (1) The Skeleton Extraction Module (SEM) that extracts skeleton points and features in an unsupervised manner, making it robust to noise and density changes. (2) The Skeleton-Aware GeoTransformer (SAGTR) that encodes high-level skeleton-aware features using self- and cross-attention layers, explicitly modeling topological structure and inter-cloud correlations. (3) The Correspondence Dual-Sampler (CDS) that establishes reliable correspondences between clouds by matching both regular points and skeleton points. Experiments on cross-source datasets KITTI-CS and GermanyForest show state-of-the-art performance. The method also achieves strong results on the regular KITTI dataset. Overall, SPEAL demonstrates that incorporating skeletal priors enables more robust point cloud registration, especially for challenging cross-source cases with noise, outlier, scale/density changes.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Point cloud registration is a fundamental computer vision task with challenges arising from noise, outliers, scale and density variations, especially for cross-source point clouds in unstructured scenes. Current methods fail to effectively capture the intrinsic topological structures and geometric intricacies of point clouds, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method:
This paper proposes a novel approach called SPEAL (Skeletal Prior Embedded Attention Learning) that leverages skeletal representations to learn discriminative features and robust correspondences. The key ideas are:

1) Skeleton Extraction Module (SEM) extracts skeleton points and features that are robust to noise and density changes.

2) Skeleton-Aware GeoTransformer (SAGTR) encodes topological structures and inter-point-cloud correlations using the skeleton representations. This allows capturing geometric intricacies effectively.

3) Correspondence Dual-Sampler (CDS) establishes accurate hybrid correspondences between superpoints and skeleton points. A spectral denoising step further refines the skeletal correspondences.

Together, these components integrate the skeletal geometric priors into a transformer architecture for robust cross-source registration.

Contributions:
1) First registration method to utilize skeletal priors for superior performance.

2) Effective skeleton extraction and incorporation of skeletal features via proposed SEM, SAGTR and CDS modules. Achieves SOTA results.

3) Introduction of KITTI Cross-Source dataset to benchmark cross-source methods, addressing a pressing need.

Experiments extensively demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both cross-source and same-source datasets. The method shows great robustness, especially in challenging cases of low overlap, scale/density differences and unstructured scenes.
