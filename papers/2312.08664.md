## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel learning-based method called SPEAL (Skeletal Prior Embedded Attention Learning) for robust point cloud registration, especially for challenging cross-source scenarios. The key idea is to leverage a medial axis transform (MAT)-based skeletal representation of point clouds to capture geometric intricacies and facilitate accurate correspondences. The method has three main components: (1) The Skeleton Extraction Module (SEM) that extracts skeleton points and features in an unsupervised manner, making it robust to noise and density changes. (2) The Skeleton-Aware GeoTransformer (SAGTR) that encodes high-level skeleton-aware features using self- and cross-attention layers, explicitly modeling topological structure and inter-cloud correlations. (3) The Correspondence Dual-Sampler (CDS) that establishes reliable correspondences between clouds by matching both regular points and skeleton points. Experiments on cross-source datasets KITTI-CS and GermanyForest show state-of-the-art performance. The method also achieves strong results on the regular KITTI dataset. Overall, SPEAL demonstrates that incorporating skeletal priors enables more robust point cloud registration, especially for challenging cross-source cases with noise, outlier, scale/density changes.
