# [A Hierarchical Representation Network for Accurate and Detailed Face   Reconstruction from In-The-Wild Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14434)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research goal of this paper is to develop an accurate and detailed 3D face reconstruction method from single or sparse-view images. Specifically, the paper aims to address the limitations of existing 3DMM-based face reconstruction methods, which lack the ability to recover high-frequency facial details such as wrinkles and expression lines. The key hypothesis is that representing the facial geometry in a hierarchical manner - with low-frequency, mid-frequency, and high-frequency components - can help disentangle and better model the different levels of facial details. The proposed hierarchical representation network (HRN) implements this idea by using a coarse 3DMM shape, a deformation map, and a displacement map to represent the geometry at different frequencies. In summary, the central research question is how to achieve highly detailed 3D face reconstruction from limited input images. The key hypothesis is that hierarchically modeling geometry can enable detail disentanglement and accurate reconstruction of both global shape and high-frequency details. The experiments aim to validate if the proposed HRN framework can achieve state-of-the-art results on this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel hierarchical representation network (HRN) for accurate and detailed 3D face reconstruction from a single in-the-wild image. 2. It presents a hierarchical modeling strategy to disentangle and represent the facial geometry into low-frequency, mid-frequency and high-frequency components using different representations (coefficients, deformation map, displacement map).3. It incorporates 3D priors of facial details learned from 3D scans to guide the modeling of mid- and high-frequency details, improving accuracy and realism. 4. It proposes a de-retouching module to refine the texture and achieve better separation of geometry and appearance.5. It extends the framework to multi-view 3D face reconstruction (MV-HRN) by enforcing consistency of shape details across views.6. It introduces a new high-quality 3D facial database (FaceHD-100) to facilitate research on sparse-view and high-fidelity 3D face reconstruction.7. Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both single-view and multi-view 3D face reconstruction across different datasets.In summary, the key innovation is the hierarchical representation for disentangling and recovering facial details at different frequencies, guided by learned 3D priors and enabled by the proposed modules. This leads to highly accurate and detailed 3D face reconstruction from one or more images.
