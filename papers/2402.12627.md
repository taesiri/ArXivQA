## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Machine learning models face significant challenges when deployed in real-world dynamic environments where data distributions can change over time. Two key research problems studied around this issue of "data change" are domain shift and concept drift. 

Domain shift refers to changes in data distribution when moving from a source domain to a target domain, such as when deploying a model trained on one dataset to a new unseen dataset. Concept drift refers to changes in data distribution in online non-stationary environments where the streaming data distribution evolves gradually over time. Both pose challenges for model performance.

This paper provides a systematic review unifying the perspectives, methods, and applications for addressing data change across the fields of domain shift and concept drift. It proposes a three-phase categorization scheme - (1) problem detection, (2) problem handling/adaptation, and (3) other factors, to consolidate the techniques and illuminate similarities and differences.

Key Contributions:

- Reviews state-of-the-art methods for out-of-domain detection, domain adaptation, fast adaptation, test-time adaptation, concept drift detection and adaptation, label shift/drift, and continual learning. 

- Identifies common techniques like distribution learning, ensemble methods, regularization, partial network updating, and active learning emerging in both fields to handle data change.

- Discusses unique focus and complementary strengths of the two fields - distribution modeling techniques in domain shift and statistical/temporal modeling techniques for efficiency in concept drift. 

- Provides an industrial perspective on efficiency constraints, model robustness, usability issues and case studies in manufacturing and healthcare applications.

- Proposes future directions such as efficient temporal modeling, incorporating humans in the loop, and establishing a human-machine cooperation paradigm.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the data change problem, highlighting shared principles and complementary advances across domain shift and concept drift research. The unified perspective and industrial insights provide valuable guidance for developing reliable and usable solutions.
