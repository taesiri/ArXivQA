# [Designing LLM Chains by Adapting Techniques from Crowdsourcing Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11681)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Large language models (LLMs) suffer from quality issues like hallucinations and brittleness when used for complex, multi-step tasks. To address this, recent work has explored "chaining" techniques where a task is decomposed into multiple LLM calls. However, designing effective LLM chains is challenging given the vast design space. 

Solution: This paper draws inspiration from over a decade of research on crowdsourcing workflows, which similarly decompose complex human work, to provide guidance on LLM chain design. The key contributions are:

1) A design space synthesized from a literature analysis of 107 crowdsourcing workflow and LLM chaining papers. The design space provides high-level "objectives" like accuracy or creativity, "strategies" to achieve them like quality control mechanisms, and low-level "tactics" like specific workflow architectures.

2) Three case studies adapting popular crowdsourcing workflows for LLMs: taxonomy creation, text shortening, and story generation. By qualitatively and quantitatively evaluating these chains versus zero-shot baselines, the authors gain insights into how tactical designs may need to differ for LLMs versus human crowd workers.

3) An analysis of what does and does not transfer from crowdsourcing to guide LLM chain development. Key high-level concepts like objectives and strategies transfer directly. However, the different capabilities of LLMs versus humans means that specific tactic designs, like the complexity of subtasks, often need to be adapted. The paper recommends tactics to explore in future LLM chaining research.

In summary, this paper contributes a literature-based LLM chaining design space, case studies applying this guidance, and an assessment of concepts that do and do not transfer from crowdsourcing to help researchers systematically build better LLM chains.
