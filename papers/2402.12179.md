# [Examining Monitoring System: Detecting Abnormal Behavior In Online   Examinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12179)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the widespread issue of cheating in online examinations, which has become more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic as exams have moved online. Candidates take advantage of the remote setting to frequently look around, search documents, and copy answers from others. This makes it very difficult for proctors to manually monitor large numbers of students effectively.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an "Exam Monitoring System" that uses AI and computer vision techniques to automatically detect abnormal behavior during online exams in real-time. The system monitors the video feeds from students' webcams and classifies behaviors as either normal or abnormal compared to a baseline.

Key Functions:
- Real-time monitoring: Classifies student behaviors from webcam feeds as normal or abnormal during the exam. Flags are raised for proctors to review.
- Abnormality alerts: Immediately alerts proctors when abnormal behaviors are detected, along with captured images for review. Can lock the exam if thresholds are exceeded until proctor intervenes.

Technical Details:
- Curated a dataset of 1200 images showing cheating scenarios like head/eye movements or mask wearing. 
- Tried CNN, VGG16, MobileNet models but prioritized Mediapipe + Fully Connected model for speed (27 FPS).
- Achieves 78.5% accuracy on a test set with a new student, making 157 correct predictions out of 200 frames.
- Real-time processing enables monitoring 20 students simultaneously.

Main Contributions:
- Addresses limitations in existing proctoring systems at scale, reducing proctor effort.
- Enhances fairness and mitigates widespread cheating in online assessments. 
- High accuracy and speed for real-time cheating detection.
- Provides proactive alerts and review system to aid proctor decision making.

Future Work: 
- Improvements like multi-label classification, facial recognition, and object detection.
- Work towards eliminating need for human proctors altogether.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an exam monitoring system that uses computer vision techniques to detect abnormal behavior in online exams and assist proctors in mitigating cheating.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution stated is:

"Our contributions include:
\begin{itemize}  
\item Enhancing fairness and effectiveness in online exam monitoring.  
\item Managing exam cheating using AI-driven approaches.  
\item Facilitating informed decision-making with AI assistance."
\end{itemize}

In summary, the paper proposes an "Exam Monitoring System" that uses AI and computer vision techniques to detect abnormal behavior during online exams in real-time. This system aims to assist proctors in identifying potential cheating and making informed decisions, thereby promoting fairness and mitigating cheating issues in online exams. The key innovations are using AI for cheating detection and providing proctors with actionable information.

It extracts facial landmarks with Mediapipe and classifies behaviors as normal or abnormal. Key aspects examined are maximizing model accuracy and speed for real-time performance. So keywords like "online exams", "cheating detection", "abnormal behavior", "real-time", "Mediapipe", "computer vision", and "model accuracy and speed" accurately reflect the core focus and contributions of this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using Mediapipe for facial landmark extraction. What are some of the key advantages and disadvantages of using Mediapipe over other facial landmark extraction techniques?

2. The paper compares multiple models like CNN, VGG16, MobileNetv3 before settling on Mediapipe + Fully Connected layer. What could be some of the reasons for this choice? How can this choice of model be further justified?

3. The method seems to use Euclidean distance between facial landmarks as the key features. What is the intuition behind using these distances as features? How robust are these features likely to be in real-world deployment?

4. The paper reports an accuracy of 78.5% on the test set. What could be some likely reasons for the drop in accuracy compared to the validation set? How can the accuracy be further improved?  

5. The model seems to be optimized for speed rather than state-of-the-art accuracy. What are some techniques that could help improve accuracy without compromising too much on speed?

6. The paper mentions a threshold system to lock the exam after multiple violations. How should this threshold be optimally set? What are some challenges with setting the right threshold?

7. The test set consists of a single new person not present in the training set. How can the model's ability to generalize to completely new individuals be further tested and improved?

8. The paper collects data from multiple realistic scenarios. However, what are some limitations of the dataset collection process? How can a more robust dataset be constructed?

9. The system seems to only consider vision-based features. How can audio or other modalities provide complementary signals to improve detection accuracy?

10. The conclusion mentions deploying this system without human proctors. What are some challenges still remaining to realize such a goal? What future work could address this?
