# [Examining Monitoring System: Detecting Abnormal Behavior In Online   Examinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12179)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the widespread issue of cheating in online examinations, which has become more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic as exams have moved online. Candidates take advantage of the remote setting to frequently look around, search documents, and copy answers from others. This makes it very difficult for proctors to manually monitor large numbers of students effectively.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an "Exam Monitoring System" that uses AI and computer vision techniques to automatically detect abnormal behavior during online exams in real-time. The system monitors the video feeds from students' webcams and classifies behaviors as either normal or abnormal compared to a baseline.

Key Functions:
- Real-time monitoring: Classifies student behaviors from webcam feeds as normal or abnormal during the exam. Flags are raised for proctors to review.
- Abnormality alerts: Immediately alerts proctors when abnormal behaviors are detected, along with captured images for review. Can lock the exam if thresholds are exceeded until proctor intervenes.

Technical Details:
- Curated a dataset of 1200 images showing cheating scenarios like head/eye movements or mask wearing. 
- Tried CNN, VGG16, MobileNet models but prioritized Mediapipe + Fully Connected model for speed (27 FPS).
- Achieves 78.5% accuracy on a test set with a new student, making 157 correct predictions out of 200 frames.
- Real-time processing enables monitoring 20 students simultaneously.

Main Contributions:
- Addresses limitations in existing proctoring systems at scale, reducing proctor effort.
- Enhances fairness and mitigates widespread cheating in online assessments. 
- High accuracy and speed for real-time cheating detection.
- Provides proactive alerts and review system to aid proctor decision making.

Future Work: 
- Improvements like multi-label classification, facial recognition, and object detection.
- Work towards eliminating need for human proctors altogether.
