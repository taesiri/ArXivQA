# [Competition-Level Problems Are Effective Evaluators of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02143)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper evaluates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 on competition-level programming problems from Codeforces. These problems require complex reasoning skills and are uniquely created by experts, reducing likelihood of data contamination. Surprisingly, the paper finds GPT-4's perceived performance sharply declines on problems released after Sept 2021, consistently across difficulties. This suggests issues in reasoning ability and generalization beyond its training data. The paper also shows GPT-4 struggles more on difficult problems and often fails on even the first test case, indicating challenges in deep understanding. Similar phenomena are observed in other code LLMs too. The paper tries straightforward methods like fine-tuning and prompting to improve the performance, but none help much, especially on difficult unseen problems. Overall, the paper establishes competition problems as an excellent benchmark to assess LLMs' reasoning skills, highlights the common pitfalls, and motivates developing models with stronger generalization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates the reasoning capabilities of large language models using recent competition-level programming problems, finding significant performance declines on unseen problems that highlight concerns about overreliance on memorization and limitations in complex reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and validating that recent competition-level programming problems serve as an excellent data source for assessing the genuine reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the paper:

1) Provides an in-depth analysis of the zero-shot performance of LLMs like GPT-4 on programming problems from Codeforces competitions, considering factors like problem release time, difficulty level, and error types. 

2) Shows a significant performance drop of GPT-4 on problems released after September 2021, indicating potential issues with reasoning abilities and generalization to complex unseen tasks.

3) Extends the analysis to other LLMs like CodeLlama and DeepSeek-Coder and observes similar performance limitations on new problems. 

4) Explores methods like fine-tuning, prompting, and problem simplification to improve performance on unseen tasks, but shows they do not consistently mitigate the issues.

5) Emphasizes the value of competition programming problems as an evaluation benchmark for assessing genuine reasoning skills of LLMs, while reducing potential data contamination.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating that recent competition problems can effectively evaluate LLMs' reasoning capacities and generalization abilities for complex problem-solving.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1) This paper proposes using recent competition programming problems to evaluate language models' reasoning abilities. What are some of the key advantages and disadvantages of this evaluation approach compared to other common benchmarks?

2) The paper finds a significant performance drop on unseen programming problems after September 2021 across various difficulties. What are some potential explanations for this sharp decline? How could the authors further analyze the causes behind it? 

3) The authors explore fine-tuning, chain-of-thought prompting, and problem simplification to try to improve performance on unseen problems. However, none of these are very effective. What are some other techniques that could be tried instead? Why might they potentially perform better?

4) The paper emphasizes the importance of minimizing overlap between the training and testing data for language models. However, in practice this can be quite difficult. What are some concrete strategies researchers could use to better enforce this separation when creating benchmarks?

5) The competition programming problems used in this paper require a combination of reasoning, coding, and problem solving skills. How suitable are these tasks for analyzing different aspects of language model capabilities compared to other specialized benchmarks targeting individual skills?

6) The paper analyzes performance over time on problems categorized into 3 difficulty tiers. Could additional finer-grained difficulty ratings provide more insights into language models' reasoning limitations? What alternative problem characteristic taxonomies could be useful?

7) The authors find GPT-4 struggles even on the first test case, indicating potential issues in comprehending the problem statement. How could the language models' understanding of the problem statements be analyzed further? 

8) The paper studies multiple large language models like GPT-4, CodeLlama, and DeepSeeker-Coder. What are some key architectural, objective, or data differences between these models that could help explain performance discrepancies observed?

9) The analysis finds widely used language models struggle on complex reasoning tasks, indicating intrinsic limitations. What modifications to model architecture, training process, or objectives could help address these reasoning challenges? 

10) The paper proposes competition programming problems for evaluating reasoning, but what other challenging or expert-created tasks could serve as effective benchmarks while also minimizing training/testing contamination?
