# [Competition-Level Problems Are Effective Evaluators of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02143)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper evaluates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 on competition-level programming problems from Codeforces. These problems require complex reasoning skills and are uniquely created by experts, reducing likelihood of data contamination. Surprisingly, the paper finds GPT-4's perceived performance sharply declines on problems released after Sept 2021, consistently across difficulties. This suggests issues in reasoning ability and generalization beyond its training data. The paper also shows GPT-4 struggles more on difficult problems and often fails on even the first test case, indicating challenges in deep understanding. Similar phenomena are observed in other code LLMs too. The paper tries straightforward methods like fine-tuning and prompting to improve the performance, but none help much, especially on difficult unseen problems. Overall, the paper establishes competition problems as an excellent benchmark to assess LLMs' reasoning skills, highlights the common pitfalls, and motivates developing models with stronger generalization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates the reasoning capabilities of large language models using recent competition-level programming problems, finding significant performance declines on unseen problems that highlight concerns about overreliance on memorization and limitations in complex reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and validating that recent competition-level programming problems serve as an excellent data source for assessing the genuine reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the paper:

1) Provides an in-depth analysis of the zero-shot performance of LLMs like GPT-4 on programming problems from Codeforces competitions, considering factors like problem release time, difficulty level, and error types. 

2) Shows a significant performance drop of GPT-4 on problems released after September 2021, indicating potential issues with reasoning abilities and generalization to complex unseen tasks.

3) Extends the analysis to other LLMs like CodeLlama and DeepSeek-Coder and observes similar performance limitations on new problems. 

4) Explores methods like fine-tuning, prompting, and problem simplification to improve performance on unseen tasks, but shows they do not consistently mitigate the issues.

5) Emphasizes the value of competition programming problems as an evaluation benchmark for assessing genuine reasoning skills of LLMs, while reducing potential data contamination.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating that recent competition problems can effectively evaluate LLMs' reasoning capacities and generalization abilities for complex problem-solving.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
There is ongoing debate about the actual reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and concerns over potential data contamination issues in benchmarks used to evaluate them. The paper aims to assess the reasoning abilities of LLMs by testing their performance on solving recent competition-level programming problems from Codeforces. These problems require deep understanding, reasoning and coding skills, and have unique test cases, making them an excellent benchmark.  

Methods & Findings:
- The paper comprehensively evaluates GPT-4's perceived zero-shot performance on programming problems of varying difficulties and release times. Surprisingly, there is a sharp drop in performance on problems released after Sept 2021, indicating potential data contamination issues and challenges in solving new complex problems.

- GPT-4 shows limited ability in solving more difficult problems, even among those released before Sept 2021 that it potentially encountered during pre-training. This suggests weaknesses in handling complex challenges.  

- Analysis of error types shows GPT-4 often struggles on the first test case, suggesting limitations in fully understanding problem requirements.

- Similar performance drops are observed with other code LLMs like CodeLlama and DeepSeek-Coder on unseen problems, indicating common underlying issues.

- Attempts to improve performance via fine-tuning, prompting and problem simplification do not lead to consistent gains, especially on difficult problems. This validates their utility as highly challenging benchmarks.

Contributions:
- Establishes competition programming problems as an excellent data source to evaluate reasoning abilities of LLMs using unique and rigorously created problems. 
- Reveals limitations of existing LLMs in complex reasoning and generalization.
- Highlights the need for models to demonstrate stronger reasoning skills and generalization on novel complex problems.
- Provides benchmark data and insights to drive progress in developing LLMs with robust reasoning abilities.

In summary, the paper clearly highlights the challenges faced by current LLMs on complex reasoning tasks and the need for more reliable evaluation approaches to accurately assess reasoning skills. The proposed competition programming problems offer a rigorous benchmark to further AI capabilities in this direction.
