# [SumTra: A Differentiable Pipeline for Few-Shot Cross-Lingual   Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13240)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Cross-lingual summarization (XLS) aims to generate summaries in a different language than the input documents. However, dedicated XLS training data is scarce. Fine-tuning large pretrained multilingual models struggles with uneven pretraining across languages, language interference, and catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned with monolingual data. This makes it challenging to achieve good zero-shot and few-shot performance.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes SumTra, a differentiable pipeline with separate summarization and translation modules. By reusing abundant monolingual summarization data and translation models, SumTra achieves strong zero-shot performance. The pipeline remains trainable end-to-end via "soft" summary predictions, enabling few-shot fine-tuning. A backtranslation loss grounds the intermediate summaries to the target language.

Main Contributions:
- SumTra pipeline with state-of-the-art modular summarizer and translator. 
- Fully differentiable via soft predictions for end-to-end fine-tuning.
- Novel objective incorporating backtranslation loss over the summarizer.
- Extensive comparative evaluation over two XLS datasets spanning 12 languages.
- Strong zero-shot performance leveraging monolingual resources.
- Competitive few-shot performance, outperforming multilingual LM baselines with 10% of the fine-tuning data.
- Analyses highlighting model coupling, error propagation alleviation from fine-tuning, acceptable memory/speed overheads.

In summary, SumTra provides an effective way to achieve competitive XLS performance by reusing existing monolingual summarization and translation resources. The modular yet trainable architecture specifically addresses the limitations of large multilingual models.
