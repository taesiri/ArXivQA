# [SeaEval for Multilingual Foundation Models: From Cross-Lingual Alignment   to Cultural Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04766)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we develop a comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmark to assess the capabilities of multilingual foundation models, especially in terms of their reasoning ability, cultural understanding, and cross-lingual knowledge sharing?

The key hypotheses that the paper puts forth are:

- Multilingual foundation models should demonstrate strong capabilities in classic NLP tasks, complex reasoning, cultural comprehension, and effective cross-lingual knowledge transfer. 

- Existing evaluation benchmarks are insufficient to fully assess these capabilities, especially in multilingual and multicultural contexts.

- By developing new datasets and evaluation protocols focusing on cultural reasoning and cross-lingual consistency, we can gain deeper insights into the current limitations of multilingual foundation models.

In summary, the central goal is to propose a systematic benchmark called SeaEval to evaluate multilingual foundation models, with a focus on assessing their cultural comprehension, cross-lingual knowledge sharing, robustness to varied instructions, and reasoning abilities. The key hypothesis is that this benchmark will surface deficiencies in existing models and provide direction for future improvements.

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of evaluating multilingual foundation models:

- Scope: This paper presents a more comprehensive benchmark called "SeaEval" for evaluating multilingual foundation models, covering more languages (English, Chinese, Indonesian) and dimensions (fundamental capabilities, reasoning, cultural knowledge, cross-lingual transfer) compared to previous benchmarks that tend to focus on monolingual or just English and Chinese models.

- New datasets: The paper introduces 6 new datasets tailored for assessing cultural reasoning and cross-lingual consistency, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks. Other benchmarks like GLUE tend to use existing public datasets.

- Metrics: Beyond standard accuracy metrics, this paper proposes two new metrics - instruction sensitivity and cross-lingual consistency to measure model stability and alignment across languages. Other papers have relied more on conventional accuracy metrics.

- Findings: The empirical analysis provides some novel findings like inconsistent performance of models on semantically equivalent cross-lingual queries, suggesting inadequate multilingual alignment. Many other papers report performance on standard datasets without deeper investigation.

- Models: The paper experiments with the latest open-sourced models like LLaMA, Baichuan as well as closed models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. Other papers frequently evaluate only on older or commercial models.

Overall, this paper pushes multilingual evaluation to be more comprehensive, rigorous and revealing of model capabilities and limitations. The new datasets, metrics and findings provide a more in-depth characterization compared to other existing benchmarking studies. The comprehensive SeaEval framework and analysis will be a valuable resource for future research on multilingual models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Incorporate additional languages and cultural reasoning datasets into SeaEval to expand linguistic and cultural diversity. The authors note the need to explore automated methods for data collection to enhance scalability.

- Develop effective automatic assessment approaches for evaluating open-ended questions and interactions. The authors point out the challenges in evaluating faithfulness, expertise and engagement for subjective questions and dialogues. 

- Include evaluation of safety and efficiency, which are noted as two important dimensions for foundation models. Assessing real-time safety and balancing effectiveness vs efficiency require further research.

- Extend the robustness analysis to include different levels and types of variations in the input instructions. The authors suggest this can provide deeper insights into model capabilities and limitations.

- Enhance multilingual models' capability for semantic comprehension and generalizable representations to process varied instructions robustly. This can help improve consistency across languages.

- Explore techniques to improve cross-lingual alignment and knowledge transfer in multilingual models, to achieve more balanced proficiency across languages.

In summary, the key future directions are expanding linguistic and cultural coverage, evaluating subjective interactions, analyzing model safety and efficiency, robustness testing with input variations, improving semantic comprehension and generalization, and enhancing multilingual alignment and knowledge transfer. The authors position SeaEval as a starting point for more in-depth multilingual and multicultural evaluation.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem and questions addressed in this paper are:

- The paper introduces SeaEval, a new comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multilingual foundation models (FMs). It aims to assess FMs across four key dimensions: (1) classic NLP tasks, (2) complex reasoning, (3) cultural comprehension, and (4) cross-lingual knowledge transfer. 

- Existing benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) have limitations, especially for multilingual models. Many focus only on English or Chinese, test only monolingual skills, lack cultural reasoning tasks, and do not sufficiently test cross-lingual knowledge sharing.

- The paper wants to evaluate how well current multilingual FMs display four desired capabilities: multilinguality, reasoning, cultural understanding, and cross-lingual knowledge transfer. It also wants to test their robustness and stability using paraphrased instructions and consistency across languages.

- To address these gaps, the paper introduces SeaEval, which includes 28 datasets spanning 5 languages and incorporates new tasks for cultural reasoning and cross-lingual assessments. It also utilizes new evaluation protocols like instruction sensitivity and cross-lingual consistency alongside accuracy.

In summary, the key problem is the lack of comprehensive benchmarks to effectively evaluate multilingual foundation models, especially for cultural reasoning and cross-lingual capabilities. SeaEval aims to address this by providing a more thorough test suite and evaluation methodology.
