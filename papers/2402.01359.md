# [TESSERACT: Eliminating Experimental Bias in Malware Classification   across Space and Time (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01359)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper identifies two common sources of experimental bias that can inflate the performance results of machine learning-based malware classifiers:

1. Temporal bias: Caused by incorrect train-test splits of data over time, which can inadvertently provide the model with future knowledge or create unrealistic settings. This is especially problematic for concept drift detection.

2. Spatial bias: Unrealistic assumptions about the ratio of goodware to malware in the dataset. The distribution of training and testing data needs to match what would be encountered in a real-world deployment.

These biases can result in misleadingly high performance scores that do not reflect how well classifiers would work when deployed.

Proposed Solution:

1. A set of 3 spatio-temporal constraints that must be enforced for realistic, unbiased evaluations:
    - Temporal training consistency 
    - Temporal goodware/malware time-window consistency
    - Realistic malware-to-goodware ratio in testing

2. A new time-aware performance metric called Area Under Time (AUT) to quantify classifier robustness over time.

3. An algorithm to tune the training data ratio to optimize desired performance goals like F1-score, precision, or recall. 

4. An open-source Python library called Tesseract that implements the constraints, metrics, and algorithms.  

Key Contributions:

- Identify and validate temporal and spatial bias through experiments on an Android malware dataset with over 250K apps from 2014-2018. Show inflated performance can decrease by 50% when eliminating biases.

- Propose first concrete methodology (constraints, metrics, algorithms, tooling) to enable unbiased evaluations that reveal true classifier performance over time.

- Demonstrate how eliminating bias leads to counter-intuitive results about classifier effectiveness. Highlight need for regular retraining.

- Extend analysis to Windows PE and PDF malware domains. Show benefits of tuning training data even when concept drift is less pronounced.

Overall, the paper makes an important contribution in identifying and addressing experimental biases to enable more robust malware classifier evaluations aligned with real-world conditions. The proposed Tesseract library aims to promote adoption of sound practices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper identifies and addresses sources of temporal and spatial bias that can artificially inflate the performance of machine learning-based Android malware classifiers, and proposes novel constraints, metrics, and a tuning algorithm to enable more realistic evaluations that reveal actual classifier robustness and facilitate fair comparisons.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to improving the evaluation of machine learning-based malware classifiers:

1. It identifies two common sources of experimental bias that can inflate performance results: temporal bias from incorrect train-test splits or violating the temporal ordering of data, and spatial bias from unrealistic assumptions about malware-to-goodware ratios in the data. 

2. It proposes a set of constraints (C1, C2, C3) that need to be enforced to ensure a sound, unbiased evaluation that reflects real-world conditions. This includes ensuring temporal consistency of the data splits and using a realistic ratio of malware in the test data.

3. It introduces a new time-aware metric called AUT that measures classifier performance over time while considering concept drift. This allows fair comparison of different classifiers. 

4. It provides an algorithm to tune the malware percentage in the training data to optimize a chosen performance metric like F1 score or precision.

5. It releases Tesseract, an open-source Python library that implements these ideas. Tesseract allows unbiased evaluations and reveals counter-intuitive performance results of classifiers.

In summary, the key contribution is a methodology and toolset to eliminate bias and properly evaluate malware classifiers in a realistic setting across time, providing more accurate insights into their real-world effectiveness.
