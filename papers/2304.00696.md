# [Thermal Spread Functions (TSF): Physics-guided Material Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00696)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we accurately classify materials by analyzing their thermal properties using a thermal camera?

Specifically, the paper proposes an approach to:

1) Recover the thermal diffusivity and absorptivity of materials from thermal images captured over time using a novel differentiable finite difference method. 

2) Use the recovered thermal properties to classify materials into categories like fabric, wood, paper, metals, etc. using machine learning techniques.

The key ideas are:

- Capturing a material's response over time to heating and cooling reveals its unique Thermal Spread Function (TSF) which depends on its thermal properties. 

- Directly analyzing the TSF images has drawbacks, so the paper develops a physics-based finite difference method to recover the thermal parameters diffusivity and absorptivity.

- These thermal parameters form natural clusters for each material, enabling classification using random forests or other ML techniques.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by recovering thermal properties from thermal camera images using their proposed approach, materials can be accurately classified in an efficient manner. The paper aims to demonstrate this methodology.
