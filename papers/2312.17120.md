# [Generative AI for Math: Part I -- MathPile: A Billion-Token-Scale   Pretraining Corpus for Math](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17120)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper introduces MathPile, a new large-scale pretraining corpus focused on mathematics. The key motivation is that existing corpora used for pretraining language models generally lack mathematical content. Yet having strong capabilities in mathematical reasoning is crucial for advanced AI systems.  

To address this gap, the authors construct MathPile, a diverse 9.5 billion token dataset collected from various high-quality sources including textbooks, lecture notes, academic papers from ArXiv, Wikipedia math articles, Stack Exchange posts,ProofWiki, and filtered webpages.

A key contribution is the meticulous data processing pipeline to ensure MathPile's quality and diversity. This encompasses language identification, cleaning, filtering based on math-specific rules, deduplication using locality-sensitive hashing, and data contamination detection by checking for overlaps with downstream math benchmark datasets.  

The paper highlights unique aspects of MathPile compared to other mathematical corpora like OpenWebMath. In particular, MathPile incorporates more diverse sources beyond just webpages, focuses on quality over raw scale, and performs extensive deduplication and data contamination checks.

Overall, MathPile helps advance the field of AI for mathematics by providing an open-source, cleaned mathematical corpus to facilitate pretraining for researchers. Detailed documentation about the dataset composition and curation process also enhances transparency. The authors aim for MathPile to spur more capable and inclusive mathematical reasoning in language models.
