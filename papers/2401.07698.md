## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reasoning about distance is important for manipulation tasks that involve establishing or avoiding contact. Signed distance functions (SDFs) are a useful representation for this, but commonly used methods like neural networks or Gaussian processes have limitations.

Method: 
- The paper presents an online method to learn SDFs using piecewise polynomial basis functions. This offers a smooth and continuous representation without needing to store training data.

- Bernstein polynomial basis functions are used to represent the SDF in a piecewise way. Weights of the basis functions are computed with an incremental least squares method to fit to incoming points and normals. Regularization is added to constrain curvature.

- The formulation allows fast query of distance and gradients, scales linearly at test time, and does not require storing training data. Priors can be incorporated through the initial weights.

Experiments & Results:
- Reconstruction accuracy is evaluated on a dataset of household objects and compared to neural network and Gaussian process models. The proposed method achieves competitive accuracy even with limited data.

- Real-time physical experiments demonstrate the potential for using the evolving SDF representation to provide feedback for manipulation control. Updates can be performed fast enough for closed-loop control.

Main Contributions:
- A piecewise polynomial formulation for online learning of implicit SDFs from point cloud data
- Regularized least squares fitting and incremental updates enable real-time learning without storing data
- Accuracy comparable to neural networks and Gaussian processes in representing distances and gradients
- Demonstrates potential for using live SDF updates to guide robotic manipulation

The method offers an interpretable and simple but effective way to learn continuous SDF representations online for providing feedback during physical interaction.

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is an online method for learning implicit signed distance functions represented as piecewise polynomial basis functions. Specifically:

- The paper presents an incremental least squares approach with regularization to approximate distance fields from incoming surface points and normals using piecewise polynomial basis functions. 

- The method enables fast access to distance and analytical gradients without needing to store training data, and can be run in real-time on both GPU and CPU.
