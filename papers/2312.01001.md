# [Learning county from pixels: Corn yield prediction with   attention-weighted multiple instance learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01001)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- County-level corn yield prediction is important for agriculture planning and policy-making. Remote sensing (RS) technology has been used for this task.
- Existing methods typically treat each county as a single data point by spatially aggregating all pixels. This overlooks detailed within-county information.  
- There is also a "mixed pixel" issue caused by inconsistent resolutions between RS image bands and crop masks, introducing noise.

Proposed Solution:
- Use multiple instance learning (MIL) to leverage pixel-level data within each county (bag) to enhance prediction while balancing computational load.
- Apply attention mechanism to assign weights to pixels, mitigating impact of mixed pixels. Pixels with more corn get higher weights.

Key Contributions:
- Novel MIL framework to utilize pixel-level details for county prediction task. Addresses lack of pixel-level labels.
- First application of attention mechanism to tackle mixed pixel issue in this context by learning to filter noisy pixels.
- Extensive experiments over 2008-2022 data in US corn belt states. Proposed model outperforms baselines.
- Analysis of learned attention weights validates correlation with pixel purity levels and key input features.
- Demonstrates capability for in-season prediction throughout growing period.

In summary, this paper makes multiple contributions - a MIL-based approach leveraging within-county details, use of attention to handle mixed pixels, strong empirical performance over many years, and analyses providing insights into the model.
