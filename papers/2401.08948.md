# [PINSAT: Parallelized Interleaving of Graph Search and Trajectory   Optimization for Kinodynamic Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08948)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Kinodynamic motion planning algorithms need to reason about dynamics and differential constraints while planning trajectories for robots. Two main approaches exist - discrete search-based methods provide optimality and completeness guarantees but struggle with high-dimensional continuous spaces. In contrast, trajectory optimization methods can efficiently synthesize feasible trajectories by transcending discretization, but they lack guarantees and reasoning over long horizons with obstacles is challenging. 

Recently, an algorithm called INSAT was proposed that combines the strengths of both approaches by interleaving graph search in a low-dimensional space with trajectory optimization in the full space. However, the frequent calls to the expensive optimization routine resulted in slow planning times, limiting its applicability. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces PINSAT, which builds on the ideas from a recent parallel search algorithm called ePA*SE. Specifically, PINSAT decouples the expansion of a state from the evaluation of its outgoing edges. This allows concurrent evaluation of multiple edges using the trajectory optimization routine. Additional modifications like pruning independence checks and asynchronous assignment of edges to threads are incorporated for further speedups.

The trajectory optimization in PINSAT represents trajectories using B-splines. It formulates an optimization problem with constraints on obstacles, duration limits, boundary conditions and derivatives. By exploiting properties of B-splines, this non-convex optimization is relaxed into a convex program that can be solved efficiently. Formal analysis proves that PINSAT retains completeness.

Contributions:
1) A parallel framework to interleave graph search and trajectory optimization that allows concurrent calls to the expensive optimization routine. This results in an order of magnitude speedup over sequential INSAT.

2) Guarantees on completeness unlike other hybrid planners.

3) Demonstrated success in complex 6-DOF manipulation planning problems with dynamics that prior hybrid planners struggled with. Achieved 90% success rate in finding optimal, smooth and dynamically feasible plans within a second across 500 varied start-goal pairs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 PINSAT parallelizes the interleaving of graph search and trajectory optimization in INSAT using edge-based parallel search to achieve faster kinodynamic motion planning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the development of PINSAT, which is a parallelized version of the INSAT algorithm for kinodynamic motion planning. Specifically:

- PINSAT parallelizes the expensive trajectory optimization step in INSAT using ideas from the ePA*SE algorithm. This allows multiple trajectory optimizations to be run concurrently, drastically speeding up the overall planning time.

- The paper shows theoretically that PINSAT preserves the completeness guarantee of INSAT.

- Experiments in a 6-DOF manipulation planning domain demonstrate that PINSAT achieves significantly higher success rates and lower planning times compared to INSAT over a range of thread counts. For example, with 60 threads PINSAT achieves 5x faster mean planning time, 7x faster median planning time, and 1.8x higher success rate than INSAT.

So in summary, the key contribution is the development and experimental validation of PINSAT, a parallelized version of INSAT that leverages concurrent trajectory optimization to enable fast and reliable kinodynamic motion planning.

- PINSAT

The paper presents an algorithm called PINSAT that combines parallel graph search using ideas from ePA*SE with trajectory optimization using B-splines to efficiently solve complex kinodynamic motion planning problems. It builds upon previous work on INSAT that also interleaved search and trajectory optimization. The key innovation is introducing parallelism to accelerate the expensive optimization steps. The results demonstrate improved planning times and success rates over INSAT and other baselines. So the core focus is on parallel, interleaved search and optimization for kinodynamic planning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper introduces a new algorithm called PINSAT that builds upon INSAT. What is the key limitation of INSAT that PINSAT aims to address? Explain the main ideas behind how PINSAT achieves this.

2) The B-spline optimization problem formulated in Equations 4 has state derivative constraints that couple the trajectory $\traj(t)$ with its duration $T$. Explain how the mapping $\timemap$ is used to decouple this optimization problem. 

3) In the trajectory reconstruction step (Section 4.1.3), the paper mentions using the derivatives of the B-spline basis functions $N_{i,k}(t)$ to compute the derivatives of the trajectory $\traj(t)$. Derive the expression for the second derivative $\traj^{(2)}(t)$ in terms of the B-spline bases and their derivatives.

4) Lemma 1 states that if the tunnel $\tau(e)$ is convex, an optimal trajectory can be found by solving the convex relaxation in Equations 11. Provide an outline for the proof of this result. What assumptions are needed?

5) The minimum order $k_{min}$ plays an important role in ensuring completeness of PINSAT. Explain how $k_{min}$ is computed and how it provides a completeness guarantee.

6) Compare and contrast the parallelization scheme used in PINSAT versus prior parallel planning methods like parallel RRT. What fundamentally enables the parallelism in PINSAT?

7) PINSAT runs an asynchronous search over edges rather than states. Explain the key differences between state expansions in A* versus edge expansions in ePA*SE. Why does this matter for enabling parallel trajectory optimizations?

8) The empirical evaluation shows PINSAT achieves higher success rates and lower planning times compared to INSAT. Analyze these results - why does parallelizing the trajectory optimization help improve the overall planning performance?

9) The paper mentions inflating the velocity limits of the robot arm in the experiments. Explain the rationale behind this design choice and how it stresses the planner.

10) The completeness proof of PINSAT relies on several assumptions, including the existence of a solution trajectory within the tunnel of a path in the graph. Discuss the limitations of this assumption and how the tunnel can be designed in practice to provide completeness guarantees.
