# [REFACTOR: Learning to Extract Theorems from Proofs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17032)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to mimic the human ability to extract reusable, modular theorems from complex mathematical proofs. Such theorems help simplify and generalize proofs, just as concepts like integrals and derivatives crystallized techniques like exhaustion. Automatically extracting reusable theorems can aid automated theorem provers and simplify large proof libraries.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes REFACTOR, a method to train graph neural networks to extract theorem components from proofs. It creates training data by "expanding" proofs - substituting an invoked theorem with its full proof tree. The model is trained to identify the original theorem's proof subtree. At test time, predictions are checked for validity as theorems. 

Contributions:
1) A novel supervised approach to mimic human theorem extraction, formalized as node classification on proof trees.
2) Accuracy of 19.6% extracting same theorems as humans, improved with larger models.
3) From test proofs, REFACTOR extracts 1907 novel reusable theorems. 
4) Applying extracted theorems to refactor the Metamath library compresses proofs by 400k nodes.
5) A prover trained on refactored proofs proves 75 more test theorems than baseline, with 31% of proofs leveraging extracted theorems. This demonstrates their reusability.

In summary, the paper presents the first proof-of-concept for neural theorem extraction on real proofs, shows accuracies on par with human extractions, and demonstrates downstream benefits for compression and automated reasoning. The diversity of usable extracted theorems indicates promise for further research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method called REFACTOR to train neural networks to extract reusable theorems from mathematical proofs, demonstrating its ability to recover some human-defined theorems, extract novel reusable theorems, compress the proof database by refactoring with extracted theorems, and improve an existing theorem prover.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel method called REFACTOR for training neural networks to extract reusable theorems from mathematical proofs. This mimics humans' ability to identify modular and reusable components.

2. Demonstrating that REFACTOR can extract unseen human theorems from proofs with 19.6% accuracy. The performance also improves with larger model size.

3. Showing that REFACTOR extracts novel and frequently reused theorems from the existing Metamath library. The extracted theorems help compress the library and improve an existing theorem prover's performance significantly.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a neural network based method to extract reusable theorems from proofs, and showing this can benefit theorem proving by discovering new reusable theorems and improving proof compression and prover performance when integrated into an existing library.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Theorem extraction - The paper focuses on training models to extract reusable theorems from mathematical proofs. This is referred to as "theorem extraction" in the paper.

- Proof trees - Mathematical proofs are represented as tree structures called "proof trees". The models make predictions about components of these trees.

- Metamath - The paper implements its ideas within the Metamath theorem proving framework. Metamath is a lightweight theorem prover that represents proofs as trees.

- Proof expansion - A key technique in the paper is "proof expansion", where the proof of one theorem is substituted/inlined inside the proof of another theorem to create training data. 

- Refactoring - The paper shows how newly extracted theorems can be used to "refactor" existing proofs in Metamath to make them more compressed and reusable.

- Graph neural networks - The models used are graph neural networks that take proof trees as input and make node-level predictions.

- Theorem proving - One application shown is using the extracted theorems to improve baseline theorem provers. More proofs are found on a test set.

So in summary, the key ideas have to do with training machine learning models to extract reusable theorems from proofs and using these to improve theorem proving systems. The proofs are represented as trees and processed using graph neural networks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes to reverse the process of human theorem extraction to create machine learning datasets. Can you elaborate more on this process? What are the key steps involved and how does it result in suitable targets for learning theorem extraction?

2. The paper uses graph neural networks as the model architecture. What are the benefits of using GNNs compared to other architectures like RNNs or Transformers? How do design choices like number of GraphSage convolution layers impact model performance?

3. The paper shows that both edge connectivity and node features are important for good performance. Why would removing edges or node features degrade performance? Can you analyze the impact on information flow through the graph? 

4. For incorrect predictions, the paper categorizes them into "Non-Tree & Invalid", "Tree & Invalid", and "Tree & Valid". Can you explain what each category means and why they arise? What improvements to the model could reduce the "Non-Tree & Invalid" cases?

5. When extracting new theorems, the paper applies several criteria to verify validity. Can you explain these criteria in more detail? Why are they important to ensure the extracted component is reusable? 

6. The newly extracted theorems are shown to be frequently reused in refactoring proofs. What specifically causes these new theorems to be more reusable than existing ones in the library?

7. How does the graph structure of Metamath proofs enable substitution of lemmas and refactoring? Would the method work as effectively in other formal proof systems lacking this graph structure?

8. Could ideas from program synthesis like the Explore-Compile family of algorithms be integrated with REFACTOR to improve it? What challenges would arise in adapting ideas between the two domains?

9. The performance improves significantly from 2.3% to 19.6% by increasing model size. What hypotheses might explain this trend? How much room for improvement is there with more scale?

10. What enhancements or modifications could make REFACTOR substantially more powerful? For example, by using different expansion schemes, proof traversal orders, or model architectures.
