# [Implicit Bias of Policy Gradient in Linear Quadratic Control:   Extrapolation to Unseen Initial States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07875)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper studies the implicit bias of policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning/optimal control problems, specifically in terms of their ability to extrapolate to unseen initial states. 
- Extrapolation is important in real-world control problems where the controller may encounter new situations during deployment. However, current RL algorithms often generalize poorly to new initial states.
- The paper focuses its analysis on the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem as a testbed for studying this question theoretically.

Main Contributions:

1. The paper proves theoretically that the extent of extrapolation by policy gradient in underdetermined LQR problems depends on the "exploration" induced by the system dynamics when starting from the initial states used during training.

2. In settings without sufficient exploration, extrapolation does not occur and the learned controller behaves similarly to a "no-extrapolation" baseline. However, with an exploration-encouraging system and initial state choice, extrapolation can become perfect.

3. For a typical setting with random system dynamics and an arbitrary training initial state, the paper shows (in expectation and with high probability) that some non-trivial extrapolation occurs, owing to the generic exploratory behavior.

4. Experiments on LQR and complex nonlinear control problems corroborate the theory and demonstrate its applicability beyond linear systems.

5. Through advanced mathematical tools, the paper also reveals differences from implicit bias results in supervised learning. This contrasts the common belief that such results translate directly to reinforcement learning.

Proposed Solution:

- The paper introduces a mathematical framework to quantify extrapolation via new optimality and cost measures tailored to RL/control.

- The analysis links these measures to the degree of "exploration" occurring during training, formalized as the overlap between trajectories from training initial states and directions orthogonal to them.

- By constructing appropriate LQR examples, the paper bounds extrapolation in different exploration regimes, thereby elucidating the interplay between system dynamics and extrapolation.

The paper hypothesizes that explicitly optimizing exploration may significantly improve generalization in real-world control problems. Overall, this work opens promising directions at the intersection of implicit bias and reinforcement learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper theoretically and empirically analyzes how the implicit bias of policy gradient methods leads learned controllers to extrapolate well or poorly to unseen initial states in linear quadratic and nonlinear control problems, finding that extrapolation depends on the degree to which system dynamics induce exploration from states encountered during training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the abstract and introduction, the main contribution of this paper is a theoretical analysis of the implicit bias of policy gradient methods in terms of their ability to extrapolate to unseen initial states in optimal control problems. Specifically, the paper analyzes this in the context of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems, and shows both theoretically and empirically that the extent of extrapolation depends on the degree of exploration induced by the system dynamics when starting from the initial states used during training. The paper also extends these findings empirically to nonlinear systems controlled by neural network policies. Overall, the analysis sheds light on an important but less studied aspect of policy gradient methods in control problems, and suggests that more informed selection of training initial states could significantly improve generalization in real-world applications.

The paper theoretically studies the implicit bias of policy gradient methods in terms of their ability to extrapolate to unseen initial states in linear quadratic control problems. It focuses specifically on the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) setting. A key finding is that the extent of extrapolation depends on the degree of exploration induced by the system dynamics when starting from the initial states used during training. The analysis employs advanced tools from random matrix theory and topology, in particular the concept of genus expansion. Experiments on LQR problems as well as non-linear systems demonstrate the theory.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper studies the implicit bias of policy gradient methods in terms of extrapolation to unseen initial states. Could you expand more on why this property is important in real-world optimal control and reinforcement learning problems?

2. The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is used as a testbed for studying extrapolation properties. What are some key properties of LQR that make it a suitable problem for this analysis? How might the conclusions extend or not extend to other optimal control formulations?

3. The paper defines quantitative measures for evaluating extrapolation based on optimality and cost. What is the motivation behind each of these measures and what are their relative advantages/limitations? 

4. A key result is that extrapolation depends on the exploration induced by the system dynamics when starting from training initial states. Could you explain further the precise relationship shown between exploration and extrapolation?

5. The analysis considers linear systems but experiments also validate conclusions on nonlinear systems. What intrinsic properties of nonlinear systems make you hypothesize that a similar dependence would hold? How might nonlinear dynamics violate conclusions?

6. For the constructed "shift" system that encourages exploration, can you discuss in more detail why perfect extrapolation is achieved for certain cost matrices? What is the underlying mechanism?

7. The analysis shows gradient descent over linear controllers does not minimize the Euclidean norm, unlike in supervised learning. What are the implications of this and why does this happen?

8. What are the key technical limitations of the analysis for typical random systems? What mathematical tools would be needed to overcome them? 

9. The experiments show extrapolation for neural network policies and nonlinear systems. What modifications would be necessary to theoretically analyze this regime?

10. The paper motivates developing methods to choose training states that improve extrapolation. What are your thoughts on possible approaches to address this challenge? What are difficulties that may arise?
