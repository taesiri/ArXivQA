# [E2E-AT: A Unified Framework for Tackling Uncertainty in Task-aware   End-to-end Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10587)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- End-to-end (E2E) learning combines machine learning (ML) models for prediction with constrained optimization (CO) models for decision making in order to directly optimize task-oriented objectives. However, uncertainties in E2E models have not been fully understood. 
- Uncertainties can occur in: (1) input features of the ML model, (2) unpredictable parameters of the CO models, and (3) unpredictable parameters of the task-aware cost function.  
- Conventional approaches only consider input feature uncertainties through adversarial training. Neglecting CO model uncertainties can cause significant generalization errors.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate a unified robust optimization framework to capture uncertainties from all sources in E2E learning.
- The worst-case uncertainties are modeled as inner maximization problems, while model parameters are optimized to minimize the worst-case cost.
- This robust program can be practically solved via End-to-End Adversarial Training (E2E-AT). Adversarial attacks on input and CO uncertainties are generated alternatively. 
- For piecewise linear ML and affine-parametric quadratic programming COs, the exact worst-case attack can be obtained by solving a Mixed Integer Linear Program. This enables certified robustness.
- E2E-AT balances between nominal and robust accuracy using a hyperparameter. Computational efficiency is improved using "free" adversarial training.

Main Contributions:
- Identify CO model uncertainties as a new source of errors in E2E learning, in addition to input uncertainties.
- Propose a unified framework to formulate robustness against uncertainties from all sources as a robust optimization problem.
- Develop an E2E-AT algorithm to train robust E2E models, with certifiable robustness guarantees. 
- Demonstrate improved robustness of E2E-AT experimentally on a power system operational planning task with neural network based forecasting and economic dispatch optimization.
