# [Adjusting Dynamics of Hopfield Neural Network via Time-variant Stimulus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18584)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) is a recurrent neural network model that demonstrates chaotic dynamics due to its nonlinear activation function and intricate connectivity structure. However, the inherent instability of HNN makes it highly sensitive to external disturbances, which poses challenges in modulating its dynamics to achieve desired behaviors. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper investigates enhancing the dynamics of HNN through the application of time-variant external stimuli, including Weight Matrix Stimuli (WMS), State Variable Stimuli (SVS) and Constant Stimuli (CS). Four distinct Adjusted HNN (AHNN) configurations are studied: 

1) AHNN with 4 WMSs can generate 4-scroll or 2-scroll attractors. 

2) AHNN with 4 WMSs and 1 SVS yields 8-scroll or 4-scroll attractors. 

3) AHNN with 4 WMSs and multiple SVSs creates grid multi-scroll attractors, with each SVS doubling the attractor. 

4) AHNN with 1 CS and 1 SVS transitions from chaotic to periodic and quasi-periodic states, eventually reaching fixed points as CS intensity increases.

An FPGA implementation is presented using piecewise Taylor series approximation for the hyperbolic tangent activation. An image encryption scheme leveraging the chaotic dynamics of AHNN is also proposed.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrates that suitable adjustment methods through time-variant stimuli can enhance HNN dynamics and complexity without compromising stability.

- Studies the effects of different stimuli types and combinations on HNN attractors and behaviors.

- Provides analysis on boundness, equilibrium stability, Lyapunov exponents and bifurcation to characterize AHNN dynamics.

- Details FPGA implementation and application in secure image communication using chaos-based encryption.

- Showcases that inappropriate stimulus applications can lead to degeneration of HNN's chaotic traits, highlighting the importance of proper adjustment techniques.

Overall, this exploration offers valuable insights into modulating nonlinear system dynamics through external time-variant stimuli.
