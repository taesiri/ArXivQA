# [Semantic Textual Similarity Assessment in Chest X-ray Reports Using a   Domain-Specific Cosine-Based Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11908)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating semantic similarity between generated and ground truth medical reports is critical for applications like chest x-ray report generation, but conventional NLP metrics like BLEU are unreliable for capturing complex medical semantics. 
- Existing domain-specific metrics are limited in scope or overlook semantic similarities between entities.
- There is a need for a robust, generalizable metric to assess medical semantic similarity.

Proposed Solution:
- A new Medical Corpus Semantic Similarity Evaluation (MCSE) metric with two main steps:
   1. Clinical entity extraction using Scispacy and additional automated post-processing. Considers associated negations and descriptions besides just extracting main entities.
   2. Domain similarity evaluation using a matrix of domain cosine similarity scores between entities. Accounts for partial semantic matches.
- Validation on RadGraph and MIMIC-CXR datasets to assess entity extraction accuracy and distinguish similarity scores. 

Main Contributions:
- Novel clinical entity extraction methodology with 75-76% validation accuracy.
- New scoring approach for medical semantic similarity using domain cosine similarity.
- Demonstrated clear differentiation between similarity scores for related and opposing medical diagnoses.
- When applied to state-of-the-art chest x-ray report generation models, provides scores that align with BLEU but give more meaningful similarity assessments.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative medical semantic similarity evaluation metric with robust clinical entity extraction and a tailored scoring approach. It is validated to reliably distinguish similarity for medical contexts and provides more insightful similarity assessments than conventional NLP metrics.
