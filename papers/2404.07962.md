# [Live and Learn: Continual Action Clustering with Incremental Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07962)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Live and Learn: Continual Action Clustering with Incremental Views":

Problem: 
- Existing multi-view action clustering (MVC) methods assume all camera views are available in advance, which is impractical when views arrive incrementally over time. 
- Learning invariant information across views in a continual learning scenario is challenging due to large divergence between historical and new views, unpredictability of new views, and impracticality of storing all historical views.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel continual action clustering (CAC) method that achieves never-ending knowledge transfer between historical and new incremental views.
- A category memory library that learns and stores action categories from historical views.
- When new view arrives, only a consensus partition matrix is maintained and updated using the new view, instead of keeping all views.
- A three-step alternate optimization of the category memory library and consensus partition matrix.

Main Contributions:
- First work to explore multi-view action clustering in an incremental learning scenario. 
- Design of a category memory library to store learned action categories from historical views.
- Maintenance of only a consensus partition matrix that gets updated with new views.
- Three-step alternate optimization procedure for continual optimization.
- Superior performance over 15 state-of-the-art baselines on 6 multi-view action datasets in terms of clustering accuracy, efficiency and scalability.

In summary, the paper proposes a new continual learning framework for multi-view action clustering that can effectively transfer knowledge across historical and new incremental views leading to improved clustering performance.
