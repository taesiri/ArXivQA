# [Can we obtain significant success in RST discourse parsing by using   Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05065)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse parsing is important for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, summarization, QA, etc. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great success on many NLP tasks. However, the potential of using LLMs for RST parsing remains an open question. 

Method:
- The paper explores using the 70B-parameter LLAMA-2, a decoder-only LLM, for RST discourse parsing with top-down and bottom-up strategies. 
- The parsing processes are translated into prompts which LLAMA-2 can work with. LLAMA-2 is fine-tuned with QLoRA for efficient computing.

Results:
- Experiments on RST-DT, Instr-DT and GUM datasets show the bottom-up parser with LLAMA-2 (70B) achieves new state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior parsers by 2-7 F1 points.
- The bottom-up parser also shows better generalization ability in out-of-domain evaluations between RST-DT and GUM.

Main Contributions:
- First work exploring the potential of large decoder-only LLMs for RST discourse parsing.
- Achieves new SOTA results by translating parsing processes into prompts and fine-tuning LLAMA-2. 
- Demonstrates LLMs can be effective for discourse parsing and have good domain portability.
- Provides insights into future research directions for neural discourse parsing.

Limitations:
- Requires large computational resources. Parsers are slow compared to standard parsers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores using the largest publicly available decoder-only language model, Llama 2, for RST discourse parsing by translating the parsing process into prompts and shows it achieves state-of-the-art results and good cross-corpus generalization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is exploring the potential of using Llama-2, the largest publicly available decoder-only language model with up to 70 billion parameters, for RST discourse parsing. Specifically, the paper proposes an approach to translate the fundamental top-down and bottom-up parsing processes into prompts that can be used to fine-tune Llama-2 for this task. 

The key findings highlighted as main contributions are:

- The parser with Llama-2 (70B) achieves new state-of-the-art results on RST discourse parsing on multiple benchmark datasets (RST-DT, Instr-DT and GUM), outperforming prior work by 2-7 F1 points. 

- The parser demonstrates good domain portability, performing well on datasets from different genres. This is attributed to fine-tuning the large language model on the parsing prompts.

- Analysis shows the parser generalizes better across corpora compared to prior work. When trained on GUM and tested on RST-DT, it achieves comparable span F1 to models trained on RST-DT itself.

So in summary, the main contribution is introducing and evaluating Llama-2 based prompting for RST discourse parsing, showing it pushes the state-of-the-art and has desirable generalization properties.

The paper explores using the large decoder-only language model Llama-2 for RST discourse parsing, where the parsing process is translated into prompts that Llama-2 can work with. The model is fine-tuned with QLoRA for efficient computing. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results, especially with the bottom-up parsing strategy, showing the potential of using LLMs for discourse parsing. The paper also examines domain generalization ability and computational limitations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes translating the parsing steps of top-down and bottom-up strategies into prompts for the LLMs. What are some potential benefits and drawbacks of this approach compared to more traditional classification and structured prediction approaches? 

2. The paper finds that the bottom-up parsing strategy works better than top-down overall. Why might this be the case? What differences in the prompt design may account for the differences in performance?

3. The paper shows impressive gains from using a 70 billion parameter LLM compared to smaller LLMs. Is there a point of diminishing returns where adding more parameters no longer helps significantly? How can we determine what size LLM is "good enough"?

4. The paper demonstrates strong performance even when training on one dataset (GUM) and testing on another (RST-DT). To what extent can we conclude that the model has learned generalizable discourse parsing capabilities? What further analyses could elucidate the level of generalization attained?

5. Error analysis: What are the most frequent error types made by the model? Are there observable patterns? Do the errors differ substantially from other existing discourse parsers?

6. The model requires very large computational resources. What are some potential methods to improve efficiency and reduce resource requirements? Can model distillation help here?

7. The prompts designed for the bottom-up parsing strategy include more contextual information than the top-down prompts. How important is this context, and can the top-down prompts be improved by including more context to close the performance gap?

8. How sensitive is model performance to the exact wording and formatting of the prompts? Is there an optimal way to design prompts for discourse parsing?

9. The paper uses rule-based post-processing to handle invalid predictions. Would a trainable approach work better? What are the tradeoffs?

10. The paper focuses specifically on RST-style discourse parsing. To what extent could this method generalize to other styles of discourse analysis? What modifications would be required?
