# [A Modular Approach for Multimodal Summarization of TV Shows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03823)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenging task of summarizing long television show episodes (30-60 minutes) involving multiple modalities - video, audio, transcripts. This requires complex reasoning over long narratives with temporal dependencies, event inferences, multi-party dialogues. Assessing quality of generated summaries is also difficult. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents a modular approach with specialized components:
1) Scene detection module - detects scene boundaries in transcripts using minimum description length principle. 
2) Scene reordering module - reorders scenes to minimize transitions between events using optimization algorithm.  
3) Vision processing module - converts visual information into natural language text using models like SwinBERT and Kosmos-2.
4) Dialogue summarization module - summarizes dialogue in each scene independently using BART fine-tuned on dialogue dataset.
5) High level summarization module - fuses scene summaries into final coherent summary using BART fine-tuned on long document dataset.

Main Contributions:
1) Novel modular architecture for multimodal summarization with specialized components for subtasks.
2) Algorithms for optimal scene detection and reordering. 
3) Vision processing via state-of-the-art video/image captioning models.
4) A new evaluation metric, PREFS, that measures precision and recall of atomic facts in summaries to assess quality and factuality.

The method is evaluated on SummScreen3D dataset and outperforms comparison models like end-to-end adapters and large language models, demonstrating the promise of the modular approach.
