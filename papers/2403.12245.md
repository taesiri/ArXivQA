# [Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Learned Dynamics by   Learning Pseudometrics and Constraint Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12245)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Learned dynamics models (e.g. neural networks or Gaussian processes) are commonly used to model robot dynamics from data. However, these models often fail to generalize accurately to out-of-distribution (OOD) states far from the training data. This limits their reliability for control and planning.

Key Ideas:
The authors leverage two common properties of robot dynamics to improve OOD generalization:

1. Sparsity: Only certain state components affect the dynamics. For example, a car's x-position does not affect its velocity dynamics. 

2. Constraints: The dynamics evolve on a lower-dimensional constraint manifold due to physics, e.g. a car moves subject to nonholonomic constraints.

The key insight is that while the full dynamics may be hard to identify, the sparsity pattern and constraint manifold may be easier to estimate from limited data and generalize better OOD.

Method:
1. Learn a pseudometric via contrastive learning on state-control data to uncover sparse dynamics inputs. Reduce input dimension when learning dynamics.

2. Approximate the constraint manifold's normal space at each state using the learned dynamics. Train a Gaussian process to represent the manifold.

3. Make predictions by evaluating the learned dynamics and projecting onto the learned constraint manifold.

Contributions:
1. A method to learn state input sparsity for dynamics using contrastive pseudometric learning 

2. A way to learn nonholonomic constraint manifolds from trajectory data

3. Improving OOD accuracy of learned dynamics by projecting predictions onto the learned manifold

4. Evaluated on a physical robot and quadrotor simulator, demonstrating improved OOD accuracy over baseline methods

The key idea is to leverage structure in the dynamics and constraints to improve generalization, without assuming perfect knowledge a priori. This is done by learning appropriate distance metrics for sparsification and approximating constraints from data.
