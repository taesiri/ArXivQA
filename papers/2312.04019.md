# [Efficiently Predicting Protein Stability Changes Upon Single-point   Mutation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04019)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach combining protein sequence and structural features to accurately and efficiently predict protein stability changes induced by single-point mutations. The authors curated a new dataset of aligned sequence-structure pairs with no information leakage relative to common test sets like S669 and Ssym for fair model evaluation. They introduced an ESM-augmented prediction model leveraging both sequential and structural representations from pretrained language models like ESM-2 and graph neural networks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance across key metrics while significantly enhancing computational efficiency, with their method achieving nearly 15 times faster processing than baseline models like PROSTATA. Through ablation studies, ESM embeddings proving critical for capturing subtle data patterns caused by mutations. While limitations exist regarding robustness and model generalization, this work highlights the potential of large language models to facilitate protein stability research by effectively interpreting complex sequence and structure relationships. Key strengths include the carefully-curated dataset, balanced accuracy and efficiency, strong consistency across test sets, and rigorous evaluations relative to prior art.
