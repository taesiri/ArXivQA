# [Interactive Segmentation of Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13545)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents an interactive method (ISRF) for segmenting objects in radiance fields. The central goal is to develop an intuitive and qualitative framework for accurate 3D object segmentation in radiance fields, which can facilitate downstream editing and manipulation tasks. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Using a hybrid implicit-explicit radiance field representation (TensoRF) that is memory efficient and fast for rendering, while also enabling distillation of semantic features to aid segmentation.

- Matching user-provided 2D strokes to the 3D radiance field semantics using nearest neighbor feature matching on clustered exemplars. This gives a robust high-confidence seed region for segmentation. 

- Growing the seed region using a bilateral search that considers both spatial proximity and semantic similarity for accurate delineation of objects.

- Interactive refinement with iterative addition and removal of content using positive and negative strokes.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art segmentation results on complex objects from different radiance field datasets. Enabling intuitive editing like object removal, appearance changes, composition, etc.

In summary, the central goal is developing an interactive framework for high-quality 3D object segmentation in radiance fields to facilitate downstream manipulation and editing. The key ideas are efficient hybrid representation, robust 2D-3D feature matching, bilateral growing and interactive refinements.
