# [Detecting Racist Text in Bengali: An Ensemble Deep Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16748)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Racism is a major issue globally, including in Bangladesh, manifesting in social media comments. It's important to detect racist texts to combat this problem.

- There is limited prior work on detecting racist texts specifically in the Bengali language. This paper aims to build models for identifying Bengali racist comments.

Data Collection and Annotation:
- Collected 6k raw social media comments from platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.

- Manually annotated the data into multi-class racist types and non-racist comments based on established definitions of racism. Categories include representational, ideological and discursive racism.  

- Surveyed the annotated data and corrected labels accordingly to validate quality.

Methodology:  
- Preprocessed text data by removing numbers, punctuation, unnecessary parts of speech, emojis. 

- Extracted feature representations using BERT-based models like BanglaBERT, BanglaBERT Base and sahajBERT to embed words based on context.

- Developed deep learning models including Multi-Channel CNN-LSTM (MCNN-LSTM), LSTM and RNNs for classification.

- Used an ensemble approach to combine predictions from the models.
  
Results:
- The MCNN-LSTM model achieved best individual accuracy of 86.93% using sahajBERT embeddings.

- The ensemble model obtained highest overall accuracy of 87.94% in identifying racism, with class-wise F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.86.  

- Comparative analysis shows the approach outperforms related previous works on similar Bengali text classification tasks.

Conclusion:
- The study demonstrates deep learning methods can effectively detect racist comments in Bengali text. 

- The ensemble model and integration of convolutional techniques with LSTMs contribute to strong results.

- Future work includes expanding the dataset size for multi-class discrimination of racism sub-types.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an ensemble deep learning framework using RNN, LSTM, and MCNN-LSTM models with BERT embeddings to detect racist text in Bengali social media comments, achieving 87.94% accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It develops effective methods for detecting racist texts in Bengali social media comments using deep neural network architectures. Specifically, it applies RNN, LSTM, and MCNN-LSTM models and shows their efficacy in identifying racism.

2. It builds a novel dataset of racist and non-racist texts in the Bengali language, manually annotates it, and makes it publicly available. This helps address the lack of Bengali datasets for racism detection. 

3. It utilizes three pre-trained BERT models (BanglaBERT, BanglaBERT Base, sahajBERT) for generating word embeddings and incorporating semantic context about the Bengali language. This improves the feature representation for the deep learning models.

4. It proposes an ensemble approach to combine the predictions from the different models (RNN, LSTM, MCNN-LSTM) which helps boost the overall predictive performance. The ensemble method achieves the highest accuracy of 87.94% on the dataset.

5. Overall, the study demonstrates the ability of deep neural networks and transfer learning techniques to effectively detect racist content in the low-resource Bengali language. The models, code, and dataset advance capabilities for identifying and mitigating racism in Bengali social media.

In summary, the main contributions are around developing datasets, models, and ensemble methods tailored to racism detection in Bengali text.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using an ensemble approach to combine multiple models. What were the individual models used and why was an ensemble approach preferred over selecting the single best performing model?

2. The Multi-Channel CNN-LSTM (MCNN-LSTM) model showed better performance over standard RNN and LSTM models. What are the key advantages of using a CNN layer before the LSTM that might account for this improved performance?

3. The paper experimented with different pre-trained BERT models for generating embeddings. Why do you think the SahajBERT embeddings performed the best even though they had a higher dimensionality than the other models?

4. The dataset used in this paper is imbalanced across the different types of racism. How might the class imbalance impact model training and what techniques could be used to mitigate any negative effects?

5. What role does data preprocessing play in preparing the textual data for model training? What key preprocessing steps were taken in this work?

6. Beyond accuracy, what other evaluation metrics were used to assess model performance? Why are precision and recall important to consider for a classification task?  

7. How was the dataset for this task constructed and manually annotated? What steps were taken to validate the quality of the annotations?

8. How does the problem addressed in this paper differ from generic hate speech detection? What unique challenges does focusing specifically on racist speech present?

9. The paper categorized racist speech into 3 types - representational, ideological and discursive racism. Do you think the models are capable of distinguishing these subtypes? Why or why not?

10. The conclusion mentions plans to expand the dataset in future work. What impact do you think a larger dataset would have? Would it allow training more complex models or enhance performance of existing ones?
