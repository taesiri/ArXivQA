# [Hot PATE: Private Aggregation of Distributions for Diverse Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02132)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a  high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes "hot PATE", an extension of the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework for privacy-preserving machine learning that is tailored for diverse, open-ended tasks common with generative AI models. Hot PATE uses teacher models to produce response distributions rather than labels, and aggregates these distributions in a way that preserves both privacy and diversity of responses. A key contribution is formalizing a notion of "preserving diversity" that ensures robust knowledge transfer from teachers to students. The paper also introduces "ensemble coordination" to produce correlated teacher votes, enabling differentially private aggregation methods with favorable privacy-utility tradeoffs even with high diversity. Both theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate hot PATE's improved performance over standard "cold" PATE in diverse settings. By expanding PATE's capabilities to diverse tasks, hot PATE broadens the applicability of private learning through techniques like prompt-based fine-tuning of generative models.
