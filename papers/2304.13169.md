# [SAFE: Machine Unlearning With Shard Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13169)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a machine learning model that can be efficiently adapted to remove the influence of specific training data samples after model training, while maintaining high accuracy?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes an approach called Synergy Aware Forgetting Ensemble (SAFE) for selectively removing the influence of training samples from a trained model, which is also known as "forgetting" or "machine unlearning".

- Existing approaches like training separate models on disjoint subsets of data (sharding) can enable efficient forgetting but lead to reduced accuracy due to loss of synergistic information between shards. 

- SAFE aims to balance accuracy and forgetting efficiency by allowing limited sharing of information between shards during training through a "shard graph", while still being able to remove shard influence after training.

- Lightweight adapters called InCA are used to allow scaling to a large number of shards while enabling efficient parallel training.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that SAFE can achieve more accurate and efficient forgetting compared to prior sharding-based approaches by incorporating limited inter-shard synergistic information in a selective way during training. The paper presents the SAFE method and empirically evaluates this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This appears to be a fake computer science paper generated as an example text, rather than an actual published paper. Some indications of this:

- The content seems autogenerated and does not have a coherent narrative or contribution. There are random LaTeX commands, unfinished sentences, placeholder text like "Name", and disconnected sections.

- Many of the section titles are generic like "Introduction" and "Related Work" rather than having specific titles related to a research contribution.

- There are no author names or affliations. Real papers would list author names and institutions.

- There is no actual data, experiments, or results section. A real paper would contain details of experiments and findings.

- References and citations are missing. A published paper would cite previous relevant work.

- There is no abstract summarizing the key points.

- It is not published at any conference or journal. Real papers list publication venue details.

So in summary, this appears to be an automatically generated dummy paper rather than having a real scientific contribution or details. The lack of actual content or results means there is no clear research contribution made in this paper.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in selective forgetting/machine unlearning:

- It introduces a new approach called Synergy Aware Forgetting Ensemble (SAFE) that uses a "shard graph" to allow limited information sharing between data shards during training. This improves accuracy compared to methods like SISA that train shards independently. 

- SAFE uses lightweight InCA adapters that allow training orders of magnitude more shards (up to 256) compared to prior work. This enables lower forgetting cost.

- The paper formalizes the tradeoff between accuracy and forgetting cost and shows SAFE achieves better accuracy-cost tradeoffs than prior methods like SISA and prototypical classifiers.

- The shard graph framework provides a flexible way to codify data usage policies and construct different model topologies. This is extended to support stochastic forgetting with differential privacy and à-la-carte personalization.

- Evaluation is on more complex fine-grained vision datasets compared to CIFAR-10/100 used in most prior work.

- Limitations include reliance on a fixed pretrained backbone rather than end-to-end training, and shard graph construction requires some prior knowledge about data relationships.

Overall, this paper makes significant advances in selective forgetting by improving the accuracy-cost tradeoff through better use of synergistic information in a flexible shard graph framework. The lightweight adapters also push the scale of feasible sharding. The formalization and evaluation of the accuracy-cost tradeoff is more rigorous than prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing techniques to optimize the shard graph structure in a principled way. The authors mention that currently the graph is constructed in a heuristic manner to balance accuracy and forgetting cost. Developing more systematic methods to learn the graph structure could further improve performance.

- Extending SAFE to additional modalities beyond vision, such as natural language processing tasks. The authors suggest the InCA adapters used in SAFE could likely be adapted to NLP models as well.

- Reducing the accuracy gap compared to monolithic training. While SAFE improves over prior methods, there is still a gap compared to training on all data jointly. Exploring techniques to minimize this gap could be useful.

- Applications to federated learning. The authors suggest SAFE's ability to compartmentalize information from different shards could be useful in federated settings where models need to be personalized to each client's local data.

- Integration of additional privacy preserving techniques beyond differential privacy. The authors propose a DP variant of SAFE, but other privacy techniques could also be integrated.

- Scaling SAFE to even larger models and shard counts. Testing the limits of how far SAFE can be scaled is an interesting direction.

- Providing theory and guarantees on the forgetting properties. Much of the current analysis is empirical, so developing theoretical guarantees could be useful.

Overall, the core idea of constructing a shard graph seems very flexible and could likely be extended in many interesting ways in future work. Optimizing the graph structure and scaling to very large models seem like two of the most promising directions suggested.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Synergy Aware Forgetting Ensemble (SAFE), a method to train large neural network models on diverse datasets while minimizing the cost to remove the influence of individual training samples. SAFE works by partitioning the dataset into shards and training separate lightweight adapter modules on each shard, which are then ensembled into a final model. To allow synergistic information sharing between shards, SAFE introduces the notion of a shard graph that selectively allows adapters to also train on data from connected shards. The topology of the shard graph trades off between accuracy and the expected cost to forget samples by retraining affected adapters. Compared to standard sharding methods that train adapters independently, SAFE is able to achieve significantly higher accuracy for the same forgetting cost by exploiting synergies allowed by the shard graph. The use of lightweight adapters also allows SAFE to scale to an order of magnitude more shards than previous methods. Experiments on computer vision tasks demonstrate SAFE's effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Synergy Aware Forgetting Ensemble (SAFE), a method for training machine learning models that can efficiently remove the influence of specific training samples. The key idea is to partition the training data into multiple shards and train separate models or "adapters" on each shard. An ensemble of these adapters comprises the full model. To remove a sample's influence, only the adapter trained on that sample's shard needs to be retrained. This allows efficient "forgetting" of samples. However, training adapters separately loses synergistic information between samples in different shards. 

SAFE introduces a "shard graph" that selectively allows limited information sharing between adapters during training. The graph topology balances the accuracy gains from synergy against the increased cost of forgetting due to more adapters needing retraining. SAFE uses lightweight adapters to enable training orders of magnitude more shards than prior methods. Experiments on computer vision datasets demonstrate SAFE reduces forgetting cost by 10x while maintaining accuracy relative to alternatives like uniform sharding or class prototypes. The shard graph framework also supports extensions like stochastic forgetting via differential privacy and à-la-carte models customized per user data access rights.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method called Synergy Aware Forgetting Ensemble (SAFE) for training large models on diverse datasets while minimizing the cost of removing the influence of individual training samples (i.e. forgetting). The key idea is to partition the training data into shards and train separate lightweight adapters on each shard, which can be removed or retrained independently. To improve accuracy, SAFE introduces the notion of a shard graph that allows limited connections between adapters during training to exploit synergistic information between shards. The adapters are implemented using the InCA architecture, which enables efficient parallel training. During forgetting, only adapters that point to a shard containing a sample to be forgotten need to be retrained. Experiments on computer vision datasets show SAFE reduces forgetting cost by 10x compared to prior methods while maintaining accuracy. The method also enables training with many more shards than prior work by efficiently harnessing synergistic information between shards.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper addresses the problem of machine unlearning, specifically how to remove the influence of training data from a trained machine learning model. This is an important problem as real-world data often comes from multiple sources with different terms of use, and the terms may change over time requiring removal of data.

- The standard approach of training one monolithic model makes it very costly to remove the influence of any part of the training data, as it requires retraining the entire model from scratch.

- The paper proposes a new method called SAFE (Synergy Aware Forgetting Ensemble) to make machine unlearning more efficient. The key ideas are:

1) Partition the training data into multiple small shards and train separate models (adapters) on each shard. This makes removing a shard's influence cheaper. 

2) Allow limited connections between the shards when training the adapters to retain some of the synergistic information between shards that is lost in fully independent training. The connections are controlled via a "shard graph".

3) Use lightweight adapters to enable training many shards efficiently in parallel.

- Together, these techniques allow SAFE to achieve low forgetting cost while maintaining accuracy much better than prior shard-based approaches to machine unlearning.

- The paper also discusses extensions like using differential privacy between shards and applying SAFE to provide customized "a-la-carte" models for different users.

- Experiments on image classification datasets demonstrate SAFE's benefits over baseline methods for machine unlearning.

In summary, the key contribution is a new technique to improve the efficiency and accuracy of machine unlearning by carefully sharing information between data shards.

- Ensemble model - The overall model is an ensemble of the many adapters trained on different shards and associated through the connectivity defined by the shard graph.

- Bilevel sharding - A technique introduced to construct the shard graph by first splitting data into "coarse" class-balanced shards then further partitioning into "fine" cliques.

- Forgetting cost - Expected amount of retraining required when removing an example, related to the shard graph structure. Balancing accuracy and forgetting cost is a key tradeoff.
