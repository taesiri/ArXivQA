# [SAFE: Machine Unlearning With Shard Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13169)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a machine unlearning method that allows removing the influence of training data from a model while minimizing the expected cost of retraining, and also maintaining high accuracy?

The key ideas and contributions in addressing this question appear to be:

- Introducing the notion of a Shard Graph to represent relations between different data shards and control what information can be shared between them during training.

- Using the Shard Graph to develop SAFE (Synergy Aware Forgetting Ensemble), an algorithm that trains an ensemble of lightweight models/adapters on the shards. The graph allows exploiting synergistic information between connected shards to improve accuracy, while limiting connections to control expected retraining cost.

- Leveraging InCA adapters that can be efficiently trained in parallel to implement SAFE at scale, enabling training with orders of magnitude more shards than prior methods. This significantly reduces retraining cost while maintaining accuracy.

- Demonstrating SAFE empirically, showing it can shard data into as many as 256 subsets with lower forgetting cost than alternatives while achieving much higher accuracy due to making better use of synergistic information between shards.

So in summary, the main hypothesis seems to be that using a Shard Graph to control sharing of information between data shards during training can enable an efficient ensemble method for machine unlearning that minimizes retraining costs without sacrificing accuracy. The results appear to support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This appears to be a dummy LaTeX paper template rather than an actual completed paper. The template includes many common LaTeX packages and defines document styles, but does not contain any substantive content or contributions. Some key aspects:

- It is an ICCV paper template with a defined paper ID, using common LaTeX packages like iccv, times, graphicx, amsmath, etc.

- It defines LaTeX commands like \name, \unlearn, \algo, etc. to be used throughout the paper.

- It defines document styles like theorem, definition environments. 

- It includes template text for abstract, introduction, and other standard paper sections.

- There are placeholder comments like "Include other packages here, before hyperref" to guide authors.

- It is set up for double column formatting, page numbers, references, etc.

But overall there is no actual content or described contributions in this dummy paper template. The template provides formatting guidance, but the authors would need to add the specific paper content.
