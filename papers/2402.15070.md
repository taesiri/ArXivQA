# [Enhancing One-Shot Federated Learning Through Data and Ensemble   Co-Boosting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15070)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- One-shot federated learning (OFL) aims to train a global server model in one communication round. The server model is trained using two key elements: 1) synthetic data generated from an ensemble of client models, and 2) the ensemble model itself. Thus, the performance of the server model intrinsically relies on the quality of the synthetic data and the ensemble. However, existing methods focus only on improving one element while ignoring the relationship between the two elements, resulting in suboptimal server performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel method called Co-Boosting, where the quality of synthetic data and the ensemble model are progressively and mutually boosted in an adversarial manner within a single OFL training process. Specifically, 1) Hard and diverse samples are first synthesized from the ensemble. 2) The synthetic samples are then used to learn a better weighted ensemble by adjusting each client's contribution. 3) The improved ensemble and data are then used to further enhance each other. This concept is based on the key idea that better ensemble produces better data, while better data leads to better ensemble, forming a positive feedback loop.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates the possibility of simultaneously improving both synthetic data quality and ensemble. Highlights their mutually beneficial relationship. 
- Introduces Co-Boosting, a novel OFL algorithm that adversarially and progressively boosts synthetic data quality and ensemble capability, naturally delivering a high-performing distilled server model.
- Eliminates the need for adjustments to client local training and additional data/model transmission during OFL, making it highly practical for real-world scenarios. Enables support for heterogeneous client architectures.
- Extensive experiments validate superiority over state-of-the-art baselines. E.g. over 5% accuracy gain on various datasets and settings. Especially effective under extreme data distribution shifts.

In summary, by mutually boosting the two key elements of OFL, Co-Boosting significantly advances state-of-the-art one-shot federated learning methods without compromising practicality. It highlights the importance of their interrelationship for advancement.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel one-shot federated learning method called Co-Boosting that progressively improves the quality of synthesized data and the ensemble model by having them mutually enhance each other in an adversarial manner, yielding better performance compared to existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Demonstrating that it is possible to simultaneously improve the quality of the synthesized data and the ensemble, which are two key elements in one-shot federated learning (OFL). This highlights the need to optimize their interaction. 

2. Introducing Co-Boosting, a novel one-shot federated learning method that periodically and adversarially improves the quality of both the synthesized data and ensemble. This leads to natural refinement of the server model over time.

3. The proposed Co-Boosting method is highly practical for contemporary model-market scenarios as it eliminates the need for client-side training adjustments, extra data/model transmissions, and accommodates diverse client model architectures. 

4. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of Co-Boosting, consistently outperforming other baselines thanks to the improved quality of both synthetic data and ensemble model.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the Co-Boosting framework that mutually boosts synthesized data quality and ensemble model quality in one-shot federated learning, leading to state-of-the-art performance. The method is also adaptable to practical constraints of model-market scenarios.

To summarize, this paper proposes a new one-shot federated learning method called "Co-Boosting" which mutually boosts the quality of synthesized data and the ensemble model in an adversarial manner. Key ideas include using hard samples and an iterative process to enhance both the data and ensemble, eliminating the need for changes to local training or extra communication while still handling client heterogeneity. The improved synthetic data and ensemble then directly translate to better server model performance.
