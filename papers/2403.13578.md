# [Dynamic Reward Adjustment in Multi-Reward Reinforcement Learning for   Counselor Reflection Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13578)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Incorporating multiple rewards into reinforcement learning (RL) training of language models is challenging. Two main approaches exist - alternating between optimizing individual rewards (ALT) or combining rewards into a unified objective (COMB). 
- Previous methods rely on static configurations for alternating order or combining ratios. Lack of dynamic adjustment limits adaptability during training.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce two novel bandit algorithms - DynaOpt and C-DynaOpt - to dynamically control multiple reward weights in COMB optimization.
- DynaOpt uses a multi-armed bandit to select which reward weight to increment at each step. Allows "do nothing" option.
- C-DynaOpt extends this by using a contextual multi-armed bandit with extra context about current weights and performance.

Key Contributions:
- Show that naive and previous bandit-based multi-reward optimization methods fail to improve counselor reflection generation.
- Proposed DynaOpt and C-DynaOpt outperform baselines in automated and human evaluation for reflection quality.
- Demonstrate potential of bandit-based dynamic adjustment of multiple rewards to enhance language model training.
- Provide analysis of reward weight trajectories showing adaptive nature of approach.

In summary, the paper introduces two new bandit algorithms for dynamically optimizing multiple rewards in language model training. Experiments on counselor reflection generation show proposed methods outperform baselines, highlighting their potential to improve multi-reward reinforcement learning.
