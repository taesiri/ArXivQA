# [Using Large Language Models to Understand Telecom Standards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02929)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- 3GPP standards documents are complex and growing in size, making it difficult to find relevant information. 
- There is a need for systems that can provide quick and accurate answers to questions about 3GPP standards content.

Proposed Solution: 
- Evaluate capability of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to serve as digital assistants for referencing 3GPP documents by answering natural language questions.
- Introduce a new extractive QA LLM called TeleRoBERTa tailored for the telecom domain.
- Develop a system called TelcoGenAI based on retrieval augmented generation, that allows querying LLMs with 3GPP content.

Key Contributions:
- Evaluation of several foundation LLMs using a Telecom QA benchmark dataset called TeleQuAD. GPT-3.5 Turbo, Falcon and TeleRoBERTa show highest accuracy of 92-96%.
- Introduction of TeleRoBERTa, which matches accuracy of largest models tested while using an order of magnitude fewer parameters.
- Methods to reduce bias and hallucinations by pre-processing context data and fine-tuning LLMs. Fine-tuning improved accuracy by ~16%.
- Overview of system architecture for TelcoGenAI to allow natural language querying of 3GPP documents using LLMs.

The results show LLMs can serve as credible assistants to reference 3GPP standards. This opens possibilities for applications like troubleshooting, network operations, service commissioning and software development.
