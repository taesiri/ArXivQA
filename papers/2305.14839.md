# PaCE: Unified Multi-modal Dialogue Pre-training with Progressive and   Compositional Experts

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an effective pre-trained model for multi-modal dialogue that can handle diverse tasks and modalities in a unified framework. The key hypotheses are:1) Decomposing multi-modal dialogue into fundamental sub-capabilities and designing specific experts for each capability can enable effective divide-and-conquer pre-training.2) A progressive pre-training strategy that controls the combination of experts in different phases can help learn the experts and their combinations more efficiently. 3) The pre-trained model can flexibly select and combine different experts to adapt to various downstream multi-modal dialogue tasks.4) The pre-trained model can make effective use of both multi-modal dialogue data and more abundant non-dialogue multi-modal data to learn strong universal representations.In summary, the central research question is how to design a pre-trained model with flexible model architecture and adaptable training methodologies for multi-modal dialogue. The key hypotheses focus on decomposing the problem, progressive training of experts, flexible expert combinations, and utilizing both dialogue and non-dialogue data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes PaCE, a novel pre-training framework for multi-modal dialogue that adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, it decomposes the complex multi-modal dialogue task into several more manageable sub-capabilities, including caption modeling, context modeling, image modeling, grounding, and generation. 2. It develops a progressive cascade pre-training strategy to evolve the model by controlling the combination of experts in different pre-training stages. In stage 1, it trains on non-dialogue data. In stage 2, it trains the context expert guided by the caption expert on dialogue data. In stage 3, it adds a generation expert. 3. It collects and utilizes two large-scale corpora for pre-training: a multi-modal non-dialog corpus with 4M samples and a multi-modal dialog corpus with 1.4M dialogs.4. Extensive experiments show PaCE achieves new state-of-the-art results on 8 multi-modal dialog tasks, including intent prediction, retrieval, state tracking and response generation. This demonstrates its effectiveness and flexibility.In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a novel structured and progressive pre-training framework PaCE that can effectively leverage both dialog and non-dialog multi-modal data to learn strong unified representations for diverse multi-modal dialogue tasks. The divide-and-conquer strategy and progressive training enable PaCE to achieve superior flexibility and expandability.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on multi-modal dialogue:- This paper presents a novel multi-modal dialogue pre-training framework called PaCE, which aims to unify and handle diverse forms of multi-modal dialogue. Most prior work has focused on building models for specific multi-modal dialogue datasets or tasks. In contrast, PaCE provides a unified framework that can be adapted to multiple downstream tasks.- The key innovation is the use of a divide-and-conquer strategy to break down multi-modal dialogue into distinct sub-capabilities, each handled by a different expert module. This differs from prior work like large seq2seq or transformer models that handle all aspects in an entangled manner. The composable nature of PaCE's experts allows expanding the model's capabilities more easily.- PaCE introduces a progressive multi-stage pre-training approach. Many multi-modal models are pre-trained in an end-to-end fashion. By comparison, PaCE trains different expert modules separately on suitable datasets at each stage, which is more efficient and flexible.- The paper pre-trains PaCE on a large-scale corpus of 4.4M multi-modal examples. Most prior work has used much smaller datasets for pre-training. The diversity and size of PaCE's data likely contributes to its strong performance.- Experimental results show PaCE achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple multi-modal dialogue tasks like intent prediction, retrieval, state tracking and response generation. This demonstrates the generalized strength of the model compared to previous specialized models tuned for each task.In summary, PaCE introduces an innovative model architecture and pre-training approach that yields a flexible and unified solution for multi-modal dialogue, outperforming prior specialized models. The composable, progressive experts design is a unique strength.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Exploring the incorporation of additional modalities beyond text and images, and investigating whether the self-attention mechanism can effectively handle a broader range of modalities for unified representation learning. - Developing more efficient approaches for adapting pre-trained multi-modal models to diverse downstream tasks, eliminating the need to fine-tune all parameters of the model.- Exploring the integration of multi-modal generation tasks like image captioning and visual question answering into a unified framework, given the variations in model architectures used for text and image generation tasks. - Enhancing reasoning and comprehension capabilities to capture fine-grained details in images and text, e.g. by introducing modules for deep reasoning.- Incorporating spatial and structural information about images to improve understanding of relative positions and relationships between entities, which could help with response generation in dialog tasks.- Designing better evaluation metrics and datasets to assess the true reasoning and generalization abilities of multi-modal dialogue models beyond surface-level language generation.- Exploring cross-modal transfer learning and leveraging synergies between vision, language and speech modalities for multi-modal representation learning.In summary, the main future directions are around expanding the capabilities of multi-modal models to handle more modalities, tasks and reasoning requirements in a unified and efficient way, while also improving evaluation to get a better sense of the models' true understanding and generalization.
