# [Context Composing for Full Line Code Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09230)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Code completion is an essential IDE feature to aid developers, but most systems only provide short, single token suggestions. 
- Multi-line completions from large language models are useful but have high latency unsuitable for local execution.  
- There is a need for fast, full-line code completion that fits local device constraints.

Solution:
- The authors built a full line code completion feature using a compact GPT-like model to run locally within JetBrains IDEs like PyCharm.
- They use careful context composition and preprocessing to maximize efficiency within the size constraints:
    - Tokenizing via a modified BPE approach to better represent code
    - Trimming whitespace, using scope change tokens
    - Constructing context with file type, path, code above caret
- This enables fast predictions while providing useful, full line suggestions.

Contributions:
- Delivered and shipped the full line completion feature in PyCharm and Dataspell.
- Showed significantly increased code completion ratio for users in A/B tests.
- Identified future directions like smarter context filling from relevant files to further improve suggestions.
- Highlighted open problems around better context composition requiring more datasets of programmer behavior.

In summary, the paper presents a performant approach to full line code completion using efficient on-device inference. It shares results of integrating this into IDEs and benefiting users, while discussing future work to make neural suggestion models more context-aware.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper describes JetBrains' approach to developing an efficient full line code completion feature using a compact context-aware transformer model that operates locally on the user's device, with a focus on prompt engineering techniques to maximize the model's efficiency within a 1 billion parameter constraint.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper describes JetBrains' approach to developing the Full Line Code Completion (FLCC) feature using compact, context-aware transformer models that can run efficiently on end-user devices. Specifically, it details:

- The current context composing setup used for FLCC, including whitespace preprocessing, scope change tokens, and a modified BPE tokenization. This allows efficient context representation within the size limitations of local device processing.

- Evaluation methods, including A/B testing showing 1.5x increased code completion ratio for users with FLCC.

- Planned future work to expand the context size and explore more "smart" context composition techniques like fill-in-the-middle and retrieval augmentation.

- A discussion of open problems and directions for further research, focused on techniques to fill the code completion context with the most relevant information from the same and recently opened files.

So in summary, the main contribution is the description and evaluation of JetBrains' approach to developing an on-device FLCC feature using careful context engineering, which has shown usefulness in practice. The paper also outlines open questions to further improve context composition.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using special tokens like <SCOPE_IN> and <SCOPE_OUT> to indicate scope changes in indentation-sensitive languages like Python. What are some challenges in determining scope changes automatically? How robust is this approach across different coding styles?

2. The paper describes using a modified BPE tokenization approach to create better representations of source code lines. Can you elaborate on how the modifications enable better line representations? What are some examples of Python "idioms" that get merged into single tokens? 

3. The context construction approach concatenates file extension, path, and code above the caret position. What other file metadata could encode useful signals? Have experiments been done with directly encoding AST nodes instead of raw code?

4. The paper talks about strict latency requirements for the on-device model. What specific latency targets are you aiming for, and how does that translate to constraints on model size and architecture?

5. You mention planning experiments with longer context sizes like 1536 tokens. How exactly does using a model like LLaMA enable fitting larger contexts within memory constraints compared to GPT?

6. For the "smart" context approaches mentioned like fill-in-the-middle and retrieval augmentation, what modifications to the base model architecture enable incorporating those? 

7. The paper describes an unsuccessful experiment rearranging class methods to keep relevant context together. Can you elaborate on why that approach didn't help and what alternatives could address that "small context" issue?

8. What existing datasets incorporate programmer IDE usage patterns to explore techniques like using context from recently opened files? If data availability is an issue, what collaborative solutions can facilitate progress?

9. The interest expressed in techniques like RETRO seems very relevant. What challenges do you anticipate in adapting such methods effectively to operate within the strict latency and size constraints of an on-device system?

10. Beyond improving code completion quality, what other dimensions like user trust, transparency, etc. should be considered in assessing and comparing approaches to integrating neural networks into developer workflows?
