# [How we won BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma challenge? Just faking it! Enhanced   Synthetic Data Augmentation and Model Ensemble for brain tumour segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17317)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate segmentation of brain tumours from MRI scans is critical for treatment planning and survival prediction. However, manual segmentation is time-consuming and suffers from intra- and inter-rater variability.
- Deep learning methods require large datasets for training, which are difficult to obtain in the medical field.

Proposed Solution:
- Use two unconventional data augmentation strategies to generate synthetic training data:
  1) Registration - Each scan is registered to every other scan to create warped versions. This results in 23,049 augmented cases.
  2) GAN (GliGAN) - A GAN is trained to generate synthetic brain tumours conditioned on noise vectors and inserted into healthy parts of real scans. Two datasets created: G (30 random real labels per case) and rG (random synthetic labels).

- Ensemble three CNN architectures for improved performance:
  1) nnU-Net baseline
  2) Swin UNETR - incorporates global context via transformers 
  3) Winner of 2021 BraTS challenge - improved nnU-Net 

- Apply thresholding during post-processing to remove false positive tumour predictions, tuned on validation set.

Main Contributions:
- Novel data augmentation strategies to generate synthetic training data for brain tumour segmentation.
- Demonstrated improved performance from ensembling CNN and transformer-based architectures. 
- Thorough evaluation and comparison to prior art on 2021/2022 BraTS challenge datasets.
- Best model achieves dice scores of 0.9101, 0.8673 and 0.8509 for whole tumour, tumour core and enhancing tumour on the 2023 BraTS validation set.

In summary, the key idea is to use synthetic data generation to alleviate data scarcity and ensemble complementary network architectures to push the state-of-the-art in brain tumour segmentation. The methods are rigorously evaluated on standard medical imaging benchmarks.
