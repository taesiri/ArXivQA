# [S^2MVTC: a Simple yet Efficient Scalable Multi-View Tensor Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09107)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multi-view clustering (MVC) methods scale poorly for large datasets due to their high computational complexity. 
- Anchor-based scalable MVC methods explore consistency between anchor graphs or projection matrices rather than directly between embedding features. Exploring consistency at the embedding feature level could be more effective.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a Scalable and Simple Multi-View Tensor Clustering (S2MVTC) method that directly explores consistency between embedding features across views. 
- It first obtains view-specific embedding features using anchor graphs and projection matrices. These features are stacked and rotated into a tensor.
- A novel Tensor Low Frequency Approximation (TLFA) operator is proposed that captures graph similarity within each view's embedding features, ensuring smooth representations. 
- Inter-view semantic consistency between embedding features is enforced through a consensus regularization term.
- The optimized consensus embedding is used for final clustering.

Main Contributions:
- Directly explores inter- and intra-view consistency relationships at the embedding feature level rather than anchor graphs or projection matrices.
- Proposes a TLFA operator to ensure graph similarity and smoothness within each view's embedding features.
- Achieves significantly higher clustering performance and lower computation time compared to state-of-the-art methods on multiple large-scale datasets. 
- Performance gaps increase on larger datasets, showing scalability advantages.

In summary, the paper proposes a highly scalable and simple yet effective MVC solution that directly operates on the embedding feature level to explore inter- and intra-view consistency. This is the key novelty leading to its superior performance.
