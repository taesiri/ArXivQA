## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes a novel deep embedding model (DEM) for zero-shot learning (ZSL) that differs from existing models in its use of the CNN visual feature space as the embedding space rather than the semantic space. 

- It provides analysis and experiments showing that using the visual feature space as the embedding space helps alleviate the hubness problem in ZSL compared to using the semantic space.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points about how this paper compares to other related work in zero-shot learning:

- Embedding space selection: This paper proposes using the CNN visual feature space as the embedding space rather than the semantic space. Most prior works use either the semantic space or an intermediate space for embedding. The authors argue that using the visual space helps alleviate the hubness problem in nearest neighbor search.

- Multi-modal fusion: The model provides a mechanism to fuse multiple semantic spaces (e.g. attributes and word vectors) in an end-to-end framework. This is more flexible than simply combining predictions. 

- Language model integration: For sentence description inputs, the model integrates a neural language model into the end-to-end framework. This enables jointly learning the language model for encoding sentences and the embedding model.

- Performance: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on several standard datasets compared to prior works. The performance gaps are particularly large on the larger-scale ImageNet datasets.

- Analysis: The paper provides useful analysis and visualizations to demonstrate the effects of embedding space selection on hubness and model performance. This provides insights into why the proposed model works well.

Overall, the novelty lies in the proposed visual feature space embedding idea and the end-to-end fusion framework. The impressive results validate these design choices and the advantages of end-to-end deep learning for zero-shot recognition.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Exploring other neural network architectures for the semantic encoding subnet. The authors use a simple fully-connected neural network in their model, but suggest exploring more advanced architectures like CNNs or graph neural networks could be beneficial.

- Applying the idea of using the visual feature space as the embedding space to other embedding models like those based on margin-based losses. The authors show this works well with a least squares loss but could also be effective for other loss functions.

- Extending the model to other transfer learning settings like multi-task learning or domain adaptation. The neural network formulation makes the model flexible enough to potentially tackle these other problems.

- Testing the approach on other, more fine-grained datasets. The authors demonstrate strong results on several existing benchmarks, but note performance could vary on other dataset types.

- Combining the model with generative approaches like GANs to generate visual examples of novel classes using their semantic descriptions.

- Exploring refinements to the multi-modal fusion approach when combining multiple semantic spaces.

In summary, the main suggested directions are around architecture exploration, extending to other transfer learning problems, evaluating on more datasets, and combining the model with generative approaches. The core idea of selecting the visual feature space as the embedding shows promise.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel deep embedding model for zero-shot learning (ZSL) called DEM. The key difference compared to existing models is that DEM uses the CNN visual feature space as the embedding space rather than the semantic space. This helps alleviate the hubness problem in nearest neighbor search. The model architecture has two branches - one encodes visual features using a CNN, the other encodes semantic features using fully connected layers or a recurrent neural net if text descriptions are available. These two branches are linked via a least squares loss to align the embedded visual and semantic vectors. The model can fuse multiple semantic spaces like attributes and word vectors. Experiments on several datasets show DEM significantly outperforms existing models on ZSL tasks. The visual feature space as embedding is critical for this - using semantic space makes performance much worse. Overall, DEM sets new state-of-the-art results by learning an end-to-end deep embedding optimized for ZSL through careful choice of embedding space.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep embedding model for zero-shot learning (ZSL). ZSL aims to recognize objects from classes not seen during training by transferring knowledge from seen classes. Most ZSL models use a joint embedding space to relate visual features and semantic representations of classes. This paper argues that the key to an effective deep embedding model for ZSL is the choice of embedding space. Specifically, it proposes using the CNN visual feature space as the embedding space, instead of the more commonly used semantic space or intermediate spaces. Mapping from semantic to visual space alleviates the hubness problem in embedding-based ZSL, where some prototypes become hubs and nearest neighbors to many points. The proposed model consists of a visual branch with a CNN encoder and a semantic branch with fully connected layers. An embedding loss minimizes the discrepancy between visual features and mapped class prototypes. This model allows end-to-end learning, multi-modal fusion, and integration of neural language models for text descriptions. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the importance of embedding space selection. The model significantly outperforms existing deep ZSL models.

In summary, this paper makes the following key contributions: (1) It proposes a novel deep embedding model for ZSL that uses the CNN visual feature space as the embedding space to reduce the hubness problem. (2) The model allows end-to-end learning, multi-modal fusion, and integration of neural language models. (3) Extensive experiments validate the importance of embedding space selection, and show state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks, outperforming existing deep ZSL models. The key idea is that selecting the visual feature space instead of semantic space as the embedding space is critical for effective deep embedding models for ZSL.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:

This paper proposes a deep neural network model for zero-shot learning (ZSL) called Deep Embedding Model (DEM). The key idea is to use the CNN visual feature space as the embedding space rather than the semantic space commonly used in other models. An image is passed through a CNN to extract a visual feature vector. The class semantic vector (e.g. attributes or word vectors) is passed through fully connected layers to be mapped to the same visual feature space. The model is trained end-to-end with a least squares loss to minimize the discrepancy between the mapped semantic vector and visual feature vector for each image. At test time, the semantic prototype of an unseen class is mapped to the visual feature space and assigned to the nearest image feature vector. Using the visual feature space as the embedding space helps alleviate the hubness problem in ZSL. The model can also fuse multiple semantic spaces like attributes and word vectors. When textual descriptions are available, a LSTM model can be used to encode sentences and trained jointly with the full model in an end-to-end manner.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points about the problem addressed in this paper are:

- It focuses on zero-shot learning (ZSL), where the goal is to recognize objects from classes not seen during training. This is an important challenge for scaling up recognition to large numbers of classes. 

- Most ZSL methods rely on learning a joint embedding space to project visual features and semantic vectors representing class information (e.g. attributes or word vectors). The key issue is how to learn an effective embedding model.

- Existing ZSL embedding models either map visual features to a semantic space or to an intermediate space. However, the authors argue these suffer from the "hubness" problem where some semantic vectors become hubs nearest to many projected visual features.

- They hypothesize that using the visual CNN feature space as the embedding space will alleviate the hubness problem. They also argue end-to-end deep learning of the embedding model has advantages for fusing semantic information.

- However, prior deep ZSL models have not shown clear benefits over non-deep methods. The key contribution is developing a deep model that uses the visual space as embedding space to achieve state-of-the-art ZSL performance.

In summary, the key problem is how to learn an effective deep embedding model for ZSL that can outperform existing models, with a focus on selecting the right embedding space and enabling end-to-end learning.
