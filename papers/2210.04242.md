# [Improving Multi-turn Emotional Support Dialogue Generation with   Lookahead Strategy Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04242)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is on developing methods for multi-turn emotional support conversation systems. Specifically, it aims to address two main challenges:

1. Support strategy planning: The paper argues that in a multi-turn emotional support conversation, the system needs to be able to strategically plan the dialogue and select appropriate support strategies to progressively guide the user to a better emotional state. This requires going beyond just predicting the next one-turn strategy to consider the long-term effects of using a sequence of strategies. 

2. Dynamic user state modeling: The paper points out that in multi-turn scenarios, it is important for the system to dynamically track changes in the user's state over the course of the conversation. It highlights that the user's emotional state often only changes subtly in these conversations, so traditional emotion detection methods that categorize emotions into discrete types may not be suitable.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a multi-turn emotional support conversation system called MultiESC. The key ideas include:

- Conducting strategy planning using "lookahead heuristics" to estimate the future user feedback for different candidate strategy sequences, in order to select strategies that will lead to better long-term outcomes.

- Modeling the user's state by capturing subtle emotional expressions using VAD emotion scores and identifying emotion causes mentioned in the user's utterances. 

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by incorporating lookahead strategy planning and dynamic user state modeling, the proposed MultiESC system will be better able to provide effective multi-turn emotional support through conversations compared to existing methods. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a multi-turn emotional support conversation framework named MultiESC. The key ideas are:

1. It conducts support strategy planning with lookahead to estimate the long-term effects of adopting certain strategies. This is different from prior work on strategy planning in dialogues which only considered selecting strategies for the next single turn. 

2. It dynamically tracks the user's state during the conversation, focusing on capturing the user's subtle emotional changes and understanding emotion causes. Previous emotion-related dialogue systems usually only detected coarse-grained emotion types.

3. Extensive experiments demonstrate MultiESC can significantly outperform competitive baselines in terms of both strategy planning and dialogue generation quality.

In summary, this is the first work that explores effective strategy planning with lookahead and fine-grained user state modeling for multi-turn emotional support conversations. The proposed techniques such as incorporating lookahead heuristics in strategy selection and capturing subtle emotion changes using VAD embeddings provide novel and effective solutions to the key challenges in this task.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper: 

The paper proposes a multi-turn emotional support conversation framework called MultiESC that conducts support strategy planning with foresight of future user feedback and dynamically tracks user state by capturing subtle emotional expressions and emotion causes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper on multi-turn emotional support conversation systems makes several novel contributions compared to prior work:

- It is one of the first papers to explore multi-turn emotional support chatbots, whereas most prior work focused on single-turn interactions. The multi-turn setting is more realistic but also more challenging.

- It proposes a new framework called MultiESC that addresses two key challenges in multi-turn ESC: support strategy planning and dynamic user state modeling. 

- For strategy planning, it incorporates "lookahead heuristics" to estimate the long-term effects of using certain strategies, unlike prior work that just considered the next turn. This helps select strategies towards the overall goal.

- For user state modeling, it captures subtle emotion changes using VAD dimensions and identifies emotion causes. Prior work usually just detected coarse emotion categories.

- It draws inspiration from A* search to formulate strategy planning as searching for an optimal sequence. This is a new way to address strategy selection.

- It demonstrates strong improvements over several baselines including recent models like DialoGPT-Joint and BlenderBot-Joint.

Overall, this paper makes multiple innovations in a new task setting of multi-turn emotional support conversations. The proposed techniques for strategy planning with lookahead and detailed user state modeling are novel and shown to be effective. The results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in this emerging research direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several promising future research directions for multi-turn emotional support conversations:

1. User state modeling: The authors mentioned that capturing subtle changes in the user's emotional state and modeling other aspects like user personality could further improve strategy planning and response generation. More sophisticated user state tracking should be explored.

2. Strategy-enhanced generation: The paper focuses on strategy planning but uses a relatively simple method to integrate the selected strategy into response generation. More sophisticated methods could be developed to generate responses that better utilize the planned strategies.

3. Evaluation metrics: Developing automatic evaluation metrics specially designed for emotional support conversations is needed. The existing dialogue evaluation metrics may not fully reflect the quality of providing emotional support. 

4. Strategy planning for other tasks: The proposed method of lookahead strategy planning could be explored on other dialogue tasks where long-term planning is needed. Its effectiveness and generality should be further tested.

5. Incorporating commonsense knowledge: The paper mentions that utilizing commonsense knowledge about social interactions could help generate more natural and empathetic responses. This is worth exploring in the future.

6. User modeling: More comprehensive user modeling that goes beyond emotion state tracking could lead to more personalized and engaging conversations. The model could try to understand user personality, preferences, experiences etc.

In summary, the authors point out promising future work in various aspects including user state modeling, strategy integration, evaluation methods, knowledge incorporation and user modeling to develop more effective and natural emotional support conversational agents.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores support strategy planning in multi-turn emotional support conversation systems. It argues that compared to single-turn interactions, developing multi-turn systems faces new challenges including how to conduct strategy planning with foresight of indirect delayed effects and how to dynamically track subtle changes in the user's state. The paper proposes a multi-turn framework called MultiESC to address these issues. For strategy planning, it uses lookahead heuristics inspired by A* search to estimate future user feedback and select strategies accordingly. For user state modeling, it focuses on capturing subtle emotion changes using the VAD model and identifying emotion causes. Experiments show MultiESC outperforms baselines in strategy planning and dialogue generation quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The main contributions are the use of lookahead heuristics for strategy planning and the way user state is modeled to enable multi-turn conversations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores multi-turn emotional support conversation systems, which aim to provide emotional support over multiple dialogue turns to help soothe users' negative feelings. Compared to prior work that only considered single-turn interactions, developing effective multi-turn systems faces new challenges. One major challenge is support strategy planning - selecting the best sequence of support strategies across turns to progressively guide users to more positive emotional states. The paper proposes a framework called MultiESC that addresses strategy planning using "lookahead heuristics". Specifically, it incorporates a strategy sequence generator to predict probable future strategy sequences, and a user feedback predictor to estimate the long-term effect of using those strategies to comfort the user. This allows strategically selecting sequences expected to provide the best long-term support effect. The other key challenge is dynamically tracking users' emotional state changes during the conversation, since their emotions evolve subtly across turns. MultiESC focuses on modeling users' subtle emotion changes along continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance dimensions based on psychological theory, and also detects emotion causes. Experiments demonstrate MultiESC substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both strategy planning and dialogue generation quality. The results highlight the importance of multi-turn modeling and long-term strategy planning for providing effective emotional support through conversation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-turn emotional support conversation (ESC) framework called MultiESC. The key components of MultiESC are the support strategy planning module and the user state modeling module. For strategy planning, MultiESC uses A*-inspired lookahead heuristics to estimate the expectation of future user feedback for different strategy sequences, in order to select strategies that will lead to the best long-term effect. This involves a strategy sequence generator to produce probabilities of future strategies, and a user feedback predictor to estimate the feedback after applying those strategies. For user state modeling, MultiESC identifies the user's subtle emotional expressions from context using the NRC VAD lexicon, and also detects the user's emotion causes using an off-the-shelf tool. The user's state embeddings are then combined with dialogue history embeddings to select the optimal support strategy. Finally, an utterance decoder generates the system response adopting that strategy. Experiments show MultiESC outperforms baselines in both strategy planning and dialogue generation quality.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of developing multi-turn emotional support conversation (ESC) systems. Some key issues it aims to tackle include:

1. Support strategy planning: Effective emotional support requires planning the conversation strategically to progressively guide the user to a better emotional state. However, most prior work on ESC systems only considered single-turn interactions and lacked explicit strategy planning. The paper argues that the system should be able to "look ahead" and plan a sequence of strategies rather than just selecting one strategy for the next turn.

2. Dynamic user state modeling: In multi-turn conversations, the user's state changes dynamically. Prior work often relied on coarse emotion type detection, but the paper argues this is insufficient for ESC where the user's emotion usually only changes subtly in intensity. It proposes more fine-grained emotion detection using continuous VAD dimensions and also modeling emotion causes.

3. Addressing the limitations of single-turn systems: Single-turn ESC systems are oversimplified and have limited effectiveness. Developing multi-turn systems allows providing support more progressively but faces new challenges like strategy planning and dynamic user state modeling.

In summary, the key focus is on enabling more effective multi-turn emotional support through long-term strategy planning and dynamic user state tracking, overcoming limitations of prior single-turn ESC systems. The core novelties are the "lookahead" strategy planning and more fine-grained user state modeling.
