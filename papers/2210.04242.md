# Improving Multi-turn Emotional Support Dialogue Generation with   Lookahead Strategy Planning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is on developing methods for multi-turn emotional support conversation systems. Specifically, it aims to address two main challenges:1. Support strategy planning: The paper argues that in a multi-turn emotional support conversation, the system needs to be able to strategically plan the dialogue and select appropriate support strategies to progressively guide the user to a better emotional state. This requires going beyond just predicting the next one-turn strategy to consider the long-term effects of using a sequence of strategies. 2. Dynamic user state modeling: The paper points out that in multi-turn scenarios, it is important for the system to dynamically track changes in the user's state over the course of the conversation. It highlights that the user's emotional state often only changes subtly in these conversations, so traditional emotion detection methods that categorize emotions into discrete types may not be suitable.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a multi-turn emotional support conversation system called MultiESC. The key ideas include:- Conducting strategy planning using "lookahead heuristics" to estimate the future user feedback for different candidate strategy sequences, in order to select strategies that will lead to better long-term outcomes.- Modeling the user's state by capturing subtle emotional expressions using VAD emotion scores and identifying emotion causes mentioned in the user's utterances. So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by incorporating lookahead strategy planning and dynamic user state modeling, the proposed MultiESC system will be better able to provide effective multi-turn emotional support through conversations compared to existing methods. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a multi-turn emotional support conversation framework named MultiESC. The key ideas are:1. It conducts support strategy planning with lookahead to estimate the long-term effects of adopting certain strategies. This is different from prior work on strategy planning in dialogues which only considered selecting strategies for the next single turn. 2. It dynamically tracks the user's state during the conversation, focusing on capturing the user's subtle emotional changes and understanding emotion causes. Previous emotion-related dialogue systems usually only detected coarse-grained emotion types.3. Extensive experiments demonstrate MultiESC can significantly outperform competitive baselines in terms of both strategy planning and dialogue generation quality.In summary, this is the first work that explores effective strategy planning with lookahead and fine-grained user state modeling for multi-turn emotional support conversations. The proposed techniques such as incorporating lookahead heuristics in strategy selection and capturing subtle emotion changes using VAD embeddings provide novel and effective solutions to the key challenges in this task.
