# [WikiWeb2M: A Page-Level Multimodal Wikipedia Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05432)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is introducing and analyzing a new multimodal dataset called WikiWeb2M for studying multimodal webpage understanding. The key research questions/goals around this dataset appear to be:

- Can retaining the full set of images, text, and structure from webpages in a unified format enable new research on multimodal webpage understanding? 

- What kinds of multimodal generation tasks such as page description, section summarization, and contextual image captioning can be facilitated by the proposed WikiWeb2M dataset?

- How does having the complete webpage context compare to more limited context (e.g. just the section an image comes from) for tasks like contextual image captioning?

- What are the statistics and characteristics of the WikiWeb2M dataset in terms of number of pages, sections, images, etc. and how does it compare to prior multimodal Wikipedia datasets like WIT?

- What level of performance can standard multimodal models like T5 and ViT achieve on tasks enabled by WikiWeb2M and how might this benchmark help drive further research?

In summary, the central research focus is presenting WikiWeb2M as a way to better study multimodal webpage understanding through unified text, image, and structure data as well as analyzing the dataset itself and benchmarking performance on enabled tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the Wikipedia Webpage 2M (WikiWeb2M) dataset. Specifically:

- WikiWeb2M is the first dataset to retain the full set of images, text, and structure data available in a Wikipedia page. 

- It contains over 2 million English Wikipedia pages with all associated text sections, images, captions, and metadata. 

- This unified multimodal data enables new tasks like page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning that require understanding content at different granularities.

- Experiments show performance improvements on downstream tasks when using the full webpage context compared to only partial context (e.g. just the target image's section).

- WikiWeb2M facilitates future research on multimodal webpage understanding through its release as an open source dataset.

In summary, the key contribution is the release and benchmarking of the first large-scale multimodal Wikipedia webpage dataset that retains the complete webpage content, enabling new research directions in multimodal understanding.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces WikiWeb2M, a new multimodal Wikipedia dataset with over 2 million pages that retains all images, text, and structure to enable tasks like page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other research on multimodal webpage datasets:

- This paper introduces WikiWeb2M, the first large-scale dataset that retains the full webpage structure with text, images, and metadata all together. Other datasets like WIT only keep partial webpage data. Having the full webpage enables new tasks like page description generation.

- The paper proposes three multimodal generation tasks leveraging the webpage structure: page description, section summarization, and contextual image captioning. These tasks demonstrate understanding webpages at different levels of granularity. Other datasets have focused more narrowly on image-text tasks.

- With over 2 million webpages, WikiWeb2M is much larger in scale compared to other webpage datasets. The scale enables pretrained models like T5 and ViT to be applied and achieve reasonable performance on the tasks. Other datasets tend to be smaller in size.

- The paper compares performance on the proposed tasks when using just the target section versus the full webpage context. Results show the additional webpage context improves downstream task performance, demonstrating the value in retaining the full webpage. 

- The tasks and dataset enable future work on assisting people who are blind or visually impaired via page previews and enhanced screen readers. This provides a motivating application compared to other webpage datasets.

- One limitation is that the summarization and captioning tasks use heuristic or simplistic approaches for generating the target outputs. More advanced models could be applied and human evaluation conducted. Other datasets have included human-generated captions or summaries.

In summary, the key innovations are in creating the first large-scale, holistic webpage dataset and demonstrating the value of webpage structure for multimodal tasks. This pushes forward research on modeling webpages.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Studying additional multimodal webpage understanding tasks enabled by the unified text, image, and structure data in WikiWeb2M, beyond the tasks introduced in the paper. The authors suggest taxonomic webpage classification, webpage retrieval, and other tasks could be explored.

- Applying models pretrained on WikiWeb2M to downstream tasks and studying the benefits of pretraining on this multimodal webpage dataset compared to other datasets.

- Expanding the contextual image captioning task to utilize even more of the webpage context beyond just the full page. For example, incorporating cross-page context or the image URL.

- Studying the generated outputs from models trained on WikiWeb2M tasks to better understand multimodal webpage understanding, for example by having humans evaluate the quality of page descriptions or contextual captions.

- Expanding the scope of the dataset to webpages beyond Wikipedia, to encompass more diversity of webpage structure and content.

- Using models trained on WikiWeb2M for assistive technologies like providing enhanced previews for screen reader users.

- Exploring multimodal generative tasks like generating synthetic webpages conditioned on images, text, and/or structure.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces WikiWeb2M, a new multimodal Wikipedia dataset that retains the full text, images, and structure of over 2 million Wikipedia pages. In contrast to prior datasets like WIT that only keep partial webpage content, WikiWeb2M can support new multimodal tasks like page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning. Experiments show that models leveraging the full webpage context in WikiWeb2M outperform models trained only on partial context for section summarization and contextual captioning. Overall, WikiWeb2M enables richer multimodal understanding and generation using complete webpages.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces WikiWeb2M, a new multimodal Wikipedia dataset that retains all of the images, text, and structure from Wikipedia webpages in one unified example. Previous datasets like WIT have only kept pieces of webpages, such as image-caption pairs or article text, but not the full webpage content. WikiWeb2M contains over 2 million Wikipedia pages with all images, text sections, and metadata like image captions and dimensions. It can enable new multimodal webpage understanding tasks like page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning. These tasks are useful for improving accessibility or generating multimodal content snippets. 

The authors describe how WikiWeb2M was created by rescraping Wikipedia pages from the WIT dataset. They define train/validation/test splits over the 2M pages. The dataset has over 10M text sections, far more than WIT, since it keeps all of a page's sections. The authors also describe the three multimodal generation tasks enabled by WikiWeb2M: page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning. For each task they describe the data processing, filtering, and metrics. They show baseline results from T5 and ViT models, demonstrating the feasibility of the tasks. In summary, the WikiWeb2M dataset advances multimodal webpage understanding by providing a unified resource to study generation tasks at the page, section, and image level.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces WikiWeb2M, a new multimodal dataset for studying webpage understanding that contains over 2 million Wikipedia pages with unified image, text, and structure data. Each webpage sample includes the page URL and title, section titles, text, and indices, images and their captions, and more. The dataset is used for three multimodal webpage generation tasks: page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning. For page description, the Wikipedia-provided summaries are used as targets. For section summarization, the first sentence of each section is treated as a pseudo summary. For contextual image captioning, the reference image descriptions from Wikipedia are used as target captions. Experiments using T5 and ViT models show strong performance on these tasks, demonstrating the utility of the unified multimodal webpage data in WikiWeb2M. Additional webpage tasks like taxonomic classification and retrieval could also leverage this new dataset in the future.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem the authors are addressing is the lack of a comprehensive multimodal webpage dataset that retains the full set of images, text, and structure from webpages. 

The authors note that prior datasets like WIT only keep certain elements of webpages (e.g. image-caption pairs), but not the full HTML content. As a result, research on multimodal webpage understanding has been limited. 

To enable more research on this, the authors introduce the Wikipedia Webpage 2M (WikiWeb2M) dataset, which contains over 2 million Wikipedia pages where each page retains all text, images, and structure (e.g. section titles and indices). 

The authors argue this comprehensive webpage data can support new multimodal tasks like page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning. These tasks require understanding connections between text, images, and structure across an entire page.

In summary, the key problem is the lack of a suitable multimodal webpage dataset to support research on holistic webpage understanding and generation. WikiWeb2M is proposed as a solution by providing a large-scale dataset with complete webpage content.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper introduces WikiWeb2M, a new multimodal dataset for studying webpage understanding. WikiWeb2M contains over 2 million Wikipedia pages where each page retains the full set of images, text, and structure data from the original webpage. This is in contrast to prior Wikipedia datasets like WIT that only keep certain webpage elements. WikiWeb2M can enable new multimodal tasks like page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning. The authors propose three tasks using WikiWeb2M: generating a description of the overall page, generating a summary sentence for a section given its content and surrounding sections, and generating an image caption given the full webpage context. Experiments show that models benefit from having access to the full webpage compared to just target sections. In summary, WikiWeb2M pushes multimodal webpage understanding forward by providing complete webpage data and task formulations taking advantage of the unified multimodal content.
