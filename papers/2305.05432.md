# [WikiWeb2M: A Page-Level Multimodal Wikipedia Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05432)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is introducing and analyzing a new multimodal dataset called WikiWeb2M for studying multimodal webpage understanding. The key research questions/goals around this dataset appear to be:- Can retaining the full set of images, text, and structure from webpages in a unified format enable new research on multimodal webpage understanding? - What kinds of multimodal generation tasks such as page description, section summarization, and contextual image captioning can be facilitated by the proposed WikiWeb2M dataset?- How does having the complete webpage context compare to more limited context (e.g. just the section an image comes from) for tasks like contextual image captioning?- What are the statistics and characteristics of the WikiWeb2M dataset in terms of number of pages, sections, images, etc. and how does it compare to prior multimodal Wikipedia datasets like WIT?- What level of performance can standard multimodal models like T5 and ViT achieve on tasks enabled by WikiWeb2M and how might this benchmark help drive further research?In summary, the central research focus is presenting WikiWeb2M as a way to better study multimodal webpage understanding through unified text, image, and structure data as well as analyzing the dataset itself and benchmarking performance on enabled tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the Wikipedia Webpage 2M (WikiWeb2M) dataset. Specifically:- WikiWeb2M is the first dataset to retain the full set of images, text, and structure data available in a Wikipedia page. - It contains over 2 million English Wikipedia pages with all associated text sections, images, captions, and metadata. - This unified multimodal data enables new tasks like page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning that require understanding content at different granularities.- Experiments show performance improvements on downstream tasks when using the full webpage context compared to only partial context (e.g. just the target image's section).- WikiWeb2M facilitates future research on multimodal webpage understanding through its release as an open source dataset.In summary, the key contribution is the release and benchmarking of the first large-scale multimodal Wikipedia webpage dataset that retains the complete webpage content, enabling new research directions in multimodal understanding.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces WikiWeb2M, a new multimodal Wikipedia dataset with over 2 million pages that retains all images, text, and structure to enable tasks like page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other research on multimodal webpage datasets:- This paper introduces WikiWeb2M, the first large-scale dataset that retains the full webpage structure with text, images, and metadata all together. Other datasets like WIT only keep partial webpage data. Having the full webpage enables new tasks like page description generation.- The paper proposes three multimodal generation tasks leveraging the webpage structure: page description, section summarization, and contextual image captioning. These tasks demonstrate understanding webpages at different levels of granularity. Other datasets have focused more narrowly on image-text tasks.- With over 2 million webpages, WikiWeb2M is much larger in scale compared to other webpage datasets. The scale enables pretrained models like T5 and ViT to be applied and achieve reasonable performance on the tasks. Other datasets tend to be smaller in size.- The paper compares performance on the proposed tasks when using just the target section versus the full webpage context. Results show the additional webpage context improves downstream task performance, demonstrating the value in retaining the full webpage. - The tasks and dataset enable future work on assisting people who are blind or visually impaired via page previews and enhanced screen readers. This provides a motivating application compared to other webpage datasets.- One limitation is that the summarization and captioning tasks use heuristic or simplistic approaches for generating the target outputs. More advanced models could be applied and human evaluation conducted. Other datasets have included human-generated captions or summaries.In summary, the key innovations are in creating the first large-scale, holistic webpage dataset and demonstrating the value of webpage structure for multimodal tasks. This pushes forward research on modeling webpages.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Studying additional multimodal webpage understanding tasks enabled by the unified text, image, and structure data in WikiWeb2M, beyond the tasks introduced in the paper. The authors suggest taxonomic webpage classification, webpage retrieval, and other tasks could be explored.- Applying models pretrained on WikiWeb2M to downstream tasks and studying the benefits of pretraining on this multimodal webpage dataset compared to other datasets.- Expanding the contextual image captioning task to utilize even more of the webpage context beyond just the full page. For example, incorporating cross-page context or the image URL.- Studying the generated outputs from models trained on WikiWeb2M tasks to better understand multimodal webpage understanding, for example by having humans evaluate the quality of page descriptions or contextual captions.- Expanding the scope of the dataset to webpages beyond Wikipedia, to encompass more diversity of webpage structure and content.- Using models trained on WikiWeb2M for assistive technologies like providing enhanced previews for screen reader users.- Exploring multimodal generative tasks like generating synthetic webpages conditioned on images, text, and/or structure.
