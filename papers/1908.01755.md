# [On the Existence of Simpler Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01755)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can accurate-yet-simple machine learning models be proven to exist, or shown likely to exist, before explicitly searching for them?

The key hypothesis proposed in the paper is that the size of the Rashomon set is often large. The Rashomon set refers to the set of almost-equally-accurate models from a function class. 

The authors hypothesize that if the Rashomon set is large, it is likely to contain numerous accurate models, including at least one simple model. This would imply that simple or interpretable models may often achieve comparable accuracy to more complex models, without having to explicitly search for them.

To investigate this hypothesis, the paper introduces the Rashomon ratio as a way to quantify the size of the Rashomon set. It provides theoretical results showing connections between a large Rashomon ratio and the existence of accurate yet simple models that generalize well. The paper also presents empirical results suggesting that similar performance of multiple machine learning algorithms correlates with larger Rashomon ratios.

In summary, the central research question is whether the existence of accurate-yet-simple models can be assessed before searching for them, based on the size of the Rashomon set. The key hypothesis is that larger Rashomon sets imply the existence of such simple models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces the concept of the "Rashomon ratio", which measures the ratio of the volume of accurate models (the "Rashomon set") to the volume of the full hypothesis space for a given learning problem. This ratio serves as a measure of the simplicity or complexity of a learning problem. 

2. It provides theoretical results showing that a large Rashomon ratio correlates with the existence of simpler yet accurate models that generalize well. Specifically, it shows that under certain assumptions, if the Rashomon ratio is large, there are guaranteed to exist simpler models that achieve similar accuracy to more complex models.

3. It provides empirical results on 38 classification datasets showing that when the Rashomon ratio is large, different machine learning algorithms tend to achieve similar performance. This suggests the Rashomon ratio could be large enough to contain accurate models from different complexities.

4. It shows both theoretically and empirically that the Rashomon ratio provides a different perspective on model complexity compared to traditional measures like VC dimension and stability. The Rashomon ratio depends on the specific dataset and measures the multiplicity of accurate models.

5. It provides analysis and empirical evidence showing the Rashomon ratio tends to be larger when there is more noise/overlap between classes, which helps explain when simpler models are likely to exist.

Overall, the key innovation is introducing the Rashomon ratio as a new lens for understanding model simplicity, the existence of accurate simple models, and connections to generalization. The theoretical and empirical results provide evidence this new perspective could be useful for machine learning theory and practice.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper focuses on the phenomenon of "Rashomon sets" in machine learning, which refers to the observation that there often exist many different models that fit a given dataset almost equally well. The key contributions of the paper are:

- It formally defines the "Rashomon ratio" as a measure of the size of the Rashomon set relative to the full hypothesis space. The Rashomon ratio is presented as a way to quantify the complexity or "simplicity" of a learning problem. 

- It provides theoretical results showing how a large Rashomon set can imply the existence of simple yet accurate models that generalize well. This connects the size of the Rashomon set to model simplicity and generalization ability.

- It empirically analyzes the Rashomon ratio on many real datasets, observing that larger Rashomon ratios correlate with similar performance across different ML algorithms. This suggests the Rashomon ratio could explain why different algorithms often achieve similar performance. 

- It analyzes how feature noise can impact the size of the Rashomon set, finding that overlapping Gaussian distributions tend to induce larger Rashomon sets.

The key differences from related work are:

- It focuses directly on quantifying and understanding the implications of the Rashomon effect itself, whereas much past work has studied it indirectly or as an aside. 

- It connects the Rashomon effect to model simplicity, generalization, and algorithmic performance in new ways not explored before.

- It proposes the concrete Rashomon ratio measure for quantifying the effect.

- It provides extensive empirical investigation of the measure on real datasets.

Overall, this paper provides both theoretical and empirical contributions towards better understanding the "Rashomon effect" phenomenon in machine learning, and its implications for topics like model simplicity, generalization, and algorithm performance. The proposed Rashomon ratio measure is novel and shown to provide insight into these areas.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper discusses the concept of Rashomon sets, which refer to the set of almost equally accurate models for a given dataset and hypothesis space. The key research directions suggested in the paper are:

1. Developing tighter theoretical bounds relating the size of the Rashomon set to the existence of simpler yet accurate models and their generalization ability. The bounds presented in the paper are basic and rely on strong assumptions. More practical bounds could further strengthen the connection between theory and practice.

2. Developing better methods to estimate the size of the Rashomon set, either analytically or via sampling techniques. This could facilitate more empirical studies across various models and datasets to validate the theoretical developments. Challenges include improper parameterizations inflating the space artificially. 

3. Understanding if techniques like adding noise to training data increase the Rashomon set size. This could provide methods to deliberately reshape problems to induce larger Rashomon sets and the attendant benefits. Initial connections are made to differential privacy.

4. Further exploring connections between Rashomon set size and model interpretability. The paper shows larger sets can contain simpler models, but more work is needed on explicitly searching for interpretable models within large Rashomon sets.

5. Considering online learning settings where the Rashomon set evolves over time as new data arrives. Extending notions like the Rashomon ratio and elbow for online model selection.

6. Developing model selection techniques that explicitly leverage the Rashomon set size and properties like the "Rashomon elbow" curve. Most work focuses on training accuracy and validation set performance.

In summary, key directions are tighter theory, better estimation methods, deliberately manipulating Rashomon sets, connections to interpretability, online learning, and new model selection techniques. The Rashomon perspective provides a new lens on generalization and simplicity in machine learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores the concept of "Rashomon sets," which are the sets of almost equally accurate models that can be derived from a particular dataset and hypothesis space. The authors introduce the "Rashomon ratio" to quantify the size of the Rashomon set relative to the full hypothesis space. They show theoretically and empirically that large Rashomon sets correlate with the existence of simpler yet accurate models that generalize well across the full set. In particular, when different machine learning algorithms achieve similar performance on a dataset, this suggests a large underlying Rashomon set. The authors provide generalization bounds for models from large Rashomon sets and show these sets can arise in the presence of noise. Overall, the paper provides a new perspective on model simplicity and generalization based on the size of the Rashomon set. A key insight is that observing similar performance across ML algorithms indicates a large Rashomon set and the likely existence of simpler accurate models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes using Rashomon sets and ratios as a new perspective for understanding generalization and model simplicity in machine learning. The Rashomon set is defined as the set of models that have approximately equal training accuracy. The Rashomon ratio measures the fraction of models that are in the Rashomon set. 

The key results are: (1) Large Rashomon sets can contain simpler and generalizable models. This is shown theoretically under assumptions about the Rashomon set containing simpler models. (2) Empirically, similar performance of different algorithms correlates with large Rashomon ratios, and large ratios correlate with good generalization. This suggests large ratios indicate it may be possible to find simpler generalizable models. (3) The Rashomon ratio differs from common complexity measures like VC dimension and is a joint property of the data and hypothesis space. (4) Noisy data where classes overlap tends to produce large Rashomon sets. Overall, the Rashomon perspective provides new insight into when simpler models exist and generalize well.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using Rashomon sets and ratios as a new perspective on generalization and model simplicity in machine learning. The Rashomon set is defined as the set of models that have training performance close to the empirical risk minimizer. The Rashomon ratio measures the fraction of the hypothesis space contained in the Rashomon set. The paper shows theoretically that under certain assumptions, a large Rashomon set can contain simpler yet accurate models that generalize well. Experimentally, the paper finds that when multiple machine learning algorithms achieve similar performance on a dataset, this correlates with a large Rashomon ratio. The results suggest that observing similar performance across algorithms on a dataset indicates it may be worthwhile to search for simpler models, as they are likely to exist in the large Rashomon set. Overall, the Rashomon ratio provides a new way to gauge the simplicity of a learning problem.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It aims to investigate why in many real-world machine learning applications, different standard algorithms often achieve similar performance, and there exist simpler/interpretable models that can achieve comparable accuracy to complex models. 

- It proposes the "Rashomon ratio" as a new complexity measure that quantifies the fraction of models in a hypothesis space that have approximately equal training accuracy. This ratio depends on both the data set and hypothesis space.

- It hypothesizes that a large Rashomon ratio, indicating many good models exist, can explain why different algorithms achieve similar performance and simpler models may exist. The size of the Rashomon set acts as an indicator of model simplicity.

- It provides theorems showing that under certain conditions like smooth loss and good approximation, a large Rashomon ratio implies existence of accurate yet simple models generalizing well.

- Experiments on UCI data sets suggest larger Rashomon ratios correlate with similar algorithm performance and good generalization, while smaller ratios sometimes correlate with performance differences.

- Noisy data where classes overlap tend to have larger Rashomon sets, offering insight into when simple models may exist.

In summary, the key question is why simple yet accurate models often exist in practice, and the proposed explanation is the "Rashomon effect" - where many good models exist, simpler ones are likely present too. The Rashomon ratio quantifies this effect.
