# [Boosting Multi-view Stereo with Late Cost Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11751)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Pairwise matching cost aggregation is crucial for modern learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods. 
- Prior works adopt an early aggregation scheme which sums pairwise costs into an intermediate cost volume. However, this can degrade informative pairwise matchings before they reach the depth network, limiting the network's ability to fully utilize the original geometric matching cues.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a late aggregation approach which allows aggregating pairwise costs throughout the network feed-forward process, achieving accurate depth estimation with only minor changes to a standard MVS network.

- Instead of weighted summation, late aggregation preserves all pairwise costs along distinct view channels. This enables the depth network to directly leverage crucial geometric cues without loss of cost fidelity.

Key Contributions:
- Analysis showing limitations of early aggregation in deteriorating informative matching costs during intermediate cost construction.

- Introduction of late aggregation scheme which propagates informative costs throughout the network forward pass for better utilization by the depth network.

- Additional techniques to address view order dependence, handle flexible test views, and improve depth filtering within the late aggregation framework.

- Experiments on DTU, Tanks and Temples, and ETH3D datasets demonstrating state-of-the-art performance using late aggregation with only minor network changes, fewer parameters and favorable efficiency.

In summary, the key insight is that preserving informative geometric matching cues for late aggregation allows better depth network utilization and accuracy. The simplicity yet strong performance underscores rethinking aggregation design for MVS methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a late cost aggregation approach for multi-view stereo that preserves and aggregates informative matching costs throughout the network forward pass to achieve better utilization of geometric cues and improved depth estimation accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a late aggregation approach for multi-view stereo (MVS). Specifically:

- The paper analyzes limitations of the widely adopted early aggregation scheme, showing that it can deteriorate informative matching costs during intermediate cost construction. This hinders the depth network from fully leveraging geometric matching cues.

- To address this, the paper proposes a late aggregation approach that propagates and aggregates informative costs throughout the network forward pass instead of constructing an intermediate cost. This allows the depth network to consistently benefit from the initial informative matching costs.

- Grounded in late aggregation, the paper further proposes techniques to address view order dependence, handle flexible test views, and improve point cloud filtering. 

- Despite its simplicity, the late aggregation method significantly improves upon cascade-based baselines and achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art methods on MVS benchmarks.

In summary, the main contribution is the analysis of limitations of early aggregation schemes in MVS and the proposal of a simple yet effective late aggregation approach to better utilize informative matching costs.
