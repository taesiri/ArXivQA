# [Explaining Image Classifiers with Multiscale Directional Image   Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12857)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How can we create mask-based explanations for image classifiers that avoid artifacts and can effectively separate fine-detail image patterns that are relevant to the classifier from nearby nuisance patterns that do not affect the classifier?The key points that support this are:- The paper introduces a new mask explanation method called ShearletX that is based on representing the image in the shearlet domain. - Current mask explanation methods use spatial smoothness constraints to avoid artifacts, but this limits their ability to separate fine details. - ShearletX uses shearlet sparsity constraints instead of spatial smoothness, allowing it to separate fine details without artifacts.- The paper provides theoretical analysis showing ShearletX avoids generating artificial edges or artifacts.- New metrics are introduced like the hallucination score and conciseness-preciseness score to evaluate the quality of mask explanations.- Experiments demonstrate ShearletX outperforms previous mask explanation methods on these new metrics and on separating fine details qualitatively.So in summary, the key hypothesis is that using shearlets and shearlet sparsity constraints will allow creating better mask explanations that avoid artifacts and can separate fine details, which is supported theoretically and experimentally.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper appears to be presenting ShearletX, a new mask explanation method for image classifiers based on the shearlet transform. The key points are:- ShearletX is the first mask explanation method that can effectively separate fine-detail image patterns that are relevant for the classifier from nearby nuisance patterns that do not affect the classifier. This is achieved by optimizing the mask in the shearlet domain rather than pixel space.- They analyze explanation artifacts theoretically and prove ShearletX is resilient to such artifacts.- They introduce two new metrics for evaluating mask explanations - the conciseness-preciseness score and hallucination score. - Experiments demonstrate ShearletX outperforms previous mask explanation methods like smooth pixel masks on these new metrics. - Examples are provided where ShearletX can explain phenomena not explainable by previous methods, by separating relevant fine details from nuisance patterns.In summary, the main contribution appears to be presenting a new mask explanation approach called ShearletX that leverages properties of the shearlet transform to separate fine image details and provides superior explanation quality, supported theoretically and empirically. The new explanation metrics are also a contribution for evaluating mask-based explanations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents ShearletX, a new mask explanation method for image classifiers that uses shearlet sparsity constraints to avoid smoothness regularization and separate fine image details relevant for classification from nearby nuisance patterns, outperforming previous mask explanation methods as shown theoretically and experimentally.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in explainable AI for image classification:- The paper presents a new mask-based explanation method called ShearletX that is based on representing the image in a shearlet basis. This is a novel approach compared to other mask-based methods like Fong & Vedaldi's smooth pixel mask that use regularization in pixel space. Using shearlets allows ShearletX to separate fine details better without artifacts.- The paper frames the problem as an optimization problem with objectives to retain the classifier's decision and obtain a sparse mask in shearlet space. This follows a similar formulation to other mask-based methods. However, ShearletX is unique in using shearlet sparsity rather than spatial smoothness constraints.- The paper proposes two new metrics - a conciseness-preciseness score and a hallucination score - for evaluating mask-based explanations. These provide new ways to quantitatively compare mask methods beyond previous metrics like deletion/insertion curves.- The theoretical analysis on why ShearletX avoids artifacts is novel. The results connecting wavefront sets to shearlet decay and Lipschitz regularity to wavelet decay help explain why ShearletX and WaveletX are resistant to artifacts.- Compared to other popular methods like gradient-based attribution, ShearletX provides a more interpretable mask highlighting salient parts rather than just a heatmap. But it is less efficient than gradient methods.- Overall, ShearletX demonstrates a new direction for mask explanations by using multiscale directional image representations. The theory and experiments highlight potential advantages over existing mask methods, especially for separating fine details. The new metrics also support better evaluation.In summary, the paper introduces a novel mask explanation approach and provides both theoretical and empirical evidence showing its benefits over previous methods. The shearlet-based explanation paradigm is a unique contribution to the field.
