# [Learning to Decode Collaboratively with Multiple Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03870)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Learning to Decode Collaboratively with Multiple Language Models":

Problem:
The paper explores how to enable multiple large language models (LLMs) to collaborate during text generation in order to produce higher quality text. Specifically, it aims to develop an unsupervised approach where a base LLM can learn when to generate text itself versus when to defer generation to assistant LLMs with different expertise. This allows the base model to take advantage of the knowledge and capabilities of larger, more specialized assistant models.

Method: 
The key idea is to model the choice of which LLM generates each token as a latent variable during decoding. The base LLM has a learned model selector that decides whether to generate the next token itself or defer to an assistant LLM based on the current context. By optimizing the marginal likelihood of text under this latent variable model, the base model learns good deferral decisions without direct supervision. At inference time, tokens are generated by interleaving the outputs of the base and assistant models coordinated by the learned model selector.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a latent variable framework to enable unsupervised learning of when and which assistant LLM to invoke during collaborative decoding.

- Introduces a method called Co-LLM that allows a base LLM to learn to collaborate with larger, more specialized LLMs in a flexible, task-specific way without prescription on how to combine the models.

- Empirically demonstrates that Co-LLM improves performance over individual models on instruction following, mathematical reasoning, question answering and classification tasks. Shows it learns sensible collaboration strategies like template-filling.

- Analysis indicates optimal collaboration improves all models and Co-LLM degrades gracefully as deferral amount changes, enabling inference-time control.

Overall the method enables emergent, versatile collaboration across domains and scales to improve LLM performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key ideas in this paper:

The paper proposes a method called \ourmethod for teaching multiple language models to collaborate by interleaving their token-level generations in patterns learned automatically from data, enabling improved performance compared to the individual models on tasks like instruction following, math reasoning, and question answering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Co-LLM to teach multiple large language models (LLMs) to collaborate by interleaving their generations at the token level. Specifically:

- They model the decision of which LLM generates each token as a latent variable, and optimize the marginal likelihood of a training set under this latent variable model. This allows the base LLM to automatically learn when to generate itself and when to call on assistant LLMs, without direct supervision.

- Token-level collaboration during decoding allows different LLMs' expertise to be fused in a way tailored to the task. It is especially useful in cross-domain settings where a generalist base LLM learns to invoke domain expert assistant models.

- Experiments show Co-LLM improves performance on instruction following, domain-specific QA, and reasoning tasks compared to individual models. The method learns qualitative collaboration strategies like template filling.

- The exposed latent variable enables adjustable collaboration levels at inference time and offers interpretability into the emergent coordination patterns.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel method for multiple LLMs to organically learn to collaborate during decoding by modeling token-level model selection as an unsupervised latent variable. This improves performance and enables interpretable, adjustable collaboration strategies to emerge.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Collaborative decoding - The paper proposes a method for multiple language models to interleave their token-level generations in order to collaborate. This allows the models to fuse their individual expertise.

- Latent variable model - The choice of which language model generates each token is modeled as a latent variable. This enables unsupervised learning of the best collaboration patterns for a given task. 

- Base model and assistant models - The framework centers around a finetunable "base" language model that decides when to generate itself or defer generation to one of the "assistant" models.

- Template filling - One qualitative result is that the base model learns to generate structural templates and defer to the assistant to fill in factual details or reasoning steps, as shown in several example generations.

- Performance gains - Experiments across domains like instruction following, math/reasoning, and QA show performance gains over individual models, with the collaboration allowing more effective use of expertise.

- Token-level control - Unlike prior work, the latent variable allows fine-grained, token-level control over model collaboration, rather than prescribed model combination strategies.

So in summary, key terms revolve around the token-level deferred generation, latent variable formulation, qualitative patterns, and performance gains through learned collaboration between language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the latent variable framework for token-level collaboration proposed in this paper differ from prior work on combining multiple language models, such as Mixture-of-Experts or Proxy Tuning? What are the advantages of the proposed approach?

2. The paper argues that allowing the base model to learn when to defer generation to assistant models in an unsupervised way enables more flexible and task-suitable collaboration patterns to emerge. What evidence supports this claim? Can you think of examples that illustrate emergent collaboration patterns?

3. How does the proposed marginal likelihood training objective differ from more straightforward approaches like maximizing the probability of pseudo-labels indicating when to defer? What benefits does the marginal likelihood bring?

4. The paper highlights computational efficiency as an advantage of the proposed method compared to alternatives like Contrastive Decoding or Proxy Tuning. Can you analyze and compare the computational costs of generating sequences using these different approaches?

5. One limitation raised is that not every deferral improves the quality of generations. How might the framework be extended to learn more fine-grained control over when deferral is helpful?

6. What types of inductive biases get encoded into the base model's learned deferral policy? How might these biases limit the generalizability of the approach to new domains or tasks? 

7. Could the proposed collaborative decoding approach also be beneficial for semi-supervised learning scenarios where limited labeled data is available? Why or why not?

8. The paper focuses on collaboration between two models. How might the approach scale to settings with more than two specialist assistant models? What new challenges might arise?

9. What societal impacts, positive or negative, might emerge from deploying systems utilizing collaborative decoding with multiple models in real-world applications?

10. One could view the learned collaborations as a simple form of emergent communication protocols between AI systems. What parallels can be drawn to how humans collaborate? How might we develop a deeper understanding of what makes for productive collaboration in groups of agents?
