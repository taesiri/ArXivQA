# [BECoTTA: Input-dependent Online Blending of Experts for Continual   Test-time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08712)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model to new, unseen data distributions at test time. However, existing CTTA methods struggle with the forgetting-adaptation trade-off and computational efficiency. They also only consider disjoint domain shifts even though real-world domains often gradually evolve over time.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes BECoTTA, an input-dependent yet efficient CTTA framework. The key components are:

1) Mixture-of-Domain Low-rank Experts (MoDE): Lightweight expert modules that capture domain-adaptive knowledge. Includes domain-adaptive routing to cluster experts by domain and domain-expert synergy loss to maximize expert-domain dependencies. Allows selective expert updates to avoid forgetting.

2) Domain Discriminator (DD): Auxiliary head that provides pseudo domain labels to guide expert routing and updates during CTTA.

3) Continual Gradual Shifts (CGS) benchmark: New evaluation benchmark with gradually shifting domains over time. More realistic than disjoint shifts.


Contributions:

1) BECoTTA achieves superior performance over strong CTTA baselines with 95-98% fewer parameters, enhancing forgetting-adaptation tradeoff.

2) Proposes MoDE architecture for input-dependent, efficient expert routing and updating during online CTTA. Achieves expertise specialization.  

3) Introduces CGS benchmark to simulate gradual real-world domain shifts over time.

In summary, this paper makes CTTA more practical by enhancing performance vs efficiency tradeoffs and better handling real-world domain shifts. The modular MoDE architecture is the key enabler.
