# [Fairness-Aware Job Scheduling for Multi-Job Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02740)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing federated learning (FL) research focuses on the monopoly scenario with one FL server and multiple clients. However, in practice, there can be multiple FL servers competing to recruit clients from a common pool simultaneously. This causes a lack of fairness as some servers may struggle to recruit enough clients while other servers recruit too many. There is a need for multi-job federated learning where multiple FL servers train models concurrently. However, how to schedule the jobs to ensure fairness in client recruitment is still an open challenge.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a fairness-aware federated job scheduling approach called FairFedJS. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce a virtual queue for each data type to reflect demand and availability of clients owning that data type. 

2) Leverage Lyapunov optimization to minimize the queue length variance across data types to ensure fairness in serving different federated learning jobs needing different data.

3) Design a job scheduling index to prioritize jobs in need of high-demand but low-availability data types.

4) Allow jobs to adapt their payments to clients as a means to adjust their scheduling priority based on current demand.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose the first fairness-aware scheduling approach for multi-job federated learning to address the emerging need.

2) Jointly optimize for scheduling fairness across jobs and maximizing long-term revenue.

3) Extensive experiments on two datasets show FairFedJS achieves 31.9% higher scheduling fairness and 1.0% faster convergence on average compared to baselines, with comparable test accuracy.

In summary, the paper identifies an important open problem in federated learning and proposes an effective and novel solution called FairFedJS to ensure fairness across competing jobs in terms of client recruitment. Experiments demonstrate promising performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a fairness-aware federated job scheduling approach called FairFedJS that ensures fair allocation of high-demand client datasets to federated learning jobs by jointly considering current demand, job payment bids, and data fairness to prevent prolonged waiting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a fairness-aware federated job scheduling approach called FairFedJS for multi-job federated learning. Specifically:

- It ensures fair allocation of high-demand client datasets to jobs that need them by jointly considering current demand and job payment bids. This prevents prolonged waiting for jobs requiring certain datasets. 

- It leverages Lyapunov optimization to convert the dual objectives of scheduling fairness and revenue maximization into a single objective function.

- Experiments show it achieves 31.9% higher scheduling fairness and 1.0% faster convergence on average compared to baselines, with comparable test accuracy.

In summary, FairFedJS is the first fairness-aware job scheduling approach designed specifically for multi-job federated learning settings. It makes optimal trade-offs between accuracy, convergence rate, and fairness.

The paper proposes a fairness-aware federated job scheduling approach called FairFedJS for multi-job federated learning. It uses Lyapunov optimization to ensure fair allocation of high-demand client datasets to jobs needing them by considering current demand and job payment bids. Key metrics evaluated include scheduling fairness, convergence time, and test accuracy. The Beta Reputation System is used to assess client reputation and data fairness is incorporated into client selection. A payment model and Job Scheduling Index are also introduced as part of the FairFedJS approach.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the FairFedJS method proposed in the paper:

1. How does FairFedJS formulate the Lyapunov drift Δ(Θ(t)) and what does it aim to achieve by minimizing the drift?

2. What is the expected utility function δ(t) in FairFedJS and how does it help to optimize the revenue of the federated learning system? 

3. Explain the design of the (drift - utility) objective function in FairFedJS and discuss the effect of the control parameter σ.

4. What is the Job Scheduling Index (JSI) Ψk(t) in FairFedJS and how does it help to streamline the job scheduling process?

5. How does FairFedJS select clients for each job in each round of federated training, considering both reputation values and data fairness?

6. Discuss the overall algorithm design of FairFedJS, explaining how the key components, including payment model, JSI calculation, job ordering and client selection, work together in each round.   

7. How does FairFedJS allow jobs to dynamically adjust their payments and what is the effect of such adjustments on the job's priority in scheduling order?

8. Analyze the differences in performance of FairFedJS under IID and Non-IID data distribution settings based on the experimental results.

9. What are the advantages and limitations of using Lyapunov optimization for job scheduling in the FairFedJS framework? Discuss any assumptions made.

10. Suggest ways in which the FairFedJS model can be extended, such as handling jobs that require multiple data types and incorporating more complex job environments.
