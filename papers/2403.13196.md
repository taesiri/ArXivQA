# [ADAPT to Robustify Prompt Tuning Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13196)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vision transformers (ViTs) are powerful but vulnerable to adversarial attacks - small perturbations to inputs that fool models. 
- Defending ViTs against attacks typically requires fine-tuning the entire model, which is computationally expensive.
- Prompt tuning allows adapting ViTs to new tasks by only tuning a small set of parameters (the prompts), keeping the backbone model frozen.
- However, applying existing adversarial defense methods to prompt tuning suffers from "gradient obfuscation", giving a false sense of security. Models still remain vulnerable to adaptive attacks.

Proposed Solution:
- Design an adaptive attack by conditioning on the prompts during each gradient step when crafting adversaries. 
- Propose ADAPT - a novel framework for adaptive adversarial training to make prompt tuning robust.
- Use a loss that promotes correct classification of samples perturbed with the adaptive attack.
- Additional design choices: Use prefix tuning (tunable prompts in each layer) rather than just input prompts, and tune the patch embedding layer along with prompts.

Main Contributions:
- Show that existing defense methods suffer from gradient obfuscation when applied to prompt tuning, and are vulnerable to adaptive attacks.
- Propose an adaptive attack tailored to the prompt tuning scenario.
- Introduce ADAPT for adversarial training of prompts, with a novel loss function emphasizing conditioning on prompts.
- Demonstrate superior robust accuracy of ADAPT over prior methods, achieving ~40% on CIFAR10 using only ~1% of model parameters.
- Analyze different prompt tuning scenarios and model sizes. Ablation studies validate design choices.
