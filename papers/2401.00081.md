## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hedging derivatives can be challenging and costly in practice due to trading costs/frictions and the need to continuously rebalance. The traditional approach of delta hedging is not optimal. 
- Finding the optimal hedging strategy requires solving a complex dynamic decision making problem across possible future states.

Proposed Solution:
- Use reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the optimal hedging policy. Specifically, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is developed to handle continuous state and action spaces.

- Two Q-functions are introduced to track both the expected cost and expected squared cost to optimize objectives involving both mean and variance of hedging outcomes.

- Compare accounting P&L and cashflow formulations. Find accounting P&L works much better, likely due to better credit assignment.

- Test on geometric Brownian motion and stochastic volatility models. RL consistently outperforms delta hedging, with increasing benefits as rebalancing frequency increases.

Main Contributions:
- Show how RL, specifically DDPG, can be adapted for the optimal hedging problem to handle continuous spaces and complex objectives.

- Introduce approach to handling objectives involving both mean and variance of hedging costs.

- Provide evidence that accounting P&L formulation enables more effective learning than cashflow formulation.

- Demonstrate methods and provide empirical results showing RL can learn superior hedging strategies than delta hedging for options under different stochastic asset models.

In summary, the paper presents a novel RL framework for learning optimal hedging policies that outperform standard benchmarks, with tests across different market models showcasing the generalizability.
