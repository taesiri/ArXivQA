# [Choose Your Weapon: Survival Strategies for Depressed AI Academics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06035)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question or hypothesis addressed in this paper is: What strategies and approaches can AI researchers in academia adopt to stay competitive and continue doing impactful research, given the challenges posed by large tech companies with much greater resources investing heavily in AI research?The authors discuss various strategies academic AI researchers could consider, such as collaborating with industry, focusing on niche applications, trying risky approaches, analyzing large models developed by tech companies, working with small data sets and models, and more. The overarching question seems to be how academic researchers can continue pushing the boundaries of AI research despite the resource limitations, by leveraging unique advantages like flexibility and risk-taking. The paper aims to start a discussion on how academia can adapt to the changing AI research landscape dominated by big tech companies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper seems to be a discussion of strategies for AI researchers in academia to remain competitive and conduct impactful research, despite having limited resources compared to large tech companies. Some of the main points made in the paper:- Gives an overview of the challenge faced by academic AI researchers with limited compute resources and small teams, as industry labs have massively scaled up.- Discusses possible strategies such as: focusing on smaller models, specialized domains, theoretical analysis, risky/unconventional approaches, collaborating with industry, and starting a company. - Argues academic researchers should leverage their ability to take risks and fail, do "unfundable" research, and analyze models others create. - Suggests ways industry and universities could help support academic AI research, through open sourcing models, direct collaboration, changing incentive structures, and enabling high-risk projects.- Ultimately argues academic AI researchers should collaborate and have an open discussion to improve their competitiveness and ability to drive innovation.So in summary, the main contribution seems to be an analysis of the current challenges facing academic AI research along with a range of proposed strategies and recommendations for improving the ecosystem. The goal is to start a discussion on how academics can stay relevant despite resource limitations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:The paper discusses strategies for AI researchers in academia to remain competitive and impactful in the face of large tech companies with vastly greater resources, such as scaling down problems, focusing on niche domains, theoretical analysis, and collaborating with industry.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper discusses strategies for AI academics to remain competitive in research despite limited resources compared to large companies. Here are some key points about how it relates to other work:- The issue of limited resources for academic AI research is a growing concern that has been discussed informally, but this paper directly addresses it in a systematic way.- It takes a pragmatic approach in suggesting strategies academics can pursue, rather than just analyzing or lamenting the problem. This is different from most existing discussions.- The suggested strategies draw on the authors' own experiences, providing concrete examples, rather than just theoretical possibilities.- It advocates for both changing research practices (e.g. scaling down, niche areas) and structural changes (e.g. university incentives). Most analyses focus on one or the other. - Collaboration with industry is presented as one strategy, in line with some other proposals. But the paper also suggests more radical options like "doing bad optics" research companies avoid.- There is a level of honesty and emotion unusual for academic papers, reflecting the frustration many feel. This makes it a more direct call to action.Overall, while the competitive imbalance in AI research is widely acknowledged, this paper stands out in directly addressing researchers with a range of strategic options backed by real examples. It balances pragmatism with a push for deeper structural changes. The passionate tone is also relatively unique and enhances its rallying cry to empower academics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper suggests several strategies for AI researchers in academia to remain competitive and do impactful work despite limited resources compared to large tech companies:- Work on specialized application domains or niches that are not an immediate focus for industry. Become an expert in a particular niche area.- Solve problems few care about now but may become important in the future. Look for overlooked or underserved application areas.  - Try approaches that seem unlikely to work based on current theory and evidence. Academic labs can take more risks.- Do research that companies may avoid due to bad optics or values misalignment. Academics have more freedom here.- Analyze and probe publicly available models instead of always trying to train new ones from scratch. Study how they work.- Focus on developing small but capable models suited for edge devices. This supports green AI and model interpretability.- Scale down to simple but representative problems that demonstrate benefits of new methods. Toy problems can provide proofs of concept.- Do high-risk, high-gain research the industry may not. Failures can be valuable in academia. - Collaborate with industry via internships, joint appointments, or even moving to industrial labs.- Start companies to gain access to more resources, though this has tradeoffs.The authors suggest universities incentivize high-risk research and industry open source more models and data. Overall the paper aims to start a discussion on how academia can best contribute to AI progress.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper "Choose Your Weapon: Survival Strategies for Depressed AI Academics" discusses strategies for AI researchers in academia to remain competitive in light of the massive resources being invested in AI research by large tech companies. The authors argue that the gap between industry and academia is growing, making it difficult for academic researchers with limited resources to produce breakthrough advances. They suggest strategies such as scaling down to simpler problems, analyzing existing models instead of training new ones, focusing on niche applications, trying unconventional approaches, and collaborating with industry. The overall message is that academic AI researchers need to carefully choose research directions and embrace unconventional and high-risk approaches to carve out a competitive niche versus industry.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper discusses strategies for AI researchers in academia to remain competitive and do impactful work in light of large tech companies having vast advantages in compute resources and funding. The authors, two tenured professors, aim to provide advice to more junior researchers on how to navigate an academic career in AI. They acknowledge the frustration many feel seeing big corporate labs accomplish things far out of reach for academic labs. The paper lists potential approaches like trying to scale work anyway, scaling down to simpler problems, analyzing publicly available models instead of training new ones, focusing on niche domains, taking risks on ideas that seem unlikely to work, and collaborating with industry. They suggest academics exploit the ability to take risks corporations avoid. They argue universities should incentivize high-risk research and fund non-traditional projects. The authors aim to start a discussion on how academic AI research can remain vibrant despite disadvantages in resources compared to corporate labs.
