## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper discusses strategies for AI academics to remain competitive in research despite limited resources compared to large companies. Here are some key points about how it relates to other work:

- The issue of limited resources for academic AI research is a growing concern that has been discussed informally, but this paper directly addresses it in a systematic way.

- It takes a pragmatic approach in suggesting strategies academics can pursue, rather than just analyzing or lamenting the problem. This is different from most existing discussions.

- The suggested strategies draw on the authors' own experiences, providing concrete examples, rather than just theoretical possibilities.

- It advocates for both changing research practices (e.g. scaling down, niche areas) and structural changes (e.g. university incentives). Most analyses focus on one or the other. 

- Collaboration with industry is presented as one strategy, in line with some other proposals. But the paper also suggests more radical options like "doing bad optics" research companies avoid.

- There is a level of honesty and emotion unusual for academic papers, reflecting the frustration many feel. This makes it a more direct call to action.

Overall, while the competitive imbalance in AI research is widely acknowledged, this paper stands out in directly addressing researchers with a range of strategic options backed by real examples. It balances pragmatism with a push for deeper structural changes. The passionate tone is also relatively unique and enhances its rallying cry to empower academics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several strategies for AI researchers in academia to remain competitive and do impactful work despite limited resources compared to large tech companies:

- Work on specialized application domains or niches that are not an immediate focus for industry. Become an expert in a particular niche area.

- Solve problems few care about now but may become important in the future. Look for overlooked or underserved application areas.  

- Try approaches that seem unlikely to work based on current theory and evidence. Academic labs can take more risks.

- Do research that companies may avoid due to bad optics or values misalignment. Academics have more freedom here.

- Analyze and probe publicly available models instead of always trying to train new ones from scratch. Study how they work.

- Focus on developing small but capable models suited for edge devices. This supports green AI and model interpretability.

- Scale down to simple but representative problems that demonstrate benefits of new methods. Toy problems can provide proofs of concept.

- Do high-risk, high-gain research the industry may not. Failures can be valuable in academia. 

- Collaborate with industry via internships, joint appointments, or even moving to industrial labs.

- Start companies to gain access to more resources, though this has tradeoffs.

The authors suggest universities incentivize high-risk research and industry open source more models and data. Overall the paper aims to start a discussion on how academia can best contribute to AI progress.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes combining reinforcement learning and artificial curiosity to allow agents to explore large state spaces more efficiently. However, adding artificial curiosity introduces additional hyperparameters that need tuning (e.g. intrinsic reward scale). How sensitive is the overall method to the settings of these curiosity hyperparameters? Is there a principled way to set them instead of relying on empirical tuning?

2. The intrinsic reward function based on prediction error is motivated as encouraging the agent to visit novel states. However, in practice, agents may end up repeating behaviors that generate high prediction errors without actually visiting new states. How does the design of the intrinsic reward function avoid this potential "trivial" solution?

3. The use of a separate transition model for generating intrinsic rewards decouples it from the model used for policy learning. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of tying the two models together instead? How would the training procedure need to change?

4. Scaling prediction-based artificial curiosity to high-dimensional state spaces like images remains challenging. What modifications to the overall approach could make it more suitable for intrinsic motivation in complex visual environments?

5. The paper uses asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) for the base RL algorithm. How does the choice of base RL algorithm interact with the addition of artificial curiosity? Would other on-policy (e.g. PPO) or off-policy (e.g. SAC) algorithms be more or less effective?

6. Adding intrinsic rewards changes the effective reward function being optimized. Does this affect the convergence properties of the base RL algorithm? Are there any modifications needed to ensure stable learning?

7. The environments used for evaluation in the paper are relatively simple 2D worlds. How will the sampling efficiency gains from artificial curiosity scale to much larger 3D environments like buildings or cities?

8. Real-world exploration often requires memory and revisiting previously seen states. How can artificial curiosity be integrated with more sophisticated exploration mechanisms that revisit based on episodic memory?

9. The prediction-based intrinsic reward requires training an additional neural network model for the environment. How does the complexity and capacity of this model affect performance? Should it match the policy model or be larger?

10. The paper focuses on undirected exploration driven by artificial curiosity. How could this approach be adapted to provide more directed exploration towards some external goal or task?
