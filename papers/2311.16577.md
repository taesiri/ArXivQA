# [Efficient Key-Based Adversarial Defense for ImageNet by Using   Pre-trained Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16577)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an efficient key-based adversarial defense for image classification by leveraging pre-trained models and recent fine-tuning techniques. The key idea is to associate each model with its own secret key to hinder transferability of adversarial examples across models, making it relevant for edge device deployment where each device has its own model. The method utilizes a vision transformer (ViT) pre-trained on ImageNet-21K, then efficiently fine-tunes multiple models with different keys using pixel shuffling for encryption and the LoRA technique to minimize added trainable parameters. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate high accuracy on both clean and adversarial images for their fully fine-tuned models, significantly outperforming prior key-based and adversarial training methods. However, LoRA fine-tuned models are not yet robust to adaptive attacks that approximate the key. By enabling efficient proliferation of personalized and defended models, the approach provides a promising direction for combating adversarial examples in real-world edge AI applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an efficient key-based adversarial defense for ImageNet classification by leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning techniques to proliferate defended models, achieving high accuracy on both clean and adversarial examples while associating one key to one model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing to leverage pre-trained models and use efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA to train many key-based defended models even at the scale of ImageNet. Specifically, the paper:

1) Stresses that the one-key-one-model approach is practical nowadays with models being deployed on edge devices, and key-based defenses have potential to combat adversarial examples. 

2) Proposes to leverage pre-trained models and efficient fine-tuning to proliferate key-based models, which is done for the first time.

3) Conducts experiments on ImageNet-1k dataset using adaptive and non-adaptive attacks to evaluate the proposed key-based fine-tuned models. The results show the models achieve higher clean and robust accuracy compared to previous key-based defenses.

In summary, the main contribution is using pre-trained models and efficient fine-tuning to enable practical training of many key-based defended models at ImageNet scale for the one-key-one-model paradigm.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an efficient key-based adversarial defense by leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning techniques. What are the advantages of using pre-trained models compared to training from scratch for this defense?

2. The threat model in Section III assumes a gray-box attacker. How could the security guarantees change if faced with a stronger white-box adversary instead? What additional defenses could be added?

3. LoRA is used for efficient fine-tuning of the ViT models. How do the low-rank decomposition matrices injected in each layer help reduce the number of trainable parameters? What are the tradeoffs?

4. For the block-wise pixel shuffling used as the key-based transformation, how does varying the block size P affect robustness against adaptive attacks? What is the reason behind this?

5. The results show LoRA fine-tuned models are not robust to adaptive attacks. What could be the reasons? How can LoRA fine-tuning be improved to make the models more robust?  

6. How does the information advantage provided by the secret key in key-based defenses compare to certified adversarial robustness provided by some defense methods? What are the relative advantages/disadvantages?

7. The results are evaluated only on l_inf and l_2 bounded adversaries. How could evaluation against unrestricted adversarial examples provide additional insight into the robustness of the defense?

8. For deployment at the edge, what additional defenses could be added on top of the proposed defense to protect against other attack vectors like backdoors?

9. The defenses are evaluated on ImageNet. How would the efficiency and robustness change if applied to other domains like speech or text? What adaptations would be required?

10. What additional analyses could provide more insight into the robustness of key-based defenses, like studying the diversity and correlation of gradients between models with different keys?
