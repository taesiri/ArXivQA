# [Re-Ex: Revising after Explanation Reduces the Factual Errors in LLM   Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17097)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT often generate factually inaccurate or hallucinated text, which reduces reliability and hinders real-world adoption. Detecting and revising these factual errors is crucial for building trust in LLMs. Existing methods have limitations - relying solely on LLMs' internal knowledge leads to persisting errors, while retrieval augmentation methods struggle to effectively process long, complex evidence.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Re-Ex, a 3-step method to revise factual errors in LLM responses by:
1) Gathering evidence of errors using external tools 
2) Getting the LLM to explain factual errors based on evidence  
3) Revising the response based on generated explanations 

The key innovation is the introduction of an explanation step, which enhances the LLM's understanding of evidence and guides better revisions. Re-Ex also uses more efficient prompting techniques to reduce time and tokens required.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes a "revising after explanation" approach with an intermediate explanation step to reduce hallucination errors
2) Achieves higher revision performance than methods like Factool, CoVE and RARR, with up to 10x faster processing and 6x fewer tokens 
3) Demonstrates the efficacy of splitting tasks into smaller segments to boost performance 
4) Provides better results on multiple benchmarks including FactPrompt and WiCE across GPT-3.5 and GPT-4

In summary, Re-Ex introduces an explanation-focused approach to efficiently detect and revise factual inconsistencies in LLM outputs, helping mitigate hallucination issues. The method displays significant improvements across key metrics compared to existing techniques.
