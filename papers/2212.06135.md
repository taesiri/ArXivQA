# [Rodin: A Generative Model for Sculpting 3D Digital Avatars Using   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06135)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The main research question of this paper is how to extend powerful diffusion generative models, which have shown phenomenal performance for 2D image synthesis, to generate 3D digital avatars with compelling details like hair and facial hair.

The key hypothesis is that using a neural radiance field representation along with an efficient roll-out diffusion network architecture that performs 3D-aware diffusion in 2D can enable high-fidelity and controllable generation of 3D avatars from random noise, an image, or text prompt.

To summarize, the central hypothesis is:

- Diffusion models can be extended to 3D avatar generation through an efficient roll-out architecture and 3D-aware processing. This allows generating detailed 3D avatars with hairstyles, facial hair, clothing, etc.

- The proposed roll-out diffusion network (Rodin) uses a radiance field representation and performs diffusion in a rolled-out 2D feature space. This brings computational efficiency while preserving 3D relationships.

- Additional techniques like hierarchical generation, latent conditioning, and classifier guidance can further boost quality and enable control over avatar generation using images or text.

So in essence, the paper aims to extend the success of diffusion models to 3D by proposing an efficient roll-out diffusion formulation for avatar generation with semantic control. The core hypothesis is that such an approach can achieve detailed 3D avatars beyond what existing techniques can generate.
