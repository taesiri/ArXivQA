 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a knowledge-based data-driven (KBDD) framework for all-day cloud type identification using spectral data from geostationary satellites Himawari-8/9. A novel convolutional neural network called CldNet is developed that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 80.89% in identifying 10 cloud types, outperforming other common semantic segmentation networks. The framework allows prediction of cloud types at night by masking visible/near-infrared bands. Notably, the trained CldNet generalizes well to higher resolution satellite data without fine-tuning, directly producing accurate cloud type distributions at 0.02Â° resolution. By deploying CldNet-W (using all bands) for daytime and CldNet-O (masking some bands) for nighttime over the full disk area, the framework enables construction of a high-fidelity, spatiotemporal cloud type database valuable for climate studies. With only 0.46M parameters, CldNet is efficient for potential edge deployment. The accurate all-day, full disk cloud typing capability makes this an impactful contribution.
