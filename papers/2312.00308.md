# [A knowledge-based data-driven (KBDD) framework for all-day   identification of cloud types using satellite remote sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00308)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a knowledge-based data-driven (KBDD) framework for all-day cloud type identification using spectral data from geostationary satellites Himawari-8/9. A novel convolutional neural network called CldNet is developed that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 80.89% in identifying 10 cloud types, outperforming other common semantic segmentation networks. The framework allows prediction of cloud types at night by masking visible/near-infrared bands. Notably, the trained CldNet generalizes well to higher resolution satellite data without fine-tuning, directly producing accurate cloud type distributions at 0.02° resolution. By deploying CldNet-W (using all bands) for daytime and CldNet-O (masking some bands) for nighttime over the full disk area, the framework enables construction of a high-fidelity, spatiotemporal cloud type database valuable for climate studies. With only 0.46M parameters, CldNet is efficient for potential edge deployment. The accurate all-day, full disk cloud typing capability makes this an impactful contribution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a knowledge-based data-driven framework using a novel convolutional neural network architecture called CldNet to achieve all-day cloud type identification with strong generalization ability from geostationary satellite data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a knowledge-based data-driven (KBDD) framework for all-day identification of cloud types using spectral information from geostationary satellites like Himawari-8/9. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Designing a KBDD framework comprising modules like knowledge module, mask module, addition of auxiliary information, network candidate set, and mask loss to enable all-day cloud type identification. 

2) Proposing a novel convolutional neural network named CldNet for cloud type classification. CldNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 80.89% on the test set, outperforming other semantic segmentation networks.

3) Demonstrating the capability of the framework to extrapolate cloud types in nighttime areas by using CldNet-O which does not use visible and near-infrared channels. This allows constructing an all-day cloud type database.

4) Showing the strong generalization ability of CldNet by directly applying it on higher resolution satellite data without any fine-tuning. CldNet could predict cloud types at 0.02° resolution with over 75% accuracy.

5) Establishing an effective cloud type identification system based on the KBDD framework and CldNet, capable of providing high-fidelity, spatiotemporal cloud type data for climate studies. The compact size of CldNet also enables edge deployment.

In summary, the main highlight is designing an end-to-end knowledge-driven deep learning system for all-day cloud typing leveraging geostationary satellite data.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Cloud types are important for climate assessments but difficult to characterize, especially at night. Existing methods rely on manual thresholds or have limited performance. There is a need for automated, performant methods to identify cloud types all-day using satellite data.

Method:
- The authors propose a knowledge-based data-driven (KBDD) framework to identify cloud types from Himawari spectral data. The framework includes:
  - A knowledge module to organize spectral data based on domain knowledge.
  - A masking module to handle day/night differences.
  - Auxiliary information (satellite/solar angles) to aid prediction.
  - A novel CNN called CldNet to predict cloud types. CldNet has specialized ASPP and UNet-like modules to capture spatial patterns.

- The framework is trained on labeled daytime data from 2020-2021 and tested on 2022 data. Two versions of CldNet are used - CldNet-W uses all bands, while CldNet-O masks visible/near-infrared bands for nighttime prediction.

Results:
- CldNet substantially outperforms other semantic segmentation networks like SegNet, PSPNet, DeepLabV3+ and UNet, improving accuracy by 22-46%. It uses far fewer parameters than UNet.

- Adding auxiliary data further improves performance to 82.23% for CldNet-W. CldNet-O achieves 73.21% accuracy at night by masking some bands.

- Without retraining, CldNet generalizes well to higher resolution satellite data, enabling higher resolution cloud typing. 

Significance:
- The proposed KBDD framework and CldNet network significantly advance the state-of-the-art in automated, all-day cloud typing from satellites.

- It enables creation of a high-fidelity spatiotemporal cloud database to support climate studies. CldNet is simple and efficient for potential edge deployment.

In summary, the paper presents a novel data-driven solution to a difficult climate assessment problem - all-day cloud typing from satellites. The results substantially improve performance over other methods.
