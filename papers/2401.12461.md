# [Fast Adversarial Training against Textual Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12461)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most existing defense methods against textual adversarial attacks rely on additional linguistic knowledge about synonyms. This is an unrealistic assumption as attackers can use various methods to obtain synonyms.  
- Typical adversarial training (AT) methods using multi-step attacks like PGD are inefficient for large NLP models like BERT.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Fast Adversarial Training (FAT) that works directly in the embedding space without requiring any synonym knowledge.

- Use single-step gradient ascent instead of multi-step methods to craft adversarial examples. Show that single-step perturbation is very similar to multi-step, so no need for inefficient multi-step. Allows more training epochs within time budget.

- Initialize perturbation using direction of perturbation from previous epoch on same sample. Show perturbations across epochs are similar, so this utilizes historical info.

- Further accelerate training via FAT-I which only updates perturbation periodically instead of every epoch.

Main Contributions:

- Propose FAT that achieves state-of-the-art robustness across datasets under black-box and white-box attacks, without requiring extra linguistic knowledge.

- Demonstrate that continuous embedding space AT itself can be an effective defense in realistic synonym-unaware settings.

- Detailed analysis of perturbation generation that motivates single-step FAT and historical initialization for efficiency and better robustness.  

- Extensive experiments with variants like FAT-I allow flexibility in trading off training time and robustness.

In summary, FAT provides an efficient and effective adversarial defense method using continuous AT in the embedding space without relying on extra synonym knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a fast adversarial training method called FAT that improves model robustness against textual adversarial attacks by using single-step gradient ascent to craft perturbations and initializing perturbations with historical information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a Fast Adversarial Training (FAT) method to improve the robustness of NLP models against textual adversarial attacks, without needing additional synonym information or human-prescribed linguistic knowledge. Specifically:

1) FAT adopts single-step gradient ascent to generate adversarial perturbations, which is more efficient than multi-step methods like PGD. This allows more training epochs within a given time budget. 

2) FAT initializes perturbations using historical information from the previous epoch, which helps find a better starting point and craft more effective adversarial examples for training.

3) Experiments show FAT outperforms defense baselines by a clear margin under various attacks involving different perturbation granularity and model visibility. It provides an easy-to-apply and effective defense solution for the realistic synonym-unaware scenario.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient continuous adversarial training method called FAT that achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness for NLP models without needing additional linguistic resources or knowledge.
