# [Modeling Unknown Stochastic Dynamical System via Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10001)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on developing a data-driven method to model unknown stochastic dynamical systems from trajectory data. Learning predictive models for such systems is challenging due to the unobservability of noises and inherent stochasticity in the systems. Existing methods have limitations in accuracy and robustness needed for effective long-term predictions. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel stochastic flow map learning (sFML) approach based on autoencoder architecture to model the underlying flow map. The key ideas are:

1) Design an encoder to identify the latent Gaussian random variables that drive the stochasticity, and a decoder to reconstruct the future states. Both encoder and decoder are parameterized as deep neural networks (DNNs).

2) Enforce unit Gaussian distribution on the latent variables through a distributional loss in encoder training. A sub-sampling strategy is introduced to promote independence between the latent variables and current states.

3) Train the overall autoencoder sFML model with a combined loss - a reconstruction loss for the decoder and the distributional loss for the encoder. 

Once trained, the decoder serves as a predictive model for long-term forecasts of the unknown stochastic system.

Main Contributions:

- A new autoencoder based sFML framework for data-driven stochastic system modeling with more robust DNN training and accuracy control.

- The method can automatically learn the true stochastic dimension of the unknown system. 

- Comprehensive numerical tests on various representative stochastic systems demonstrate high accuracy in long term predictions, applicability to non-Gaussian noises, and capability to handle high-dimensional problems.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in developing an effective and practical data-driven approach for predictive modeling of complex unknown stochastic dynamical systems.
