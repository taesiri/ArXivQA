# [Modeling Unknown Stochastic Dynamical System via Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10001)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on developing a data-driven method to model unknown stochastic dynamical systems from trajectory data. Learning predictive models for such systems is challenging due to the unobservability of noises and inherent stochasticity in the systems. Existing methods have limitations in accuracy and robustness needed for effective long-term predictions. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel stochastic flow map learning (sFML) approach based on autoencoder architecture to model the underlying flow map. The key ideas are:

1) Design an encoder to identify the latent Gaussian random variables that drive the stochasticity, and a decoder to reconstruct the future states. Both encoder and decoder are parameterized as deep neural networks (DNNs).

2) Enforce unit Gaussian distribution on the latent variables through a distributional loss in encoder training. A sub-sampling strategy is introduced to promote independence between the latent variables and current states.

3) Train the overall autoencoder sFML model with a combined loss - a reconstruction loss for the decoder and the distributional loss for the encoder. 

Once trained, the decoder serves as a predictive model for long-term forecasts of the unknown stochastic system.

Main Contributions:

- A new autoencoder based sFML framework for data-driven stochastic system modeling with more robust DNN training and accuracy control.

- The method can automatically learn the true stochastic dimension of the unknown system. 

- Comprehensive numerical tests on various representative stochastic systems demonstrate high accuracy in long term predictions, applicability to non-Gaussian noises, and capability to handle high-dimensional problems.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in developing an effective and practical data-driven approach for predictive modeling of complex unknown stochastic dynamical systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a data-driven method to learn unknown stochastic dynamical systems by using an autoencoder neural network architecture to identify latent Gaussian variables and reconstruct state trajectories.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new construction of the stochastic flow map learning (sFML) predictive model for data-driven modeling of unknown stochastic dynamical systems. Specifically, the paper employs the concept of autoencoder to develop the sFML model. The key aspects of the contribution are:

- It designs an encoding function to extract the hidden latent random variables from the noisy trajectory data of the unknown SDE, and a decoding function to reconstruct the future state data. 

- Both the encoder and decoder are expressed as deep neural networks (DNNs). The training enforces the latent variables to follow standard Gaussian distribution and be independent of the current state data.

- An important sub-sampling strategy of the training data is developed to promote independence between the latent variables and current states. 

- The decoder serves as the predictive model for long-term system predictions, once trained using short bursts of measurement data.

- It can effectively discover the true dimensions of unobserved stochastic components of unknown systems.

- Extensive numerical examples demonstrate the method is effective for modeling both Gaussian and non-Gaussian systems, and systems with multi-dimensional stochastic components.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an autoencoder based sFML approach for data-driven modeling of unknown stochastic dynamical systems, which is shown to be accurate and robust.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper assumes the unknown stochastic process is time-homogenous. What modifications would need to be made to the method if this assumption does not hold? How would it impact the training data preparation and the loss functions?

2) The method encodes the latent variables as independent standard normal random variables. Could other distributions be used instead? What impact would that have on the distributional loss function and the decoding process? 

3) The paper advocates the use of a resampling strategy on the training batches. What would happen if no resampling was done? Would the encoder still be able to extract independent latent variables?

4) How does the choice of the kernel function and bandwidth parameter impact the performance of the Renyi-entropy based statistical distance loss? Is there an optimal selection guideline? 

5) The decoder uses a simple MSE loss between the reconstructed and true trajectories. Could more advanced loss functions like maximum mean discrepancies be beneficial? What about adversarial losses?

6) For multidimensional systems, the paper shows the training loss can indicate the true stochastic dimension. Is there a theoretically justified threshold value? Could false selections still occur?

7) What is the impact of model architecture choices (depth, width, activations) on identifying the correct latent space dimension and long term prediction accuracy?

8) The method assumes the availability of multiple short trajectory bursts. How would performance degrade if only a single long trajectory is available? Are there data augmentation strategies to help?

9) Can ideas from domain adaptation be used to transfer a model trained on some trajectories to make predictions on a new system with different parameters?

10) For non-Gaussian noise, the method still encodes to a Gaussian latent variable. Could better performance be achieved by encoding to a matched non-Gaussian distribution instead? What difficulties would that introduce?
