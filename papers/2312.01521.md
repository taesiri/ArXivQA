# [Neural Markov Prolog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01521)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Neural Markov Prolog":

Problem:
- Neural networks have made great progress recently by incorporating inductive biases about data domains into specialized model structures. However, these neural networks are treated as separate architectures with no explicit connections between them, obscuring theoretical similarities and making modifications cumbersome.
- Existing methods from statistical relational learning can generate large, unwieldy probabilistic graphical models lacking the efficiency of neural networks. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Neural Markov Prolog (NMP), a language that combines first order logic and probability to represent neural networks. 
- NMP is based on Markov logic networks and Prolog. It allows concise representation of neural networks with precise probabilistic semantics.
- The paper shows a restricted form of Markov logic with only binary clauses can represent all sigmoid neural networks. This is extended elegantly to NMP to represent all neural networks in a form extremely close to Prolog.

Main Contributions:
- Provides formal proof that deep sigmoid neural networks can be viewed as binary pairwise Markov networks.
- Introduces the language Neural Markov Prolog that combines logical representation power of Prolog and Markov logic with efficiency of neural networks.
- Demonstrates NMP's flexibility to concisely define popular neural architectures like RNNs, CNNs and GNNs, highlighting their similarities.
- Discusses how NMP's interpretability can help systematically develop innovative deep learning models and convey them meaningfully.
- Suggests NMP could enable techniques like inductive logic programming for automatic architecture discovery and expansion.

In summary, the paper proposes the new neuro-symbolic language Neural Markov Prolog that enjoys simplicity of Prolog, semantics of Markov logic and efficiency of neural networks. It demonstrates NMP's utility for interpretable development and presentation of neural network architectures.
