# [Online Time-Optimal Trajectory Generation for Two Quadrotors with   Multi-Waypoints Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18021)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Research on autonomous drone racing has focused mainly on single drone aggressive flights, lacking study of multi-drone systems with high-speed maneuverability. 
- Existing methods for multi-drone trajectory generation require offline computation taking hours and can't handle dynamic waypoints that change positions in real-time.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel online method called Pairwise Model Predictive Control (PMPC) to generate minimum-time trajectories for two quadrotors to fly through waypoints without collision.

- A two-step velocity search method efficiently finds time-optimal trajectories for a point mass model. These trajectories serve as initial values and velocity references for the optimization.

- An optimization problem is formed with objectives for minimum time waypoint passing and collision avoidance between drones. Dynamic weights are used to balance the objectives.

- The efficient overall method runs at 50Hz online for real-time trajectory generation handling dynamic waypoints.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes an online method for minimum-time trajectory generation of two quadrotors through waypoints without collision, with ability to handle dynamic waypoints.

- Designs a two-step velocity search approach to generate time-optimal point mass trajectories as optimization references.

- Develops an optimization formulation with dynamic weights for efficient online solving at 50Hz for real-time model predictive control.

- Provides simulation validation and real-world experiments showing two drones achieving 8.1m/s speeds in a compact 6x4x2 m space.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling online, minimum-time trajectory generation for two drones without collision through dynamic waypoints, with efficiency for real-time model predictive control.
