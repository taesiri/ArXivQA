# [Knowledge Infused Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03084)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we enhance language model decoding to be more knowledge-aware and generate more accurate, relevant, and factual text for knowledge-intensive natural language generation tasks?The key hypothesis appears to be:By dynamically retrieving relevant knowledge during each decoding step and using it to guide the model's output distribution, language models can generate more knowledgeable, coherent, and factual text without needing extensive retraining or model architecture changes.Specifically, the paper proposes a method called Knowledge Infused Decoding (KID) that does the following during decoding:- Maintains a local memory of concepts mentioned in the current context- Interacts this with a knowledge trie created from retrieved supporting documents - Continuously updates the local memory to guide the model's output distribution via reinforcement learningThe hypothesis is that by reshaping the model's output distribution towards relevant entities in the knowledge trie at each step, KID can enhance language models' ability to produce knowledgeable and factual text for knowledge-intensive NLG tasks. The experiments aim to demonstrate this across several datasets and models.In summary, the central research question is how to make LM decoding more dynamic and knowledge-aware, and the core hypothesis is that KID's approach of interacting a local memory with retrieved knowledge can achieve this without extensive retraining or model changes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a novel decoding algorithm called Knowledge Infused Decoding (KID) for generative language models. KID dynamically infuses external knowledge into each step of the language model decoding by maintaining a local knowledge memory and interacting it with an external knowledge trie. Specifically, some key aspects of the contribution are:- KID is designed to be model and task agnostic, so it can be applied to different generative language models and knowledge-intensive natural language generation tasks. - Experiments on six diverse NLG tasks show that task-agnostic LMs like GPT-2 and BART perform much better with KID compared to standard beam search or sampling decoding.- KID also outperforms several other knowledge-infusion techniques that require extra model training or architecture modifications. It shows particularly strong performance in few-shot learning scenarios.- Human evaluations confirm KID generates more relevant, factual, and fluent language compared to baselines.- Analysis shows KID can help alleviate exposure bias and provide stable generation quality for longer sequences.So in summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the KID algorithm as an effective and generalizable approach to infuse knowledge into language model decoding to improve performance on knowledge-intensive NLG tasks. The model-agnostic nature, gains over other knowledge techniques, and human evaluation results are key aspects of the contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Unfortunately, I do not have enough context to summarize this full paper in one sentence, as it seems to introduce a new decoding algorithm called Knowledge Infused Decoding (KID) for generating more knowledge-grounded and factual text. Based on a brief skim, a very high-level summary could be: "The authors propose a novel decoding algorithm called Knowledge Infused Decoding that dynamically incorporates external knowledge from Wikipedia into language model decoding to generate more factual and relevant text." However, without reading the full paper in depth, it is difficult to provide an accurate 1-sentence summary that captures the key contributions. Please let me know if you would like me to summarize any specific sections or details from the paper.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:The main contribution of this paper is the proposed KID decoding algorithm, which dynamically infuses knowledge during the decoding process to guide each step of generation. This is a novel approach compared to most prior work on incorporating knowledge into language models, which has focused more on modifying the model architecture or training objectives. The KID approach has some similarities to recent retrieval-augmented models like RAG, which also leverage retrieved knowledge documents. However, a key difference is that RAG retrieves documents only once upfront based on the initial context, while KID interacts with retrieved knowledge dynamically at each step. The results indicate KID is more effective for longer, abstractive generation where the context evolves.Compared to other knowledge infusion techniques, KID requires no model retraining or architectural changes. It can simply be applied on top of any pre-trained LM. This makes it much more practical and flexible. The strong performance of KID even without fine-tuning demonstrates its versatility.The paper shows systematic comparisons between KID and competitive knowledge infusion baselines across multiple datasets. The human evaluation results are important to validate that KID generations are actually more grounded in the knowledge sources. The ablation studies provide useful insights on model size, choice of retriever, etc.Overall, KID seems to advance state-of-the-art by presenting a lightweight yet powerful approach to dynamic knowledge infusion. The decoding focus differentiates it from most prior techniques. The comprehensive experiments and analyses are a key strength. If the technical details can be successfully replicated, KID could become an impactful contribution adopted by many researchers and practitioners.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Applying Knowledge Infused Decoding (KID) to other generative tasks beyond the ones explored in the paper, such as open-ended story generation and conversation summarization. The authors believe KID has potential for improving performance on other knowledge-intensive NLG tasks.- Combining KID with prompt-based generations to further boost performance in few-shot scenarios. The authors found KID showed strong generalization ability with limited training data. Using prompts could help it adapt even quicker to new domains. - Integrating KID with larger foundation models like GPT-3 175B to understand its potential at scale. The authors found vanilla GPT-3 benefited more from KID compared to fine-tuned models, so exploring very large LMs is an important direction.- Studying more efficient data structures to accelerate the knowledge fetching and integration in KID. The knowledge trie structure helped reduce memory footprint, but further optimizations could improve speed.- Exploring ways to mitigate biases that may be present in the underlying LM or knowledge sources used by KID. The authors acknowledge biases could affect KID's generations.- Validating KID's effectiveness across more diverse languages beyond just English. Generalizing KID's approach across languages requires some modifications.- Diagnosing and providing interpretations for cases where KID may generate incorrect or unreliable text, since it currently lacks mechanisms to explain failures.In summary, the main future directions are applying KID more broadly across tasks/models/languages, improving its speed/efficiency, mitigating biases, and enhancing interpretability. The authors seem excited about KID's potential with further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel decoding algorithm called Knowledge Infused Decoding (KID) for generative language models. KID dynamically retrieves and integrates external knowledge during each step of the language model decoding process. Specifically, it maintains a local knowledge memory based on the current context, interacts this with a dynamically created knowledge trie extracted from retrieved supporting documents, and continuously updates the local memory as a knowledge-aware constraint to guide the decoding via reinforcement learning. Experiments on six diverse knowledge-intensive NLG tasks show that task-agnostic language models like GPT-2 and BART equipped with KID outperform many task-optimized state-of-the-art models. KID is particularly effective in few-shot scenarios, outperforming seven other knowledge-infusion techniques. Human evaluation confirms KID's ability to generate more relevant, factual language compared to baselines. A key advantage of KID is that it provides knowledge-infused decoding in a model and task agnostic way without needing costly retraining or architecture changes to generative LMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel decoding algorithm called Knowledge Infused Decoding (KID) to improve language model performance on knowledge-intensive natural language generation tasks. KID dynamically integrates external knowledge into each step of the language model decoding process. Specifically, it maintains a local knowledge memory based on the current context and interacts this memory with a dynamically created knowledge trie built from retrieved supporting documents. The local memory is continuously updated to guide the decoding via reinforcement learning. KID was evaluated on several natural language generation tasks requiring knowledge such as question answering, logic-centric writing, and dialogue generation. On these tasks, KID outperformed conventional decoding methods like beam search and sampling, as well as several other knowledge integration techniques. The benefits were particularly strong in few-shot scenarios with limited training data. Human evaluation confirmed KID's ability to produce more relevant, factual generations compared to baselines. A key advantage of KID is that it can be applied as a standalone module on top of any pre-trained language model without modifications. The paper demonstrates the potential for inference-time improvements to language model performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The main method proposed in this paper is Knowledge Infused Decoding (KID). KID is a novel decoding algorithm for generative language models that dynamically infuses external knowledge into each step of the language model decoding. Specifically, given an input context, KID first retrieves several relevant documents from Wikipedia to ground the generation. It then constructs a local knowledge memory based on the current context, and interacts this memory with a dynamically created knowledge trie built from the retrieved documents. At each decoding step, KID queries the knowledge trie to fetch relevant entities and uses them to guide the language model's next token prediction via policy gradient reinforcement learning. The goal is to reshape the language model's token probabilities at each step towards entities that are grounded in the retrieved knowledge. By continuously updating the local memory and sampling new knowledge demonstrations from the trie, KID is able to dynamically integrate external knowledge into language model decoding. This allows task-agnostic language models like GPT-2 and BART to generate more factual and relevant text for knowledge-intensive NLG tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

This paper is presenting a new decoding algorithm called Knowledge Infused Decoding (KID) for generative language models. The key problem it is trying to address is how to better infuse external knowledge into language models during text generation, in order to produce more factual and relevant outputs. Some of the key questions and issues the paper explores are:- How can we dynamically integrate external knowledge into each step of the language model's decoding process, rather than just using static knowledge retrieved initially?- Can guiding the language model's predictions at each step based on relevant knowledge improve the factual correctness and relevance of generated text?- Does this knowledge infusion approach work well across diverse language generation tasks compared to other methods?- Can it help mitigate issues like exposure bias that cause quality degradation for longer sequences?- Does a knowledge trie structure allow efficient fetching and integration of relevant knowledge compared to other knowledge storage formats?- How does the approach compare to other knowledge infusion techniques in terms of performance, especially in low-resource scenarios?So in summary, the key focus is researching methods to inject up-to-date, dynamic knowledge into language model decoding to improve the factual accuracy and relevance of text generation across different tasks. The paper proposes KID as a new decoding algorithm to achieve this.
