# [Exploring Adversarial Robustness of LiDAR-Camera Fusion Model in   Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01468)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous driving systems rely on camera and LiDAR sensors for environment perception and object detection. However, prior work has shown deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.  

- This paper focuses on exploring the adversarial robustness of LiDAR-camera fusion models for 3D object detection when subjected to adversarial point clouds that satisfy physical constraints of LiDAR sensors.

Methodology:
- The authors generate adversarial point clouds to be injected into the LiDAR sensor of a target vehicle, with the goal of hiding cars to cause potential rear-end collisions.  

- The attack is constrained to add points only above the cars to avoid occlusions. The adversarial points adhere to LiDAR physical constraints on number of points per ray, vertical angles, and horizontal angle range.

- The attack objective is formulated to suppress bounding box proposals for the target car from the LiDAR-camera fusion model MVX-Net. Gradient-based optimization is used to generate the adversarial point clouds.

Results:
- Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that adding about 200 physically-constrained adversarial points can hide a target car with 99% success rate, without any image tampering.

- The attack success rate increases with more adversarial points and greater distance between the victim and target vehicles. Target cars directly in front of the victim vehicle are more easily hidden.

Contributions:  
- First study to demonstrate LiDAR-camera fusion model's vulnerability to adversarial LiDAR point clouds satisfying physical constraints, even without tampering the image data.

- Analysis provided on the impact of number, distance and angle of adversarial points on attack success rate.

- Research contributes to understanding multi-sensor robustness and improving safety of autonomous driving systems.
