# [Hierarchical Motion Planning and Offline Robust Model Predictive Control   for Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04769)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Driving autonomous vehicles (AVs) under harsh conditions like adverse roads and uncertain vehicle parameters is a major challenge. The goal is to develop motion planning and control methods for AVs to navigate complex scenarios safely. 

Proposed Solution
- A hierarchical framework with motion planning (upper layer) and robust control (lower layer) is proposed. 

- In the upper layer, an optimal trajectory is generated using the artificial potential field (APF) method to avoid collisions by formulating surroundings as potentials. This handles complex scenarios with roads, lanes, static/dynamic obstacles modeled as potentials.

- In the lower layer, an offline constrained robust model predictive control (RMPC) method is used to track the optimal trajectory from the upper layer. It handles uncertain vehicle parameters using a linear parameter varying (LPV) system model. Constraints on inputs and states are included to ensure stability and performance.  

- The vehicle model is augmented with the steering rate for better handling of input vibrations. This is the key novelty compared to other RMPC methods.

Main Contributions
- A hierarchical planning and control framework for AVs to handle complex uncertain scenarios:
    - APF-based optimal trajectory generation (upper layer)
    - Offline constrained RMPC with augmented vehicle model (lower layer)

- Improved efficiency over other RMPC variants in: 
   - Computational time  
   - Reduced input vibrations
   - Balanced tracking performance and stability

- Demonstrated performance in simulation case studies with normal, aggressive and unexpected driving scenarios
