# [3D molecule generation by denoising voxel grids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07473)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we generate novel, synthetically valid 3D molecular structures in a simple and efficient way using deep generative models?

The key elements of this research question are:

- Generating 3D molecular structures - The goal is to produce complete 3D representations of molecules, including atomic coordinates and bonds. 

- Novel molecules - The aim is to generate new molecules not just recreate known structures. This allows exploring a wider chemical space.

- Synthetic validity - The generated molecules need to represent realistic and synthetically feasible chemical structures.

- Simple and efficient - The proposed method should be conceptually simpler and faster compared to existing approaches like 3D point cloud diffusion models.

- Using deep generative models - Leveraging the power of deep neural networks for unconditional 3D molecular generation.

To address this, the paper proposes a new score-based generative modeling approach called VoxMol that operates on voxelized molecular densities. The key hypothesis seems to be that representing molecules as voxels and generating them by denoising makes the model simpler, faster, and able to generate valid 3D structures competitively.

In summary, the core research question is about developing a new deep generative technique for unconditional 3D molecular generation that is simpler and more efficient than current state-of-the-art like 3D point cloud diffusion models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new method for 3D molecule generation called VoxMol. The main contributions are:

- It represents molecules as voxel grids instead of point clouds. Each voxel encodes the atomic density at that point in space. 

- It trains a neural network to denoise noisy voxel grids to a clean signal. This network parametrizes the score function that enables generation.

- It generates molecules via a two-step process: (1) sampling noisy voxels via Langevin MCMC, and (2) denoising to the original signal. 

- It achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods on unconditional 3D molecule generation, while being conceptually simpler and faster.

In summary, the main contribution is a new score-based approach for generating 3D molecular structures by modeling them as voxel grids and training a denoising neural network. This differs from current methods that typically use point clouds and diffusion models. The voxel representation and sampling procedure are simpler while still achieving strong results.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new score-based approach to generate 3D molecular structures represented as densities on voxel grids, using a denoising neural network trained with a fixed noise level and leveraging the network to sample molecules via Langevin MCMC and denoising.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on 3D molecule generation:

- It proposes a new score-based approach for generating 3D molecular structures, unlike recent work that uses diffusion models on point clouds. The key differences are the representation (voxel grids vs point clouds), noise model, network architecture, and generative modeling algorithm.

- Instead of operating directly on atom coordinates and types like point cloud methods, it represents molecules as voxel grids and models the density of atoms. This allows implicit modeling of atom types and conformations through the density grids.

- It achieves competitive quantitative results on standard benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art point cloud diffusion models like EDM. The voxel-based method seems simpler to train and faster to generate molecules.

- The voxel representation and convolutional architecture allow implicit modeling of long-range dependencies between atoms versus just single and pairwise interactions in graph networks on point clouds.

- Unlike point cloud generative models, this method does not need to know the number of atoms a priori for training or generation. The grid captures the full density.

- While point cloud methods leverage equivariant networks, this paper uses standard convolutional networks, so there is likely room for improvement by using equivariant 3D convnets.

- The noise model corrupts the entire voxel grid as opposed to displacing individual atoms like in diffusion models. The effect on the underlying graph structure is different.

Overall, this paper introduces a novel generative modeling approach for 3D molecular structures using ideas from computer vision and shows competitive performance to recent point cloud methods, while having several advantages in terms of simplicity, speed, and representation. The comparison illuminates the tradeoffs between voxel and point cloud representations for molecule generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing equivariant 3D convolutional networks for the denoising task. The paper notes that equivariant networks have been very effective for molecular discriminative tasks and point clouds, but their initial attempts at using them for denoising voxel grids were not successful. Further research could potentially improve performance. 

- Applying the proposed voxel-based method to conditional molecule generation tasks. The paper focuses on unconditional generation, but notes their approach could likely be adapted for conditional generation based on various targets or constraints.

- Improving the Langevin MCMC sampling procedure. The results indicate there is significant room for improvement in the "walk" step of the sampling. Developing better MCMC procedures could boost performance.

- Exploring different voxel resolutions and atomic density radii. The paper tested a few different parameter settings, but more work could further optimize these choices.

- Applying the method to generate other 3D structures beyond molecules, such as proteins or materials. The voxel representation could generalize well.

- Developing multiscale voxel representations, which could capture different levels of structural detail. 

- Combining the strengths of voxel and point cloud representations in a hybrid model.

- Evaluating the generated molecules on downstream predictive tasks to assess applicability.

- Exploring other potential applications of the noise model and sampling scheme proposed.

In summary, the paper provides a solid foundation and proof of concept for this voxel-based generative modeling approach for molecules. But there are many promising avenues for extending it in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new score-based approach to generate 3D molecules represented as atomic densities on regular grids. It trains a denoising neural network to map noisy voxelized molecules to clean molecules, learning the score function of the smooth distribution. Molecules are then generated by first sampling noisy grids via Langevin MCMC, and then recovering the clean molecule by denoising. This method, called VoxMol, differs from current approaches like diffusion models on atom point clouds in terms of the representation, noise model, architecture, and algorithm. Experiments on QM9 and GEOM-drugs datasets show VoxMol achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art while being simpler and faster. The voxel representation allows capturing long-range dependencies and does not require knowing the number of atoms beforehand. Overall, this presents a promising new direction for unconditional 3D molecular generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a new score-based approach for 3D molecule generation called VoxMol. The method represents molecules as atomic densities on regular voxel grids. First, a denoising neural network is trained to map from noisy voxelized molecules to clean real molecules. This network parameterizes the score function of the smooth noisy distribution. Then, molecules are generated in two steps: 1) Sample noisy grids from a smooth distribution via Langevin MCMC. 2) Recover clean molecules by denoising the noisy grids with the trained network. 

VoxMol generates molecules differently than current state-of-the-art diffusion models on point clouds. It differs in the data representation, noise model, network architecture, and algorithm. Experiments on QM9 and GEOM-drugs datasets show VoxMol achieves comparable unconditional 3D generation results to state-of-the-art while being simpler to train and faster to generate. The method does not need to know atom numbers beforehand or treat atom features as separate distributions. Overall, this work presents a promising new voxel-based approach for 3D molecule generation.

The paper proposes a new score-based approach to generate 3D molecules represented as atomic densities on regular voxel grids. The method trains a denoising neural network to map from a distribution of noisy voxelized molecules to the distribution of real molecules.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes VoxMol, a new score-based approach to generate 3D molecular structures represented as atomic densities on voxel grids. The key idea is to train a neural network to denoise noisy voxelized molecules. Specifically, noisy molecules are created by adding Gaussian noise to clean molecules. The denoising model learns to map the distribution of noisy molecules to that of real molecules, allowing it to estimate the score function of the noisy distribution. This score function is then leveraged to generate new molecules via a two-step sampling process: (1) sample noisy voxels using underdamped Langevin MCMC, and (2) recover a clean molecule by denoising the noisy grid. Compared to existing diffusion-based methods that operate on atom point clouds, VoxMol offers a simpler training procedure, faster sampling, and the ability to handle molecules with varying numbers of atoms. Experiments on QM9 and GEOM datasets demonstrate that VoxMol achieves state-of-the-art performance on unconditional 3D molecule generation while overcoming some limitations of current point cloud approaches. The key innovations are the voxel-based representation, the noise model, and the neural empirical Bayes generation framework.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes VoxMol, a new score-based approach to generate 3D molecular structures represented as atomic densities on voxel grids. The method trains a neural network to denoise voxelized molecular grids that have been corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. This network approximates the score function for sampling noisy molecules which are then denoised to produce clean samples. Specifically, noisy molecular grids are first sampled using Langevin MCMC and then denoised in a single step by the trained network to generate valid molecular structures. Compared to existing methods that operate on atomic point clouds, VoxMol uses a different data representation, noise model, network architecture and sampling procedure but still achieves competitive performance on unconditional molecular generation tasks while requiring less sampling steps. The voxel representation also does not require knowing the number of atoms a priori like point cloud methods. Qualitative results demonstrate that VoxMol can generate diverse, drug-like molecules with reasonable valence and symmetry.
