# [Frustratingly Simple Prompting-based Text Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15931)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The ASAP dataset used for automated essay scoring (AES) contains noise such as encoding errors in over 5% of sentences and non-word entities like "@PERSON1". 
- This noise has been overlooked in previous AES systems that treat the dataset as static.

Proposed Solution:
- Apply simple text denoising techniques using prompting with GPT-3.5 to fix encoding errors and replace non-word entities.
- Hypothesis is cleaning the noise will improve performance of linear regression for AES.

Experiments:
- GPT-3.5 used to generate cleaned text, original annotations retained to restore original words. 
- Roberta-base used for 8-fold cross-validation linear regression on original and cleaned texts.
- Perplexity and quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) measured.

Results:
- Cleaned text improved perplexity and QWK scores over original text.
- Detailed prompt-by-prompt analysis showed denoising helped most prompts.

Conclusion:
- Modifying datasets through denoising can improve results even using simple methods.  
- Noise and quality of training data impacts learning capability of models.
- While denoising helped overall, nuances across prompts needs more study.

Main Contributions:
- Novel perspective of dynamically enhancing ASAP dataset through denoising instead of treating it as static. 
- Demonstrated simple denoising using prompting can improve AES performance even without complex models.
- Emphasized the need to refine datasets themselves in addition to building better systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a simple text denoising technique using prompting to clean the ASAP dataset for automated essay scoring, finding that making minor enhancements to the training data can improve the linear regression results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple text denoising approach using prompting to clean the ASAP dataset for automated essay scoring (AES). Specifically, the paper:

- Identifies noise in the ASAP dataset, including encoding errors and non-word entities, which account for over 5% of sentences. 

- Employs two prompts with GPT-3.5-turbo to fix encoding errors and replace non-word entities. This denoising process enhances the quality of the texts.

- Conducts experiments showing that linear regression on the cleaned texts yields better quadratic weighted kappa scores for automated essay scoring compared to using the original noisy texts. 

- Underscores the value of refining datasets through simple denoising techniques to improve performance on downstream tasks like AES. 

So in summary, the key contribution is demonstrating the efficacy of a simple prompting-based text denoising method to clean the widely used ASAP dataset and obtain better essay scoring outcomes. This challenges the status quo of treating datasets as static and explores their dynamic potential.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What were the two distinct contexts in which the term "prompt" was used in this paper? Explain the difference between them.

2. What were the two main types of "noise" identified in the sentences of the ASAP dataset? Describe the process used to classify sentences as containing noise. 

3. Explain in detail the process used for text denoising, including the models and tools leveraged at each step. 

4. What was the purpose of using the ERRANT tool and .m2 annotations after generating cleaned text with GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct?

5. Why did the authors choose to conduct linear regression evaluations on the original text even when models were trained on the cleaned text? What did this choice enable them to ensure?

6. Analyze the results presented in Table 2. What inferences can you draw about the efficacy of the text denoising process in improving model performance? How might you explain the variations in results across prompts?

7. Discuss the limitations acknowledged by the authors regarding their choice to use a simple transformer rather than building a custom neural regression system. How might this have impacted their ability to achieve state-of-the-art results?

8. What role might the refinement of training datasets play in future work on automated essay scoring systems? How could additional features contribute to ongoing improvements?

9. Compare and contrast the metrics used to evaluate model performance in Table 3. What are the advantages of using such a diverse range of metrics? 

10. If you were to extend the work in this paper, what additional experiments would you design to further analyze the impact of text denoising on model performance? What other techniques could be explored?
