# [SportQA: A Benchmark for Sports Understanding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15862)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sports understanding poses unique challenges for natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) due to its dynamic, strategic nature.  
- Existing sports QA datasets are limited in size, domain coverage and lack depth in assessing advanced, scenario-based reasoning. 
- This hinders the ability to comprehensively evaluate and enhance LLMs' comprehension of sports.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce SportQA, a novel sports QA benchmark with over 70,000 multiple choice questions across 3 levels of difficulty:
  - Level 1: Basic historical/factual knowledge 
  - Level 2: Rules, tactics and advanced historical knowledge - 35 sports
  - Level 3: Complex, scenario-based reasoning - 6 key sports
- Questions range from straightforward facts to intricate game situations needing expert-level analysis.

Key Contributions:  
- Comprehensive sports QA evaluation benchmark aligned with spectrum of human sports expertise 
- Analysis of multiple LLMs using few-shot learning reveals competence in basic knowledge but significant gaps in complex reasoning compared to human performance
- Underscores need for advancements in logical reasoning and nuanced understanding in sports contexts
- Expanded sports NLP capabilities and applications in journalism, coaching, etc.
- Publicly available dataset to facilitate future research 

The paper makes a significant contribution in sports NLP by introducing a substantial, multi-faceted QA dataset for assessing and enhancing LLMs' understanding across diverse aspects of sports knowledge. Results reveal current models struggle with advanced scenario analysis compared to humans, highlighting room for improvement. Overall, the benchmark and analysis open exciting new directions for sports NLP research and applications.
