# [Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for LEO Constellations   Integrated with HAPs Using Hybrid NOMA-OFDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00685)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Integrating federated learning (FL) with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks is challenging due to the highly sporadic connectivity between LEO satellites and ground stations (GS). This leads to very slow convergence of the FL model training, taking days or even weeks. Specifically, there are four key issues: (1) The irregular visibility patterns between satellites and GS due to differing trajectories. (2) Long propagation delays over large distances. (3) The large size of modern machine learning models. (4) Unreliable communication channels near Earth's surface.  

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes NomaFedHAP, a novel framework to address the above issues. The key ideas are:

(1) Use multiple high-altitude platforms (HAPs) as distributed parameter servers instead of GS to improve visibility. HAPs have better connectivity, environment, flexibility and costs. 

(2) Introduce non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to allow concurrent transmission of models from multiple satellites using the full downlink bandwidth. This boosts data rates to transmit large models within the short visibility windows.

(3) Design a new ring topology using HAPs as relays between orbits to avoid Doppler shift from inter-orbit communication.  

(4) Propose algorithms for efficient propagation of global, local and sub-orbital models between HAPs and satellites to keep all satellites engaged.

(5) Develop an optimized aggregation scheme to balance models from all orbits when generating the global model.

Main Contributions:

(1) First work to apply NOMA in FL-LEO to address bandwidth limits for large model transmission under sporadic connectivity.

(2) Use HAPs as distributed parameter servers to further accelerate convergence. 

(3) Derive a closed-form expression for outage probability to evaluate reliability.

(4) Propose techniques including new topology, model propagation and aggregation algorithms specifically tailored for LEO satellites. 

(5) Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate order-of-magnitude faster convergence than state-of-the-art, within 4 hours, while achieving highest accuracy.

In summary, NomaFedHAP provides a customized solution for fast, reliable and efficient federated learning in LEO satellite networks by judicious algorithm and topology design.
