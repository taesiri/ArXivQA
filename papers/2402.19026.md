# [Progressive Contrastive Learning with Multi-Prototype for Unsupervised   Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19026)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to match people across visible and infrared images without any annotations. It is challenging due to large cross-modality gaps and lack of labels. Existing methods utilize cluster-based contrastive learning by using cluster centers as prototypes. However, cluster centers mainly capture shared information while overlooking diverse characteristics within a cluster. This leads to blurred cluster boundaries and limitations in handling hard samples. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Progressive Contrastive Learning with Multi-Prototype (PCLMP) method to mine both shared and diverse information for robust USVI-ReID. Specifically,
1) A Hard Prototype Contrastive Learning is designed to select the samples farthest from cluster centers as hard prototypes. This captures distinctive information to improve cluster separability.  
2) A Dynamic Prototype Contrastive Learning randomly selects samples as dynamic prototypes to retain feature diversity within clusters.
3) A progressive strategy is introduced to gradually focus on hard samples, avoiding early deterioration.

Main Contributions:
1) Novel hard and dynamic prototype designs to capture both common and diverse information.
2) Progressive strategy to stably optimize the learning of shared and distinctive characteristics.  
3) Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art with 3.9% average mAP improvement on two benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness.

In summary, this paper effectively rethinks prototype design in contrastive learning and proposes progressive optimization for learning robust USVI-ReID representations, leading to new state-of-the-art.
