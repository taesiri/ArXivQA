# [Three Decades of Activations: A Comprehensive Survey of 400 Activation   Functions for Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09092)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of 400 activation functions for neural networks. Activation functions play a crucial role in neural networks by introducing non-linearities that enable networks to learn complex patterns in data. However, the large number of proposed activation functions makes it difficult to maintain an overview of the field. This fragmentation has led to unintentional redundancy and reinvention of existing activation functions. 

To address this problem, the authors provide an extensive compilation of activation functions categorized into two main classes - fixed/classical activation functions and adaptive activation functions. Fixed activation functions such as sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU have a predetermined mathematical formulation and apply the same transformation regardless of the input. In contrast, adaptive activation functions can change their shape by learning parameters from data, allowing more flexibility. Examples include PReLU, swish, and recently proposed transformative adaptive activation functions (TAAF).

By covering 400 activation functions, this survey is significantly broader in scope than prior works. The goal is to provide researchers with a foundational resource to facilitate an informed selection of activation functions and avoid duplication of effort. The authors recognize the limitations of not including extensive benchmarks or analyses. Still, they believe this exhaustive list establishes a valuable reference that can accelerate future research on activation functions.

In summary, this paper tackles the fragmentation in activation function research that has led to redundancy. It provides the most comprehensive compilation of activation functions to date as a reference for researchers to build upon. By making prior work more accessible, the survey aims to stimulate innovation in developing better activation functions.
