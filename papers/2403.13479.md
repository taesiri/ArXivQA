# [Deepfake Detection without Deepfakes: Generalization via Synthetic   Frequency Patterns Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13479)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deepfake detectors trained to distinguish real vs synthetic images often fail to generalize to new unseen generation methods. They tend to overfit on the specific artifacts of the generators used during training.

Proposed Solution: 
- Train detectors without using any real deepfakes, only pristine images. Inject synthetic frequency patterns into some of the pristine images to simulate artifacts. These patterns are inspired by common shapes seen in deepfake fingerprints but not tied to any one method.

- Patterns include geometric shapes, grids, auras in the frequency domain. They are randomized but maintain structure at each generation.

- By exposing the model to diverse fake-like patterns on real images, aim to teach the concept of deepfakes in general rather than memorization of specific artifacts.

Contributions:
- Analysis of frequency domain fingerprints from 25 different GAN and diffusion model image generators. Identify common shapes and structures.

- Novel training procedure involving injection of customizable synthetic frequency patterns into pristine images. Converts pristine images into "fakes" for training.

- Test models on large dataset covering 25 generators. Demonstrate state-of-the-art deepfake detection and superior generalization ability compared to previous fingerprint-based methods.

- Open source code release enabling reproduction of experiments and applications of proposed training approach.

Overall, the key insight is that exposing models to diverse fake-looking frequency patterns teaches them the general concept of discrepancies between real and fake images. This avoids overfitting to individual generator fingerprints and enhances generalization.
