# [Direct Exoplanet Detection Using Deep Convolutional Image Reconstruction   (ConStruct): A New Algorithm for Post-Processing High-Contrast Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03671)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents a new machine learning algorithm called \texttt{ConStruct} for detecting faint exoplanets in high-contrast adaptive optics images. The key innovation is using a convolutional autoencoder neural network to accurately predict and subtract out quasistatic speckle noise in the images while preserving potential exoplanet signals. The autoencoder is trained on a large dataset of archival high-contrast images to learn an effective model of typical speckle patterns. In the reduction process, image patches are extracted from an ADI sequence and the central region is masked and fed into the autoencoder which predicts the speckle noise content. This allows exoplanets hiding in the masked area to remain unbiased. Additional post-processing steps further refine the speckle noise subtraction using temporal correlations. \texttt{ConStruct} is tested on real Keck/NIRC2 data containing 30 unique point sources and demonstrates improved signal-to-noise ratios over a standard PCA-based approach for 67% of sources, with contrast improvements up to a factor of 2.6. This method shows promise for enhancing exoplanet detection sensitivity, especially for future extremely large telescopes utilizing adaptive optics.
