# [UniVL: A Unified Video and Language Pre-Training Model for Multimodal   Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06353)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we develop a unified pre-training model for both multimodal video understanding and generation tasks?The key points are:- The paper proposes a unified video-language pre-training model called UniVL that can be fine-tuned for both understanding (e.g. retrieval) and generation (e.g. captioning) tasks. - Most prior works focused on pre-training for either understanding or generation tasks separately. This model aims to bridge that gap.- The model has four components: two single-modal encoders, a cross-encoder, and a decoder. It is trained with five objectives to learn joint video-text representations.- Two pre-training strategies are introduced to make the training more effective. - Experiments on five downstream tasks show state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the model's effectiveness for both understanding and generation.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a unified pre-training approach can learn representations that transfer well to both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. The UniVL model is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing UniVL, a unified video and language pre-training model for both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. 2. Designing the model architecture with four components: two single-modal encoders, a cross encoder, and a decoder. This allows flexibility for various downstream tasks.3. Developing five pre-training objectives to train the model components: video-text joint, conditioned masked language model, conditioned masked frame model, video-text alignment, and language reconstruction.4. Proposing two pre-training strategies: stage by stage pre-training and enhanced video representation to make the training more effective. 5. Conducting experiments on a large instructional video dataset HowTo100M for pre-training, and evaluating on five downstream tasks: text-based video retrieval, video captioning, action segmentation, action step localization, and multimodal sentiment analysis. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on these tasks.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a flexible and unified video-language pre-training model UniVL that achieves strong performance on both understanding and generation downstream tasks. The model architecture, pre-training objectives and strategies are novel and effective.

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes UniVL, a unified video and language pre-training model with an encoder-decoder architecture and objectives for both understanding and generation tasks, which achieves state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream multimodal tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in video and language pre-training:- This paper proposes a unified video and language pre-training model (UniVL) for both understanding and generation tasks. Other recent works like VideoBERT, ActBERT, and HERO focus on pre-training for understanding tasks. VideoAsMT takes a generative modeling approach for translation between modalities. UniVL aims to be flexible for both types of tasks.- The model architecture combines elements from prior work. It uses separate encoders like ViLBERT, a cross-modal encoder like HERO, and an autoregressive decoder like BART. The objectives also combine masked language modeling, masked frame modeling, alignment prediction, etc. - The pre-training data and tasks are tailored for instructional videos. Other recent models use general video datasets like YouTube clips. Pre-training on domain-specific data could be beneficial for downstream tasks in that domain.- The paper demonstrates strong performance on a range of video+language tasks after fine-tuning. For text-based video retrieval and action segmentation, UniVL outperforms models like VideoBERT and ActBERT pre-trained on the same dataset. For video captioning, it achieves state-of-the-art results.- One limitation is the compute required for pre-training is quite high (12 days on 8 V100 GPUs). More efficient pre-training could help scale this approach.Overall, UniVL combines strengths from prior work and demonstrates the value of pre-training for both understanding and generation. The flexible encoder-decoder design and broad set of pre-training objectives enable strong performance on diverse video+language tasks.
