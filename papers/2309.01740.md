# [An Empirical Analysis for Zero-Shot Multi-Label Classification on   COVID-19 CT Scans and Uncurated Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01740)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we effectively apply zero-shot multi-label classification to CT scans and uncurated radiology reports for COVID-19 diagnosis?

Specifically, the paper investigates:

- Different approaches for fine-tuning pre-trained contrastive visual language models (e.g. CLIP) on CT scans and reports. This includes freezing encoders, fine-tuning encoders, and training alternative encoders. 

- The impact of using class-dependent vs class-independent templates for the zero-shot prompts.

- Combinations of pre-trained text encoders and vision encoders for mapping images and text.

- The effects of varying context length and truncation side when using long uncurated reports.

The overall goal is to develop a zero-shot classification system that can help radiologists accurately detect key COVID-19 associated lung pathologies and conditions directly from CT scans and reports, without needing exhaustive labeled data. The paper provides an empirical analysis of solutions for this fine-grained medical multimodal classification task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Collecting and preprocessing a dataset of COVID-19 CT scans and corresponding radiology reports from a university hospital. This provides real-world uncurated data for training and evaluation.

- Investigating different approaches for mapping CT images to text reports and performing zero-shot classification, including using pre-trained encoders like CLIP and fine-tuning them on the collected dataset. 

- Designing a class-dependent zero-shot template scheme to better target vision features to prompts for each class, rather than using the same generic prompts.

- Empirically analyzing various combinations of vision and text encoders, context lengths, truncation approaches etc. to identify effective solutions for this fine-grained multi-label zero-shot classification task.

- Demonstrating the feasibility of zero-shot classification on uncurated medical data for identifying fine-grained lung pathologies related to COVID-19, like consolidations and ground glass opacities.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the empirical analysis and development of solutions for zero-shot multi-label classification on CT scans and radiology reports for fine-grained COVID-19 pathology identification, using a real-world collected dataset. The authors frame this as a first step towards developing assistive automatic diagnosis tools leveraging uncurated medical data.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents an empirical analysis of different methods for zero-shot multi-label classification of COVID-19 CT scans and uncurated radiology reports, comparing approaches like finetuning pretrained CLIP models and combining pretrained vision and text encoders.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points of comparison between this paper and other related research:

- The paper focuses on multi-label classification of COVID-19 CT scans and radiology reports using a zero-shot learning approach based on contrastive visual-language modeling. This is a novel application of zero-shot learning to this type of fine-grained medical image analysis task. 

- Most prior work on COVID-19 diagnosis has focused on binary classification of X-ray images rather than multi-label classification of CT scans. The use of CT scans provides more fine-grained information compared to X-rays.

- The paper explores finetuning several existing medical vision-language models like CheXzero, MedCLIP, and BioMedCLIP on their dataset. Other papers have proposed new architectures, while this leverages transfer learning.

- They design a class-dependent zero-shot template scheme to handle the variability in radiology reports, unlike the standard class-independent templates. This is an interesting way to adapt zero-shot learning to unstructured medical text.

- The dataset size is relatively small (460 reports) compared to large public chest X-ray datasets. So transfer learning is key, while some papers collect larger proprietary datasets.

- Multi-label classification on 5 fine-grained attributes is evaluated, unlike much work that focuses on COVID-19 diagnosis as a single label. This is a challenging problem setup.

- The vision encoder choices analyze medical encoders like those in CheXzero, MedCLIP as well as more general ones like ResNet-50 and ViT. This provides useful comparisons.

In summary, the paper provides a uniquely thorough empirical analysis of zero-shot learning methods tailored to fine-grained classification of medical images and unstructured text. The transfer learning based approach is well-motivated by the problem setup and dataset size.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying the methods to longitudinal data for prognosis of long COVID-19. The authors mention they are in the process of collecting data from multiple hospitals that will allow them to study disease progression over time. This could be useful for predicting long-term outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

- Moving from 2D to 3D analysis. The authors note that recent review articles have discussed the potential of using 3D volumes for tasks like disease prognostication. Applying their methods to full 3D CT volumes rather than 2D slices could improve performance.

- Improving the variability and framing of the text data for zero-shot classification. The authors acknowledge challenges with the variability of the uncurated text reports. Further work on better templates and framing of the text could enhance the zero-shot classification.

- Applying the techniques to additional fine-grained lung pathology patterns beyond those studied. The authors hope their work inspires research on using unstructured pandemic data to identify other intricate lung details automatically.

- Validating the methods on larger datasets. The authors note their dataset was limited in size. Testing on larger datasets from multiple hospitals could further validate the techniques.

- End-to-end processing of the images rather than offline preprocessing. The authors mention the current limitation of offline image processing and suggest this could be incorporated into the data loading/training process.

In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding the methods to longitudinal prognosis tasks, 3D analysis, larger datasets, additional fine-grained pathologies, improving the text variability, and end-to-end training. The overall goal is to advance the use of unstructured pandemic data for automated medical diagnosis.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents an empirical analysis for zero-shot multi-label classification on COVID-19 CT scans and uncurated radiology reports. The main method used is contrastive visual language learning, specifically fine-tuning variants of the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model on the collected CT scan and report data. 

The key steps of the method are:

- Data preprocessing: CT scans are resampled, split into 4 blocks, montages of 4 random slices are created, and resized to 224x224. Reports are translated to English and filtered. 

- Encoder selection: Several vision encoders are considered including CNNs like ResNet-50 and transformers like ViT and Swin Transformer. For text, the RadBERT model fine-tuned on COVID radiology reports is used.

- Embeddings alignment: The image and text embeddings are aligned using a contrastive loss that maximizes agreement between positive pairs and distinguishes negative pairs.

- Zero-shot classification: Class-specific image-text template pairs are created as prompts. The similarity between the image embedding and the text template embeddings is used to predict multi-label classifications for 5 lung conditions.

So in summary, the main method is fine-tuning variants of the CLIP model on preprocessed CT slice montages and radiology reports, then using the aligned embeddings for zero-shot multi-label classification of lung conditions relevant for COVID-19 assessment. Contrastive learning enables zero-shot prediction without labeled data.
