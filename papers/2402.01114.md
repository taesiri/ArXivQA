# [Double-Dip: Thwarting Label-Only Membership Inference Attacks with   Transfer Learning and Randomization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01114)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) can suffer from overfitting when trained on small datasets, causing them to have high accuracy on training samples but poor performance on other samples. 
- Overfitted DNNs are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), where an adversary tries to determine if a given sample was used to train the model.
- Existing defenses against MIAs either degrade model accuracy or are ineffective against state-of-the-art label-only MIAs that rely only on predicted labels.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Double-Dip", a two-stage approach to thwart label-only MIAs on overfitted DNNs without sacrificing accuracy.

Stage 1: 
- Uses transfer learning to embed an overfitted DNN into a target model with a shared feature space as a publicly available pretrained model.
- Freezes weights in some layers of the pretrained model and trains the remaining layers on the target dataset.  
- Reduces overfitting in the target model, providing resilience against MIAs while improving classification accuracy.

Stage 2:
- Employs random noise perturbation to construct regions of constant output label around input samples.
- Causes noise magnitudes needed to misclassify members and nonmembers to become more similar.
- Further reduces success rates of label-only MIAs without affecting accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- First study investigating transfer learning to mitigate label-only MIAs on overfitted DNNs. 
- Analysis of design choices like number of frozen layers, model complexity, dataset correlations.
- Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrating efficacy of Double-Dip.
- Reduces MIA success rate to near random guess (50%) while significantly improving classification accuracy over defenses like regularization.
- Lightweight Stage 2 post-processing further reduces success rates without retraining models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage approach called Double-Dip that uses transfer learning to embed an overfitted deep neural network into a target model to reduce vulnerability to membership inference attacks, and adds random noise perturbations in the second stage to further lower attack success rate without compromising classification accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing "Double-Dip", a two-stage approach using transfer learning (Stage 1) and randomization (Stage 2) to thwart label-only membership inference attacks on overfitted deep neural networks. Specifically:

- Stage 1 uses transfer learning to embed an overfitted DNN into a target model with shared features and parameters with a pretrained model. This is shown to reduce the adversary success rate (ASR) of membership inference attacks while increasing classification accuracy. 

- Stage 2 employs random noise perturbation around input samples to construct regions of constant output labels. This further reduces ASR while maintaining classification accuracy.

- Extensive experiments are conducted with different datasets and pretrained models. Results show Stage 1 significantly reduces ASR and improves accuracy over not using transfer learning or using regularization/distillation based defenses. Stage 2 further reduces ASR close to 50% (random guess level).

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating a two-stage "Double-Dip" approach using transfer learning and randomization that effectively defends against membership inference attacks on overfitted DNNs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- Membership inference attack (MIA)
- Label-only MIA 
- Overfitted deep neural networks (DNNs)
- Transfer learning (TL)
- Target model
- Source model
- Pretrained model
- Adversary success rate (ASR)
- Classification accuracy (ACC) 
- Double-Dip 
- Stage-1 (using TL to reduce overfitting and ASR)
- Stage-2 (using randomization to further reduce ASR)

The paper proposes a two-stage defense called "Double-Dip" against membership inference attacks on overfitted DNNs. Stage-1 uses transfer learning to reduce overfitting and adversary success rate while improving classification accuracy. Stage-2 employs randomization to further reduce the ASR. The key metrics used are ASR (should be close to 50% for an ineffective adversary) and ACC (should be high for model usability). Several target and source datasets, along with pretrained models are used to evaluate the efficacy of Double-Dip.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) What is the key insight behind using transfer learning in Stage 1 of Double-Dip to help overcome overfitting in the limited data setting? How does overcoming overfitting improve resilience against membership inference attacks?

2) How does the degree of similarity between features in the source and target datasets impact the effectiveness of transfer learning in Stage 1? What experiments were done to evaluate this?

3) What is the rationale behind comparing the performance of less complex models like VGG-19 versus more complex models like ResNet-18 and Swin-T transformers? How did model complexity relate to effectiveness in reducing adversary success rate?

4) What is the key idea behind using a smoothed classifier with random noise perturbation in Stage 2? How does adding calibrated Gaussian noise help further reduce the adversary success rate without impacting classification accuracy?

5) What are the pros and cons of using differential privacy mechanisms versus the proposed randomization strategy in Stage 2 to reduce adversary success rate? How did they compare empirically?

6) What is the purpose of evaluating Double-Dip against shadow models in the threat model? How well did shadow models represent the target models in experiments?

7) How effective was Stage 1 of Double-Dip in defending against other types of membership inference attacks, like entropy-based attacks? What can be done to further improve defenses against such attacks?

8) How does the number of frozen layers in the pretrained model impact the effectiveness of transfer learning, especially when the target dataset size is small? What did the experiments reveal regarding choice of frozen layers?

9) What domain adaptation strategies can be used to extend Double-Dip to settings where there are no correlated features between the source and target datasets? 

10) How do the experiments account for and compare adversary success rates under different threat models - whitebox and blackbox access? Were there any interesting observations from comparing them?
