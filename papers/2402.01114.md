# [Double-Dip: Thwarting Label-Only Membership Inference Attacks with   Transfer Learning and Randomization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01114)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) can suffer from overfitting when trained on small datasets, causing them to have high accuracy on training samples but poor performance on other samples. 
- Overfitted DNNs are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), where an adversary tries to determine if a given sample was used to train the model.
- Existing defenses against MIAs either degrade model accuracy or are ineffective against state-of-the-art label-only MIAs that rely only on predicted labels.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Double-Dip", a two-stage approach to thwart label-only MIAs on overfitted DNNs without sacrificing accuracy.

Stage 1: 
- Uses transfer learning to embed an overfitted DNN into a target model with a shared feature space as a publicly available pretrained model.
- Freezes weights in some layers of the pretrained model and trains the remaining layers on the target dataset.  
- Reduces overfitting in the target model, providing resilience against MIAs while improving classification accuracy.

Stage 2:
- Employs random noise perturbation to construct regions of constant output label around input samples.
- Causes noise magnitudes needed to misclassify members and nonmembers to become more similar.
- Further reduces success rates of label-only MIAs without affecting accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- First study investigating transfer learning to mitigate label-only MIAs on overfitted DNNs. 
- Analysis of design choices like number of frozen layers, model complexity, dataset correlations.
- Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrating efficacy of Double-Dip.
- Reduces MIA success rate to near random guess (50%) while significantly improving classification accuracy over defenses like regularization.
- Lightweight Stage 2 post-processing further reduces success rates without retraining models.
