## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for multi-robot collaborative area search. It leverages a hierarchical framework comprising role selection for high-level task planning and a primitive policy network for low-level action execution. Specifically, the role selection module learns to choose between "explore" and "cover" roles for each robot based on local and global observations using a decentralized actor-critic structure. An intelligent role switching mechanism facilitates smooth transitions between the roles over time. The primitive policy then executes sub-task actions conditioned on the assigned role and local observations. This decoupled approach enhances scalability to larger, more complex environments and higher numbers of robots compared to prior work. Through extensive simulated experiments, the method demonstrates superior performance in simultaneously exploring unknown areas and covering target locations over baselines. The analysis also reveals the ability to balance the explore-cover tradeoff by tuning relative reward weights. Key advantages include efficient training, implicit coordination among robots, and generalizability across varying map complexity and robot team sizes. Future work involves enabling dynamic role weight adaptation and investigating more expressive environmental representations.
