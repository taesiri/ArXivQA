# [F-Eval: Asssessing Fundamental Abilities with Refined Evaluation Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14869)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) focus primarily on assessing instruction-following capabilities rather than fundamental abilities cultivated during pre-training. 
- Subjective evaluation methods heavily depend on scoring by API models like GPT4.0. However, without reference texts, LLMs struggle to discern subtle quality differences in outputs.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce F-Eval, a bilingual benchmark with 15 sub-datasets to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' fundamental abilities across 3 dimensions: expression, commonsense, and logic.
- Dataset formats include multi-choice questions, open-ended questions, reference-based subjective tasks, and reference-free subjective tasks. 
- Employ 4 categories of tailored evaluation methods: rule-based, probability-based, assistant-tool based, and API-based evaluation.  
- For reference-free subjective tasks, design alternative evaluation methods to scoring by API models for greater reliability and distinction.

Main Contributions:
- First benchmark focusing specifically on assessing fundamental abilities of LLMs rather than just instruction-following skills
- Provide suitable evaluation methods for each type of sub-dataset
- Devise new methods for reference-free subjective tasks that outperform API model scoring in terms of human correlation and score distribution
- Comprehensive analysis of 13 LLMs' performance on F-Eval, shedding light on impact of model scale, dimensions, and normalization techniques to guide future LLM research

The benchmark and analyses serve as a valuable resource for studying and enhancing LLMs' core competencies beyond narrow metrics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces F-Eval, a comprehensive bilingual benchmark with 15 sub-datasets to evaluate the fundamental abilities of large language models across dimensions of expression, commonsense, and logic, using suitable evaluation methods for each sub-dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces F-Eval, a comprehensive bilingual benchmark to evaluate the fundamental abilities of large language models across 3 dimensions - expression, commonsense, and logic. The benchmark contains 15 sub-datasets with over 2000 instances in both English and Chinese.

2. It employs 4 categories of evaluation methods suited for different sub-datasets - rule-based, probability-based, assistant tool-based, and API-based evaluation. Notably, it devises new methods for reference-free subjective tasks as an alternative to scoring by API models. 

3. It conducts experiments on 13 advanced LLMs and discusses model performance in detail from perspectives of model size, ability imbalance across dimensions, and normalization methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of F-Eval and provide insights into improving LLMs' fundamental abilities.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of F-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark to assess LLMs' fundamental abilities, along with suitable evaluation methods designed for each sub-dataset. The benchmark and experiments are expected to facilitate future research towards enhancing these core capabilities of LLMs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- F-Eval - The name of the proposed evaluation benchmark to assess the fundamental abilities of large language models.

- Fundamental abilities - The core competencies that emerge during the pre-training stage of large language models, which F-Eval aims to evaluate. These include expression, commonsense, and logic. 

- Objective tasks - Objective sub-datasets in F-Eval include multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions with definitive answers. These are evaluated based on accuracy.

- Subjective tasks - Subjective sub-datasets aim to align with human judgment and include both reference-based and reference-free varieties. New evaluation methods are proposed for the latter.

- Three dimensions - The benchmark structure revolves around assessing abilities across three dimensions: expression, commonsense, and logic.

- Evaluation methods - A variety of evaluation methods are employed, including rule-based, probability-based, assistant tool-based, and API-based evaluations. 

- Self-adaptive normalization - A specially designed score normalization technique to effectively aggregate results across diverse sub-datasets. 

- Correlation analysis - Evaluation reliability is measured through correlation analysis between automated metrics and human judgement.

- Model analysis - Performance variations are studied across different model sizes, dimensions, and normalization techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does F-Eval address the limitation of current evaluation benchmarks only assessing the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs and overlooking their fundamental abilities?

2. Why does F-Eval focus on evaluating the fundamental abilities of LLMs rather than their instruction-following and conversational capabilities? What additional insights can evaluating fundamental abilities provide?

3. How does the composition and format of datasets in F-Eval, such as multi-choice objective tasks and reference-free subjective tasks, allow for a comprehensive assessment of fundamental abilities?

4. What challenges arise in evaluating the fundamental abilities of LLMs without references, and how does F-Eval address them through newly designed evaluation methods?

5. How does the self-adaptive normalization method proposed help accurately combine and interpret scores across different F-Eval sub-datasets? What are its advantages over statistical normalization methods?

6. What trends do the F-Eval results reveal regarding the relationship between LLM scale and performance across ability dimensions like expression, common sense, and logic?

7. Why do different LLM series, despite similarities in scale, show imbalanced abilities across the three evaluation dimensions in F-Eval? What factors might explain this?

8. How suitable are open-source LLMs as proxy models for automated evaluation methods, based on analysis of correlation coefficients in F-Eval sub-datasets?

9. To what extent do the findings from F-Eval highlight shortcomings in current open-source LLMs' fundamental abilities, and what path forward do they suggest for future LLM research?  

10. How might researchers further validate, refine or build upon the benchmark datasets and evaluation protocols proposed in F-Eval to advance LLM assessment?
