# [Offensive Lineup Analysis in Basketball with Clustering Players Based on   Shooting Style and Offensive Role](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13821)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
In basketball, scoring efficiency is critical to winning games due to the large number of possessions. Enhancing scoring efficiency requires effective collaboration between players with different playing styles. Previous research has analyzed basketball lineups but not quantitatively examined the compatibility of players' shooting styles and offensive roles. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes two new methods to capture players' offensive styles - shooting style clustering using tracking data, and offensive role clustering using playtype data and stats. 

For shooting style clustering, they use interpretable handcrafted shot features and Wasserstein distances between shooting distributions to group players. This captures more specifics of shooting tendencies than prior work.

For offensive role clustering, they apply soft clustering to playtype data to allow players to have partial membership in multiple clusters. This better captures composite offensive roles than hard clustering methods.

They then analyze lineup scoring efficiency using the cluster assignments in two ways:

1) Predict lineup efficiency using machine learning models with lineup composition as features. Identify trends in effective vs ineffective lineups.

2) Quantitatively estimate scoring effects of 2-player cluster combinations via Bayesian hierarchical modeling.

Main Contributions:

- New shooting style clustering method using tracking data and Wasserstein distances

- First application of soft clustering on playtype data to define offensive roles 

- Quantitative analysis estimating compatibility between clusters and scoring efficiency

- New insights into effective combinations of players for scoring, such as benefits of having multiple isolation scorers or shooters in a lineup.

In summary, the key novelty is the new player clustering methods and quantitative analysis of cluster compatibility for gaining new understandings of efficient lineup construction.
