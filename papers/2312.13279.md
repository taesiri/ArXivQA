# [Stretch with Stretch: Physical Therapy Exercise Games Led by a Mobile   Manipulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13279)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Physical therapy (PT) is important for treating impairments in people with Parkinson's disease (PD), but there are shortages of physical therapists and low adherence to self-guided PT regimens. 
- Prior robotic systems for guiding physical therapy exercises have been large, immobile, and not very customizable/adaptive.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present a robotic system called "Stretch with Stretch" (SWS) consisting of a mobile manipulator (Hello Robot Stretch RE1) with a soft bubble end effector to guide stretching exercises.
- Exercises involve repetitively touching the bubble with different body parts (hands, feet, knees).
- Target locations for the bubble are personalized based on:
   1) Kinematic models of exercises using the person's body dimensions
   2) Haptic sampling to estimate the person's range of motion 
   3) Adjustments based on the person's performance
- Cognitive challenges (naming tasks) are combined with some physical exercises to improve dual tasking capability.

Contributions:
- A robotic system for personalized and progressive physical therapy exercises using an off-the-shelf mobile manipulator 
- Novel models to define exercise difficulty based on body dimensions, range of motion, and performance
- 10 specific stretching exercises compatible with the system
- Demonstrated feasibility through a study with 10 people with PD performing 6 exercises over 1 hour
- Subjective ratings showed participants found the system useful, easy to use, and the exercises were mildly to moderately difficult

The system could help address current barriers to effective PD therapy and shows promise for supervised use in clinics or homes. Further improvements around safety, feedback, and motivation are discussed.
