# [DemaFormer: Damped Exponential Moving Average Transformer with   Energy-Based Modeling for Temporal Language Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02549)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes DemaFormer, a novel neural architecture for temporal language grounding (TLG). TLG aims to localize video moments that correspond to a natural language query. DemaFormer incorporates damping exponential moving average (DEMA) attention to capture local dependencies between video-language inputs. Additionally, an energy-based modeling approach is proposed to explicitly model the distribution of relevant moment-query representations and distinguish them from irrelevant ones. Specifically, a contrastive divergence training objective minimizes the energy of positive samples while maximizing the energy of negative samples generated by Langevin dynamics. Comprehensive experiments on four TLG benchmarks demonstrate that DemaFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. The improvements are attributed to the effective joint modeling of video and language enabled by the DEMA attention and energy-based modeling. Qualitative analysis verifies that DemaFormer produces more accurate localization and better captures the distribution of relevant moment-query pairs compared to baseline models.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1. It proposes DemaFormer, a novel architecture for temporal language grounding. DemaFormer integrates exponential moving average with learnable damping coefficients into the attention mechanism to appropriately capture dependency patterns among video-language inputs.

2. It proposes a novel energy-based learning framework for temporal language grounding. The objective for the energy-based model can be formulated as a contrastive divergence to assist a classical grounding loss for modeling moment-query representations.

3. It conducts extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over previous state-of-the-art baselines on four public benchmarks for the temporal language grounding task. It also provides comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the proposed components and deliver meaningful insights.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) the DemaFormer architecture, (2) the energy-based learning framework, and (3) experimental results showing state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.
