## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Radiation therapy planning is complex and time-consuming, requiring collaboration between physicists and oncologists. This can cause delays in treatment. 
- Existing deep learning methods for automating radiation dose prediction lack ability to generate high-frequency details and have limitations in efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MD-Dose, a novel diffusion model using Mamba architecture for dose prediction. 
- It consists of a forward noise addition process and a reverse denoising process.
- A Mamba-UNet is proposed as the denoising network to predict noise and restore dose maps.
- A Mamba encoder extracts anatomical structure information from CT/segmentation images. This is integrated into Mamba-UNet to guide dose localization.

Main Contributions:
- First work to utilize Mamba architecture for dose prediction task. Mamba has shown great efficiency in processing long sequences.
- Proposal of Mamba-UNet as denoising network with a Mamba encoder to incorporate anatomical structure information.
- Experiments on 300 thoracic tumor patients show MD-Dose achieves state-of-the-art performance in prediction accuracy and efficiency.
- Visualizations demonstrate MD-Dose generates dose maps with clearer high-frequency details. DVH curves are closest to ground truth.
- Ablations validate the efficacy of the structure encoder and Mamba's superiority over CNN/Transformers.

In summary, the paper presents MD-Dose, a novel and efficient diffusion model for radiation dose prediction using Mamba architecture. By integrating anatomical structure information, it generates high quality dose maps to facilitate precise radiation therapy planning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes MD-Dose, a novel diffusion model using Mamba as the denoising network to predict radiation therapy dose distribution maps for thoracic cancer patients, which incorporates a Mamba encoder to extract anatomical structure information and integrate it to guide dose prediction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors propose MD-Dose, a novel dose prediction model that uses Mamba as the denoising network within a diffusion model framework. To the best of their knowledge, this is the first work to introduce Mamba for radiation dose prediction.

2. They develop a Mamba-based structural encoder to extract anatomical information from CT images and organ segmentation masks. This anatomical information helps guide the noise predictor to generate more precise dose distribution map predictions. 

3. The authors evaluate MD-Dose on a clinical dataset of 300 thoracic tumor patients. The results show their method achieves the best performance while consuming less computation time compared to prior state-of-the-art diffusion model methods.

In summary, the key innovation is using the Mamba architecture in a diffusion model for dose prediction, alongside a Mamba-based structural encoder to incorporate anatomical guidance. Evaluations demonstrate improved accuracy and efficiency over existing approaches.
