# [Unsupervised Intrinsic Image Decomposition with LiDAR Intensity Enhanced   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14089)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Unsupervised intrinsic image decomposition (IID) aims to separate an image into albedo (object color) and shading components without ground truth supervision. Recent work IID-LI achieves impressive performance by utilizing LiDAR intensity during both training and inference. However, the requirement of LiDAR intensity at inference time limits its applicability. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes LIET, which utilizes LiDAR intensity during training but requires only a single RGB image at inference time. LIET has a partially shared encoder-decoder architecture with separate image and LiDAR intensity encoders that share some processing components. Two key ideas are proposed to enhance IID quality:

1) Albedo-alignment loss aligns the grayscaled albedo from the RGB image to that inferred from the LiDAR intensity. This helps reduce shadows in the RGB albedo. 

2) Image-LiDAR conversion paths mutually translate between the image and LiDAR representations. This facilitates separating content and style as image and LiDAR share content but differ in style.

Main Contributions:

- LIET architecture that utilizes LiDAR intensity at training time but allows single RGB image inference, expanding applicability.

- Albedo-alignment loss and image-LiDAR conversion paths to better leverage LiDAR data and enhance IID quality.

- Comparable IID performance to IID-LI requiring LiDAR at inference time, while using only RGB input at inference.

- Improved image quality over state-of-the-art unsupervised IID methods in terms of recent image quality assessment metrics.

In summary, LIET expands the applicability of LiDAR-enhanced IID while matching state-of-the-art quality by using LiDAR only at training time. The proposed techniques help effectively leverage the LiDAR data to improve RGB-only inference.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes an unsupervised intrinsic image decomposition method that utilizes LiDAR intensity during training to enhance performance while only requiring a single image input during inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing an unsupervised single-image intrinsic image decomposition model called LIET that utilizes both image and corresponding LiDAR intensity during training, while only requiring a single image during inference. 

2. Introducing an albedo-alignment loss to align the albedo inferred from an image to that inferred from the corresponding LiDAR intensity. This helps reduce cast shadows in the image albedo.

3. Proposing image-LiDAR conversion (ILC) paths that mutually translate between image and LiDAR intensity. This facilitates separating image content and style, enhancing the intrinsic image decomposition quality.

4. Demonstrating through experiments that LIET achieves state-of-the-art intrinsic image decomposition quality using only a single image at inference time. It also shows higher image quality ratings compared to prior arts.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the LIET model that leverages LiDAR intensity at training time to achieve high quality single image intrinsic decomposition at inference time. The albedo-alignment loss and ILC paths also contribute to improving the decomposition quality.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) What is the key motivation behind proposing a partially shared model architecture that can utilize both image and LiDAR intensity during training but only image during inference? What problem does this solve compared to prior work?

2) Explain the albedo-alignment loss in detail. Why is aligning the grayscaled albedo from the image to the albedo from the LiDAR intensity useful? How does it help reduce cast shadows in the image albedo?

3) What is the purpose of the image-LiDAR conversion (ILC) paths? How do they help separate image content and style more effectively compared to prior methods? 

4) The paper states that albedo-alignment loss helps achieve albedo local flatness without needing an explicit smoothing loss. Explain why this is the case and discuss the tradeoffs.

5) What modifications needed to be made to the USI^3D architecture to incorporate LiDAR intensity information during training? Discuss the key changes. 

6) Why can't LiDAR intensity be directly used as ground truth for albedo despite capturing surface properties well? How does the method address the difference in wavelength bands?

7) Analyze the quantitative results in Tables 1 and 2. What conclusions can you draw about the method's IID quality and image quality compared to prior state-of-the-art?

8) How suitable do you think the NTT-IID dataset used in this paper is for evaluating IID methods? What are its strengths and weaknesses? 

9) The method trains on synthetic albedo/shading data. How might this impact generalization to real-world test data? Could the synthetic data induce biases?

10) The paper demonstrates single image IID with LiDAR supervision. Can you think of other modalities that could provide useful supervision for this task during training?
