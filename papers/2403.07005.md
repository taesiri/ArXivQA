# [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with a Hierarchy of Reward Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07005)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing works on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with reward machines (RMs) suffer from several limitations when dealing with complex cooperative tasks:
1) They rely on the assumption of weak interdependencies among agents, thus cannot handle scenarios where agents are highly interdependent. 
2) They are limited to simple prior knowledge where each high-level event only consists of a single proposition. This makes it hard to specify tasks with multiple concurrent events.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with a Hierarchy of Reward Machines (MAHRM). The key ideas are:

1) Utilize a hierarchical structure of propositions where higher level propositions temporally abstract lower level ones. Each proposition represents a subtask assigned to a group of agents.  

2) Derive a hierarchy of RMs from this structure, with each RM defining rewards for the subtask of one proposition.

3) Learn policies similarly to hierarchical RL: higher level policy chooses lower level subtasks to execute while lowest level policy determines actions of agents.  

4) Eliminate unreasonable selections of subtasks using internal structure of RMs to improve learning efficiency.

5) Enable dynamic decomposition of joint task by assigning different subtasks to agents over time.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes MAHRM framework that handles complex cooperative MARL scenarios with highly interdependent agents and concurrent events.

2) Reduces size of state/action spaces by hierarchical decomposition into subtasks over groups of agents.

3) Coordinates agents via hierarchical policies derived from hierarchy of RMs specifying rewards.

4) Outperforms baselines using same high-level knowledge on cooperative navigation, Minecraft and multi-agent passage domains.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel MARL approach MAHRM that leverages hierarchical abstraction of events as prior knowledge to efficiently decompose complex cooperative tasks over interdependent agents. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several multi-agent domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multi-agent hierarchical reinforcement learning framework using hierarchies of reward machines to decompose complex cooperative tasks into simpler subtasks for more efficient learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the abstract and introduction, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called Multi-Agent reinforcement learning with Hierarchy of Reward Machines (MAHRM) for more efficient cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, MAHRM:

- Exploits the hierarchical relationship of high-level events (propositions) to decompose a complex joint task into simpler subtasks. Each proposition represents a subtask assigned to a group of agents. This reduces the complexity compared to flat decomposition methods. 

- Derives a hierarchy of Reward Machines from the hierarchy of propositions to specify the rewards of the subtasks. 

- Learns policies in a hierarchical way similar to hierarchical RL: high-level policies choose lower-level subtasks to execute, and lowest-level policies determine actions of agents to interact with the environment.  

- Eliminates unreasonable selections of subtasks using the internal structure of Reward Machines to improve learning efficiency.

- Enables dynamic decomposition to split joint state/action spaces into local ones for interdependent agents.

The experiments in three cooperative multi-agent domains demonstrate that MAHRM outperforms other baselines utilizing the same high-level prior knowledge.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) - The paper studies cooperative MARL problems where multiple agents interact to complete a common task.

- Reward Machines (RMs) - RMs are used to specify reward functions and incorporate prior knowledge of high-level events to facilitate more efficient MARL.

- Hierarchy of RMs - The paper proposes using a hierarchy of RMs to decompose complex tasks into simpler subtasks assigned to groups of agents. 

- Temporal abstraction - Higher levels in the RM hierarchy provide temporal abstractions of lower level events.

- Task decomposition - The hierarchy of RMs allows dynamic decomposition of the joint task into subtasks.

- Option space - Possible selections and assignments of subtasks are formalized as options. The RM hierarchy is used to define and constrain the option space.

- Policies - Policies at higher levels choose subtask options, while lowest level policies determine actions.

- Concurrent events - The proposed approach is designed to handle scenarios where events among agents can occur concurrently.

- Interdependent agents - The method can deal with interdependent agents where local state spaces would be too large.

In summary, key terms cover the MARL setting, use of hierarchical RMs for task decomposition, leveraging temporal abstraction and prior knowledge, policy definitions, and handling of concurrency and interdependence.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a hierarchical structure of propositions to represent the decomposition of a complex task. How does this hierarchy help reduce the size of reward machines compared to a flat decomposition? What are the limitations of the hierarchical decomposition?

2. The options defined in the paper assign subtasks to groups of agents. How does dynamic assignment of subtasks to agents help address interdependencies between agents? Does it introduce additional challenges compared to static assignment?  

3. The paper defines constraints on the option space to eliminate unreasonable options using the internal structure of reward machines. What specific constraints are defined and how do they help improve learning efficiency? Are there other potential constraints that could be included?

4. The policies are learned recursively in a hierarchical manner similar to hierarchical RL. What are the differences in how temporal abstraction is achieved compared to standard hierarchical RL methods? What are the advantages?

5. How does the calculation of discounted accumulated rewards differ between the lowest level policies and higher level policies? Why is this difference necessary?

6. One of the baselines is Decentralized Q-learning with Projected Reward Machines. What are the key limitations of using projected reward machines that the proposed method addresses?

7. Another baseline is Independent Q-learning with Reward Machines. What is the cause of non-stationarity when using this method and how does the proposed hierarchical approach alleviate it?  

8. The Modular framework baseline also utilizes the same prior knowledge. What prevents it from choosing the correct subtasks to execute under sparse rewards?

9. The complexity of domains evaluated increases from Navigation to MineCraft to Pass. What specific challenges emerge in the Pass domain that validates the capability of the method to handle complexity and interdependence?

10. The method relies extensively on predefined hierarchical structure and reward machines. What are promising directions to learn these components automatically from interactions with the environment?
