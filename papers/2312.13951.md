# [Typhoon: Thai Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13951)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are predominantly trained on English data and may lack understanding of other languages and cultures, including Thai.  
- Thai is a low-resource language with limited publicly available datasets for pretraining LLMs. Existing multilingual models have very little Thai data.  
- There is a need for Thai-specific LLMs that encapsulate Thai linguistic knowledge and cultural understanding.

Proposed Solution - Typhoon:
- Typhoon is a 7 billion parameter autoregressive LLM specifically tailored for Thai.
- It is adapted from Mistral-7B by further pretraining on a cleaned Thai subset of Common Crawl plus some English data.
- A Thai subword tokenizer is added to improve efficiency over GPT-4 by 2.62x.  
- Typhoon outperforms all other open-source Thai LLMs on ThaiExam, a new benchmark based on Thai national exams to evaluate cultural knowledge.
- An instruction-tuned version, Typhoon-Instruct, outperforms others on Thai instruction-following tasks.

Other Contributions:
- Methodology to extract and clean a Thai subset from Common Crawl at scale.
- ThaiExam benchmark to evaluate cultural knowledge. 
- Analysis of tradeoffs between full fine-tuning vs Low-Rank Adaptation for model adaption.
- Public release of model and benchmarks to enable further research.

The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art capabilities for open-source Thai LLMs both in terms of reasoning ability as well as instruction-following.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Typhoon, a 7 billion parameter Thai language model adapted from Mistral and pretrained on Thai data, which outperforms other open-source Thai models and achieves comparable performance to GPT-3.5 on Thai benchmarks while being over 2 times more efficient in tokenizing Thai text.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The development of Typhoon, a 7 billion parameter Thai language model adapted from Mistral-7B and further pretrained on a Thai dataset. 

2. The creation of ThaiExam, an evaluation benchmark for assessing Thai knowledge in language models, based on Thai national examinations.

3. Evaluations showing that Typhoon outperforms other open-source Thai language models on ThaiExam, instruction following tasks, and other NLP tasks. Its performance is comparable to GPT-3.5 on some tasks despite having fewer parameters.

4. An analysis of challenges and considerations when developing Thai language models, including data preparation, tokenization, and base model selection. 

5. The public release of Typhoon's weights to promote further research and development of Thai language models.

In summary, the main contribution is the development and thorough evaluation of Typhoon, a state-of-the-art open-source Thai language model, along with insights to guide future work on low-resource language modeling.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions various challenges in developing Thai language models such as lack of large-scale datasets and resources. Can you elaborate on some of the unique challenges for the Thai language compared to high-resource languages like English? 

2. The paper employs a data preparation methodology with four key steps - scaling the data, strict deduplication, rule-based/heuristic filtering, and incorporating English data. Can you walk through these steps in more detail and explain the rationale behind each one?

3. The choice of base model, training strategy, and batch size were explored in initial experiments. What were the key findings and decisions made for the final Typhoon model configuration based on these experiments? 

4. The paper argues that multilingual models may lack understanding of Thai culture and knowledge despite having some Thai data. How exactly does the Typhoon model aim to encapsulate more Thai knowledge compared to these models?

5. Can you explain in detail the motivation behind developing the ThaiExam benchmark and walk through the different examination sets it comprises? How is it different from existing benchmarks for evaluating Thai knowledge?

6. For instruction tuning, the paper employs both translated instruction datasets and self-instructed data. Can you compare and contrast these two data collection methodologies? What are the limitations of relying solely on translations?

7. The Thai AlpacaEval dataset was created manually by native Thai speakers. How does this process differ from simply translating the original English AlpacaEval? What unique considerations had to be made?

8. The paper evaluates on a diverse set of tasks including instruction following, translation, summarization and QA. Can you analyze and compare Typhoon's performance across these different tasks? Were there any surprising results?

9. The paper identifies several risks and limitations of language models like Typhoon. Can you expand on what some of these risks are and how the authors aim to mitigate them? 

10. The paper mentions several promising directions for future work such as utilizing larger Thai datasets and exploring larger base models. Can you suggest any other interesting future research directions that build upon this work?
