# [SADAS: A Dialogue Assistant System Towards Remediating Norm Violations   in Bilingual Socio-Cultural Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In today's globalized world, people from different cultural backgrounds often fail to meet behavioral expectations when communicating due to insufficient understanding of each other's social norms. This can lead to conflicts.
- Existing NLP systems struggle to understand the social factors in language and cannot provide real-time assistance for cross-cultural conversations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose the Socially-Aware Dialogue Assistant System (SADAS) to facilitate conversations between individuals with diverse cultural backgrounds. 
- SADAS has a novel architecture to (1) identify norm categories in the dialogue, (2) detect potential norm violations, (3) evaluate violation severity, (4) generate targeted remedies to rectify breaches, and (5) provide justifications.

Key Contributions:
- SADAS is the first real-time system to detect and remedy social norm violations in cross-cultural bilingual conversations.
- The authors conduct extensive experiments to select optimal modules for each task, providing empirical evidence to justify their choices.
- They build specialized applications like a mobile app and mixed reality interface on HoloLens 2 to demonstrate the system.
- Both automatic metrics and human evaluations are performed to validate SADAS's overall performance in facilitating conversations.
- The authors open-source the system to advance future research.

In summary, SADAS leverages state-of-the-art NLP techniques to provide real-time assistance for improving mutual understanding between interlocutors from different cultural backgrounds during conversations. Both the system design and evaluation methodology are key contributions.
