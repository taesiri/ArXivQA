# [Optimistic Safety for Linearly-Constrained Online Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05786)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies online convex optimization (OCO) with unknown linear constraints. In this setting, at each round the player chooses an action vector, suffers a loss according to an adversarially chosen convex loss function, and then receives noisy bandit feedback on whether their action violated a fixed but unknown linear constraint. The goal is to minimize regret compared to the best fixed action satisfying the constraints, while ensuring the constraints are never violated. 

Prior work achieved $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret with zero constraint violations. However, the best regret for OCO without constraints is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$, so there is a gap.

Proposed Solution: 
The key idea is "optimistic safety" - maintain optimistic (outer approximation) and pessimistic (inner approximation) estimates of the constraint set. Use the optimistic set to choose low regret actions and scale them into the pessimistic set to ensure safety.

Specifically, in each round:
1) Estimate constraints via least squares. 
2) Construct optimistic set (overestimates feasible set) and pessimistic set (underestimates feasible set).
3) Run an online optimization algorithm on optimistic set to get optimistic action.
4) Scale down optimistic action to maximum value that lies in pessimistic set.
5) Play scaled down action and update estimates.

This framework ensures safety via the pessimistic set while still optimizing for low regret via the optimistic set.

Main Contributions:
1) Propose above "optimistic safety" approach and prove it achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with high probability and zero constraint violations. Improves over prior $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ results using slightly stronger assumptions.

2) Show the algorithm gives $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ expected regret and zero expected constraint violation when constraints are stochastic. Comparable to algorithms that get $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and violation for stochastic constraints. 

3) Give computationally efficient version with $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret.

4) Empirically demonstrate improved performance over benchmarks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new algorithm called Optimistically Safe Online Convex Optimization (OSOCO) for online convex optimization problems with unknown linear constraints, achieving $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and zero constraint violation under slightly stronger assumptions than prior work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes two main contributions:

1. It provides the first algorithm for online convex optimization (OCO) under unknown linear constraints and noisy feedback that achieves Õ(√T) regret. Specifically, it gives an "optimistically safe" algorithm called OSOCO that attains Õ(d√T) regret while ensuring zero constraint violations with high probability. This improves upon previous algorithms that achieved Õ(T^{2/3}) regret for this setting.  

2. It shows how OSOCO can be adapted to handle OCO with stochastic linear constraints, where it achieves Õ(√T) expected regret and zero expected constraint violation per round. This compares favorably to prior algorithms for OCO with stochastic constraints that achieve Õ(√T) regret but have Õ(√T) cumulative constraint violation.

In summary, the main innovations are introducing a novel "optimistic safety" approach to OCO under constraints and providing algorithms with optimal regret and constraint violation guarantees under two distinct constraint models - unknown static constraints and stochastic constraints. The core idea is to maintain optimistic and pessimistic estimates of the constraints to balance exploration and exploitation.

The paper studies the problem of online convex optimization with unknown linear constraints, where the learner receives noisy bandit feedback on the constraints. The key ideas proposed are using "optimistic safety" via optimistic and pessimistic estimates of the constraints to ensure low regret and safety, and providing regret and constraint violation guarantees for this setting. Other related topics discussed are algorithms for OCO problems with nonconvex action sets and time-varying stochastic constraints. Terms like projection-free algorithms, safe learning, and computational efficiency also come up regarding algorithm design. So these would be some of the main keywords and terminology connected to this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The key novelty of this paper is the "optimistic safety" design paradigm. Can you explain in more detail how maintaining optimistic and pessimistic estimates of the constraints enables both low regret and safety? How does this differ fundamentally from previous approaches?

2) The algorithm runs an online optimization algorithm (denoted $\Ac$) over an optimistic estimate of the constraints. What properties does $\Ac$ need to satisfy for the overall approach to work (as formalized in Definition 1)? Why are these properties important? 

3) When terminating and restarting $\Ac$ in each phase, the paper claims there is only a "small cost" in doing so. Can you formalize what this cost is and why it is small, even though $\Ac$ may have regret guarantees that depend on knowing the time horizon $T$?

4) How does the bound on the scaling factor $\gamma_t$ in Lemma 1 ensure both low regret and safety? Why is it important that this scaling preserves the "direction" of the optimistic action?

5) The regret decomposition separates the analysis into a "cost of safety" and "optimistic regret." Intuitively, why does this decomposition make sense? What drives each of these terms?

6) For the zero expected violation guarantee, why is the constraint tightened by $\mu \mathbf{1}$? What impact does this tightening have on the other problem parameters and the regret bound?

7) The computationally efficient version uses a structured relaxation of the optimistic set. Explain how this relaxation enables an efficient online optimization algorithm and why it only increases the regret by a $\sqrt{d}$ factor.  

8) The HedgeDescent algorithm combines Hedge over a finite set of experts with Online Gradient Descent within each expert. Why is this combination suitable for the structured optimistic set? How do the regret guarantees compose?

9) Empirically, the paper shows improved performance over baselines, even in a "hard" setting. Why might optimistic safety be naturally robust, even when settings are intentionally challenging?

10) A limitation mentioned is extending the algorithm to a non-oblivious adversary. What challenges arise in this setting and how might optimistic safety provide a starting point to address them?
