# [MamMIL: Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Images with State   Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05160)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Whole slide images (WSIs) contain billions of pixels, making it challenging to apply deep learning for computational pathology tasks like cancer diagnosis. Obtaining patch-level annotations is infeasible and feeding the entire WSI into models leads to GPU memory limitations.  
- Prior work uses multiple instance learning (MIL) to extract features from small patches (instances) of the WSI and aggregate them for slide-level prediction. But these methods either assume instances are independent, limiting performance, or use Transformer self-attention, which has quadratic complexity unsuitable for large number of instances.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose MamMIL, a MIL framework that uses the recent Mamba state space model (SSM) to efficiently model dependencies between instances in a WSI while keeping linear complexity.
- Mamba extended to model bidirectional dependencies between instances with a bidirectional SSM (Bi-SSM) block. A 2D context-aware block (2D-CAB) incorporated to retain 2D spatial relationships lost when representing WSI as 1D sequence input to SSM.
- Multiple MIL-SSM modules stacked, each contains Bi-SSM and 2D-CAB blocks. Instance features aggregated and class token used as bag feature for slide-level prediction.

Main Contributions:
- First work to introduce Mamba SSM for efficient long sequence modeling into MIL framework for computational pathology. Enables modeling inter-instance dependencies for better WSI classification.
- Propose innovations like Bi-SSM and 2D-CAB to adapt Mamba for bidirectional dependency modeling and 2D spatial context retention in WSI MIL task.
- Experiments show MamMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing GPU memory requirements compared to Transformer-based MIL alternatives.

In summary, the paper develops an efficient and high-performing MIL solution for WSI analysis by innovatively adapting the Mamba model to incorporate domain-specific inductive biases. The proposed MamMIL framework sets a new benchmark and direction for MIL research in computational pathology.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes MamMIL, a multiple instance learning framework that utilizes Mamba, a linear-complexity state space model, to efficiently model instance dependencies in whole slide images for computational pathology.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It is the first work to introduce Mamba, a linear-complexity sequence modeling method, into the multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for whole slide image (WSI) classification. 

2. It proposes a bidirectional state space model (Bi-SSM) block to enable Mamba to model dependencies between instances in a bidirectional manner, overcoming Mamba's limitation of only unidirectional sequence modeling.

3. It designs a 2D context-aware block (2D-CAB) to incorporate 2D spatial relationships between instances into Mamba's 1D sequence modeling, avoiding the loss of 2D contextual information. 

4. Experiments show that the proposed MamMIL method achieves state-of-the-art performance on WSI classification while having a lower GPU memory footprint than Transformer-based MIL methods.

In summary, the main contribution is using Mamba to efficiently model instance dependencies for MIL-based WSI classification, and proposing techniques to adapt Mamba for this task. The method achieves strong performance with high efficiency.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the MamMIL method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a bidirectional state space model to enable modeling of bidirectional dependencies between instances. How does this compare to using something like a Transformer or graph neural network to model dependencies? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The 2D context-aware block is used to incorporate 2D spatial relationships into the instance features. Could you explain more about how this block works and how it enables modeling of 2D relationships from a 1D sequence input? 

3. What motivated the specific design choices for integrating Mamba into the MIL framework, like using the class token and instance shuffling? What alternatives were considered and what were the limitations?

4. How does MamMIL compare to other MIL methods in terms of computational complexity and memory requirements? What enables its efficiency compared to Transformer-based approaches?

5. Could MamMIL be extended to some kind of hierarchical or multi-scale architecture to model dependencies between instance groups or regions? What would be the challenges associated with this?

6. The ablation studies show shuffle operation has a big impact on performance. Why do you think this is the case? Does this indicate potential overfitting issues?

7. What other state space models besides Mamba could potentially be integrated into the MIL framework? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of using something else?

8. How suitable is MamMIL for deployment in a clinical setting? What practical considerations around model interpretation, robustness, etc would be important to address?

9. The method is evaluated on two datasets. How would you expect performance to vary on larger, more heterogeneous histopathology datasets? Would any modifications be needed?

10. How does MamMIL compare to other approaches in terms of interpretability or explainability? Could attention mechanisms be incorporated to provide instance-level or region-level explanations?
