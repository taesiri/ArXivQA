# [Mastering Complex Coordination through Attention-based Dynamic Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04245)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Dynamic Attention-based Graph MIX (DAGMIX). Instead of relying on a fully connected graph between agents, DAGMIX generates a sparse, dynamic graph at each time step based on an attention mechanism over the agents' observations. This optimized graph structure makes DAGMIX more suitable for large-scale tasks with many agents. The individual Q-values of the agents are then combined through operations on this dynamic graph, providing a more precise estimate of the global Q-value to guide learning. Experiments on challenges in the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) environment demonstrate that DAGMIX significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on complex tasks with many agents and asymmetric settings. The performance is comparable on simpler scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the dynamic graph over simply using attention or a fully connected graph. Overall, DAGMIX provides a reliable framework for coordinating large numbers of agents by capturing their intrinsic relationships through attention-based dynamic graphs.
