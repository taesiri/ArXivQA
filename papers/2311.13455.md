# [Generation of Explanations for Logic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13455)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents an in-depth exploration of a fortiori arguments, a complex form of deductive reasoning that compares the relative likelihood of two parallel scenarios. The goal is to assess the capability of large language models, specifically GPT-3.5-turbo, in interpreting, explaining, and even augmenting such arguments. A series of meticulously designed experiments are conducted, facilitated through prompting strategies. The model's proficiency is evaluated across diverse facets including argument identification, extraction of logical components, classification, property prediction, explanation generation, and data augmentation. While highlighting successes like property prediction, it also uncovers deficiencies in areas like argument recognition. A hybrid evaluation framework is proposed, combining automated metrics and manual assessment. Experimentation reveals that providing external information significantly enhances explanatory quality. Though facing constraints, this research makes valuable contributions in comprehensively evaluating state-of-the-art models on this multifaceted logical reasoning task, devising effective prompting techniques, and enriching the existing dataset through augmentation. It lays the groundwork for future advancements at the intersection of language, logic, and AI.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents research exploring the capability of the GPT-3.5 language model to interpret and explain complex logical arguments known as "a fortiori" arguments. These arguments make deductions by comparing the relative likelihood of two parallel scenarios. The research utilizes prompt engineering to guide GPT-3.5 through the intricate reasoning steps needed to understand these arguments. It evaluates the model's performance on tasks like identifying argument components, predicting implicit properties, and generating explanations. Though GPT-3.5 demonstrates promise, particularly in extracting argument elements and properties, it struggles with classification and formulating complete explanations. To enrich diversity, new arguments are generated using data augmentation techniques. While highlighting successes, the research also acknowledges limitations like inconsistent task alignment and subjectivity in human evaluation. It concludes by proposing future work around emergent models, dataset expansion, automated optimization, and knowledge distillation. Overall, this pioneering effort makes valuable contributions towards the automation of logical reasoning.
