# [Rethinking Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image   Classification: A Good Instance Classifier is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02249)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective instance-based MIL framework that can achieve strong performance on both instance-level and bag-level classification for whole slide image analysis? The key hypotheses behind their proposed approach are:1) Using instance-level weakly supervised contrastive learning can help learn good feature representations to separate positive and negative instances.2) Generating high-quality pseudo labels for instances through prototype learning can provide effective supervision for training a good instance classifier. 3) Jointly training the contrastive learning, prototype learning, and instance classifier in an iterative manner can enable them to improve each other and learn an efficient instance classifier for both instance-level and bag-level classification.The authors propose the INS framework to address this research question and test these hypotheses. The main novelty lies in the design of the instance-level weakly supervised contrastive learning, the prototype-based pseudo label generation, and the joint training strategy to integrate everything together.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes INS, an instance-level MIL framework that combines contrastive learning and prototype learning to effectively address both instance-level and bag-level classification tasks. - It proposes instance-level weakly supervised contrastive learning (IWSCL) for the first time in the MIL setting to learn good instance representations, better separating negative and positive instances in the feature space.- It proposes the Prototype-based Pseudo Label Generation (PPLG) strategy to generate high-quality pseudo labels for each instance through prototype learning. - It develops a joint training strategy for IWSCL, PPLG and the instance classifier, where they help improve each other through iterative optimization.- It utilizes the true negative instances from negative bags to guide the training of the instance classifier, IWSCL and PPLG, ensuring the framework iterates towards the right direction.- Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate INS achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both instance-level and bag-level classification tasks.In summary, the key innovation is the instance-level framework that leverages contrastive learning and prototype learning to effectively tackle the challenges of learning good instance representations and generating accurate pseudo instance labels in weakly supervised MIL. The joint training strategy and use of true negatives further improve the framework.
