# [Rethinking Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image   Classification: A Good Instance Classifier is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02249)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective instance-based MIL framework that can achieve strong performance on both instance-level and bag-level classification for whole slide image analysis? The key hypotheses behind their proposed approach are:1) Using instance-level weakly supervised contrastive learning can help learn good feature representations to separate positive and negative instances.2) Generating high-quality pseudo labels for instances through prototype learning can provide effective supervision for training a good instance classifier. 3) Jointly training the contrastive learning, prototype learning, and instance classifier in an iterative manner can enable them to improve each other and learn an efficient instance classifier for both instance-level and bag-level classification.The authors propose the INS framework to address this research question and test these hypotheses. The main novelty lies in the design of the instance-level weakly supervised contrastive learning, the prototype-based pseudo label generation, and the joint training strategy to integrate everything together.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes INS, an instance-level MIL framework that combines contrastive learning and prototype learning to effectively address both instance-level and bag-level classification tasks. - It proposes instance-level weakly supervised contrastive learning (IWSCL) for the first time in the MIL setting to learn good instance representations, better separating negative and positive instances in the feature space.- It proposes the Prototype-based Pseudo Label Generation (PPLG) strategy to generate high-quality pseudo labels for each instance through prototype learning. - It develops a joint training strategy for IWSCL, PPLG and the instance classifier, where they help improve each other through iterative optimization.- It utilizes the true negative instances from negative bags to guide the training of the instance classifier, IWSCL and PPLG, ensuring the framework iterates towards the right direction.- Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate INS achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both instance-level and bag-level classification tasks.In summary, the key innovation is the instance-level framework that leverages contrastive learning and prototype learning to effectively tackle the challenges of learning good instance representations and generating accurate pseudo instance labels in weakly supervised MIL. The joint training strategy and use of true negatives further improve the framework.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes an instance-level multiple instance learning framework called INS that combines contrastive learning and prototype learning to effectively address both instance-level and bag-level classification tasks in weakly supervised whole slide image analysis.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper presents a new multiple instance learning (MIL) framework called INS for weakly supervised whole slide image classification. It focuses on improving instance-level and bag-level classification through more effective feature learning and pseudo label generation compared to prior MIL methods.- Most prior MIL methods fall into two main categories - instance-based methods that use noisy pseudo labels, and attention-based bag methods that lack instance interpretability. This paper argues both have limitations, and proposes an alternative instance-based approach.- A key contribution is the use of instance-level weakly supervised contrastive learning (IWSCL), which is novel for MIL. This allows better separation of positive and negative instances in the feature space compared to unsupervised contrastive learning used in some prior works.- Another contribution is the prototype-based pseudo label generation (PPLG) strategy. This iteratively generates higher quality pseudo labels than simply inheriting the bag label like in many instance-based methods.- The joint training procedure for IWSCL, PPLG and the instance classifier is also novel. The components mutually improve each other in an iterative process guided by true negative instances. - Experiments across several datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over previous MIL techniques in both instance and bag classification tasks. This is a key strength over prior works.- An interesting analysis shows the method can provide interpretability on a difficult lymph node metastasis prediction task, identifying indicative pathological patterns. This demonstrates potential for knowledge discovery.Overall, the proposed INS framework presents an innovative instance-based approach for MIL that outperforms prior arts across important metrics. The joint learning process and demonstrations of interpretability are significant contributions to advancing weak supervision in histopathology image analysis.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Applying the proposed INS method to more medical image analysis tasks beyond histopathology, such as radiology image analysis. They suggest it could be a promising framework for various weakly supervised medical image analysis problems.- Exploring more advanced network architectures for the encoder and classifier modules in INS, such as Vision Transformers, to further improve performance.- Investigating how to best incorporate prior medical knowledge into the INS framework to guide the model training and improve interpretability.- Extending INS to the multi-instance multi-label learning setting, where there are multiple possible positive instance types and bag labels are not binary.- Developing theoretical understandings of why the proposed prototype learning and contrastive learning components are effective in the multiple instance learning setting.- Designing more complex sampling strategies when constructing the training batches to improve efficiency and performance of the contrastive learning module.- Applying INS to 3D histopathology image analysis problems using volumetric patches extracted from 3D whole slide images.So in summary, they highlight opportunities to apply INS to new tasks and modalities, integrate medical domain knowledge, scale to more complex labeling settings, refine the methodology, and develop theoretical justifications. Advancing research along these directions could further improve weakly supervised medical image analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes an instance-level multiple instance learning (MIL) framework called INS that utilizes contrastive learning and prototype learning to effectively perform both instance-level and bag-level classification of whole slide images (WSIs). The framework learns a good instance feature representation through a novel instance-level weakly supervised contrastive learning method, and generates accurate pseudo labels for instances via a prototype learning strategy. It uses true negative instances in the training set to guide the contrastive learning, prototype learning, and instance classifier training. Experiments on one synthetic and three real-world histopathology image datasets for various clinical prediction tasks show that INS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both instance-level and bag-level classification compared to previous MIL methods. The powerful instance classification ability also enables INS to perform interpretable analysis and discover new pathological patterns for difficult clinical tasks using only slide-level labels.
