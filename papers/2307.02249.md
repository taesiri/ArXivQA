# [Rethinking Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image   Classification: A Good Instance Classifier is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02249)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective instance-based MIL framework that can achieve strong performance on both instance-level and bag-level classification for whole slide image analysis? The key hypotheses behind their proposed approach are:1) Using instance-level weakly supervised contrastive learning can help learn good feature representations to separate positive and negative instances.2) Generating high-quality pseudo labels for instances through prototype learning can provide effective supervision for training a good instance classifier. 3) Jointly training the contrastive learning, prototype learning, and instance classifier in an iterative manner can enable them to improve each other and learn an efficient instance classifier for both instance-level and bag-level classification.The authors propose the INS framework to address this research question and test these hypotheses. The main novelty lies in the design of the instance-level weakly supervised contrastive learning, the prototype-based pseudo label generation, and the joint training strategy to integrate everything together.
