# [Security and Privacy Challenges of Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00888)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects covered in this paper:

Problem: 

Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive text generation capabilities. However, these powerful models also have inherent vulnerabilities related to privacy and security risks. Researchers have identified and demonstrated numerous attacks to exploit LLMs, suggesting an imperative need to understand, analyze and defend against potential threats to ensure safe, ethical and reliable deployment.  

Proposed Solution:

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the privacy and security issues in LLMs, spanning (1) various security attacks like jailbreaking, prompt injection, backdoor attacks and data poisoning attacks; and (2) privacy attacks like gradient leakage, membership inference attacks and personally identifiable information (PII) leakage. 

The authors detail the potential goals, attack methodologies and impact of these attacks. They then review existing and emerging defense strategies and mitigation techniques to protect against the characterized attacks. The analysis also extends to application-specific security and privacy risks in domains like healthcare, transportation and governance.

Main Contributions:

(1) Systematic analysis of representative privacy and security attacks on LLMs based on recent literature.

(2) Review of effectiveness and limitations of defense mechanisms against these attacks.  

(3) Outlining limitations of current attack/defense research and offering insights into future directions including:
(i) Developing robust detection and prevention techniques tailored to evolving LLM capabilities
(ii) Designing dynamic defense methods resilient to advanced attacks
(iii) Exploring multi-modal attacks to enable comprehensive privacy risk assessment
(iv) Establishing metrics to effectively evaluate attack and defense techniques.

In summary, this timely survey significantly contributes to the understanding of prevailing privacy and security research challenges associated with LLMs. The discussions and recommendations provide useful guidelines to enable reliable and safe deployment of LLMs across applications.
