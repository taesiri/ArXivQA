# [LIME: Localized Image Editing via Attention Regularization in Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09256)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces LIME, a novel method for localized image editing in diffusion models without needing additional user inputs or model retraining. LIME first identifies semantic segments in the input image using intermediate features from the pre-trained InstructPix2Pix model. It then determines the region of interest (RoI) for editing by combining these segments with cross-attention maps derived from the edit instruction. A key contribution is the proposed attention regularization technique that selectively reduces the influence of unrelated tokens within the RoI during the diffusion model's iterative denoising steps. This guides the model to focus edits precisely on the intended region. Experiments demonstrate that LIME enables more accurate, localized edits compared to prior state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark datasets, consistently improving the performance of base models like InstructPix2Pix and HIVE. A limitation is that LIME still relies on the capabilities of the base model, which can sometimes alter image styles. Overall, LIME advances localized editing in diffusion models without extra supervision, user inputs or model retraining.
