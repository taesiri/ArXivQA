# [Language-only Efficient Training of Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01998)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes LinCIR, a novel and efficient language-only training framework for zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR). LinCIR eliminates the need for expensive-to-collect image-text-image triplets by introducing a new self-supervision technique called self-masking projection (SMP). SMP projects the text embedding into the token space and replaces keywords with the projected embeddings to construct a new text input. The textual encoder extracts embeddings from the original and constructed texts, which are optimized to be similar via MSE loss. This approach allows training on diverse natural language captions rather than a restricted template text. Furthermore, LinCIR's text-only paradigm enables highly efficient and scalable training. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art ZS-CIR performance on multiple benchmarks while using fewer computational resources than prior works. Notably, LinCIR outperforms even supervised methods on FashionIQ and continues improving with larger vision transformer backbones, unlike other ZS-CIR techniques. Through both efficiency and effectiveness, LinCIR establishes a new state-of-the-art for practical ZS-CIR.
