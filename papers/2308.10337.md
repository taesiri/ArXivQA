# [Strata-NeRF : Neural Radiance Fields for Stratified Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10337)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we model complex 3D scenes with multiple hierarchical levels or "stratified" structure using a single neural radiance field? The key hypotheses seem to be:1) Current neural radiance field approaches like Mip-NeRF 360 struggle to jointly model scenes with multiple levels using a single network, resulting in artifacts and suboptimal novel views. 2) Conditioning the radiance field on discrete vector quantized (VQ) latent codes will allow a single network to better capture discontinuities and changes between levels in the scene structure.3) The proposed Strata-NeRF architecture with VQ latent conditioning will enable high-fidelity novel view synthesis for stratified scenes using a single network.The paper introduces a new dataset of synthetic stratified scenes and proposes the Strata-NeRF method to address the limitations of current NeRFs in modeling such hierarchies. The central research question is how to extend neural radiance fields to effectively represent multi-level scenes in a unified way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Strata-NeRF, a single neural radiance field that can implicitly model scenes with multiple hierarchical levels, or "strata". The key ideas are:- Introducing the concept of "stratified scenes" which have multiple levels of structure. This is common in real-world scenes like buildings.- Proposing a new synthetic dataset of stratified scenes with simple and complex geometries to analyze existing neural radiance field methods.- Developing Strata-NeRF which conditions the radiance field on vector quantized (VQ) latent codes that can represent the discrete transitions between levels in stratified scenes. This is achieved through two lightweight modules - the Latent Generator and Latent Router.- Showing through quantitative and qualitative results that Strata-NeRF can effectively model stratified scenes and generate high-fidelity novel views. It outperforms other methods like Mip-NeRF 360 on the proposed synthetic dataset.- Demonstrating the generalization capability of Strata-NeRF on real-world scenes from the RealEstate10K dataset, where it also establishes a new state-of-the-art.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a way to model complex real-world stratified scenes using a single neural radiance field in a memory efficient manner, through the use of VQ latent conditioning.
