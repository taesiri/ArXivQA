# [Specifying Genericity through Inclusiveness and Abstractness Continuous   Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15278)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing frameworks for annotating noun phrase (NP) genericity use discrete multi-class or binary schemes. These cannot capture the nuanced, continuous nature of genericity semantics. 
- Recent cognitive literature models genericity as continuous, aligning with the phenomenon's complex nature in linguistic theory.
- No current annotated dataset exists to capture fine-grained aspects of NP genericity. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel annotation framework grounded in linguistic theory to model NP genericity using two continuous dimensions: 
    1) Inclusiveness: captures quantificational aspect 
    2) Abstractness: captures whether the NP refers to a concrete entity.
- The dual goals are to examine if naive annotators' judgements align with linguistic theory and if the data can automatically identify levels of genericity for commonsense knowledge repositories.

Methodology:
- Crowd workers annotated inclusiveness and abstractness of 324 NPs on continuous scales.
- Compared annotations to existing binary labels on the dataset. 
- Analyzed agreement, prediction of binary labels, distributional patterns.

Key Results:
- Continuous annotations reliably predict binary labels, demonstrating validity.
- Analysis reveals phenomena from theory - different types of generics exhibit nuanced patterns.
- Framework suitable for non experts and captures subtleties lost in binary schemes.

Contributions:
- First annotated dataset with fine-grained genericity judgments.
- Validation of suitability for crowdsourcing complex semantic task.
- Linguistic analysis reveals new insights on phenomenon.
- Practical scheme to construct commonsense knowledge resources.

The summary covers the key details on the problem being addressed, the proposed annotation framework and methodology, analysis demonstrating its validity, and unique contributions it makes. It highlights how the work draws from and builds on linguistic theory while being simple enough for non-experts to provide reliable judgements on a complex semantic property.
