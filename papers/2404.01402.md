# [ContactHandover: Contact-Guided Robot-to-Human Object Handover](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01402)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Successful robot-to-human object handover requires the robot to maintain a stable grasp while ensuring the human receiver can easily and naturally grasp the object. This is challenging because the robot needs to (1) choose a stable grasp that leaves room for the human to grasp the object later, and (2) deliver the object in a pose that makes natural grasp areas on the object visible and reachable to the human receiver. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose ContactHandover, a two-phase robot-to-human handover system that uses predicted 3D human hand-object contact maps to guide both the grasping and delivery phases.

1. Contact-Guided Grasping Phase: 
   - Predict 6-DOF robot grasp candidates and a 3D human contact affordance map on the object.
   - Re-rank grasps by penalizing those that occlude more human contacts.
   - Execute highest ranked grasp that balances stability and available human contacts.

2. Object Delivery Phase:
   - Compute robot end-effector pose that minimizes human arm joint torques and displacements.
   - Maximizes visible and reachable human contact points close to human receiver.
   
Main Contributions:
- A contact-guided grasp selection method that considers both robot grasp stability and accommodating human grasp preferences.
- An object delivery method that computes a robot pose minimizing human effort while maximizing visible/reachable contacts.  
- Two benchmark metrics (visibility, reachability) to evaluate quality of a handover pose.
- Evaluated on 27 daily objects and showed improved handover visibility and reachability over baselines.

In summary, the key idea is to use predicted human hand-object contacts to guide both the grasping and delivery stages to enable easier and more natural handovers for the human receiver.
