# [Not just Birds and Cars: Generic, Scalable and Explainable Models for   Professional Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05703)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Previous computer vision models for professional visual recognition tasks like identifying bird species or car brands are task-specific, have limited scalability and generalizability. They tend to overfit on certain datasets like birds and cars, and do not perform well when applied to other professional domains like medicine, art, fashion etc. The authors identify the need for a generic, scalable and explainable solution that can handle the complexity of labels and tasks in professional recognition across diverse domains.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose Pro-NeXt, a biologically-inspired model that mimics the human visual hierarchy mechanism. It has a module called Gaze-Shift that progressively focuses on salient parts while retaining the context. This hierarchical separation of focal and contextual information enables both scalability through transformers and accuracy through CNNs. The intermediate features can also provide localization and segmentation without extra training.

Key Contributions:
1) Pro-NeXt is a generic framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across 12 datasets spanning 5 diverse professional domains including wildlife, vehicles, medicine, art and fashion.

2) Pro-NeXt demonstrates excellent scalability - increasing model size and computations consistently improves accuracy across tasks. 

3) Pro-NeXt features high explainability even without explicit supervision - the intermediate features alone provide reliable object detection and segmentation, outperforming prior specialized methods.

4) Analysis shows Pro-NeXt's inference mimics human perception, explaining its effectiveness. The work delivers new state-of-the-art in professional recognition while featuring scalability and explainability previously lacking in this domain.

In summary, this paper introduces a unified architecture for professional visual recognition that pushes the boundaries of performance, scalability and explainability to advance research in this complex domain.
