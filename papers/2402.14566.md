# [Self-supervised Visualisation of Medical Image Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14566)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Medical image datasets are growing rapidly in size and complexity. Tasks like data exploration, quality control, and annotation remain challenging with large batches of images.  
- Existing methods for visualizing high-dimensional datasets like t-SNE struggle to produce semantically meaningful 2D embeddings for medical images.

Methods:
- The paper proposes using t-SimCNE, a recently introduced self-supervised contrastive method for 2D visualisation of image datasets. 
- T-SimCNE uses data augmenations and a Siamese network to map augmented views of the same image close together in a 2D embedding space.
- The authors apply t-SimCNE to various medical image datasets like blood cell microscopy, histopathology slides, and dermatology images.
- They also explore the utility of rotational data augmentations, given that microscopy images have rotational symmetry.

Key Results:
- T-SimCNE produces semantically meaningful 2D visualizations that successfully separate different cell types, tissue types, and medical conditions.
- It outperforms standard dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE of raw images or pretrained CNN features.
- Additional rotational augmentations further improve visualization quality, especially for blood cell microscopy data.
- The embeddings reveal medically relevant subgroups and data artifacts not visible through standard techniques.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates the utility of self-supervised contrastive learning for visualizing medical imaging datasets.
- Shows that t-SimCNE can reveal clinically meaningful structure in embeddings.
- Suggests the importance of customized data augmentations that leverage domain knowledge about invariances.
- Overall, t-SimCNE is proposed as a useful tool for tasks like data exploration, quality control, and annotation for medical imaging datasets.
