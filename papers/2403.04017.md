# [Learning Guided Automated Reasoning: A Brief Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04017)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Learning Guided Automated Reasoning: A Brief Survey":

Problem:
Automated reasoning (AR) and automated theorem proving (ATP) systems are capable of solving complex mathematical and logical problems. However, they face the challenge of combinatorial explosion on difficult problems and have to make many heuristic choices regarding theory selection, lemma selection, inference steps, instantiations, clause splitting etc. Traditionally these were handcrafted based on human insights but mathematics is undecidable and such heuristics don't scale. 

Solution: 
This paper surveys techniques that use machine learning, especially statistical machine learning to guide the proof search in AR/ATP systems. The key idea is to learn from past successful and unsuccessful proof attempts to predict promising choices. The systems and techniques covered include:

- Early history of combining ML and ATP in systems like Automated Mathematician, Theo, HR, MaLARea etc.
- Mathematical knowledge representation using syntactic (terms, graphs), semantic (models) and neural methods like tree NNs, graph NNs.
- Premise selection using kNN, naive Bayes, decision trees, gradient boosted trees and graph neural networks.
- Guiding saturation-based ATPs like E, Vampire, iProver via clause selection using methods like ENIGMA, Deepire.
- Guiding tableaux provers like leanCoP using reinforcement learning.
- Guiding tactic-based ITPs like HOL4, Coq, Lean by predicting useful tactics.

Main Contributions:

- Comprehensive overview connecting early heuristic systems to modern ML guided ATP systems
- Analysis of clause guidance methods like signature dependence, conjecture dependence, layering with ATP loop.
- Comparison of ATP and ITP guidance highlighting tradeoffs like speed vs accuracy.
- Discussion of benefits and challenges of tactic-based ITP guidance.
- Summary of related problems like semantic modeling, knowledge graph embeddings, program synthesis etc.

The key future direction highlighted is combining statistical and neural methods with symbolic methods for better knowledge absorption and avoiding hallucination in emerging models like large language models. The overall goal is develop AI systems that keep learning and discovering new hard mathematical facts.
