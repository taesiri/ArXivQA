# [DelightfulTTS: The Microsoft Speech Synthesis System for Blizzard   Challenge 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12612)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to synthesize natural and high-quality speech from text. The authors approach this goal from two main perspectives:

1. Directly modeling and generating high sampling rate (48 kHz) waveform, which can convey more expression and prosody compared to lower sampling rates like 16kHz or 24kHz. 

2. Systematically modeling variation information in speech, including both explicit (speaker ID, language ID, pitch, duration) and implicit (utterance-level and phoneme-level prosody) factors, to improve expressiveness and naturalness. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that combining high sampling rate waveform generation with extensive modeling of variation factors will allow their system, called DelightfulTTS, to achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of naturalness and speaker similarity. The subjective evaluation results presented, showing performance on par with real recordings, support this hypothesis.
