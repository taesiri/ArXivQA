# [DelightfulTTS: The Microsoft Speech Synthesis System for Blizzard   Challenge 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12612)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to synthesize natural and high-quality speech from text. The authors approach this goal from two main perspectives:

1. Directly modeling and generating high sampling rate (48 kHz) waveform, which can convey more expression and prosody compared to lower sampling rates like 16kHz or 24kHz. 

2. Systematically modeling variation information in speech, including both explicit (speaker ID, language ID, pitch, duration) and implicit (utterance-level and phoneme-level prosody) factors, to improve expressiveness and naturalness. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that combining high sampling rate waveform generation with extensive modeling of variation factors will allow their system, called DelightfulTTS, to achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of naturalness and speaker similarity. The subjective evaluation results presented, showing performance on par with real recordings, support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing an end-to-end neural text-to-speech (TTS) system called DelightfulTTS that achieves high-quality speech synthesis. 

2. Generating speech directly at 48 kHz sampling rate to provide higher perceptual quality compared to lower sampling rates. This is achieved by predicting 16 kHz mel-spectrograms with the acoustic model and using the HiFiNet vocoder to generate 48 kHz waveform.

3. Modeling variation information systematically, including both explicit (speaker ID, language ID, pitch, duration) and implicit (utterance-level and phoneme-level prosody) factors. This improves expressiveness and naturalness. 

4. Using an improved Conformer architecture in the acoustic model to better capture local and global dependencies in the mel-spectrogram.

5. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Blizzard Challenge 2021, with the system's naturalness and similarity scores matching that of the original recordings.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a high-quality end-to-end TTS system with direct 48 kHz waveform generation and comprehensive modeling of variation information to achieve very natural sounding speech synthesis. The effectiveness is demonstrated by the top results on the Blizzard Challenge 2021.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper presents Microsoft's end-to-end neural text-to-speech system called DelightfulTTS for the Blizzard Challenge 2021. The system directly generates high-quality 48kHz audio by predicting 16kHz mel-spectrograms with an acoustic model and then generating waveform with a HiFi-GAN vocoder. It models variation information like prosody systematically to improve expressiveness and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the challenge.

In one sentence: Microsoft's DelightfulTTS system with direct 48kHz waveform generation and systematic variation modeling achieves state-of-the-art performance in Blizzard Challenge 2021.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other TTS research:

- It focuses on improving naturalness and quality of synthesized speech. Many recent TTS papers have focused more on efficiency and speed. This paper puts quality as the top priority.

- It generates audio directly at 48kHz sampling rate. Most other TTS systems use lower sampling rates like 16kHz or 24kHz. The higher 48kHz allows greater frequency range to capture nuances. 

- It systematically models both explicit (e.g. pitch, duration) and implicit (e.g. prosody) variation information. Many papers focus on just one or two types of variation. Modeling variation comprehensively helps with expressiveness.

- It uses an improved Conformer architecture in the acoustic model. Conformer captures both local and global interactions well for TTS. Many papers still use Transformer or LSTM architectures.

- It balances the difficulty between acoustic model and vocoder by predicting 16kHz spectrogram and upsampling to 48kHz waveform. Most other 48kHz TTS systems put the upsampling burden fully on the acoustic model.

- The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on Blizzard Challenge 2021, matching the naturalness of real recordings. This shows the effectiveness of the methods used.

In summary, the focus on quality, direct 48kHz generation, systematic variation modeling, Conformer architecture, and excellent results help this paper advance the state-of-the-art in expressive and natural sounding TTS. The comprehensive approach is a key difference from prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further improving the modeling of variation information on multi-speaker, multi-lingual, multi-style datasets. The authors suggest investigating the capability of their style transfer approach across different languages and speakers.

- Exploring other aspects beyond just prosody modeling to improve expressiveness, such as emotion and speaking style transfer. 

- Investigating the use of their proposed techniques on other modalities beyond just speech, such as for multimodal synthesis.

- Continuing to improve robustness, controllability and naturalness through better modeling of linguistics, prosody, and acoustic features.

- Exploring ways to improve training efficiency and reduce computational complexity to make their approaches more practical.

- Validating their methods on more languages, datasets, and tasks beyond the Blizzard Challenge.

- Combining insights from their approach with other recent advancements in neural TTS to develop further improved end-to-end TTS systems.

In summary, the main future directions are centered around extending their prosody modeling framework to handle more variation factors, applying it to new settings, improving model efficiency and robustness, and combining it with other state-of-the-art TTS techniques.

This paper describes Microsoft's end-to-end neural text-to-speech system called DelightfulTTS for the Blizzard Challenge 2021. The goal is to synthesize high-quality and natural sounding speech. They approach this by directly generating 48kHz waveforms to capture more acoustic details, and by modeling variation information like pitch, duration, speaker ID, etc. to improve prosody and naturalness.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper describes Microsoft's text-to-speech (TTS) system called DelightfulTTS for the Blizzard Challenge 2021. The goal was to synthesize natural and high-quality speech from text. They approached this in two main ways: First, they directly generated audio waveforms at 48kHz sampling rate instead of lower rates like 16kHz. The higher 48kHz rate allows a larger frequency range to convey expression and prosody. Second, they systematically modeled variation information in the speech, including speaker ID, language ID, pitch, duration, and utterance/phoneme-level prosody. This improves expressiveness and naturalness. 

For the 48kHz generation, they predict a 16kHz mel-spectrogram with the acoustic model, then use their HiFiNet vocoder to generate the 48kHz waveform. This balances the difficulties between the acoustic model and vocoder. To model variation, they use different techniques: lookup embeddings for speaker/language ID, extract and predict pitch/duration, and extract and predict utterance/phoneme-level prosody vectors. Their acoustic model uses an improved Conformer architecture. In evaluations, their system achieved the highest naturalness and speaker similarity scores among participants, matching the scores for real recordings. This demonstrates their modeling of 48kHz audio and speech variation information improves perception quality and naturalness.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper describes an end-to-end neural text-to-speech (TTS) system called DelightfulTTS for synthesizing high quality 48kHz speech from text. The system consists of an acoustic model to generate 16kHz mel-spectrograms from text and a vocoder called HiFiNet to generate 48kHz waveforms from the mel-spectrograms. The acoustic model uses an improved Conformer architecture to model both local and global dependencies in the mel-spectrograms. It also employs a variance adaptor to model both explicit (speaker ID, language ID, pitch, duration) and implicit (utterance-level and phoneme-level prosody) variation information to improve expressiveness. The vocoder takes the 16kHz mel-spectrograms from the acoustic model and converts them to high fidelity 48kHz waveforms. According to the evaluation, DelightfulTTS achieves state-of-the-art naturalness and similarity to original speaker, demonstrating its effectiveness in synthesizing high quality and natural sounding speech.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper describes an end-to-end neural text-to-speech (TTS) system called DelightfulTTS submitted to the Blizzard Challenge 2021 competition. The main goal is to synthesize high-quality and natural sounding speech from input text. The paper approaches this in two main ways:

1. Directly generating high sampling rate (48kHz) waveforms, as higher sampling rates can convey more prosody and expression. They generate 16kHz mel-spectrograms with the acoustic model and upsample to 48kHz with the vocoder, balancing the difficulties.
