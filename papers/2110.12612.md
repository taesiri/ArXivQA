# [DelightfulTTS: The Microsoft Speech Synthesis System for Blizzard   Challenge 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12612)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to synthesize natural and high-quality speech from text. The authors approach this goal from two main perspectives:

1. Directly modeling and generating high sampling rate (48 kHz) waveform, which can convey more expression and prosody compared to lower sampling rates like 16kHz or 24kHz. 

2. Systematically modeling variation information in speech, including both explicit (speaker ID, language ID, pitch, duration) and implicit (utterance-level and phoneme-level prosody) factors, to improve expressiveness and naturalness. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that combining high sampling rate waveform generation with extensive modeling of variation factors will allow their system, called DelightfulTTS, to achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of naturalness and speaker similarity. The subjective evaluation results presented, showing performance on par with real recordings, support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing an end-to-end neural text-to-speech (TTS) system called DelightfulTTS that achieves high-quality speech synthesis. 

2. Generating speech directly at 48 kHz sampling rate to provide higher perceptual quality compared to lower sampling rates. This is achieved by predicting 16 kHz mel-spectrograms with the acoustic model and using the HiFiNet vocoder to generate 48 kHz waveform.

3. Modeling variation information systematically, including both explicit (speaker ID, language ID, pitch, duration) and implicit (utterance-level and phoneme-level prosody) factors. This improves expressiveness and naturalness. 

4. Using an improved Conformer architecture in the acoustic model to better capture local and global dependencies in the mel-spectrogram.

5. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Blizzard Challenge 2021, with the system's naturalness and similarity scores matching that of the original recordings.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a high-quality end-to-end TTS system with direct 48 kHz waveform generation and comprehensive modeling of variation information to achieve very natural sounding speech synthesis. The effectiveness is demonstrated by the top results on the Blizzard Challenge 2021.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper presents Microsoft's end-to-end neural text-to-speech system called DelightfulTTS for the Blizzard Challenge 2021. The system directly generates high-quality 48kHz audio by predicting 16kHz mel-spectrograms with an acoustic model and then generating waveform with a HiFi-GAN vocoder. It models variation information like prosody systematically to improve expressiveness and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the challenge.

In one sentence: Microsoft's DelightfulTTS system with direct 48kHz waveform generation and systematic variation modeling achieves state-of-the-art performance in Blizzard Challenge 2021.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other TTS research:

- It focuses on improving naturalness and quality of synthesized speech. Many recent TTS papers have focused more on efficiency and speed. This paper puts quality as the top priority.

- It generates audio directly at 48kHz sampling rate. Most other TTS systems use lower sampling rates like 16kHz or 24kHz. The higher 48kHz allows greater frequency range to capture nuances. 

- It systematically models both explicit (e.g. pitch, duration) and implicit (e.g. prosody) variation information. Many papers focus on just one or two types of variation. Modeling variation comprehensively helps with expressiveness.

- It uses an improved Conformer architecture in the acoustic model. Conformer captures both local and global interactions well for TTS. Many papers still use Transformer or LSTM architectures.

- It balances the difficulty between acoustic model and vocoder by predicting 16kHz spectrogram and upsampling to 48kHz waveform. Most other 48kHz TTS systems put the upsampling burden fully on the acoustic model.

- The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on Blizzard Challenge 2021, matching the naturalness of real recordings. This shows the effectiveness of the methods used.

In summary, the focus on quality, direct 48kHz generation, systematic variation modeling, Conformer architecture, and excellent results help this paper advance the state-of-the-art in expressive and natural sounding TTS. The comprehensive approach is a key difference from prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further improving the modeling of variation information on multi-speaker, multi-lingual, multi-style datasets. The authors suggest investigating the capability of their style transfer approach across different languages and speakers.

- Exploring other aspects beyond just prosody modeling to improve expressiveness, such as emotion and speaking style transfer. 

- Investigating the use of their proposed techniques on other modalities beyond just speech, such as for multimodal synthesis.

- Continuing to improve robustness, controllability and naturalness through better modeling of linguistics, prosody, and acoustic features.

- Exploring ways to improve training efficiency and reduce computational complexity to make their approaches more practical.

- Validating their methods on more languages, datasets, and tasks beyond the Blizzard Challenge.

- Combining insights from their approach with other recent advancements in neural TTS to develop further improved end-to-end TTS systems.

In summary, the main future directions are centered around extending their prosody modeling framework to handle more variation factors, applying it to new settings, improving model efficiency and robustness, and combining it with other state-of-the-art TTS techniques.
