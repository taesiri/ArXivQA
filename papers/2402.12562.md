# [Dynamic Pricing and Learning with Long-term Reference Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12562)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies a dynamic pricing problem where customer demand depends not only on the current price but also on a reference price formed based on past prices. 
- Commonly used reference price models like exponential smoothing capture short-term effects. This paper proposes a new averaging reference mechanism (ARM) to model longer-term reference price effects.

Key Contributions:
- Shows fixed pricing can be highly suboptimal under ARM unlike under exponential smoothing models. The gap can be linear in time horizon.
- Proves (near-)optimality of markdown pricing under ARM. This matches practical intuition and provides justification for widespread industry practice of markdowns.
- For linear demand model, characterizes structure of near-optimal markdown policy. Shows it can be parameterized by a two-dimensional vector which also characterizes local greedy price.
- Develops learning algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret under ARM with linear demand, using ideas of learning the policy parameter and greedy prices. Prior approaches for exponential smoothing models are not applicable.
- Matches lower bound to show dependence on price range is unavoidable.

Proposed Solution - Learning Algorithm:
- Learns estimates of greedy prices for two reference prices to estimate policy parameter. Uses bandit convex optimization.
- Resets reference price during learning using a novel steering method to facilitate this estimation.
- With estimated parameter, computes near-optimal markdown policy. Applies it for remaining horizon.
- Achieves Ã•(sqrt(T)) regret under ARM with linear demand. Significantly advances state of the art.

In summary, the paper makes both modeling and algorithmic contributions for studying longer-term reference price effects in dynamic pricing, with theoretical and practical implications. The proposed learning algorithm is efficient and near-optimal.
