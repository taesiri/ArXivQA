# [Maximum Entropy Model Correction in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17855)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new model-based reinforcement learning approach called Maximum Entropy Model Correction (MaxEnt MoCo) that helps alleviate issues with model error. The key idea is to correct the approximate learned model using a maximum entropy density estimation method to make its state transition distributions more consistent with the true environment dynamics. This is done by querying the true dynamics to obtain next-state expectations for a set of basis functions, and then minimizing the KL divergence between the corrected model and the original model subject to matching those expectation constraints. Algorithms called MoCoVI and MoCoDyna are introduced that iteratively update the basis functions using past value functions to improve performance. Theoretical analysis shows these algorithms can utilize the approximate model to accelerate convergence towards the true value function compared to model-free methods, while remaining robust to model inaccuracies. Experiments confirm the faster convergence benefits in practice. Overall, the MaxEnt MoCo framework provides a way to get the best of both model-based and model-free reinforcement learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes maximum entropy model correction in reinforcement learning to reduce the adverse impact of model errors by correcting approximate next-state distributions, and introduces theoretical analysis and algorithms that effectively utilize the corrected model while converging to the true value function.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a method called MaxEnt Model Correction (MoCo) to correct an approximate model in reinforcement learning using maximum entropy density estimation. The key ideas are:

1) Given an approximate model $\hat{p}$ and a set of basis functions $\phi_i$, the agent can query the true environment dynamics $p$ to get expected values $\bar{\phi_i} = \mathbb{E}_{x' \sim p(\cdot | x,a)}[\phi_i(x')]$. 

2) For each state-action pair $(x,a)$, the approximate next-state distribution $\hat{p}(\cdot | x,a)$ is corrected to a new distribution $\bar{p}(\cdot | x,a)$ by minimizing the KL divergence from $\hat{p}(\cdot | x,a)$ subject to matching the expected values of basis functions under $\bar{p}$. This is done via maximum entropy density estimation.

3) The corrected model $\bar{p}$ can then be used with planning algorithms like value iteration. Even with an imperfect model $\hat{p}$, the corrected model $\bar{p}$ allows faster convergence to the optimal value function compared to model-free algorithms.

4) The authors propose Model Correcting Value Iteration (MoCoVI) which uses past value functions as basis functions, and show its improved convergence over value iteration. They also propose a sample-based algorithm MoCoDyna.

In summary, the key contribution is a principled model correction method based on maximum entropy, which can accelerate learning compared to model-free algorithms by effective utilization of an imperfect model.
