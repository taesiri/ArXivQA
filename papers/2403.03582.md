# [Design of an Open-Source Architecture for Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03582)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural machine translation (NMT) model development involves multiple complex stages, making it challenging for newcomers to the field. 
- Existing NMT tools like OpenNMT have extensive capabilities but can have a steep learning curve.
- There is a growing need for sustainable NMT practices to reduce carbon emissions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces adaptNMT, an open-source application built on OpenNMT and SentencePiece.
- It provides an intuitive interface and workflows to simplify NMT model building, translation, and deployment.
- Users can customize models (RNN/Transformer) and parameters through the GUI without coding.
- It has easy split, train, translate and evaluate capabilities along with visualization for monitoring.
- The tool can utilize local GPUs or Google Cloud for scalable infrastructure.
- To encourage sustainable models, it generates a "green report" with energy usage and CO2 emissions.

Main Contributions:
- An accessible cloud-based platform for end-to-end NMT, particularly useful for newcomers.  
- Simplified workflows for building, training and deploying customized NMT models.
- Support for model ensembles and multiple translation evaluation metrics.
- Real-time training visualization and extensive logging capabilities.
- "Green report" feature to track environmental impact, promoting eco-friendly model development.
- Open-source availability to benefit the wider NMT research community.

The paper introduces an architecture aimed at democratizing and promoting sustainable neural machine translation. By simplifying workflows and providing an intuitive interface, adaptNMT makes state-of-the-art NMT more accessible.
