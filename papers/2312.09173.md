# [Safe Motion Planning for Quadruped Robots Using Density Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09173)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a motion planning framework for quadruped robots using density functions. The key idea is to decompose the locomotion problem into a high-level density planner that generates a safe reference trajectory by constructing an analytical density function with obstacles encoded as zero density regions. This density trajectory is then used by a model predictive controller (MPC) to generate optimal foot reaction forces to track the trajectory, while avoiding obstacles. Finally, a proportional-derivative (PD) controller converts the forces to joint torques for trajectory tracking. The density function is designed to satisfy almost everywhere convergence to handle non-trivial environments. Simulations in Gazebo demonstrate successful obstacle avoidance and convergence by integrating the proposed density planner with the Open Control Studio 2 (OCS2) framework's MPC and PD for a quadruped model. Key benefits are the intuitive encoding of obstacles through density, systematically generating feedback plans, and leveraging existing controllers. Limitations are assuming a holonomic system in the density constructions and limited handling of rough terrain. Future work includes smoothening generated trajectories and extending to non-holonomic systems for off-road navigation.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Safely navigating legged robots such as quadrupeds in complex environments with obstacles is challenging. Although sampling-based planners can enforce safety through collision checks, this can be inefficient. Control barrier functions can provide safety guarantees but are difficult to design.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a motion planning framework for quadrupeds based on density functions. 
- Density functions provide an intuitive way to represent safety constraints and environment occupancy.
- The planning problem is decomposed into a high-level density-based planner and a model predictive controller (MPC). 
- The high-level plan uses an analytically constructed density function that enables obstacle avoidance and convergence to the goal. The plan is obtained as the gradient of the density function.
- The MPC optimizes the trajectory and computes foot reaction forces to track the high-level plan. A PID controller then generates joint torques.

Main Contributions:
- An analytical construction method for density functions that can represent arbitrary unsafe sets and generate safe trajectories
- Integration of density-based planning with MPC and controllers for quadruped locomotion 
- Simulation and hardware experiments demonstrating safe quadruped navigation amidst obstacles using the proposed density-based motion planning framework

In summary, the key innovation is the use of analytically constructed density functions for high-level planning to enable safe navigation. This density-based plan is then integrated with lower-level controllers tailored for quadruped dynamics and constraints. The complete framework is validated in simulation and hardware.
