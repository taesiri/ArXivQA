# [Safe Motion Planning for Quadruped Robots Using Density Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09173)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a motion planning framework for quadruped robots using density functions. The key idea is to decompose the locomotion problem into a high-level density planner that generates a safe reference trajectory by constructing an analytical density function with obstacles encoded as zero density regions. This density trajectory is then used by a model predictive controller (MPC) to generate optimal foot reaction forces to track the trajectory, while avoiding obstacles. Finally, a proportional-derivative (PD) controller converts the forces to joint torques for trajectory tracking. The density function is designed to satisfy almost everywhere convergence to handle non-trivial environments. Simulations in Gazebo demonstrate successful obstacle avoidance and convergence by integrating the proposed density planner with the Open Control Studio 2 (OCS2) framework's MPC and PD for a quadruped model. Key benefits are the intuitive encoding of obstacles through density, systematically generating feedback plans, and leveraging existing controllers. Limitations are assuming a holonomic system in the density constructions and limited handling of rough terrain. Future work includes smoothening generated trajectories and extending to non-holonomic systems for off-road navigation.
