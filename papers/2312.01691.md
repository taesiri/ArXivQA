# [Estimating Coronal Mass Ejection Mass and Kinetic Energy by Fusion of   Multiple Deep-learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01691)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new deep learning based method called DeepCME to estimate the mass and kinetic energy of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using LASCO C2 image data. DeepCME fuses three convolutional neural network models - ResNet50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2 - to extract features from C2 base-difference images of CMEs and make predictions. Experiments using CME data from 1996-2020 demonstrate that DeepCME outperforms the individual component models, achieving the lowest mean relative error of 0.013 and 0.009 in estimating CME mass and kinetic energy respectively. This is the first known use of deep learning for CME mass and energy prediction. The results show promise that machine learning can help better understand CME dynamics. Further efforts are needed to apply deep learning to predict other CME attributes. Overall, this paper presents an initial step toward utilizing artificial intelligence for improved CME characterization and forecasting.
