# [Just Ask for Calibration: Strategies for Eliciting Calibrated Confidence   Scores from Language Models Fine-Tuned with Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14975)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper evaluates methods for extracting well-calibrated confidence scores from reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) fine-tuned language models (LMs) like ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Claude. It finds that directly prompting these models to verbalize a probability or linguistic expression of likelihood (e.g. "very likely") results in better-calibrated confidence scores than using the model's own conditional probabilities. Having the model generate multiple answer options further improves the calibration. Overall, verbalized confidences reduce the expected calibration error by over 50% compared to conditional probabilities for prominent RLHF LMs across question answering datasets. The paper demonstrates that models can express numerical probabilities surprisingly well. It also shows that chain-of-thought prompting does not meaningfully enhance calibration. The key limitations are the focus on factual recall problems and lack of model implementation details. In summary, RLHF LMs can directly estimate well-calibrated confidences when explicitly asked, without any fine-tuning, by verbalizing their certainty.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates methods for extracting well-calibrated confidence scores from reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, finding that directly prompting the model to verbalize a probability or linguistic expression of likelihood produces better calibration than using the model's conditional probabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is showing that large reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) language models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Claude can often directly verbalize better-calibrated confidence scores (either as numerical probabilities or linguistic expressions like "highly likely") than the models' own conditional probabilities. Specifically, the key findings include:

1) RLHF-LMs can verbalize well-calibrated confidence scores without any fine-tuning to explicitly learn calibration or verbalization. 

2) Prompting the model to produce multiple guesses before assessing confidence generally improves calibration, similar to findings in human psychology.

3) Numerical probability verbalizations are often better calibrated than linguistic expressions for these models.

4) Chain-of-thought prompting does not clearly improve calibration.

5) There are significant differences between models in ability to verbalize calibration, with GPT-3.5 and Claude-2 stronger than GPT-4 and Llama-2-70B-Chat.

In summary, the paper introduces and evaluates a promising new method for extracting better-calibrated confidence estimates from popular RLHF language models by prompting them to verbalize their uncertainty.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Calibration - The paper focuses on evaluating how well the confidence scores produced by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) language models correlate with the actual likelihood the models' predictions are correct.

- Verbalized probabilities - The paper proposes and evaluates methods to elicit calibrated confidence scores by having models directly verbalize and express their confidence levels rather than relying only on the models' internal probability estimates.  

- Expected calibration error (ECE) - A standard metric used to quantify how miscalibrated a model's confidence estimates are. The paper evaluates various methods using ECE.

- TriviaQA, SciQ, TruthfulQA - Factual question answering datasets used to evaluate the calibration of different models and confidence estimation methods.

- ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude - State-of-the-art RLHF language models evaluated in the paper in terms of their calibration and verbalized confidence estimates.

- Considering multiple answers - Technique explored where models generate multiple possible answers before expressing confidence, which is found to improve calibration, similar to findings in human psychology.

In summary, the key focus is on evaluating and improving calibration of confidence scores from RLHF models using verbalization methods. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes eliciting calibrated confidence scores from language models through verbalization rather than using the model's conditional probabilities. What are some potential advantages and disadvantages of this verbalization approach compared to using conditional probabilities?

2. The paper finds that having the model generate multiple guesses before stating a confidence score improves calibration, similar to findings in human psychology research. What mechanisms might explain this effect both for humans and for language models? 

3. The paper shows temperature scaling also generally improves calibration of verbalized confidence scores. How does temperature scaling interact with the verbalization methods proposed? Could the calibration improvements from verbalization and temperature scaling be complementary?  

4. The paper demonstrates the verbalization approach using common benchmark QA datasets focused on factual knowledge. How might the effectiveness of verbalized confidence scores compare on more reasoning-focused datasets? What adaptations might be needed?

5. The prompts used to elicit verbalized confidence scores are quite simple and standardized. Could more complex prompting strategies further improve the calibration of verbalized confidence? What prompt variants could be explored?  

6. The paper studies several major language models but does not fine-tune them specifically for verbalizing confidence. How much could directly fine-tuning the models to optimize verbalized calibration improve results? What training frameworks could enable this?

7. The paper studies short-form question answering settings. Could the verbalization approach be extended to longer-form text generation by breaking down generation into question answering steps? How could this be implemented?

8. What factors account for the differences seen in calibration and verbalization capabilities between the various language models studied? How could model architecture, data, or training approach impact verbal calibration skills?

9. The paper relies on human surveys and optimization from held-out data to map linguistic expressions of uncertainty to probability values. Could this mapping be learned automatically from data instead? What methods could enable this?

10. How robust is the verbalization approach to different ways uncertainty could be expressed linguistically across domains and applications? Could the set of verbal expressions be expanded and standardized to cover more cases?
