# [Controllable Mesh Generation Through Sparse Latent Point Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07938)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How to design an efficient and controllable generative model for high-quality 3D mesh generation?

The key points are:

1. The authors propose to use point clouds as an intermediate representation for mesh generation. This avoids the challenges of directly generating meshes, such as irregular structure and inconsistent topology.

2. They further encode the point clouds into a sparse set of latent points with features. This representation enables more efficient and controllable mesh generation compared to directly generating dense point clouds. 

3. Two denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are trained in the space of the sparse latent points to model the distribution of point positions and features respectively.

4. Sampling from this learned latent space allows fast and controllable mesh generation. The sparse latent points explicitly control the overall structure while the features control local details.

5. Experiments show their method, SLIDE, generates higher quality and more diverse meshes compared to baselines. It also enables control over shape structure and semantics without part annotations.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that modeling point clouds first, and then distilling them into a sparse latent space leads to an efficient and controllable approach for high-quality mesh generation. The paper presents SLIDE as a way to achieve this.
