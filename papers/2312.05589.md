Problem Statement:
This paper provides a comprehensive review of hybrid and ensemble deep learning approaches for natural language processing (NLP). It discusses the need for using ensemble techniques to combine multiple deep learning models, in order to enhance the performance across diverse NLP tasks by capitalizing on the strengths of different architectures while mitigating their weaknesses.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper systematically examines the applications of hybrid and ensemble techniques across major NLP tasks - sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, question answering, text classification & generation, speech recognition, summarization and language modeling. For each task, key deep learning models like RNNs, CNNs, LSTMs and BERT are analyzed, along with their integration using ensemble methods like bagging, boosting and stacking.

Main Contributions:
- Delineates popular deep learning architectures including RNNs, CNNs, LSTMs and BERT with analysis of their working and performance on NLP tasks.
- Discusses the rationale behind using hybrid and ensemble approaches to combine complementary strengths of diverse neural models. 
- Provides a structured overview of ensemble techniques leveraged in NLP like bagging, boosting and stacking.
- Explores the implementation of hybrid neural combinations across major NLP applications.
- Highlights computational challenges like overhead and overfitting as well as trade-offs between model performance and interpretability.

In summary, the paper offers an extensive review of hybrid and ensemble deep learning for NLP, systematically covering relevant techniques, architectures, applications and associated challenges to provide an invaluable reference for anyone aiming to advance NLP using these synergistic approaches.
