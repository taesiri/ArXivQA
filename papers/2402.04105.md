# [Measuring Implicit Bias in Explicitly Unbiased Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit bias tests but may still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases.  
- Measuring such implicit biases is challenging since LLMs are increasingly proprietary so internal states like embeddings may not be accessible.
- Implicit biases matter most if they influence actual decisions these systems make.

Solution:
- The authors introduce two new measures inspired by psychology:
  - LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias: A prompt-based method to reveal implicit biases. 
  - LLM Decision Bias: Detects subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks.
- These measures are designed to be completely prompt-based so they can be applied to proprietary LLMs. 
- The decision prompts are tailored to be less socially sensitive and highlight comparison between options, based on findings that implicit biases in humans are most predictive in relative contexts.

Key Contributions:
- Widespread implicit biases and discriminatory behaviors were found in 6 LLMs across 4 domains and 21 categories, including concerning cases like associating "black" with negative words.
- LLM IAT Bias correlates with embedding measures but better predicts downstream LLM Decision Bias.
- Focusing on relative decisions is critical to eliciting biases.
- The psychology-inspired prompt engineering provides an effective framework to uncover nuanced biases even in models that appear explicitly unbiased.

In summary, this work showcases how insights from psychology can further advance bias measurement in LLMs beyond current benchmarks. The proposed methods unveil subtle but impactful biases that still persist despite alignment efforts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces two new methods inspired by psychology - LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias and LLM Decision Bias - to measure implicit biases and discriminatory behaviors in large language models, and finds pervasive human-like stereotype biases across multiple models despite improvements in explicit bias.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing LLM IAT Bias: a prompt-based technique that captures implicit biases in large language models (LLMs). 

2. Proposing LLM Decision Bias: a behavioral measure that captures discriminatory decisions in LLMs.

3. Identifying widespread implicit biases and discriminatory behaviors in 4 social domains (race, gender, religion, health) across 21 categories in 6 LLMs. 

4. A case study on GPT-4 showing that LLM IAT Bias correlates with embedding-based measures but better predicts LLM Decision Bias.

5. Showcasing how psychology can inspire new approaches to assessing biases in LLMs, by drawing on concepts like explicit vs implicit bias and absolute vs relative evaluations.

The key ideas are using prompt engineering to measure previously overlooked implicit biases in LLMs, even proprietary models, and showing these biases translate to discriminatory decisions in relative contexts. The approach is inspired by decades of psychology research on human social biases.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Implicit bias - A subtle, often unconscious form of bias that stands in contrast to explicit bias. The paper introduces methods to measure implicit biases in large language models.

- Large language models (LLMs) - Advanced natural language AI systems like GPT-3 and GPT-4 that the paper studies for implicit biases.  

- LLM Implicit Association Test (LLM IAT) - A new prompt-based method proposed in the paper for quantifying implicit biases in LLMs. Inspired by psychology's Implicit Association Test for humans. 

- LLM Decision Bias - Another new measure proposed to detect discriminatory behaviors in decision-making by LLMs. Together with LLM IAT Bias allows assessing biases and their behavioral consequences.  

- Explicitly unbiased LLMs - The paper studies models like GPT-4 that are aligned to be unbiased on existing explicit bias benchmarks, but may still have implicit biases.

- Social biases - The implicit biases studied are related to social categories like race, gender, religion and health. Evidence is found of similar human-like stereotypes and discrimination against marginalized groups.

- Prompt engineering - Creating prompts inspired by psychology to effectively elicit previously hidden biases. For example using techniques like relativity and impression management.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two new measures of bias - LLM IAT Bias and LLM Decision Bias. How are these measures adapted from the psychological concepts of implicit bias and discriminatory behaviors? What modifications were made to make them suitable for evaluating AI systems?

2. The LLM IAT Bias task involves associating target groups with attributes. What was the motivation behind choosing the specific set of target groups and attributes tested in this study? How do they cover a broad range of potentially biased associations?  

3. The LLM Decision Bias task involves making relative decisions between individuals from different target groups. Why is a relative rather than absolute decision context important for eliciting biases according to psychological research? How does the authors' prompt design reflect this?

4. Figure 1 shows a high-level overview of the methodology involving the LLM IAT Bias and LLM Decision Bias tasks. Can you walk through the details of how these tasks are structured, administered and analyzed step-by-step? 

5. The results demonstrate widespread implicit bias across models using the new LLM IAT Bias measure. What theories from social psychology might explain the persistence of these implicit stereotypes despite efforts to reduce explicit biases?

6. The paper argues that measuring implicit bias is important primarily due to its influence on decisions and behaviors. How specifically did the study examine whether LLM IAT Bias correlates with and predicts LLM Decision Bias?

7. The study found no significant bias using existing benchmark tests, yet uncovered bias using the new implicit and decision bias measures. What limitations of current benchmarks does this highlight? How might they be improved based on this work?

8. The conclusion discusses connections between psychology and AI safety, including potential interventions to reduce biases. What are some concrete next steps this research enables from both a psychological and AI perspectives?  

9. Could the methodology proposed generalize to uncover biases beyond social biases? What other forms of bias could prompt-based measures adapted from psychology help reveal?

10. The authors caution about directly comparing human versus LLM biases. What are some key differences between humans and LLMs that warrant this caution? How should we interpret similarities and differences between human and machine biases?
