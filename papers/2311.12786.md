# [Mechanistically analyzing the effects of fine-tuning on procedurally   defined tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12786)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper analyzes how fine-tuning affects the capabilities of pretrained language models. Using controlled experiments with probabilistic context-free grammars and Tracr-compiled transformers, the authors show that fine-tuning rarely fundamentally alters or deletes capabilities from the pretrained model. Instead, fine-tuning typically learns a minimal "wrapper" that makes small modifications to exploit the pretrained model's existing capabilities to perform well on the downstream task. For example, the wrapper may amplify the use of a relevant capability or inhibit unrelated capabilities. The paper shows the wrapper is often highly localized and can be easily "revived" via additional fine-tuning or modifying a few parameters. This indicates practitioners may unintentionally reopen access to unsafe capabilities in a safety-fine-tuned model by further tuning on downstream tasks. More broadly, the results illustrate fine-tuning's limitations in fundamentally changing model behavior and suggest the need for techniques that more substantially alter model capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper empirically analyzes the effects of fine-tuning on procedural tasks and concludes that fine-tuning typically alters pretrained models by learning minimal "wrappers" that transform underlying capabilities, rather than deleting or fundamentally changing them.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper empirically analyzes how fine-tuning affects the capabilities of large pre-trained models in controlled settings using procedurally generated tasks and interpretability tools. The key findings are: (1) Fine-tuning rarely fundamentally alters underlying model capabilities, but rather learns minimal "wrappers" that transform them. For example, wrappers can exploit spurious correlations in the fine-tuning data. (2) The wrappers are highly localized, such that pruning a few weights lets original capabilities reemerge. (3) Reverse fine-tuning on the original pretraining data rapidly "revives" original capabilities, indicating they persist under the wrapper. This implies practitioners could inadvertently remove safety wrappers via fine-tuning. Additional analyses on language models support these core claims. Overall, this work provides insight into how fine-tuning adapts models by modulating, but not deleting, existing capabilities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper finds that fine-tuning large pre-trained language models typically does not meaningfully alter the models' underlying learned capabilities but instead only makes minimal, localized changes like adding a simple "wrapper", and the original capabilities can often be easily revived with more fine-tuning.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper aims to address the question of how fine-tuning alters the underlying capabilities learned by a model during pretraining. Specifically, it investigates whether fine-tuning yields entirely novel capabilities or whether it just modulates existing ones. The central hypothesis is that fine-tuning rarely fundamentally alters a model's capabilities, but rather learns minimal "wrappers" on top of existing capabilities to adapt them to the downstream task. To test this, the paper uses procedural tasks and mechanistic analysis tools to precisely understand how capabilities change during fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing evidence that fine-tuning rarely fundamentally alters the capabilities of a pretrained model. Through controlled experiments on procedurally defined tasks using tools like network pruning and probing, the authors show that fine-tuning tends to only minimally transform the model's existing capabilities via learned "wrappers", rather than deleting or replacing capabilities. The paper also introduces a methodology called "reverse fine-tuning" to further validate these claims by showing that original pretrained capabilities can be revived after only a small number of gradient steps. Overall, these findings have important implications for understanding how fine-tuning works and how to better control model capabilities when adapting pretrained models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper provides a mechanistic analysis of how fine-tuning affects the underlying capabilities of transformer models, focusing specifically on procedurally defined tasks using compiled transformers (Tracr) and probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs).

Some key ways this paper compares to other related work:

- Many prior works have studied fine-tuning theoretically or evaluated its effects behaviorally. This paper aims to provide more mechanistic insights by using interpretability tools like network pruning, attention visualizations, and probing on controlled procedural tasks.

- Recent works have also started using synthetic tasks like PCFGs or board games to understand emergent capabilities in transformers. This paper follows that trend but specifically focuses on studying fine-tuning through such procedural tasks. 

- The paper proposes "reverse fine-tuning" as a new tool to evaluate if capabilities were actually forgotten during fine-tuning or if they can be easily revived.

- The key findings - that fine-tuning learns minimal "wrappers", capabilities are rarely deleted but rather modulated, and "revival" of capabilities is often very sample efficient - supports hypotheses from some recent works but directly tests and validates them through rigorous experiments.

Overall, this paper provides one of the most extensive mechanistic analysis of fine-tuning in controlled settings to date. The insights complement recent behavioral and theoretical studies of fine-tuning, while the proposed analyses and tasks also offer new tools for future research to build on.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my understanding, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

1. Understanding how fine-tuning works in more realistic settings with larger language models. The current work uses controlled synthetic tasks, but analyzing large language models trained on more complex real-world data would be an important next step.

2. Developing methods beyond fine-tuning that can more substantially alter pretrained models' capabilities. The results indicate fine-tuning typically only makes minimal changes, so exploring alternative techniques that can deeply modify models' behaviors may be needed for some applications.

3. Further analysis on the implications of the main result - that fine-tuning rarely deletes capabilities - for alignment research and developing safe AI systems. For example, more work could be done on how easily "safety wrappers" added via fine-tuning can be removed.

In summary, the main suggestions are to validate and expand on the current findings in more realistic settings, develop new adaptation methods beyond fine-tuning, and further explore the safety implications of the difficulty in deleting capabilities via fine-tuning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Fine-tuning: The process of adapting a pretrained model to a downstream task by continued training on a smaller dataset. A key concept examined in the paper.

- Capabilities: The functions or behaviors that a model learns during pretraining or fine-tuning. The paper analyzes how fine-tuning affects the capabilities of a model.

- Wrappers: Minimal transformations learned on top of a model's existing capabilities during fine-tuning. The paper hypothesizes wrappers are often learned instead of fully altering capabilities. 

- Strong/weak relevance: Whether a pretrained capability is causally relevant or merely exploits spurious correlations for a downstream task. This impacts how fine-tuning works.

- Reverse fine-tuning: Further fine-tuning a model in the "reverse" direction back towards its original pretraining distribution/task. Used to evaluate if capabilities were actually forgotten.  

- Procedural tasks: Synthetic datasets such as TracR programs or PCFGs used to precisely analyze models. Allows clearer determination of capabilities.

- Pruning/probing/attention maps: Interpretability tools used to understand how fine-tuning changes models.

So in summary, key terms revolve around fine-tuning, model capabilities, analyzing how those capabilities change, and methodologies for precisely investigating that within controlled procedural tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes "reverse fine-tuning" as a way to evaluate if fine-tuning has meaningfully altered the capabilities of a pretrained model. What are the key assumptions behind this proposed methodology? How could one test if those assumptions hold in practice?

2. The authors claim fine-tuning learns a "minimal transformation" of the pretrained model's capabilities, which they call a "wrapper". What precisely constitutes a "minimal transformation"? How is the precise boundary of the "wrapper" identified? 

3. The paper argues a "wrapper" explanation better fits the data than alternatives like deletion or amplification of capabilities. What further experiments could more rigorously test if the "wrapper hypothesis" better explains the results compared to these other hypotheses?  

4. How sensitive are the results to hyperparameters chosen for fine-tuning and reverse fine-tuning? Could apparent "revival" of lost capabilities in few steps of reverse fine-tuning be an artifact of suboptimal hyperparameters in the initial fine-tuning stage?

5. The authors utilize linear probes to argue capabilities continue to persist after fine-tuning. What are limitations of probing as an analysis method? How could the probing results showing persistence of lost capabilities be further validated?

6. The authors fine-tune explicit computational programs implemented via Tracr transformers. To what extent could these highly synthetic tasks fail to capture the complexity of real natural language processing setups in terms of the effect of fine-tuning?

7. The paper suggests "revived" capabilities could lead to accidental removal of safety wrappers via subsequent fine-tuning. What further study is needed to assess if this proposed failure mode holds in large scale models fine-tuned on complex natural language tasks?  

8. The paper focuses on analyzing fine-tuning. How might the conclusions change for other methods like adapter tuning or prompt tuning that are also widely used for model adaptation?

9. The authors use strict notions of capabilities based on input-output behavior. How might a more flexible capability definition based on latent representations affect the conclusions regarding wrapper learning?

10. The paper argues wrappers are localized, meaning they can be forgotten via pruning small components of the model. However, might there be distributed representations of wrappers that lead to more persistent alterations to model capabilities?
