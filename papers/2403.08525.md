# [From Weak to Strong Sound Event Labels using Adaptive Change-Point   Detection and Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08525)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Most audio datasets today have weakly labeled data with imprecise timing information. Strong labels with precise timing are needed to improve sound event detection (SED) models, especially for counting occurrences of sounds.
- Crowdsourcing strong labels is challenging. A solution is to crowdsource weak labels and reconstruct strong labels. Prior work uses fixed length segments which can fail to resolve separate sound events.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose an adaptive change point detection (A-CPD) method to segment audio into queries sent to a weak label annotator. Queries are adapted based on a probability prediction for the target sound's presence.  
- Aim is to maximize information gained about temporal activations of target sounds with a limited annotation budget.

Methodology:
- Active learning loop selects unlabeled recordings, segments using A-CPD queries, sends to annotator for weak labels per segment, reconstructs strong labels.
- A-CPD uses a ProtoNet model (pre-trained on other classes) to predict probability of target class presence per segment. Applies change point detection on probabilities over time to locate prominent peaks and construct queries between peaks.
- Compare to fixed change point detection using embeddings (F-CPD) and fixed length segments baseline.

Contributions:
- Propose adaptive audio segmentation method for machine-guided weak label annotation to get strong labels.
- Show A-CPD derives higher quality strong labels than baseline strategies, even with limited budget and noisy annotator. Leads to better event detection models.
- Demonstrate favorable performance of A-CPD for multiple sound classes compared to two query strategy baselines.
