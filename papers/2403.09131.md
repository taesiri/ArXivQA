# [ProSwitch: Knowledge-Guided Language Model Fine-Tuning to Generate   Professional and Non-Professional Styled Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown ability to generate high-quality text, but their capacity to switch between different styles via fine-tuning is underexplored. 
- In particular, the ability to produce both professional and non-professional styled text in response to queries has not been well studied.
- Being able to switch between formal and informal styles could enhance user comprehension and information retrieval.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce ProSwitch, a novel methodology to equip LLMs with the ability to produce both professional and non-professional responses. 
- ProSwitch has 3 main phases:
   1) Data preparation to gather domain knowledge and training corpus
   2) Instruction tuning to optimize LM with multiple levels of prompt formats 
   3) Comprehensive evaluation to assess professionalism discrimination and quality

Main Contributions:
- First study on generating professional vs non-professional text by exploiting external knowledge and internal LM knowledge
- Analysis of multi-level instruction tuning strategy for this task 
- Comprehensive evaluation methodology assessing various aspects like terminology use, reasoning, and language quality

- Show that ProSwitch outperforms general and specialized LM baselines in switching between styles while maintaining quality
- Demonstrate feasibility of acquiring professionalism discrimination without compromising text generation skills

In summary, the paper introduces a novel approach to improve LMs' ability to switch between professional and non-professional styles for textual responses, with a rigorous evaluation methodology. The results highlight the promise of instruction tuning guided by domain knowledge for controllable text generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces ProSwitch, a novel method to equip language models with the ability to switch between professional and non-professional styles of text generation through knowledge-guided instruction tuning. 

2. It proposes a comprehensive evaluation methodology with quantitative indicators to assess the professionalism discrimination and quality of generated text. These include Terminology Hit Gap (THG), Reasoning Step Gap (RSG), Pro F1 score, BLEU score, and BERT score.

3. Through experiments on two domain QA datasets, it demonstrates that ProSwitch variants outperform both general language models (e.g. Llama, ChatGPT) and specialized models (e.g. ChatDoctor) in professional/non-professional style switching ability, without compromising text generation quality.

In summary, the key contribution is developing and evaluating a technique to improve language models' capacity to produce responses in professional vs. casual styles based on targeted instruction tuning and domain knowledge guidance. The method and analysis provide new insights into controlling text generation style and quality.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does ProSwitch leverage both external domain knowledge and internal knowledge from large language models to improve professional/non-professional text generation? What are the key sources of knowledge it utilizes?

2. What prompted the authors to categorize the training QA pairs by question type? How does this categorization help the model learn type-related features of professionalism? 

3. The paper proposes a multi-level instruction tuning strategy. Can you explain the key information conveyed at each level of instructions and how it provides more detailed guidance to the model?

4. What are the key differences between the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning (FFT) methods for training ProSwitch? What does the comparative experiment using these two methods reveal about learning professional language features?

5. How does the paper define and quantify "professionalism" of text? What metrics are proposed to evaluate the professionalism discrimination ability of models?

6. Besides professionalism metrics, what reference-based metrics are used to evaluate whether the tuning process causes degradation in fundamental text generation skills?

7. Can you analyze the statistical results showing answers with higher "reasoning density" are considered more professional? What implications does this have?

8. What experiment was done to evaluate the cross-domain adaptation performance of ProSwitch? What can be concluded about its domain transfer capacity?

9. What are the limitations of the proposed method as acknowledged by the authors? What aspects require further investigation? 

10. Can you think of some real-world applications where a system capable of flexibly switching between professional and non-professional text styles would be useful?
