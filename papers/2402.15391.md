# [Genie: Generative Interactive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15391)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing generative AI models can generate images or videos from prompts, but lack interactivity and agentic control. Current world models require action-labeled data, limiting diversity. 
- There is a need for models that can generate interactive environments controllable at a frame level, trained only from unlabeled video data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Genie, a generative interactive environment model comprised of three components:
    1) A latent action model to infer actions between frames in an unsupervised way
    2) A video tokenizer to encode raw frames into discrete tokens  
    3) An autoregressive dynamics model to predict future frames based on past tokens and actions
- Genie is trained end-to-end on internet gameplay videos, without any action or domain-specific supervision
- It allows users to control video generation on a frame-by-frame basis via learned latent actions

Main Contributions:
- First model capable of generating interactive environments controllable at a frame level from only raw, unlabeled videos
- Scales to 11B parameters using efficient spatiotemporal transformer architecture 
- Shows promising results when trained on 30K hours of internet platformer gameplay videos and a robotics dataset
- Latent actions facilitate simulating unseen environments and training agents via imitation learning
- Opens ability for users to create and explore imagined worlds prompted from text, images or sketches

In summary, Genie pioneers a new form of generative model - trainable end-to-end from video-only data to produce controllable, interactive environments. This could enable modeling a greater diversity of worlds, as well as empowering future research into generalist agents.
