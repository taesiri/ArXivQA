# [Towards Sustainable SecureML: Quantifying Carbon Footprint of   Adversarial Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19009)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning (ML) models have high computational demands, leading to increased carbon emissions and raising sustainability concerns. This issue is more pressing for adversarial ML, which focuses on enhancing model security against attacks. Defending ML systems often requires additional computations, further increasing emissions. 

- However, the relationship between adversarial robustness and carbon emissions is not well understood. There is a need to quantify this trade-off to develop sustainable and secure ML systems.

Solution:
- The paper introduces the Robustness-Carbon Trade-off Index (RCTI), a novel metric inspired by economic elasticity principles. RCTI measures the sensitivity of carbon emissions to changes in adversarial robustness. 

- The RCTI quantifies the relative change in emissions compared to the relative change in robustness when defense mechanisms are added to make a model more attack-resistant. This ratio captures how much emissions increase for each unit of robustness gained.

Key Contributions:
- Pioneers first work studying carbon footprint of adversarial ML, providing evidence that greater model robustness leads to higher emissions.

- Proposes RCTI metric to quantify trade-off between robustness and emissions, indicating how environmental impact changes with model defenses. Can guide development of sustainable secure ML.

- Demonstrates RCTI through an evasion attack experiment, analyzing interplay between robustness, performance, and emissions. Shows enhancing robustness can initially be eco-efficient before reaching a tipping point.

- Introduces "elasticity of robustness" concept from economics to interpret RCTI value and classify security mechanisms as eco-friendly or not, based on emissions.

In summary, this paper makes an important first step in understanding the environmental dimensions of adversarial ML, and provides a valuable metric in RCTI to build sustainable defenses against attacks.
