# [SigFormer: Sparse Signal-Guided Transformer for Multi-Modal Human Action   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17428)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes SigFormer, a novel multi-modal action segmentation network that effectively fuses both sparse and dense signals to achieve accurate fine-grained action representation. The core innovation is the sparse guided cross-modal module, which utilizes masked attention to constrain feature fusion to temporal regions where sparse signals are active, ensuring precise guidance. To enhance boundary awareness, an intermediate bottleneck module with inner losses is introduced to extract features aligned with both action category and boundary information from each modality. Furthermore, mutual interactive branches explicitly model multi-stage interactions between the action category branch and temporal boundary branch, refining the category predictions using filtered boundary information. Comprehensive experiments on the large-scale OpenPack benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with SigFormer achieving an impressive F1 score of 0.958 by effectively fusing four modalities and emphasizing boundary information to mitigate over-segmentation errors. The proposed innovations for guided multi-modal fusion and emphasis on boundary awareness prove highly effective for the multi-modal action segmentation task.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of SigFormer are:

1. It proposes an effective network called SigFormer to utilize both sparse and dense signals for multi-modal action segmentation. The key component is the sparse guided cross-modal module, which uses masked attention to fuse signals with different information densities.

2. To increase awareness of temporal boundaries, the paper introduces an intermediate bottleneck module with inner loss functions to extract features related to both action categories and boundaries from each modality.
