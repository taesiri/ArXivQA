# [Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04247)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper examines potential risks of large language model-based agents in scientific applications, advocates prioritizing risk control over autonomous capabilities, and proposes a triadic safeguarding framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and environmental feedback.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is providing a comprehensive analysis of the potential risks associated with using large language model (LLM)-based agents in scientific research. It examines these risks from three key perspectives: user intent, scientific domain, and environmental impact. 

The paper does not propose new methods or models. Rather, it conducts a thorough review of vulnerabilities of scientific LLM agents across areas like chemistry, biology, and physics. It also surveys related literature on safeguarding both general LLMs and scientific agents. 

Based on this analysis, the paper advocates for prioritizing agent safety over autonomous capabilities. It argues for a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and environmental feedback to mitigate risks. The paper also highlights limitations and challenges that remain in developing robust safety practices for scientific agents.

In summary, the key contribution is clearly defining and scoping the risks of using LLMs as scientific agents, providing a foundation to motivate further research into safety practices and oversight mechanisms for these systems. The paper sounds an alarm about the urgency of addressing these risks before serious consequences might occur from the proliferation of unregulated scientific agents.
