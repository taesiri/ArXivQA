# [LongNet: Scaling Transformers to 1,000,000,000 Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02486)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we scale up the sequence length of Transformers to very long sequences (billions of tokens) without sacrificing performance on shorter sequences? The key hypothesis is that replacing the standard Transformer attention mechanism with a proposed "dilated attention" mechanism will allow scaling to much longer sequences while maintaining strong performance on shorter sequences. Dilated attention expands the attentional field exponentially as distance increases, reducing the overall complexity from quadratic to linear.In summary, the central research question is how to efficiently scale Transformers to extremely long sequence lengths. The proposed dilated attention mechanism is hypothesized to achieve this goal by reducing complexity while still capturing long-range dependencies. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of dilated attention in scaling to long sequences without losing short-sequence performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing LongNet, a Transformer variant that can scale the sequence length to over 1 billion tokens without sacrificing performance on shorter sequences. Specifically:- It proposes dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. This reduces the complexity from quadratic to linear while still allowing long-range dependencies.- It shows how LongNet can be used as a distributed trainer to parallelize training across multiple GPUs/nodes. This allows scaling to 1 billion tokens with nearly constant runtime. - Experiments show LongNet achieves strong performance on both long-sequence modeling tasks and general language modeling benchmarks. - The authors demonstrate the capability of scaling the sequence length to 1 billion tokens, which opens possibilities for modeling entire corpora or the full internet as a single sequence.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the dilated attention mechanism and the distributed training scheme to efficiently scale Transformer sequence lengths to orders of magnitude longer than previous methods, without sacrificing model performance. This enables new possibilities for extreme long-context modeling.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in scaling up Transformer models:- The key contribution of this paper is proposing the dilated attention mechanism to reduce the quadratic complexity of standard Transformer attention to linear. This enables scaling the sequence length to over 1 billion tokens, which is significantly longer than prior work. For example, previous sparse Transformers like Sparse Transformer, Longformer, and BigBird have been scaled up to 65K-128K tokens. So this paper pushes the boundary much further in terms of sequence length.- Compared to recurrent models like RNNs, LSTMs, and transformer-XL, the advantage of this work is maintaining the parallelizability of the standard Transformer. Recurrent models are limited in parallelization due to their sequential nature, while the dilated attention can still be computed in parallel across sequence segments.- The distributed algorithm in this paper enables scaling up training to 1 billion tokens across multiple GPUs/nodes. This goes beyond typical model parallelism or pipeline parallelism approaches by splitting the long sequence dimension across devices. Prior model parallel works have focused more on partitioning the hidden dimension rather than the sequence length.- In terms of model quality, this work shows dilated attention performs on par or better than sparse Transformers for both long and short sequence tasks. And it still follows the Transformer scaling laws relating model size, compute, and quality. This indicates it does not sacrifice too much model expressiveness.- One limitation is that retrieval mechanisms like sparse attention with memory modules or models like Memformer are not explored. The focus is more on reducing complexity through sparsification rather than improving memory.In summary, this paper makes excellent progress in scaling up sequence length for Transformers, while maintaining model quality and parallelizability. The core dilated attention mechanism seems quite promising.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring the limits of in-context learning with extremely long contexts. The authors suggest that with a context length of over 1 billion tokens, models may be able to alleviate catastrophic forgetting and leverage the long context for more effective few-shot and one-shot learning.- Applying LongNet to additional tasks beyond language modeling, such as multimodal modeling, BEiT pretraining, and genomic data modeling. The linear complexity and distributed training approach may be useful in these domains as well.- Training even larger models by scaling up LongNet. The authors show LongNet follows similar scaling laws to vanilla Transformers, so scaling up model size may lead to further improvements.- Deploying LongNet in production systems. The paper focuses on pretraining, but adapting LongNet for efficient inference could allow leveraging billion-token contexts at test time.- Exploring additional sparse attention patterns and training techniques specialized for LongNet's architecture. There may be opportunities to further optimize the dilated attention patterns.- Applying the distributed training approach to other sparse Transformers. The distributed algorithm for splitting the sequence dimension may help scale other sparse Transformers.In summary, the main future directions are exploring extremely long context learning, scaling to new tasks and larger models, optimization for production systems, and extending the distributed training techniques to other architectures. The core idea of scaling to over 1 billion tokens could enable many new applications.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces LongNet, a Transformer variant that can scale sequence length to over 1 billion tokens without sacrificing performance on shorter sequences. The key contribution is dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance between tokens grows. This results in a linear computation complexity and a logarithmic dependency between any two tokens. LongNet can serve as a distributed trainer to parallelize training across nodes, breaking constraints on computation and memory. Experiments show LongNet achieves strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and general language tasks. LongNet replaces the standard Transformer attention with dilated attention, which splits the input into segments that are sparsified by selecting rows at intervals. Multiple dilated attentions with different configurations are mixed to capture both local and global information. LongNet also differs computation across attention heads by shifting the sparsified positions. Theoretically, this leads to linear complexity and logarithmic maximum token dependency. LongNet leverages this to parallelize training across devices, scaling to 1 billion tokens. Experiments demonstrate advantages over sparse and vanilla Transformers in perplexity, scaling curves, model scaling, and long context prompting. The work enables modeling of extremely long sequences.
