# [High-Resolution Image Inpainting using Multi-Scale Neural Patch   Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09969)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the main research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we develop an effective approach for high-resolution image inpainting that preserves both global structure and local texture details in the filled regions?

The key points I gathered are:

- Recent deep learning methods for image inpainting like Context Encoder can capture semantics but struggle with texture details, especially for higher resolution images.

- Traditional texture synthesis methods can propagate textures well but don't understand global structure and semantics. 

- This paper proposes a multi-scale neural patch synthesis approach to get the benefits of both - it uses a convolutional neural network for structured prediction of image content along with a texture matching loss to synthesize high-frequency details.

- The method involves jointly optimizing an image to match a learned global content prediction and match local neural patches from surrounding areas, in a coarse-to-fine manner across scales.

- Experiments on ImageNet and Paris StreetView datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art inpainting accuracy and ability to generate sharper, more coherent results than prior methods.

In summary, the core research contribution is a hybrid deep learning approach for high-quality high-resolution image inpainting by combining learned global structure and neural texture synthesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a multi-scale neural patch synthesis approach for high-resolution image inpainting. Specifically:

- They propose a joint optimization framework that combines a global content constraint modeled by an encoder-decoder CNN, and a local texture constraint modeled by similarity of neural patches extracted from a pre-trained classification network. 

- They introduce a multi-scale neural patch synthesis algorithm that utilizes this joint optimization framework in a coarse-to-fine manner to fill in large holes in high-resolution images.

- They show that the proposed approach can generate coherent hole-filling results that preserve both global structure and realistic texture details. 

- They demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and Paris StreetView datasets compared to prior learning-based and patch propagation methods.

- They highlight the capability of neural features from classification networks to synthesize realistic image content and textures, beyond just transferring artistic styles.

In summary, the key contribution is a multi-scale optimization technique that leverages the complementary strengths of learning-based hole prediction and neural patch similarity to achieve high-quality semantic inpainting, especially for high-resolution images. The joint modeling of content and texture constraints is the main novel aspect.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-scale neural patch synthesis approach for high-resolution image inpainting. The method uses a joint optimization framework with two loss functions - a holistic content loss and a local texture loss. The content loss, modeled by training an encoder-decoder CNN, captures the overall structure and semantics. The texture loss, computed using a pre-trained VGG network, matches neural patches inside and outside the hole region to synthesize realistic details. To handle high-resolution images, they use a coarse-to-fine optimization scheme over multiple scales. Experiments on Paris StreetView and ImageNet datasets demonstrate their method can produce sharper and more coherent inpainting results compared to prior techniques like Context Encoder and PatchMatch, especially for larger holes in high-resolution images. The approach is also extended to remove distracting objects in real photos by handling holes of arbitrary shapes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-scale neural patch synthesis approach for high-resolution image inpainting. The key idea is to leverage both the structured prediction power of encoder-decoder convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as well as the ability of neural patches to synthesize realistic, high-frequency details. The method uses a content network (based on Context Encoder) to provide a global content constraint capturing semantics and structure. It also uses a pre-trained texture network (VGG-19) to define a local texture constraint ensuring visual coherence between the hole region and surrounding image areas. These content and texture constraints are jointly optimized using backpropagation and L-BFGS. To handle high resolutions, a coarse-to-fine pyramid strategy is employed.

The method is evaluated on the ImageNet and Paris StreetView datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art inpainting accuracy both quantitatively and visually. The joint optimization framework is shown to be effective, with the content network providing global structure and the texture network enabling synthesis of finer details. Comparisons to Context Encoder and PatchMatch show the approach generates sharper, more coherent results, especially for larger holes in high-resolution images. The technique also extends naturally to arbitrary hole shapes, enabling object removal applications. Limitations include occasional discontinuity artifacts and slow runtimes. Overall, this work advances semantic inpainting through a hybrid deep learning approach combining structured prediction with neural patch synthesis.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a multi-scale neural patch synthesis approach for high-resolution image inpainting. The key idea is to leverage both global image structure and local texture details for hole filling through a joint optimization framework. 

Specifically, the method models two loss terms - a holistic content loss and a local texture loss. The content loss captures the overall semantics and structure of the image using an encoder-decoder network. The texture loss ensures local patch similarity between known regions and the hole using a pre-trained VGG network. These two losses are jointly optimized to reconstruct the missing region. 

To handle high-resolution images, the method uses a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy over multiple scales. The content network prediction provides the initialization at the coarsest scale. This is iteratively refined across scales using joint optimization of content and texture losses, transferring textures from finer scales to coarser ones. This allows the model to generate sharper and more coherent hole fillings at high resolutions.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of high-resolution image inpainting, which involves filling in large missing regions (holes) in images with realistic and semantically coherent details. Specifically, the paper aims to improve upon recent deep learning based inpainting methods, which can generate semantically plausible image structures but often lack fine texture details and have difficulty handling high-resolution images. 

The key questions the paper tries to address are:

1) How can we improve upon existing deep learning based inpainting methods to generate sharper, more realistic texture details, especially for high-resolution images?

2) How can we leverage both the semantic/structural modeling capabilities of deep networks as well as traditional texture synthesis techniques to get the best of both worlds?

3) How can we effectively model both the global structure and local texture constraints for the inpainting problem using deep networks?

4) How can we extend these deep learning techniques to handle inpainting of arbitrary shaped holes and object removal?

In summary, the paper aims to push the boundaries of learning-based inpainting to handle high-resolution images with realistic textures through a hybrid deep learning and texture synthesis approach.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-scale neural patch synthesis approach for high-resolution image inpainting. The method combines global semantic information from a trained content prediction network with local texture details extracted from neural patches in a joint optimization framework. At the lowest scale, the content prediction network provides an initial fill for the missing region. Then at each scale, joint optimization is performed to update the hole content by minimizing both the content loss to the prediction from the coarser scale and the texture loss between patches inside and outside the hole. After optimization, the result is upsampled to the next finer scale and used to initialize the optimization. This allows hole filling that preserves both structure and high-frequency details in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experiments on ImageNet and Paris StreetView datasets demonstrate the method's advantages over prior inpainting techniques, especially for high-resolution inputs where it can generate sharper and more coherent hole fills. The approach also extends naturally to remove distractors or undesired objects from photographs by masking arbitrary regions.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a high-resolution image inpainting method using multi-scale neural patch synthesis. The key idea is to leverage both global semantic information and local texture details for generating sharper and more realistic image inpainting results. The method combines a content network and a texture network in a joint optimization framework. The content network is trained to predict the overall structure of the missing region. The texture network extracts mid-layer neural features from a pre-trained VGG network to model texture similarity between patches inside and outside the hole. 

To enable high-resolution inpainting, a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy is used. The content prediction from the smallest scale initializes the next finer scale's optimization. At each scale, the joint content and texture loss is optimized to update the hole region. This multi-scale approach allows hallucinating both structure and texture details for large missing regions in high-resolution images.

Experiments on Paris StreetView and ImageNet datasets demonstrate superiority over previous approaches like context encoders and patch-based texture synthesis. Qualitative results show the proposed method generates sharper inpainting with finer details and fewer artifacts, especially for larger holes in higher resolution images. The method can also handle arbitrary shaped holes for object removal. Limitations include slower speed and occasional blurriness or discontinuities. Overall, this neural patch synthesis approach advances semantic inpainting quality to benefit image editing tasks.
