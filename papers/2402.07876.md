# [Policy Improvement using Language Feedback Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07876)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Learning instruction following agents that efficiently generalize to new environments and instructions is challenging. Two main challenges are sample efficiency and generalizability.
- Reinforcement learning requires many environment interactions. Imitation learning requires many expert demonstrations, which can be expensive or inconvenient to collect from humans repeatedly.
- Simply using large language models (LLMs) as experts to provide corrections during training is slow and expensive.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Language Feedback Models (LFMs) which are small models trained to identify desirable and undesirable behavior. 
- Collect a small set of LLM feedback on trajectories to train the LFM. The LFM predicts if an action helps complete the instruction goal.
- Improve policies by using the LFM to identify on-policy desirable behavior to imitate, without needing the LLM at test time.

Contributions:
- Show LFMs enable better policy improvement than behavior cloning baselines and using the LLM as an expert policy for all environments.
- Show learning LFMs is more cost-effective than using the LLM for expert actions given a fixed computational budget. LFMs better handle large action spaces.
- Show LFMs generalize - they improve policies on unseen test environments through one-shot adaptation, without needing demonstrations or LLMs.
- Show LFMs can provide human-interpretable feedback, enabling trust and verification of the identified desirable behavior.

In summary, the paper presents Language Feedback Models as an efficient way to leverage LLM knowledge to improve instruction following agents. LFMs identify on-policy desirable behavior for imitation learning in a sample efficient, cost-effective and generalizable manner.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Language Feedback Models that efficiently leverage knowledge from large language models to identify desirable behavior for imitation learning, thereby improving instruction following agents in a sample-efficient, cost-effective, and generalizable manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Language Feedback Models (LFMs) that identify desirable behavior - actions that help achieve tasks specified in instructions - for imitation learning in instruction following. Specifically:

- LFMs are trained to predict whether an action is productive in achieving the goals outlined in an instruction, using feedback from large language models on verbalized environment observations and agent actions. 

- LFMs are shown to improve task completion rates over strong behavioral cloning baselines by identifying desirable behavior to imitate, on several instruction following benchmarks such as Touchdown, ScienceWorld, and ALFWorld environments.

- Compared to using LLMs directly to predict actions, LFMs provide better performance when controlling for the number of LLM tokens used. LFMs distill the world knowledge of large LLMs into a small and cost-effective model.

- LFMs generalize to unseen environments, allowing policy adaptation through one round of imitation learning using LFM-identified desirable behavior, improving task completion rates by 3.5-12%.

- LFMs can be modified to provide human-interpretable explanations for why actions are considered desirable, enabling human verification of imitation learning data.

In summary, the key contribution is using language feedback models to leverage knowledge distilled from LLMs to identify desirable behavior for efficient and generalizable policy improvement in instruction following.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Language Feedback Models (LFM)

The paper introduces the concept of Language Feedback Models which identify desirable behavior from base policies to help improve them via imitation learning. Key aspects explored in the paper relate to using LLMs to train cost-effective LFMs, testing their sample efficiency and generalizability on instruction following benchmarks, and modifying them to provide human-interpretable feedback. The LFMs are shown to outperform imitation learning directly from LLMs, and enable policy adaptation to new environments. So the core focus is on leveraging language and LLMs to learn what constitutes productive/desirable behavior for a task, distilling that into an efficient LFM, and using it to improve instruction following.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using language feedback models (LFMs) to identify desirable behavior for imitation learning. How does this approach for policy improvement compare to more traditional methods like reinforcement learning or behavioral cloning? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages?

2. The LFM is first trained on rollouts from an initial policy by getting feedback from a large language model (LLM). What are some key considerations in designing the prompts to get high-quality and accurate feedback from the LLM? How might the quality of LFM training depend on the strength of the initial policy?

3. The paper shows that learning a separate LFM is more cost-effective than using the LLM directly for action prediction during policy improvement. But training the LFM still requires some upfront LLM queries. Under what conditions would the cost savings outweigh this initial expense? How might this tradeoff change with different problem settings?

4. How exactly does the trained LFM identify desirable behavior during policy improvement? What objective or metric does it optimize for when critiquing state-action pairs? How could this objective be improved to better align with solving downstream tasks?

5. The method relies on effective verbalization of the environment into natural language for the LLM. How does the quality of this verbalization impact what useful feedback signals can be extracted? What verbalization approaches could strengthen the technique?

6. For generalizability, the paper shows adaptation of the LFM policy to new test environments. What factors influence how much the LFM's critiques transfer across environments? When would we expect this approach to fail or require additional LLM queries?

7. The detailed LFM provides human-interpretable explanations for its feedback without loss of accuracy. How were these detailed explanations generated from the LLM, and why didn't they degrade task performance? What are the benefits of such explainability?

8. How was the LLM model (GPT-4) fine-tuned or selected to provide high-quality feedback signals for training the LFM? How might the choice of LLM model impact the end task metrics achieved after policy improvement?

9. What mechanisms allow the LFM to capture similar world knowledge and reasoning ability to the LLM itself despite being far smaller in size? What implicit knowledge distillation takes place? How does this relate to transfer learning approaches?

10. The method improves policies for complex, long-horizon language instruction following. What other problem settings could benefit from this approach of learning from LLM feedback signals? What challenges arise in new domains compared to the environments studied?
