# [SoDaCam: Software-defined Cameras via Single-Photon Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00066)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we use single-photon imaging devices like SPAD arrays to achieve flexible, software-defined cameras with novel post-capture imaging capabilities?The key ideas proposed are:- SPAD arrays can acquire data in the form of "photon-cubes" - sequences of binary frames capturing individual photon detections with high temporal resolution. - Simple linear transformations or "projections" of these photon-cubes can emulate a diverse range of camera types like flutter shutter cameras, event cameras, motion cameras, etc.- This provides a realization of "software-defined cameras" (SoDaCam) where the imaging modality is defined flexibly via post-processing, rather than fixed hardware choices. - SoDaCam unlocks new capabilities like simultaneously achieving multiple modalities using a single sensor, capabilities difficult to realize in conventional hardware.- Projections can be computed on-sensor to reduce bandwidth and power needs for SPAD imaging.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that post-capture projections on photon-cube data from SPADs can enable flexible software-defined cameras with novel capabilities. The paper explores this concept through theoretical analysis, simulations, and prototype hardware experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introducing the concept of "photon-cube projections" for single-photon imaging devices. The key idea is that different projections of the raw photon-cube data acquired by a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array can emulate various imaging modalities like exposure bracketing, flutter shutter cameras, video compressive sensing, event cameras, etc.2. Demonstrating the flexibility of photon-cube projections to provide novel capabilities beyond the emulated cameras, such as multi-bucket coding for video compressive sensing, low-light event imaging, and motion stacks for motion deblurring. 3. Implementing some of the projections on a novel compute architecture called UltraPhase that is designed for single-photon imaging. This shows the feasibility of computing projections near sensor to reduce sensor readout and power consumption.4. Conceptualizing the idea of a "software-defined camera" or SoDaCam that can provide multiple imaging modalities simultaneously from a single photon-sensing hardware. The software-defined notion comes from the fact that different projections on the raw photon data can emulate different camera types.In summary, the core contribution seems to be introducing photon-cube projections as a way to obtain diverse computational imaging capabilities from single-photon data in a software-defined manner, along with demonstrations of novel imaging modalities and an efficient hardware implementation. The software-defined camera concept built on photon-cube projections is positioned as a step towards computational cameras that have flexibility limited only by shot noise and computational power.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other research on software-defined cameras and single-photon imaging:- The idea of using post-capture computation to provide software-defined cameras has been explored before (e.g., in light field cameras and programmable sensors). However, this paper takes it to the extreme granularity of individual photon detections using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays.- Most prior work on passive single-photon imaging has focused on applications like high dynamic range imaging, motion compensation, and burst photography. This paper introduces new applications like emulating event cameras, video compressive sensing, and motion projections from the same photon data.- The concept of computing projections of the photon-cube for emulating cameras is novel. Prior work has not explicitly made these connections between different imaging modalities and projections on the temporal photon data.- Demonstrating the photon-cube projections on a prototype compute architecture (UltraPhase) that interfaces with a SPAD array is an important proof-of-concept result. It shows the feasibility of computing projections near-sensor for bandwidth and power reduction.- Compared to conventional high-speed cameras that could also acquire photon-cubes, this paper argues SPADs are better suited because they do not suffer from read noise penalties, especially in low-light conditions. The comparisons to high-speed cameras help position the work.- The limitations around resolution and fill-factor of current SPAD arrays are acknowledged. But the paper makes a case that continued progress on SPAD technology can help overcome these limitations in the future.In summary, this paper makes both conceptual and practical contributions in showing how the extreme temporal resolution of single-photon data enables a new class of software-defined, post-capture imaging systems. The emulation results and prototype demonstration help position and differentiate the work within the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Adding color to SoDaCam, such as by overlaying color filter arrays (CFAs) and performing demosaicing on the computed photon-cube projections. - Leveraging improvements in SPAD characteristics like higher resolution, frame rate, and fill factor as they become available, to enhance SoDaCam capabilities.- Using SoDaCam as a platform to compare different imaging modalities in a hardware-agnostic manner.- Using the flexibility of SoDaCam to prototype and deploy new unconventional imaging models more easily.- Exploring sensor-in-the-loop optimization, where photon-cube projections are tailored for specific downstream computer vision tasks.- Implementing projections on more powerful camera image signal processors as chip-to-chip communication standards evolve.- Applying SoDaCam principles to other single-photon imagers like jots and jittered time-stamping cameras that also produce temporal photon data.In summary, the authors point to enhancements in SPAD sensor technology, leveraging SoDaCam's flexibility for new imaging models and in-camera optimization, adding color, and porting the projections to more powerful processors as key future directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper presents "SoDaCam," a system for emulating various cameras from photon-cubes acquired by single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays. Photon-cubes represent the spatio-temporal detections of photons as a sequence of binary frames. The key idea is that simple linear transformations, or projections, of the photon-cube can provide the functionality of different imaging systems in a software-defined manner. For example, coded exposures can emulate flutter shutter cameras for motion deblurring, computing temporal derivatives can emulate event cameras, and shifted integrations can emulate camera motion without any physical movement. These photon-cube projections provide camera-specific compression, and can be computed efficiently near the sensor to reduce bandwidth requirements. The authors demonstrate the versatility of the approach by emulating high-speed video cameras, event cameras, and motion cameras from the same photon-cube data. A prototype system implements projections on a novel SPAD compute architecture, showing reductions in power and bandwidth compared to full sensor readout. Overall, the work introduces the concept of software-defined cameras at the level of individual photons, with implications for future reconfigurable imaging systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces "SoDaCam", a software-defined camera system built using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays. SPAD arrays can operate at extremely high frame rates (up to 100 kHz), producing a temporal sequence of binary frames called a photon-cube. The key idea is that by computing simple linear and shift operations called photon-cube projections on this data, the system can emulate a wide variety of camera types and modalities post-capture, including flutter shutter cameras, event cameras, and cameras that move during exposure. The authors demonstrate emulating three distinct imaging systems - high-speed video compressive imaging, event cameras, and motion projection cameras - all from the same raw photon-cube data. Additional capabilities enabled by the software-defined approach include simultaneous multi-camera emulation and new modalities like motion stacks. Implementing the photon-cube projections on-chip using a novel near-sensor compute architecture called UltraPhase is also shown to dramatically reduce sensor readout bandwidth and power consumption compared to transferring the full photon-cube off-chip. Overall, the proposed SoDaCam system provides an extremely flexible software-defined camera using SPAD sensors, with processing at the level of individual photons.
