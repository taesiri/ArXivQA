# [StyleGANEX: StyleGAN-Based Manipulation Beyond Cropped Aligned Faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06146)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is:

How to overcome the fixed-crop limitation of StyleGAN in order to perform face manipulation on normal field-of-view (FoV) face images and videos?

The key limitation with existing StyleGAN-based face manipulation methods is that they can only handle cropped and aligned faces at a fixed resolution that StyleGAN was pre-trained on. However, most real-world portrait images and videos contain unaligned faces with a larger field of view showing more background context. 

The paper proposes a method called StyleGANEX to refactor StyleGAN to overcome its fixed-crop constraint and enable unaligned face manipulation. The key ideas are:

1) Expanding the shallow layers of StyleGAN using dilated convolutions to accommodate variable input resolutions. 

2) Introducing a corresponding encoder to project normal FoV faces into the expanded feature space of StyleGANEX.

3) Forming a fully convolutional framework between the encoder and StyleGANEX decoder to perform diverse face manipulation tasks like facial editing, super-resolution, and video toonification on unaligned faces.

By overcoming the fixed-crop limitation, the paper aims to expand the capability of StyleGAN beyond just aligned faces to enable more versatile face manipulation on real-world portrait imagery. The effectiveness of the proposed StyleGANEX method is demonstrated through experiments on various tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing StyleGANEX, which is a novel architecture that extends StyleGAN to go beyond generating only cropped and aligned faces at a fixed resolution. 

Specifically, the paper makes the following key contributions:

- It proposes StyleGANEX, which refactors the shallow layers of StyleGAN by using dilated convolutions to enlarge their reception fields. This allows the first layer to accept an input feature map of any resolution instead of a fixed 4x4 map in original StyleGAN.

- It introduces a corresponding encoder that can project normal field-of-view (FoV) face images to the joint style code and first-layer feature space of StyleGANEX. 

- Together the encoder and StyleGANEX form a fully convolutional framework that can perform inversion and manipulation on unaligned variable-resolution faces.

- It validates StyleGANEX on a diverse set of tasks including facial attribute editing, super-resolution, sketch/mask-to-face translation and face toonification on normal FoV faces.

In summary, the key innovation is the StyleGANEX architecture that expands the capability of StyleGAN beyond just cropped aligned faces while retaining its style manipulation abilities. This is enabled by the simple yet effective technique of enlarging the reception fields of shallow layers. The proposed framework significantly improves the versatility of StyleGAN for face image manipulation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to modify StyleGAN to handle unaligned faces of arbitrary resolutions while retaining its ability to manipulate facial attributes and styles.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on StyleGAN-based face manipulation:

- Overcomes the fixed-crop limitation of StyleGAN while retaining style control abilities: The paper presents StyleGANEX, which refactors StyleGAN to handle unaligned faces of varying resolutions. This overcomes a fundamental limitation of StyleGAN. Most prior work like pSp and InterFaceGAN has been constrained to cropped aligned faces. 

- Preserves model compatibility and generative space: StyleGANEX directly loads pre-trained StyleGAN parameters without retraining. So it is fully compatible with StyleGAN's generative space and existing manipulation techniques. Other methods like VToonify remove layers of StyleGAN, losing generative abilities.

- General encoder-decoder framework: The StyleGANEX encoder and generator form a fully convolutional framework that can flexibly perform various face manipulation tasks beyond cropped faces. This is more versatile than task-specific frameworks.

- First-layer feature prediction: The key idea is predicting the first-layer feature to capture spatial layout. This differs from optimization-based inversion methods like PTI and pSp that mainly focus on the latent code. Other feature prediction methods like HFGI follow StyleGAN's fixed feature resolution.

- Normal FoV video manipulation: The framework can process normal field-of-view portrait videos, enabling coherent video editing and stylization. This goes beyond image editing methods.

- Stronger feature learning: The joint training of encoder and generator differs from fixed latent code extractors like in VToonify. This allows better detail reconstruction and editing consistency.

In summary, the paper presents both a novel model architecture and a generic encoder-decoder framework to lift fundamental limitations of StyleGAN for diverse face manipulation tasks. The comparisons show the approach is more effective and versatile than existing StyleGAN-based methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the efficiency of the inversion process. The current approach relies on inefficient optimization for precise reconstruction. The authors suggest exploring more efficient inversion methods like iterative residue prediction and hypernetworks.

- Improving the feature representation of StyleGANEX. The current model is limited in handling out-of-distribution features like complex clothing, human bodies, and large face rotations. Expanding the feature representation could allow for better generalization.

- Applying StyleGANEX to other domains beyond faces. The proposed refactoring approach is domain-agnostic. Extending it to other domains like cars, bedrooms, etc. could be an interesting direction. 

- Addressing model bias. StyleGANEX may inherit biases from the original StyleGAN model. Applying it to tasks with severe data imbalance may require dealing with bias and improving performance on under-represented data.

- Exploring other applications. The authors demonstrate several applications like facial attribute editing, super-resolution, sketch-to-face, etc. Applying StyleGANEX to other generative tasks could be worthwhile to explore.

- Improving spatial editing. The paper introduces joint manipulation of style code and spatial features. More advanced spatial editing like spatially-controllable editing could be an interesting avenue.

- Combining with other GAN models. StyleGANEX builds upon StyleGAN architecture specifically. Extending the ideas to other GANs like BigGAN, ProGAN etc. could be useful to study.

In summary, the main future directions focus on improving inversion efficiency, feature representation, model generalization, exploring new applications, and combining ideas with other GAN models. Addressing model bias and spatial editing also seem like fruitful areas according to the authors.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes StyleGANEX, an extension of StyleGAN that overcomes its limitation of only generating cropped and aligned faces at a fixed resolution. StyleGANEX refactors the shallow layers of StyleGAN using dilated convolutions to expand their receptive fields without changing parameters. This allows the first layer to take an input feature map of any spatial resolution. Thus StyleGANEX extends the latent space to a joint latent code and input feature space that can generate unaligned faces. An encoder is designed to project face images into this joint space for manipulation tasks like attribute editing, super-resolution, and sketch-to-face translation on normal field-of-view faces. Experiments demonstrate the capability of StyleGANEX in diverse manipulation tasks beyond aligned faces while inheriting the generative power and controllability of StyleGAN. The simple refactoring method makes StyleGANEX fully compatible with pre-trained StyleGAN for easy adoption.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes StyleGANEX, an improved architecture that overcomes the fixed-crop limitation of StyleGAN while retaining its style control abilities. The authors refactor the shallow layers of StyleGAN to have enlarged, variable resolutions. This allows the model to accept an additional first-layer feature map with flexible resolution, forming an extended $W^+$ - $F$ space. By only changing the receptive fields of convolutions, StyleGANEX is compatible with pre-trained StyleGAN and preserves its generative capabilities. Based on StyleGANEX, the authors design an encoder to project normal field-of-view (FoV) face images into this joint latent space. The encoder-decoder framework can handle unaligned face images of various resolutions. This enables a range of face manipulation tasks on full face photos rather than just aligned and cropped faces, including attribute editing, super-resolution, sketch/mask-to-face translation, and video toonification. Experiments validate the effectiveness of StyleGANEX and the encoder in overcoming the fixed-crop constraint and achieving high-quality results on diverse tasks.

In summary, this work makes two main contributions - (1) It refactors StyleGAN into StyleGANEX to expand its generative space and overcome the fixed-crop limitation. (2) It develops an encoder tailored for StyleGANEX to project normal FoV faces into its extended latent space, enabling manipulation of unaligned face images and videos. The proposed framework significantly enhances the capability of StyleGAN-based face editing. It can process full face photos beyond just aligned and cropped faces, while retaining StyleGAN's generative quality and style control abilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a simple yet effective approach to refactor StyleGAN to overcome its fixed-crop limitation while retaining its style control abilities. The key idea is to expand the shallow layers of StyleGAN to have higher resolution feature maps through dilated convolutions, instead of removing them. Specifically, the first layer is changed to have a variable feature map with 1/32 resolution of the output image, instead of a fixed 4x4 feature map. This allows the model, named StyleGANEX, to generate faces beyond the original 1024x1024 resolution constraint. To enable projection of real unaligned faces into StyleGANEX's latent space, the paper designs a corresponding encoder by aggregating features from a pSp encoder to predict the first layer feature. Together the encoder and StyleGANEX form an end-to-end framework that can perform various face manipulation tasks, including facial attribute editing, super-resolution, sketch/mask-to-face translation, and video toonification, on normal field-of-view face images and videos. StyleGANEX retains all the original parameters of StyleGAN and is compatible with its generative space, thus inheriting its powerful style manipulation abilities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the limitation of StyleGAN in being constrained to cropped aligned faces at a fixed image resolution. Specifically:

- StyleGAN is inherently limited to generating cropped and aligned faces at a certain fixed image resolution that it is pretrained on (e.g. 1024x1024). 

- This makes it difficult to apply StyleGAN to process normal field-of-view (FoV) face images and videos, where the face occupies a smaller proportion of the image and allows for things like full hair, clothing, and background.

- Existing StyleGAN-based face manipulation models that perform tasks like facial attribute editing are also limited to cropped aligned faces. If applied to normal FoV images, they would need to crop, align, edit, and paste back the faces, often resulting in discontinuities.

- Recent work like StyleGAN3 and VToonify made attempts to address the limitation, but still have issues - StyleGAN3 still requires realignment, while VToonify loses StyleGAN's ability to perform latent editing on facial attributes.

The key research problem is overcoming StyleGAN's fixed-crop limitation to enable unaligned face generation and manipulation, while retaining its expressive style modulation and manipulation capabilities.
