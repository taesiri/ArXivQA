# [StyleGANEX: StyleGAN-Based Manipulation Beyond Cropped Aligned Faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06146)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is:

How to overcome the fixed-crop limitation of StyleGAN in order to perform face manipulation on normal field-of-view (FoV) face images and videos?

The key limitation with existing StyleGAN-based face manipulation methods is that they can only handle cropped and aligned faces at a fixed resolution that StyleGAN was pre-trained on. However, most real-world portrait images and videos contain unaligned faces with a larger field of view showing more background context. 

The paper proposes a method called StyleGANEX to refactor StyleGAN to overcome its fixed-crop constraint and enable unaligned face manipulation. The key ideas are:

1) Expanding the shallow layers of StyleGAN using dilated convolutions to accommodate variable input resolutions. 

2) Introducing a corresponding encoder to project normal FoV faces into the expanded feature space of StyleGANEX.

3) Forming a fully convolutional framework between the encoder and StyleGANEX decoder to perform diverse face manipulation tasks like facial editing, super-resolution, and video toonification on unaligned faces.

By overcoming the fixed-crop limitation, the paper aims to expand the capability of StyleGAN beyond just aligned faces to enable more versatile face manipulation on real-world portrait imagery. The effectiveness of the proposed StyleGANEX method is demonstrated through experiments on various tasks.
