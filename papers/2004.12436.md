# [All you need is a second look: Towards Tighter Arbitrary shape text   detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12436)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the main research question this paper tries to address is: How to build an effective text detection system that can handle arbitrary shaped texts in natural scene images?Specifically, the paper points out three main challenges in arbitrary shaped text detection:1) Standard convolutional networks have limited receptive fields and may fail to detect long text instances. 2) Simple representations using rectangles or quadrangles are not adequate for curved or irregular shaped texts. 3) Tiny text instances are difficult to precisely describe and detect.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a new two-stage segmentation based text detection system called NASK:1) The first stage (TIS) uses a convolutional network with a Group Spatial and Channel Attention module (GSCA) to locate text instances and generate bounding box proposals. 2) The second stage (FOX) takes the proposals and predicts geometric attributes like text center line, character orientation etc. to construct a tighter representation of the text using fiducial points.3) The two stages are connected through a Text RoI pooling layer.The key hypothesis is that the proposed NASK system with the GSCA module for capturing long-range contexts and the FOX module for generating fiducial point representations can achieve better performance on arbitrary shaped text detection compared to previous methods. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results, thus validating their approach.In summary, the main research question is how to effectively detect arbitrary shaped texts, and the key hypothesis is that the proposed two-stage NASK system can achieve improved performance through long-range contextual modeling and tighter fiducial point-based text representation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a two-stage text detection framework called NASK (Need A Second looK) for detecting arbitrary shaped texts. 2. Introducing a Group Spatial and Channel Attention (GSCA) module to capture long-range dependencies in the feature maps and enhance feature representation.3. Introducing a Fiducial Point Expression (FOX) module to achieve tighter and more accurate detection of arbitrary shaped texts by predicting geometric attributes like text center line, text orientation etc.  4. Achieving state-of-the-art text detection performance on two curved text detection benchmarks - Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500.In summary, the key ideas are:- A two-stage segmentation approach, with the first stage detecting text instances and second stage refining detections using predicted geometric attributes. - Using attention mechanisms (GSCA) to capture long-range dependencies in the feature maps.- Representing text with a set of fiducial points generated from predicted geometric attributes to enable tighter arbitrary shape text detection.- Showing state-of-the-art performance on curved text detection datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed ideas.
