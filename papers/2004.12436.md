# [All you need is a second look: Towards Tighter Arbitrary shape text   detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12436)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the main research question this paper tries to address is: 

How to build an effective text detection system that can handle arbitrary shaped texts in natural scene images?

Specifically, the paper points out three main challenges in arbitrary shaped text detection:

1) Standard convolutional networks have limited receptive fields and may fail to detect long text instances. 

2) Simple representations using rectangles or quadrangles are not adequate for curved or irregular shaped texts. 

3) Tiny text instances are difficult to precisely describe and detect.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a new two-stage segmentation based text detection system called NASK:

1) The first stage (TIS) uses a convolutional network with a Group Spatial and Channel Attention module (GSCA) to locate text instances and generate bounding box proposals. 

2) The second stage (FOX) takes the proposals and predicts geometric attributes like text center line, character orientation etc. to construct a tighter representation of the text using fiducial points.

3) The two stages are connected through a Text RoI pooling layer.

The key hypothesis is that the proposed NASK system with the GSCA module for capturing long-range contexts and the FOX module for generating fiducial point representations can achieve better performance on arbitrary shaped text detection compared to previous methods. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results, thus validating their approach.

In summary, the main research question is how to effectively detect arbitrary shaped texts, and the key hypothesis is that the proposed two-stage NASK system can achieve improved performance through long-range contextual modeling and tighter fiducial point-based text representation.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage deep learning method called NASK for detecting arbitrarily shaped text in images, using a Group Spatial and Channel Attention module and a Fiducial Point Expression module to capture long-range dependencies and precisely reconstruct curved texts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in scene text detection:

- This paper proposes a new two-stage text detection model called NASK (Need A Second looK) that uses segmentation for text detection. Many recent scene text detection models are also segmentation-based, such as PSENet, TextSnake, and TextField. 

- A key contribution of this paper is a new module called Fiducial Point Expression (FOX) that generates a tighter representation of text instances using geometrical attributes like text center line, orientation, etc. This is different from representing text simply as boxes/quadrilaterals, and allows better detection of curved/arbitrary shaped text.

- The paper also proposes a Group Spatial and Channel Attention (GSCA) module to capture long-range dependencies in the feature maps. Attention mechanisms are commonly used in recent text detection models to augment feature representations.

- NASK achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500 datasets. These datasets contain curved/arbitrary text which is more challenging than oriented text in datasets like ICDAR 2015.

- Compared to regressing-based text detectors like EAST, NASK is more complex and slower but shows better performance on curved text, highlighting the advantages of segmentation-based methods for arbitrary shape text detection.

- NASK builds on recent ideas like attention and tighter shape representation using geometrical attributes, showing incremental innovation on top of existing state-of-the-art text detection techniques.

In summary, this paper demonstrates solid engineering and incremental innovation for the task of arbitrary shape text detection, achieving improved performance on curved text datasets compared to prior arts. The ideas are fairly aligned with current research direction in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Improving arbitrary shape text detection for more challenging cases, like extremely tiny, blurred, or distorted texts. The authors mention that detecting these types of texts remains difficult. They suggest exploring enhancements or modifications to their approach to better handle these cases.

- Incorporating contextual reasoning to improve detection accuracy. The authors mention that their approach focuses only on visual information within the input image patches. Incorporating contextual reasoning to understand text semantics and relationships could help resolve ambiguities and improve performance.

- Exploring other potential applications of their approach, beyond scene text detection. The authors suggest their two-stage segmentation approach and attention mechanism could be applicable to other fine-grained visual categorization problems.

- Improving computational efficiency for real-time applications. The authors' approach achieves reasonably fast speeds but mention further optimizations could be made for real-time use cases like augmented reality.

- Evaluating performance on other scene text datasets. The authors demonstrate results on two datasets but suggest more extensive evaluation across diverse datasets would further verify the robustness and generalizability of their approach.

In summary, the key directions are enhancing text detection for challenging cases, incorporating contextual reasoning, applying the approach to new domains, improving computational speed, and more extensive evaluation on diverse datasets. The authors propose their work as a solid baseline upon which future research can build to advance arbitrary shape text detection.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new two-stage scene text detection method called NASK (Need A Second looK) for detecting arbitrary shaped texts. NASK consists of a Text Instance Segmentation (TIS) module and a Fiducial pOint eXpression (FOX) module connected by Text RoI pooling. TIS uses a Fully Convolutional Network with a proposed Group Spatial and Channel Attention module (GSCA) to conduct text instance segmentation. GSCA captures long-range dependencies in the feature maps. Text RoI pooling then transforms the rectangle proposals from TIS into a fixed size input for the FOX module. FOX reconstructs text instances by predicting geometrical attributes like text center line, orientation, scale, etc. and generating fiducial points to represent the text shapes tightly. This allows NASK to detect arbitrary shaped texts accurately. Experiments on Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500 datasets show NASK achieves state-of-the-art performance for curved text detection. The ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GSCA module and two-stage architecture.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new two-stage segmentation based approach for detecting arbitrary shape text in images, called NASK (Need A Second looK). The method addresses some key challenges in scene text detection like handling long text instances, detecting tiny or curved texts, and dealing with varying scales. 

NASK consists of two main components - TIS and FOX. TIS is a Fully Convolutional Network with a Group Spatial and Channel Attention module that performs text instance segmentation to locate text regions. FOX is then applied on the cropped regions from TIS to reconstruct tighter representations of text instances using predicted geometrical attributes like text center line, orientation, scale etc. This two-stage approach allows handling varying scales better compared to a single network. Experiments on Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of NASK in detecting arbitrarily shaped scene texts. The attention mechanism in TIS helps improve feature representations while FOX allows tighter bounding compared to rectangular boxes. The end-to-end trainable two-stage approach makes NASK accurate and practical.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a two-stage segmentation based arbitrary text detector called NASK (Need A Second looK). The method consists of:

1) A Text Instance Segmentation (TIS) network based on FCN with a Group Spatial and Channel Attention module (GSCA) to capture long-range dependencies and generate text instance proposals. 

2) A Text RoI Pooling module to transform rectangle proposals to fixed size.

3) A Fiducial Point Expression module (FOX) to reconstruct text instances using predicted geometrical attributes like text center line, character scale and orientation. This allows tighter representation of arbitrary shaped texts. 

The two-stage approach first segments text instances and then refines their shapes. GSCA enhances feature representation by computing interactions between all spatial positions and channels. FOX reconstructs texts more precisely using fiducial points calculated from geometrical attributes. Experiments on Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Overall, NASK addresses problems like limited receptive fields, representation of arbitrary shapes, and varying scales using the proposed two-stage approach and modules.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problems and questions it is addressing are:

- Scene text detection remains challenging due to the diversity in text size, aspect ratios, orientations, etc. Specifically, the paper identifies three main challenges:

1) Standard CNNs have a limited receptive field and struggle to detect long text instances. 

2) Simple bounding boxes like rectangles/quadrilaterals do not accurately represent curved/arbitrary shaped text. 

3) Tiny text instances are difficult to accurately segment and describe.

- To address these challenges, the paper proposes a new two-stage segmentation-based text detection method called NASK:

1) The first stage (TIS) uses a FCN with a proposed Group Spatial and Channel Attention (GSCA) module to segment text instances. 

2) The second stage (FOX) reconstructs text instances more precisely using predicted geometrical attributes like text center line, orientation, etc.

- The main research questions appear to be:

1) Can a two-stage segmentation approach better handle issues like limited receptive fields, arbitrary shapes, and tiny text instances compared to standard one-stage methods?

2) Can the proposed GSCA module effectively capture long-range dependencies in the feature maps to improve text segmentation? 

3) Can representing text with fiducial points generated from geometrical attributes provide a tighter bounding shape than rectangles/quadrilaterals?

4) How does the proposed NASK method compare to prior state-of-the-art on curved text datasets like Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500 in terms of accuracy and efficiency?

In summary, the key focus is on developing a more robust segmentation-based scene text detection method that can handle major challenges like long text, arbitrary shapes, and tiny instances. The core innovations are the two-stage approach, GSCA module, and fiducial point representation.
