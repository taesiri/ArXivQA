# [All you need is a second look: Towards Tighter Arbitrary shape text   detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12436)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the main research question this paper tries to address is: How to build an effective text detection system that can handle arbitrary shaped texts in natural scene images?Specifically, the paper points out three main challenges in arbitrary shaped text detection:1) Standard convolutional networks have limited receptive fields and may fail to detect long text instances. 2) Simple representations using rectangles or quadrangles are not adequate for curved or irregular shaped texts. 3) Tiny text instances are difficult to precisely describe and detect.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a new two-stage segmentation based text detection system called NASK:1) The first stage (TIS) uses a convolutional network with a Group Spatial and Channel Attention module (GSCA) to locate text instances and generate bounding box proposals. 2) The second stage (FOX) takes the proposals and predicts geometric attributes like text center line, character orientation etc. to construct a tighter representation of the text using fiducial points.3) The two stages are connected through a Text RoI pooling layer.The key hypothesis is that the proposed NASK system with the GSCA module for capturing long-range contexts and the FOX module for generating fiducial point representations can achieve better performance on arbitrary shaped text detection compared to previous methods. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results, thus validating their approach.In summary, the main research question is how to effectively detect arbitrary shaped texts, and the key hypothesis is that the proposed two-stage NASK system can achieve improved performance through long-range contextual modeling and tighter fiducial point-based text representation.
