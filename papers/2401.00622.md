# [Federated Class-Incremental Learning with New-Class Augmented   Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00622)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among participants while preserving data privacy. However, prevailing FL methods assume static datasets, overlooking the dynamic expansion of data volume and diversification of classes in real-world scenarios. This leads to "catastrophic forgetting", where models overwrite previously learned knowledge upon assimilating new data, drastically undermining their performance. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes FedNASD, a novel federated class-incremental learning (FCIL) method to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in FL with expanding data over time. The key idea is to augment the knowledge transfer from historical models to current models using both old and new class information. Specifically, it combines the new class scores from current models with the outputs of historical models lacking new class information. This enriched representation of past and present knowledge is then distilled into the current models, enabling more comprehensive and precise knowledge transfer to mitigate forgetting.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes FedNASD, a novel FCIL method that harmonizes new and old class information during self-distillation to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
2) Provides theoretical analysis that proves FedNASD models old class scores as conditional probabilities and uses new class predictions to refine historical knowledge.
3) Empirical experiments demonstrate FedNASD substantially reduces average forgetting rate and improves global accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, FedNASD is the first FCIL method with theoretical support that effectively handles dynamic and expanding federated data by augmenting historical knowledge with new class information for more holistic self-distillation. Experiments validate its state-of-the-art performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes FedNASD, a federated class-incremental learning method that mitigates catastrophic forgetting by harmonizing new class scores with historical models' outputs during self-distillation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing FedNASD, a novel federated class-incremental learning method that mitigates catastrophic forgetting by harmonizing new class scores with the outputs of historical models during self-distillation.

2. Providing theoretical analyses that confirm the soundness of FedNASD's design. 

3. Conducting experiments that demonstrate FedNASD substantially reduces the average forgetting rate and markedly enhances global accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods on four datasets with two class-incremental settings.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the FedNASD method along with theoretical analysis to validate it and empirical results to demonstrate its effectiveness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Federated learning (FL): A distributed machine learning approach that enables collaborative model training among participants while preserving the privacy of raw data.

- Federated class-incremental learning (FCIL): An extension of FL to handle dynamically expanding data volumes and new classes over time, aiming to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.  

- Catastrophic forgetting: The phenomenon where a model loses previously learned knowledge upon assimilating new information.

- Self-distillation: A technique that retains knowledge about old classes by distilling it from soft targets extracted by historical models into current models.  

- New-class augmented self-distillation: The proposed method in this paper that augments the outputs of historical models with new class scores from current models before conducting self-distillation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

- Conditional probability modeling: One of the theoretical analyses provided in the paper, modeling old class scores from historical models as conditional probabilities absent new classes.

- Probability approximation: Another theoretical analysis that approximates new class scores from historical models using predictions from current models.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around federated learning, class-incremental learning, catastrophic forgetting, self-distillation, and the theoretical analyses around conditional probabilities and probability approximation.
