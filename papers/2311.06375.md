# [Image Classification using Combination of Topological Features and   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06375)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for image classification that integrates topological features extracted using persistent homology with deep neural networks. The key steps involve binarizing the MNIST images, applying image processing functions to capture shapes more effectively, constructing cubical complexes and filtrations to extract topological features, generating persistence diagrams, vectorizing them using methods like Betti curves and persistence landscapes, and finally feeding these vectorized topological signatures as inputs into CNN and MLP architectures alongside the original images. Multiple feature fusion schemes are explored - combining topo features from separate homology dimensions, fusing all dimensions, or concatenating the vectors. Experiments demonstrate that integrating topological features consistently improves MLP accuracy over using just pixel data, with the heat kernel vectorization delivering best performance - 98.4% fused accuracy. However for CNNs, topo features do not further boost accuracy over the 98.7% baseline. The concept of enriching deep nets with complementary topological descriptors is promising yet computationally expensive. This pioneering study on multi-class image classification paves the way for further research into synergistic combinations of geometric learning and neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes combining topological features extracted using persistent homology with deep learning architectures like CNNs and MLPs to classify images from the MNIST dataset, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to baseline MLP models that use only pixel data as input.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The application of topological features coding in different architectures of neural networks for multi-class image classification from the MNIST dataset. 

2. Computational experiments using a variety of persistence diagram vectorization methods and considered deep learning architectures and their combination on the MNIST dataset.

3. Improvement in the MNIST MLP accuracy compared with the baseline receiving only the original images as input. 

The paper extracts topological features from MNIST images using persistent homology and combines them with deep learning features from CNN and MLP architectures for multi-class classification. Different vectorization methods are used to encode the topological information in vector representations compatible with the neural networks. Experiments show that incorporating topological features can increase the accuracy of an MLP network on the MNIST dataset compared to using only the original images. This demonstrates the potential of leveraging topological data analysis to improve image classification performance.

The paper proposes an approach to integrate topological features extracted using TDA methods like persistent homology into neural network architectures for multi-class image classification on the MNIST dataset. It evaluates different vectorization techniques to represent the topological information in persistence diagrams and fuse them with deep learning features from CNNs and MLPs. The key focus is on assessing if topological data can enhance classification accuracy compared to using only the original image pixels.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using both 0-dimensional and 1-dimensional homology groups for image classification. Why do you think the 1-dimensional homology groups did not provide good accuracy on their own? What improvements could be made to better leverage 1-dimensional topological features?

2. The paper explores different vectorization techniques like persistence landscapes, persistence images etc. for turning persistence diagrams into machine learning compatible features. Which of these techniques worked best and why? What are some of the relative tradeoffs between the different vectorization methods?

3. The paper uses both MLP and CNN architectures for integrating topological features. The MLP sees improvements from added topology but CNN does not. What reasons may explain this discrepancy? How can the topological features be better integrated with CNNs?  

4. The paper computes multiple topological representations per image using different grayscale image transforms like height, radial, density functions. What is the motivation behind computing multiple diagrams per image? Does taking an ensemble improve result accuracy?

5. The paper uses a small subset of 5000 training images and 1250 test images from MNIST. How would results differ if full 60,000 image train and 10,000 image test sets were used instead? Would the gap between baseline MLP and topology-integrated MLP reduce?

6. How does the computational overhead of extracting topological features and vectorization compare to the neural net training itself? Is there a way to make the topology extraction process more efficient?

7. The paper uses standard MLP and CNN architectures for MNIST without any tuning. How much further could accuracy be improved by tuning neural architecture hyperparameters and adding more layers when using topological features? 

8. The topology integration helps MNIST classification here. Would similar benefits be seen for more complex image datasets like CIFAR-10? Are certain tasks better suited for topological feature augmentation than others?

9. For real-world applications, is the accuracy increase from topological methods worth the extra computational complexity? When would you recommend using this?

10. The paper fuses topology with neural networks. Are there any other major machine learning methods like random forests, SVM etc. that can be combined with topological feature representations? How would their results compare?
