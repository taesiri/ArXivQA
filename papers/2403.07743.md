# [Equipping Computational Pathology Systems with Artifact Processing   Pipelines: A Showcase for Computation and Performance Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07743)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Histopathology using glass slides is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis. However, artifacts can be introduced during slide preparation which can negatively impact computational pathology (CPATH) systems that analyze digitized whole slide images (WSIs). 
- Detecting and removing artifacts from WSIs is critical for enabling reliable automated diagnosis by CPATH systems.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an artifact detection pipeline using a mixture of experts (MoE) deep learning approach to detect 5 types of artifacts - damaged tissue, blur, folded tissue, bubbles, irrelevant blood.
- The pipeline takes a WSI as input, splits it into patches, classifies each patch using the MoE model, and post-processes the predictions to output:
   1) Artifact segmentation map 
   2) Artifact report for quality control
   3) Artifact-free region of interest (RoI) mask
   4) Artifact-refined WSI for downstream analysis
- The MoE approach trains 5 separate models, each an expert on detecting one artifact type. A fusion mechanism combines the predictions.
- Two MoE schemes are developed using CNNs (MobileNetV3) and Vision Transformers (ViT-Tiny).

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive study comparing MoE and multiclass approaches for artifact detection using state-of-the-art CNN and ViT architectures
- MoE provides better sensitivity in retaining artifact-free regions compared to multiclass models, at the cost of higher computational complexity
- Testing on out-of-distribution datasets from different hospitals/cancer types shows MoE generalizes better 
- Qualitative assessment by pathologists indicates MoE using CNNs has highest diagnostic usability
- Complete end-to-end pipeline taking WSI as input and providing refined output for reliable CPATH diagnosis
- Detailed analysis of performance vs computational tradeoffs to help guide selection based on application requirements

In summary, the paper proposes and validates a mixture of experts artifact detection pipeline to improve reliability of computational pathology systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a mixture of experts deep learning approach using DCNNs and ViTs to detect five common histological artifacts from whole slide images and refine them to equip computational pathology systems with the ability to make reliable diagnostic predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Development of four deep learning (DL) pipelines, including mixture of experts (MoE) and multiclass models using state-of-the-art DCNNs (MobileNet) and ViTs (ViT-Tiny), for detecting artifacts in histopathology images.

2. Evaluation of computational complexity trade-offs between the models - MoEs have better performance but higher complexity compared to multiclass models. 

3. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation on out-of-distribution datasets to assess generalization ability and robustness. The DCNN-based MoE was found to have the best overall performance.  

4. Provision of various outcomes from the artifact detection pipeline - segmentation maps, artifact reports, artifact-free region of interest masks, and artifact-refined images that can enable more reliable computational pathology predictions.

In summary, the main contribution is the development and evaluation of artifact detection pipelines using MoE and multiclass DL models to equip computational pathology systems to isolate anomalies and enable more reliable analysis. The DCNN-based MoE provided the best trade-off between performance and efficiency.
