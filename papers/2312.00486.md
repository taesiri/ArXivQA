# [REDUCR: Robust Data Downsampling Using Class Priority Reweighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00486)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces REDUCR, a new robust and efficient data downsampling algorithm for online batch selection during machine learning model training. REDUCR employs a weighted selection rule that evaluates how much training on a datapoint will affect the generalization error of specific underperforming classes. It does this by using per-class reference models and prioritizing classes with poor performance through a multiplicative weight update method. Experiments across image and text classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that REDUCR substantially improves worst-class accuracy and frequently exceeds state-of-the-art methods in average accuracy. For example, on the imbalanced Clothing1M dataset, REDUCR delivers around a 15% boost on worst-class performance compared to prior methods. The paper also includes detailed ablation studies and sensitivity analyses that provide further insight into the contribution of different algorithm components and hyperparameters. Overall, the work introduces a novel online selection approach specialized for preserving robustness to imbalance and distribution shift during aggressive data downsampling.
