# [Symbolic Numeric Planning with Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Planning problems involve finding a sequence of actions (plan) to reach a goal state from an initial state. Numeric planning extends classical planning to allow numeric variables that can be incremented/decremented. 
- Two main approaches exist - search-based methods that explore the state space, and symbolic methods that encode the problem as a logical formula for a bounded number of steps. However, existing symbolic encodings have limitations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new "symbolic pattern planning" encoding that generalizes existing rolled-up and relaxed-relaxed-exists encodings. 
- A pattern is defined as an arbitrary sequence of actions. The encoding introduces variables to represent the state after executing initial sequences of the pattern.
- This encoding allows multiple executions of actions, avoids mutexes between actions, and reduces the number of variables compared to other encodings.

Main Contributions:
- Defines the pattern encoding and proves it is correct and complete.
- Proves the pattern encoding dominates existing rolled-up and relaxed-relaxed-exists encodings - it will always find a solution with bound less than or equal to those encodings.
- Empirically evaluates the approach on International Planning Competition domains, showing it solves more problems and faster than other symbolic and search-based planners on numeric domains.
- Proposes using symbolic search over patterns and increasing bounds to bridge symbolic and search-based planning.
- Overall, provides a new foundation for research on symbolic planning encodings.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel pattern-based encoding for numeric planning that dominates prior encodings and shows strong empirical performance. The pattern formulation also opens up new research directions.
