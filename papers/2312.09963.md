# [Symbolic Numeric Planning with Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Planning problems involve finding a sequence of actions (plan) to reach a goal state from an initial state. Numeric planning extends classical planning to allow numeric variables that can be incremented/decremented. 
- Two main approaches exist - search-based methods that explore the state space, and symbolic methods that encode the problem as a logical formula for a bounded number of steps. However, existing symbolic encodings have limitations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new "symbolic pattern planning" encoding that generalizes existing rolled-up and relaxed-relaxed-exists encodings. 
- A pattern is defined as an arbitrary sequence of actions. The encoding introduces variables to represent the state after executing initial sequences of the pattern.
- This encoding allows multiple executions of actions, avoids mutexes between actions, and reduces the number of variables compared to other encodings.

Main Contributions:
- Defines the pattern encoding and proves it is correct and complete.
- Proves the pattern encoding dominates existing rolled-up and relaxed-relaxed-exists encodings - it will always find a solution with bound less than or equal to those encodings.
- Empirically evaluates the approach on International Planning Competition domains, showing it solves more problems and faster than other symbolic and search-based planners on numeric domains.
- Proposes using symbolic search over patterns and increasing bounds to bridge symbolic and search-based planning.
- Overall, provides a new foundation for research on symbolic planning encodings.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel pattern-based encoding for numeric planning that dominates prior encodings and shows strong empirical performance. The pattern formulation also opens up new research directions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel symbolic pattern planning approach for solving linear numeric planning problems, which combines and generalizes the strengths of rolled-up and relaxed-relaxed-exists encodings to produce encodings with fewer variables/clauses that provably dominate prior methods and enable comparatively better performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel symbolic approach for solving numeric planning problems called symbolic pattern planning. The key ideas are:

- Defining a "pattern" as an arbitrary sequence of actions in the planning problem. 

- Using this pattern to generalize and extend previous encodings like the rolled-up encoding and relaxed-relaxed-exists encoding.

- Showing theoretically that the pattern encoding dominates (is never worse than) these previous encodings.

- Providing a method to compute good patterns using the Asymptotic Relaxed Planning Graph.

- Implementing the pattern encoding in a planner called Patty and showing experimentally that it has very good performance compared to state-of-the-art planners on standard numeric planning benchmarks.

In summary, the pattern encoding framework is a novel and general approach for symbolic numeric planning that provides both theoretical and practical improvements over previous methods. The ability to use arbitrary patterns also opens up new possibilities for bridging symbolic and search-based planning techniques.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Symbolic planning
- Numeric planning 
- Pattern encoding
- Rolled-up encoding
- Relaxed-relaxed-exists (R2E) encoding
- Satisfiability encodings
- Bound on number of steps
- Asymptotic Relaxed Planning Graph (ARPG)
- International Planning Competition (IPC) benchmarks

The paper proposes a new "pattern encoding" approach for symbolic planning that generalizes previous rolled-up and R2E encodings. It introduces the concept of a pattern, which is an arbitrary sequence of actions, and shows how to encode numeric planning problems using this pattern in order to generate satisfiability formulas. Theoretical results show the pattern encoding dominates previous encodings, and experimental results on IPC benchmarks demonstrate strong performance compared to other planners. Key terms like symbolic planning, numeric planning, encodings, bounds, patterns, and benchmark comparisons reflect the core focus and contributions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the symbolic pattern planning method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper claims that the pattern encoding bridges the gap between symbolic and search-based planning. Can you further elaborate on how it does so and what are the key ideas that enable bridging this gap?

2. The paper introduces the concept of a "pattern" for planning encodings. What constitutes a pattern, what are the requirements on a pattern, and what degrees of freedom exist in choosing a pattern? How does the choice of pattern impact completeness and efficiency?

3. Theorem 1 states several domination results of the pattern encoding over other encodings. Could you walk through the key ideas behind one of these domination results in more detail? What are the subtleties involved? 

4. The asymptotic relaxed planning graph (ARPG) is used to compute the pattern ordering. How exactly does the ARPG construction work? What guarantees does it provide on the encoding when using its output pattern?

5. How does allowing multiple non-consecutive occurrences of an action in the pattern impact the encoding? Does this provide additional power over existing encodings and if so, how?

6. Theoretical analysis aside, what empirical evidence is provided in the paper that shows the benefits of the pattern encoding approach? Are there cases where it performs worse than existing methods?

7. The paper claims the pattern encoding approach provides a new starting point for symbolic planning research. What are some promising new research directions opened up by this approach that the paper did not have space to explore?

8. How does the pattern encoding compare to other recent symbolic planning encoding innovations in terms of theoretical domination results and empirical performance?

9. The choice of pattern impacts efficiency greatly. Are there methods provided in the paper for effectively searching the space of possible patterns? What guidance exists on choosing a good pattern?

10. A key benefit claimed is reducing the number of variables and clauses. Quantitatively, how much reduction is achieved over current state-of-the-art encodings on standard benchmarks? And what techniques enable these reductions?
