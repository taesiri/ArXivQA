# [ToolLLM: Facilitating Large Language Models to Master 16000+ Real-world   APIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16789)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question appears to be: 

How can we empower open-source large language models (LLMs) to skillfully master diverse APIs and effectively execute complex instructions involving external tools?

The key points related to this research question are:

- Current open-source LLMs lack sophistication in higher-level tasks like tool use compared to state-of-the-art proprietary models like ChatGPT. This is because existing instruction tuning focuses on basic language skills rather than tool use.

- The authors aim to facilitate tool-use capabilities in open-source LLMs through a new framework called ToolLLM. This involves data construction, model training, and evaluation.

- They create a new instruction tuning dataset called ToolBench covering 16,000+ real-world APIs. It involves both single-tool and complex multi-tool instructions.

- To aid data annotation, they develop a depth-first search decision tree (DFSDT) to enhance LLM planning and reasoning when searching for valid solutions. 

- They fine-tune the LLaMA model on this dataset to create ToolLLaMA, and develop an automatic evaluator ToolEval.

- Experiments show ToolLLaMA matches ChatGPT's performance on tool use despite less data, indicating the dataset and training effectively instill tool mastery in open-source LLMs.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that through tailored data and training, the tool-use deficiencies in open-source LLMs can be ameliorated to match proprietary models, which the results seem to validate. Enabling open-source LLMs to skillfully utilize APIs is the core focus.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of ToolLLM, a framework for enabling open-source large language models (LLMs) to master real-world APIs and effectively follow human instructions to use tools. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, containing over 16,000 real APIs spanning 49 categories. It includes both single-tool and complex multi-tool instructions, and the solutions are annotated using a novel depth-first search-based decision tree to enhance LLM planning and reasoning. 

2. ToolEval, an automatic evaluator for efficiently assessing tool-use capabilities of LLMs. It provides two key metrics - pass rate and win rate - that are shown to correlate well with human evaluation.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions the authors suggest:

- Develop more sophisticated methods to achieve parameter efficiency without sacrificing performance when tuning LLMs. The authors tried using LoRA for parameter-efficient tuning of LLaMA, but found it led to reduced performance. They suggest designing better methods that can improve parameter efficiency while maintaining strong performance.

- Explore integrating the API retriever and ToolLLaMA model into a more automated pipeline. The authors developed an API retriever to automatically recommend relevant APIs for each instruction, alleviating the need for manual API selection. They suggest further developing this into a fully automated tool-use pipeline. 

- Apply the depth-first search-based decision tree (DFSDT) strategy to other small-scale models beyond LLaMA. The authors found DFSDT significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of LLaMA. They suggest exploring using DFSDT for other smaller LLMs to enhance their planning and reasoning skills.

- Construct additional training data beyond the current 12k+ instruction-solution pairs. The authors found their current dataset size brought good generalization performance, but suggest constructing more data could further improve capabilities.

- Test the approach on more complex real-world scenarios and instructions. The current evaluation focused on constructed instructions. The authors suggest evaluating on complex real human instructions and tool use cases to further validate the method.

- Explore modifications and extensions to the DFSDT algorithm. The authors developed DFSDT as a general decision-making strategy, but suggest exploring variations like integrating learned node scoring could enhance it further.

- Apply the overall approach to other domains beyond tool use. The current work focused on tool use, but the authors suggest expanding it to other domains requiring complex reasoning and planning.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem/question it is addressing is:

How to empower open-source large language models (LLMs) to master the use of diverse APIs and execute complex instructions involving API interactions. 

The paper highlights that current open-source LLMs such as LLaMA and Vicuna still lack sophisticated capabilities for using APIs and executing higher-level tasks that require tool usage, compared to proprietary state-of-the-art LLMs like ChatGPT. The underlying reasons are:

2) Existing datasets/methods for training tool usage skills have limitations in terms of:
- Limited diversity and number of real-world APIs involved
- Constraint to single-tool instructions rather than complex multi-tool scenarios
- Inferior prompting strategies for model planning/reasoning compared to proprietary LLMs

To address this gap, the paper introduces ToolLLM, a general framework for constructing a high-quality instruction tuning dataset centered on tool usage, training a model (ToolLLaMA) on this dataset, and accurately evaluating its tool usage capabilities. The key components include:

- ToolBench dataset containing instructions spanning thousands of real-world APIs across diverse categories and both single/multi-tool scenarios.

- A novel depth-first search decision tree method to boost planning for LLMs during dataset construction. 

- ToolEval, an automatic evaluator to efficiently assess model performance on tool usage.

- Experiments showing ToolLLaMA matches ChatGPT on ToolEval, demonstrating the ability to unlock sophisticated tool skills in open-source LLMs.

In summary, the paper focuses on empowering open-source LLMs with the tool usage and instruction execution capabilities previously only seen in proprietary LLMs by constructing specialized data/methods.
