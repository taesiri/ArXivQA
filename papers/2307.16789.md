# [ToolLLM: Facilitating Large Language Models to Master 16000+ Real-world   APIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16789)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question appears to be: 

How can we empower open-source large language models (LLMs) to skillfully master diverse APIs and effectively execute complex instructions involving external tools?

The key points related to this research question are:

- Current open-source LLMs lack sophistication in higher-level tasks like tool use compared to state-of-the-art proprietary models like ChatGPT. This is because existing instruction tuning focuses on basic language skills rather than tool use.

- The authors aim to facilitate tool-use capabilities in open-source LLMs through a new framework called ToolLLM. This involves data construction, model training, and evaluation.

- They create a new instruction tuning dataset called ToolBench covering 16,000+ real-world APIs. It involves both single-tool and complex multi-tool instructions.

- To aid data annotation, they develop a depth-first search decision tree (DFSDT) to enhance LLM planning and reasoning when searching for valid solutions. 

- They fine-tune the LLaMA model on this dataset to create ToolLLaMA, and develop an automatic evaluator ToolEval.

- Experiments show ToolLLaMA matches ChatGPT's performance on tool use despite less data, indicating the dataset and training effectively instill tool mastery in open-source LLMs.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that through tailored data and training, the tool-use deficiencies in open-source LLMs can be ameliorated to match proprietary models, which the results seem to validate. Enabling open-source LLMs to skillfully utilize APIs is the core focus.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of ToolLLM, a framework for enabling open-source large language models (LLMs) to master real-world APIs and effectively follow human instructions to use tools. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, containing over 16,000 real APIs spanning 49 categories. It includes both single-tool and complex multi-tool instructions, and the solutions are annotated using a novel depth-first search-based decision tree to enhance LLM planning and reasoning. 

2. ToolEval, an automatic evaluator for efficiently assessing tool-use capabilities of LLMs. It provides two key metrics - pass rate and win rate - that are shown to correlate well with human evaluation.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem/question it is addressing is:

How to empower open-source large language models (LLMs) to master the use of diverse APIs and execute complex instructions involving API interactions. 

The paper highlights that current open-source LLMs such as LLaMA and Vicuna still lack sophisticated capabilities for using APIs and executing higher-level tasks that require tool usage, compared to proprietary state-of-the-art LLMs like ChatGPT. The underlying reasons are:

1) Current instruction tuning of open-source LLMs has focused more on enhancing basic language skills rather than tool usage skills specifically. 

2) Existing datasets/methods for training tool usage skills have limitations in terms of:
- Limited diversity and number of real-world APIs involved
- Constraint to single-tool instructions rather than complex multi-tool scenarios
- Inferior prompting strategies for model planning/reasoning compared to proprietary LLMs

To address this gap, the paper introduces ToolLLM, a general framework for constructing a high-quality instruction tuning dataset centered on tool usage, training a model (ToolLLaMA) on this dataset, and accurately evaluating its tool usage capabilities. The key components include:

- ToolBench dataset containing instructions spanning thousands of real-world APIs across diverse categories and both single/multi-tool scenarios.

- A novel depth-first search decision tree method to boost planning for LLMs during dataset construction. 

- ToolEval, an automatic evaluator to efficiently assess model performance on tool usage.

- Experiments showing ToolLLaMA matches ChatGPT on ToolEval, demonstrating the ability to unlock sophisticated tool skills in open-source LLMs.

In summary, the paper focuses on empowering open-source LLMs with the tool usage and instruction execution capabilities previously only seen in proprietary LLMs by constructing specialized data/methods.
