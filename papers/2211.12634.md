# [PNI : Industrial Anomaly Detection using Position and Neighborhood   Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12634)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is: 

Can incorporating position and neighborhood information into the modeling of normal feature distributions improve anomaly detection and localization performance in industrial inspection tasks?

The key points are:

- Existing methods model the anomaly score of image patches independently, without considering the correlation between neighboring feature patches or the expected positions of normal features. 

- This paper proposes to model the normal feature distribution conditioned on position and neighborhood information, to better capture what is "normal" for a given context.

- The neighborhood information is modeled using an MLP network on local feature neighborhoods. 

- The position information is modeled by building histograms of normal features at each spatial location.

- These conditional distributions are combined to estimate anomaly likelihood.

- A refinement network trained on synthetic defects is used to enhance anomaly maps.

The central hypothesis is that by incorporating position and neighborhood context into modeling normal features, the method can better discriminate anomalies and achieve state-of-the-art performance on industrial inspection tasks. Experiments on MVTec AD and other datasets aim to validate this hypothesis.
