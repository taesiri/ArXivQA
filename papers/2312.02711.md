# [HARMONIOUS -- Human-like reactive motion control and multimodal   perception for humanoid robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02711)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents HARMONIOUS, a real-time reactive motion control system for the upper body of a dual-arm humanoid robot with 17 degrees of freedom. The system enables safe and effective human-robot interaction by producing human-like minimum jerk movements while simultaneously avoiding obstacles perceived through visual, proximity, and tactile sensors. These multimodal sensory inputs are unified into a representation that dynamically generates motion constraints. The core is a quadratic programming formulation that seeks joint velocity commands respecting multiple constraints while minimizing velocity magnitudes. Obstacles are mapped as additional constraints in a distributed fashion, resembling peripersonal space representations. HARMONIOUS was systematically evaluated in simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating superior performance in cluttered and human proximity scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods. It can handle separate or coordinated tasks for the arms, exploit kinematic redundancy to avoid collisions while fulfilling tasks, and easily incorporate additional constraints. The system was shown at scale during an interactive game with a human, successfully coping with unstructured physical interaction and simultaneously processing obstacles from all sensory modalities.
