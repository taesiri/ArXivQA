# SPRING: Situated Conversation Agent Pretrained with Multimodal Questions   from Incremental Layout Graph

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1. Whether a conversational agent can be pretrained to better understand visual attributes and spatial relations in complex situated scenarios by generating multimodal question-answer pairs from incremental layout graphs. 2. Whether the multimodal question-answering pretraining tasks along with curriculum learning can improve the agent's ability to reason about visual attributes and spatial relations when responding in a conversational setting.3. Whether the proposed SPRING model outperforms existing state-of-the-art conversational agents on benchmark datasets like SIMMC 1.0 and SIMMC 2.0 by incorporating the incremental layout graph-based pretraining.In summary, the central hypothesis is that situational conversational agents can be significantly improved by pretraining them on multimodal QA pairs generated automatically from incremental layout graphs of the scenes, along with curriculum learning. The SPRING model is proposed to test this hypothesis against existing conversational agents on complex multimodal dialogue datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposes a novel method named SPRING to pretrain a situated conversation agent. SPRING generates multimodal question-answering (MQA) pairs from incremental layout graphs (ILGs) to improve the agent's capabilities for reasoning about visual attributes and spatial relations of objects in complex scenes. - Designs two types of MQA pretraining tasks - visual QA and spatial QA, with 3 subtasks each. The QA pairs are automatically generated by traversing nodes in the ILG, and get difficulty labels based on number of nodes spanned. - Uses curriculum learning strategy during pretraining, where easier QA pairs are presented first based on difficulty labels, then harder ones are introduced gradually.- Conducts experiments on SIMMC 1.0 and 2.0 datasets. SPRING significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on various metrics, especially on responses requiring visual attributes and spatial relations.- The proposed ILG generation method and MQA pretraining approach are unsupervised, without needing extra human annotations. This allows improving situated conversation agents without additional labeling effort.In summary, the key innovation is using ILGs to automatically create QA pairs for pretraining, which enhances the agent's ability to generate accurate visual attributes and spatial relations in responses. The pretraining strategy and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.
