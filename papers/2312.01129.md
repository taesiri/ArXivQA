# [ControlDreamer: Stylized 3D Generation with Multi-View ControlNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01129)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text-to-3D generation methods face challenges in aligning texture to geometry when refining an initial 3D model, often resulting in artifacts. 
- They are also limited in generating creative 3D model geometries and styles due to dataset biases and mode-seeking behavior during training.

Proposed Solution:
- A two-stage pipeline called ControlDreamer for generating stylized 3D models from text prompts:
   - Stage 1: Generate a neural radiance field (NeRF) from a geometry prompt and convert it to a mesh 
   - Stage 2: Refine the mesh's texture and geometry using a style prompt with a novel Multi-View ControlNet
- Multi-View ControlNet is a depth-aware conditional diffusion model built on top of the frozen MVDream model. It encodes multi-view depth maps to align textures to initial geometry.

Main Contributions:
- ControlDreamer pipeline that combines NeRF creation and multi-view stylization for high-quality 3D generation
- More practical and efficient training of Multi-View ControlNet compared to prior models 
- Ability of Multi-View ControlNet to align diverse textures and geometries, overcoming dataset biases
- Improved generation of creative 3D models with ControlDreamer, validated on a curated text benchmark

In summary, this paper introduces a two-stage text-to-3D pipeline called ControlDreamer that leverages a depth-aware multi-view diffusion network to generate high-quality stylized 3D models. It addresses limitations in aligning geometry and texture as well as creative geometry generation compared to previous approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces ControlDreamer, a two-stage pipeline for generating stylized 3D models from text prompts by first creating a geometry-focused neural radiance field using MVDream and then refining it into a mesh with texture and style details using a novel depth-aware multi-view diffusion model called MV-ControlNet.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of ControlDreamer, a two-stage pipeline for generating stylized 3D models from text prompts. Specifically:

1) ControlDreamer combines generating a neural radiance field (NeRF) from a geometry prompt, converting it to a mesh, and then refining both geometry and texture using a style prompt. This two-stage approach helps overcome limitations of previous text-to-3D methods in aligning geometry and textures.

2) A key component is the multi-view ControlNet (MV-ControlNet), a depth-aware multi-view diffusion model. MV-ControlNet is trained on dataset generated from filtered text prompts and helps align diverse geometries and styles in the 3D models.

3) ControlDreamer outperforms previous text-to-3D pipelines, as evidenced both qualitatively in generating more creative and customized 3D models, as well as quantitatively on a text alignment benchmark. The two-stage pipeline and MV-ControlNet help overcome biases and enable counterfactual 3D generation.

In summary, the main contribution is the full ControlDreamer pipeline, enabled by the efficient and effective MV-ControlNet, for generating multi-view consistent, stylized 3D models from text prompts.
