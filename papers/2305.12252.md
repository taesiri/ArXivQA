# [Boosting Human-Object Interaction Detection with Text-to-Image Diffusion   Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12252)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces DiffHOI, a novel human-object interaction (HOI) detection framework that leverages the generative and representative capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to improve HOI detection performance. The authors first analyze limitations of current HOI datasets and models, identifying issues like class imbalance, small data size, limited diversity, and the inability to effectively capture subtle contextual cues that are critical for disambiguating interactions. The core of DiffHOI involves extracting verb-associated contextual representations from a frozen Stable Diffusion model and global scene-level features from CLIP, which are adapted and incorporated into a transformer-based HOI detection pipeline to enhance interaction modeling. Furthermore, the authors present SynHOI, a large-scale, class-balanced, and highly diverse synthetic HOI dataset comprising over 140K images generated using an automatic pipeline. Experiments demonstrate DiffHOI with SynHOI achieves new state-of-the-art results on HICO-DET for both regular detection (41.5 mAP) and zero-shot detection across multiple protocols. Ablations validate the usefulness of key components like the SynHOI data and diffusion+CLIP representations. Overall, this work makes notable progress in HOI detection through a novel integration of generative diffusion models and introduces an effective synthetic data generation paradigm to overcome data limitations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new HOI detection method, DiffHOI, that leverages representations from a text-to-image diffusion model and introduces SynHOI, a large-scale synthetic HOI dataset, to address data imbalance issues and boost HOI detection performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new method called \texttt{DiffHOI} for human-object interaction (HOI) detection, which leverages the generative and representation capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to enhance HOI detection performance. 

2. It releases a new synthetic HOI dataset called \texttt{SynHOI} which is class-balanced, large-scale, highly diverse, and contains high-quality annotations. This helps address the long-tail issue in existing HOI datasets. It also develops an automatic pipeline to scale up the generation of diverse and accurate HOI data.

3. Extensive experiments show that the proposed \texttt{DiffHOI} method combined with the \texttt{SynHOI} dataset significantly improves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection tasks, in both regular and zero-shot settings. For example, it achieves 41.50 mAP on the HICO-DET benchmark, outperforming prior arts by a large margin.

In summary, the main contribution is a new HOI detection method leveraging diffusion models, plus a synthetic dataset to enhance HOI detection, which together push state-of-the-art HOI performance to new levels.
