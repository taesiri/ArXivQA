# [Better than classical? The subtle art of benchmarking quantum machine   learning models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07059)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is an overwhelming belief emerging from small-scale benchmark studies that quantum machine learning models outperform classical ones. However, benchmarking has many pitfalls and the results can depend strongly on subtle details of the experimental design. 
- The paper questions whether current benchmarking practices can give robust insights about the potential of quantum machine learning ideas.

Methodology:
- The authors systematically benchmark 12 popular quantum machine learning models from 11 influential papers against classical baselines. The models span three families: quantum neural networks, quantum kernel methods and quantum convolutional neural networks.

- Six types of classification datasets with a total of 160 individual variants are used, most of which are synthetically generated with tunable properties. Datasets aim to cover diverse function relationships and manifold structures.

- Extensive hyperparameter optimization using grid search with 5-fold cross-validation is performed for every model and dataset. Convergence criteria for training are standardized.

Results:
- Classical out-of-the-box machine learning models (MLP, SVM, CNN) consistently outperform the quantum models. There are no signs of overfitting or better scaling in the quantum models.

- Removing entanglement from quantum models often does not deteriorate performance. This questions whether "quantumness" plays a big role for the small-scale learning tasks benchmarked.  

- Hybrid quantum-classical models perform similarly to their classical hosts, suggesting the replaced components play a comparable role. The extra components in quantum convolutional neural networks seem to degrade the performance of classical CNNs.

- Two models based on amplitude embedding struggle throughout, likely due to an inductive bias misaligned with the tasks. Most models perform poorly on a simple linearly separable dataset.

Conclusions:  
- Benchmarking methodology and the choice of meaningful data are subtle but crucial factors that require more attention in quantum ML research. Software and hardware improvements are important to scale studies.

- Current ideas for near-term quantum machine learning do not seem to provide evidence of an advantage over classical machine learning baselines, but further investigations need to focus on understanding model inductive biases.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper conducts a large-scale benchmark study of 12 popular quantum machine learning models on 160 classification datasets, finding that out-of-the-box classical machine learning models consistently outperform them and that removing entanglement often does not degrade performance, questioning whether "quantumness" helps for small learning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a large-scale benchmark study that systematically tests 12 popular quantum machine learning models on 160 datasets grouped into 10 classification benchmarks. The main contributions are:

1) The paper finds that out-of-the-box classical machine learning models (neural networks, SVMs, CNNs) consistently outperform the quantum models on the small-scale datasets tested. This contrasts the overwhelming evidence from the literature that quantum models outperform classical ones. 

2) Removing entanglement from quantum models often results in equal or better performance compared to the original models. This suggests that for the tasks considered, "quantumness" may not be the crucial ingredient for performance.

3) The paper identifies and discusses several open questions and challenges that emerge from the benchmark results regarding quantum model design, such as: what makes data reuploading and hybrid models work, why amplitude encoding struggles, why quantum models fail on simple linearly separable data, what distance measures do quantum kernels induce, etc.

4) The paper emphasizes the need for more methodological rigour, transparency and critical assessment in quantum ML benchmarking studies in order to gain robust and meaningful insights. This includes extensive hyperparameter tuning, consideration of benchmarking pitfalls, testing variations of models, and asking focused questions that benchmarks can answer.

In summary, while not showing quantum advantages, the paper uncovers insights into strengths and weaknesses of current quantum ML ideas, and sets out an agenda for more rigorous quantum ML benchmarking.
