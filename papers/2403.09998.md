# [FBPT: A Fully Binary Point Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09998)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Transformers have shown great success in NLP and vision tasks, but applying them to point cloud processing poses challenges due to the unique properties of point clouds (irregular, unordered, etc.). 
- Prior works have not proposed a fully binarized point cloud transformer which can significantly reduce model size and computational costs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Fully Binary Point Cloud Transformer (FBPT) which binarizes both weights and activations to 1-bit.
- Identified key issues with naively binarizing point cloud transformers: degradation of attention module, difficulty fitting activations, and uniform attention distribution.
- Proposes solutions:
   - Fine-grained binarization for self-attention activations
   - Dynamic-static hybrid binarization to handle variable activations
   - 3-stage hierarchical training to prevent attention degradation

Contributions:
- First fully binarized point cloud transformer network
- Analysis of bottlenecks in binarizing point cloud transformers
- Solutions for those bottlenecks including fine-grained binarization, dynamic-static hybrid binarization, and hierarchical training
- Demonstrated effectiveness on point cloud classification (90.9% accuracy) and place recognition tasks
- Reductions of 87.2% in model size and 80.2% in FLOPs compared to full-precision counterpart

In summary, the paper identifies unique challenges in binarizing point cloud transformers and contributes novel techniques to address them. Experiments validate the accuracy, efficiency and generalization ability of the proposed FBPT model.
