 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes the task of simulating user satisfaction to enhance the evaluation of task-oriented dialogue systems. The authors argue that user simulation allows for large-scale automatic evaluation, but prior simulations simply provide slots mechanically and do not measure dialogue quality well. To make simulations more human-like, they incorporate predicting user satisfaction and actions. The authors collect a new dataset called USS with 6,800 dialogues labeled for satisfaction on a 5-point scale. The dialogues span multiple domains like e-commerce, reservations, and movie recommendations. They provide three baselines: feature-based, RNN-based with hierarchical GRUs, and BERT-based models.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel task of simulating user satisfaction for evaluating task-oriented dialogue systems. The goal is to enhance the evaluation capability of user simulations and make them more human-like by incorporating user satisfaction prediction and user action prediction. 

The authors first do a user study to analyze the characteristics of user satisfaction in task-oriented dialogues. They find that user dissatisfaction is mainly caused by the system failing to understand or address the user's needs. Different degrees of satisfaction also lead to different user action sequences. 

Based on these observations, the authors collect and release a new dataset called USS with 6,800 dialogues labeled for exchange-level and dialogue-level user satisfaction on a 5-point scale. This is a multi-domain dataset spanning real-world e-commerce, WOZ experiments, and movie recommendations.

Three baseline methods are proposed for user satisfaction and action prediction - feature-based, RNN-based, and BERT-based. Experiments show distributed representations outperform feature-based approaches, with BERT having the best cross-domain generalization thanks to pre-training.

This novel task and dataset enable research into building more human-like user simulations. The satisfaction modeling and action prediction components allow simulating user behavior better based on the dialogue context. Overall, this work enhances the evaluation power of simulations for task-oriented systems.
