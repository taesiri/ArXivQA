## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving user satisfaction prediction and exploring how to combine it with action prediction. The paper proposes this as a novel task, so there is room for improvement in developing models for satisfaction and action prediction. The authors suggest investigating how to integrate the two tasks.

- Generating responses based on predicted user satisfaction. The paper mentions that generating appropriate system responses conditioned on predicted user satisfaction levels remains an open challenge. 

- Incorporating external knowledge and personas into user simulations. The authors suggest grounding user simulators with knowledge bases and consistent personas could make them more human-like.

- Applying the data and methods to related tasks like user satisfaction modeling, dialogue policy learning, and hand-off prediction. The annotated satisfaction data could facilitate research in these areas beyond user simulation.

- Studying the textual explanations collected for the JDDC satisfaction labels. These could provide insights for user studies and interpretability of evaluation models.

- Improving cross-domain generalization of satisfaction prediction models, which was limited in the baselines. Pre-training approaches like BERT seemed promising for this.

In summary, the key suggestions are to build on the novel satisfaction prediction and action modeling task, integrate those predictions into a full user simulator, ground the simulator with knowledge and personas, apply the data to related problems, and analyze the human rationales that were collected. Advancing satisfaction prediction itself, especially for cross-domain generalization, is also highlighted.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes the task of simulating user satisfaction to enhance the evaluation of task-oriented dialogue systems. The authors argue that user simulation allows for large-scale automatic evaluation, but prior simulations simply provide slots mechanically and do not measure dialogue quality well. To make simulations more human-like, they incorporate predicting user satisfaction and actions. The authors collect a new dataset called USS with 6,800 dialogues labeled for satisfaction on a 5-point scale. The dialogues span multiple domains like e-commerce, reservations, and movie recommendations. They provide three baselines: feature-based, RNN-based with hierarchical GRUs, and BERT-based models. Experiments show that distributed representations outperform features, and GRUs achieve the best in-domain satisfaction prediction while BERT generalizes better across domains. Overall, this paper introduces a novel task of simulating satisfaction for evaluation, provides a new multi-domain dataset, and establishes baseline methods.

In summary, the key ideas are:
1) Propose simulating user satisfaction to enhance evaluation of task-oriented dialog systems through more human-like user simulation 
2) Create a large annotated dataset called USS with satisfaction labels for 6,800 dialogues in multiple domains
3) Establish feature-based, GRU, and BERT baselines, with BERT showing stronger cross-domain generalization
4) Overall goal is increasing the evaluation power and human-likeness of user simulation for task-oriented dialogue systems

The paper proposes the task of simulating user satisfaction for evaluating task-oriented dialogue systems. To enable research on this task, the authors collect a new dataset called USS, which contains 6,800 dialogues labeled with 5-level user satisfaction ratings. The USS dataset spans multiple domains including e-commerce, reservations, and movie recommendations.
