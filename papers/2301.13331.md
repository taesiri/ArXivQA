# [Neural Operator: Is data all you need to model the world? An insight   into the impact of Physics Informed Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13331)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the central research question is: How can data-driven machine learning approaches, specifically neural operators, complement conventional numerical methods for solving engineering and physics problems modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs)? The key hypothesis seems to be that neural operator architectures can provide faster and fairly accurate alternatives to conventional numerical methods for approximating solutions to PDEs, while also having certain advantages like discretization invariance and resolution invariance.The paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of both conventional techniques like finite element methods and finite difference methods, as well as newer machine learning-based approaches like physics-informed neural networks and various neural operator models. It highlights the potential of neural operators to overcome limitations of conventional numerical solvers and some existing ML techniques, while also noting pitfalls of data-driven approaches.The paper focuses on characterizing different neural operator architectures and their performance on approximating solutions for key PDEs encountered in physics and engineering problems. It aims to highlight opportunities for further developing these computational approaches to tackle problems in applied physics.In summary, the central research question is about understanding how neural operators can complement conventional numerical solvers for PDEs, while the key hypothesis is that they can provide faster, fairly accurate alternatives with certain advantages. The paper aims to comprehensively characterize these architectures and their applications to physics problems.
