# [FAQ: Feature Aggregated Queries for Transformer-based Video Object   Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08319)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to improve video object detection performance using Transformer-based models. 

The key hypothesis is that aggregating and enhancing the quality of the queries for the Transformer decoder can help handle issues like feature degradation in videos and improve detection accuracy.

Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates two main ideas:

1) Vanilla Query Aggregation (VQA): Aggregating queries from neighboring frames using a weighted average based on feature similarity.

2) Dynamic Query Aggregation (DQA): Generating dynamic queries adapted to each frame's features, instead of using fixed random queries. The dynamic queries are aggregated across frames.

The overall goal is to improve video object detection accuracy by focusing on the unique properties of Transformer-based detectors, namely the quer


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a module to aggregate the queries for Transformer-based video object detectors in order to improve their performance on video tasks. Specifically:

- They propose a vanilla query aggregation (VQA) module that aggregates the queries from neighboring frames using weighted averaging to enhance the query representations. 

- They extend VQA to a dynamic query aggregation (DQA) module that generates and aggregates queries based on the features of the input frames rather than using randomly initialized queries. 

- DQA contains basic queries that are randomly initialized and dynamic queries that are generated from the basic queries using a mapping function based on the input frame features.

- During training, they aggregate both dynamic and basic queries but only use the dynamic queries during inference.

- They show DQA can be integrated into various Transformer-based detectors like Deformable DETR and improve their performance on video object detection tasks like ImageNet VID by over 2.4% mAP.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing query aggregation modules specifically designed for Transformer architectures to improve their applicability and performance on video domains. This provides a new perspective compared to prior work on aggregating features or detection results.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Feature Aggregated Queries (FAQ) to improve Transformer-based video object detectors by aggregating and enhancing the query features from neighboring frames to handle issues like motion blur and occlusion.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in video object detection:

- This paper focuses on improving query-based object detectors like DETR for video. Most prior work has focused on adapting other types of models like Faster R-CNN or CenterNet to video. 

- The main idea is to aggregate queries across frames to handle motion and occlusion. Other methods typically aggregate features across frames. Aggregating queries is a novel approach.

- The proposed query aggregation modules are model-agnostic and can work with different Transformer detectors. Other video detection methods are often tailored to specific base detectors.

- Both a simple weighted averaging module and more advanced dynamic query generation method are proposed. The dynamic method adapts queries to each frame.

- The method achieves strong results, outperforming prior feature aggregation techniques like TransVOD when added to DETR models. This validates the efficacy of query aggregation.

- The computational overhead of the proposed modules is limited, making them practical. Other techniques like adding a separate temporal encoder can be more costly.

Overall, this query aggregation approach is innovative compared to prior video detection research. Evaluating on multiple DETR models shows the general value of this idea. The results demonstrate aggregating queries can be more effective than aggregating features for handling video challenges. This provides a new direction for adapting Transformer detectors to video analysis.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the performance on small objects: The authors note that their method performs worse on small objects compared to medium and large objects. They suggest exploring ways to incorporate more local or regional information when generating the dynamic queries, in order to better handle small objects. 

- Extending to other Transformer-based detectors: The authors propose their method as a general module that can be integrated into various Transformer-based object detectors. They suggest applying it to other recent Transformer detectors besides the ones explored in the paper.

- Exploring different query initialization strategies: The authors use basic randomly initialized queries as the basis for generating the dynamic queries. They suggest exploring other strategies for initializing or constructing the basic queries.

- Applying to other video tasks: The authors focus on video object detection, but suggest their idea of enhancing queries via aggregation could be beneficial for other video tasks like segmentation, tracking, etc.

- Optimizing the model complexity: The authors analyze the model complexity and note it does not increase much. But they suggest exploring ways to further optimize or reduce the complexity.

- Analyzing the effect of different components: The authors ablate some components like the aggregation methods, but suggest more analysis could be done on the effect of different design choices.

- Visualizing and understanding the query representations: The authors provide some visualization but suggest more work could be done to understand what the aggregated queries are representing.

So in summary, the main future directions are improving performance (especially on small objects), extending the approach to other models and tasks, analyzing and optimizing the components, and further understanding the learned query representations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes new methods to improve Transformer-based object detectors for video object detection. The key idea is to aggregate the queries in the Transformer decoder based on features from neighboring frames to handle issues like motion blur or occlusion. First, they propose a vanilla query aggregation module that averages the queries from nearby frames using learned weights. Then, they extend this to a more advanced dynamic query aggregation module. This generates new dynamic queries from basic randomly initialized queries based on the input frame features. The weights for aggregating queries are also learnable. 

Experiments validate the benefits of the proposed query aggregation modules. When integrated into state-of-the-art Transformer detectors like Deformable DETR, performance on ImageNet VID improves by over 2% mAP. The modules are light-weight and only introduce small overhead. Analysis shows the advantage of building queries adaptive to the input frames versus random initialization. Overall, this work provides a simple yet effective way to adapt powerful Transformer object detectors from images to video by aggregating queries using spatial-temporal context. The proposed query aggregation is a general framework that can be integrated into many existing vision Transformer architectures.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes Feature Aggregated Queries (FAQ) to improve Transformer-based video object detectors. The key ideas are:

1. Aggregating queries across frames can help handle feature degradation in videos. Unlike prior work that aggregates features, the paper aggregates the queries in the Transformer decoder. 

2. A vanilla query aggregation (VQA) module is introduced, which aggregates queries from neighboring frames using a weighted average based on feature similarities. 

3. A more advanced dynamic query aggregation (DQA) module is proposed, which generates dynamic queries conditioned on the input features before aggregating them. This builds a stronger relationship between the queries and input frames.

4. Extensive experiments on ImageNet VID show the proposed FAQ method consistently improves various Transformer detectors by 2-4% mAP. The DQA module in particular outperforms prior feature aggregation methods like TransVOD.

In summary, the key novelty is aggregating queries instead of features for video detection using Transformers, especially the dynamic conditioned query generation. This simple yet effective FAQ approach advances the state-of-the-art for this task.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of feature degradation in video object detection compared to image object detection. Specifically, it is proposing a new approach to improve video object detection performance for Transformer-based object detectors.

The key points are:

- Video object detection suffers from feature degradation due to motion between frames, which is not an issue in static image object detection. Existing methods try to address this by feature aggregation across frames or post-processing of per-frame predictions.

- Recent Transformer-based detectors like DETR perform well on image detection but have not been extensively explored for video. The paper aims to improve these Transformer detectors for video tasks.

- The main idea is to improve the quality of the decoder queries in Transformer detectors by aggregating queries across frames. This is different from prior work that aggregates features or predictions.

- A vanilla query aggregation (VQA) module is proposed to aggregate queries by weighting based on feature similarity of frames. 

- This is extended to a dynamic query aggregation (DQA) module that generates queries conditioned on frame features, allowing more adaptive aggregation.

- Experiments show integrating their proposed modules into Transformer detectors significantly improves performance on the ImageNet VID dataset, outperforming prior feature aggregation methods like TransVOD.

In summary, the key novelty is improving video object detection for Transformers by aggregating decoder queries across frames, rather than aggregating features or predictions as in prior work. The results demonstrate this is an effective approach.
