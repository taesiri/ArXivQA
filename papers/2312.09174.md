# [Towards Efficient Quantum Anomaly Detection: One-Class SVMs using   Variable Subsampling and Randomized Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09174)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores approaches to enhance the scalability of quantum one-class support vector machines (SVMs) for anomaly detection. The authors replicate prior work showing a 20% improvement in average precision with a quantum SVM and then propose two methods aiming to reduce the quadratic time complexity relative to data size: randomized measurements and variable subsampling ensembles. The former uses random basis rotations and classical post-processing to efficiently compute kernel matrices, while the latter trains SVM ensembles on varied-size data subsets. Experiments on synthetic and credit card fraud data reveal marginal quantum improvements over a classical SVM. While the variable subsampling ensemble demonstrates stability and notable reductions in training time, the randomized measurements exhibit high variance. The authors conclude that combinations of these approaches may further optimize performance and scalability. Key results show variable subsampling slashes training times by 95% and mitigates testing time growth compared to standard quantum SVMs. However, quantum improvements over classical techniques are incremental for the explored data. This suggests scalable quantum SVMs remain a promising but challenging direction for anomaly detection.
