## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "HierCode: A Lightweight Hierarchical Codebook for Zero-shot Chinese Text Recognition":

Problem:
- Traditional one-hot encoding methods for Chinese text recognition (CTR) fail to capture the rich hierarchical information (structures and radicals) within Chinese characters. This leads to loss of critical information.
- One-hot encoding models cannot perform zero-shot recognition of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) characters, which is crucial given the large and ever-growing Chinese lexicon. 
- One-hot encoding leads to huge classification layers, making deployment difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose HierCode, a hierarchical codebook that assigns unique multi-hot encodings to each Chinese character by encoding structures and radicals in a binary tree.
- Leverage prototype learning on radicals to get distinctive and robust representations. 
- Use similarity matching between HierCode and visual features for recognition, enabling zero-shot capability.
- Multi-hot encoding ensures lightweight characteristics.

Main Contributions:
- HierCode provides informative hierarchical representations for Chinese characters via binary trees and prototype learning.
- Enables zero-shot Chinese text recognition at both character and line levels.
- Multi-hot encoding allows lightweight model size and fast inference speed.  
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets - handwritten, scene, document, web and ancient texts. Outperforms one-hot encoding baselines.
- Facilitates development of lightweight models due to compact codebook size.

In summary, HierCode exploits the hierarchical nature of Chinese characters to develop a lightweight and informative codebook that enables zero-shot recognition and achieves superior performance across diverse CTR tasks.
