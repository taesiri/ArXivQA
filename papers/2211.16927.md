# [3D GAN Inversion with Facial Symmetry Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16927)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can facial symmetry prior be leveraged to promote 3D GAN inversion from a single image? 

Specifically, the authors aim to reconstruct a 3D human face from a single image through inverting a pre-trained 3D GAN model. They recognize that directly applying 2D GAN inversion methods to a 3D GAN model can lead to inaccurate geometry and blurry novel views. To address this, they propose using facial symmetry as a prior to generate a pseudo auxiliary view via image flipping. This provides additional geometric constraints to obtain better geometry during inversion. They also use depth-guided 3D warping to create pseudo-labels in adjacent views, providing texture supervision to enhance image quality. The overall goal is to show that incorporating facial symmetry prior into the inversion process can enable high-quality 3D face reconstruction from a single image.
