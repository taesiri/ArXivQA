# [FOD-Swin-Net: angular super resolution of fiber orientation distribution   using a transformer-based deep model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11775)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Estimating fiber orientations from diffusion MRI is important for understanding brain connectivity and diseases. However, getting robust orientation estimates requires high angular resolution data which demands lengthy acquisitions. This is a challenge as such data is often not available clinically.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a deep learning method called FOD-Swin-Net to achieve angular super-resolution for fiber orientation distribution (FOD) estimated from fast, single-shell acquisitions. It uses the Swin Transformer U-Net architecture applied in a patch-based manner to bring the quality of FOD computed from 32 diffusion directions to be comparable to that obtained from 288 directions.

Methodology:
1) Single-shell 32 direction DWI is fit with SS3T model to get low resolution FOD. 
2) 3D Patches containing significant white/gray matter are extracted.
3) Swin UNETR is trained to refine FOD patches using MSE loss against multi-shell 288 direction target. 
4) Whole volume FOD is constructed via sliding windows at test time.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes first deep learning method to achieve angular super-resolution for sphereical harmonic FOD representation.
2) Transforms fast, single shell FOD to match quality of multi-shell FOD using Transformer architecture.  
3) Improves performance over state-of-the-art method FOD-Net in public HCP dataset.
4) Faster inference than voxel-based methods by patch-based processing.
5) Can help accelerate acquisitions by reducing required number of diffusion directions.

In summary, the paper presents a new deep learning approach to obtain high angular resolution fiber orientations from fast diffusion MRI for improved connectivity analysis.
