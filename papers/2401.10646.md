# [Empowering HWNs with Efficient Data Labeling: A Clustered Federated   Semi-Supervised Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10646)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
- Hierarchical wireless networks (HWNs) contain a massive amount of unlabeled, non-IID data across edge devices, resulting in slower convergence and increased processing times for federated learning approaches. 
- Existing clustered federated learning (CFL) methods operate under the unrealistic assumption that edge devices have access to accurate ground-truth labels.
- No existing CFL methods in HWNs address the challenge of leveraging unlabeled non-IID data in an efficient way that considers the unique constraints of edge networks.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel framework called "Clustered Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (CFSL)" that incorporates CFL with semi-supervised learning to enable efficient use of unlabeled non-IID data in HWNs.
- Uses the best-performing specialized models from the CFL clustering process to generate accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, even when the data comes from different distributions. 
- Formulates an optimization problem to select the specialized model that provides optimal pseudo labeling for each device while meeting deadline and resource constraints.
- Proposes a tractable solution to determine when and how to select the best specialized model for labeling based on accuracy and latency tradeoffs.  

Key Contributions:
- First work to explore CFL with SSL in HWNs to harness unlabeled non-IID data under resource constraints.
- Optimization formulation to balance tradeoffs between labeling accuracy, latency, and system constraints.
- Specialized model selection approach that evaluates labeling utility across clusters to find the best model for each device.
- Extensive experiments showcase significant gains for CFSL over baselines in testing accuracy, labeling accuracy and latency.

In summary, the key novelty is developing a specialized model selection strategy to enable accurate and efficient pseudo-labeling of unlabeled non-IID data in resource-constrained HWNs under a CFL setting.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called "Clustered Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (CFSL)" for efficiently using unlabeled data in hierarchical wireless networks under clustered federated learning settings. Specifically, the paper:

1) Formulates an optimization problem for minimizing the loss on labeled data while maximizing the utility of unlabeled data under resource constraints of hierarchical networks. 

2) Proposes a tractable solution to select the best-performing specialized model for each device to label its unlabeled data, even if the data comes from different distributions. This allows effective use of unlabeled non-IID data.
