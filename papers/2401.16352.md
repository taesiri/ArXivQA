# [Adversarial Training on Purification (AToP): Advancing Both Robustness   and Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16352)

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on a review of the LaTeX source code provided, some of the key terms and concepts that appear related to this paper include:

- Mathematics and mathematical notation (use of amsmath, matrices, vectors, etc)
- Probability and statistics (distributions, expectations, variance, etc) 
- Machine learning concepts (training data, models, encoders/decoders, loss functions, regularization, etc)
- Neural networks (rectified linear units, softmax, sigmoid activations)
- Information theory (Kullback-Leibler divergence)
- Optimization (learning rates, argmin/argmax)

So in summary, key terms are mathematics, probability/statistics, machine learning, neural networks, information theory, and optimization. The paper seems to leverage these concepts and techniques based on the defined LaTeX macros and notation.
