# [Accurate 3D Face Reconstruction with Weakly-Supervised Learning: From   Single Image to Image Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08527)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- 3D face reconstruction from images is important but challenging. Lack of training data with ground truth 3D shapes is a major issue.
- Reconstructing 3D face from an image set can be better than using a single image, but how to effectively leverage multiple images is an open problem.

Methods:
- Propose a CNN (R-Net) to regress 3DMM coefficients from a single image in a weakly-supervised manner, using a robust hybrid loss with both image-level (photometric, landmark) and perception-level (FaceNet feature) terms.
- Further propose a lightweight CNN (C-Net) to predict per-coefficient confidence scores for identity shape aggregation from an image collection. C-Net is trained without any ground truth labels to minimize reconstruction loss.

Main Contributions:
- Achieve state-of-the-art single image 3D face reconstruction through the proposed hybrid-level weakly supervised learning of R-Net. Significantly outperform previous methods.
- First learning-based method to reconstruct and aggregate 3D face shapes from an unconstrained image collection. Outperform heuristic aggregation methods.
- C-Net automatically learns to select high quality face images and exploit pose variations for complementary shape information aggregation.

In summary, this paper pushes the envelope of learning-based 3D face reconstruction to leverage both robust hybrid losses for single-image shape regression and auto-learned confidence prediction for multi-image shape aggregation. Both components achieve superior results over previous arts.
