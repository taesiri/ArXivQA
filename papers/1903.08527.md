# [Accurate 3D Face Reconstruction with Weakly-Supervised Learning: From   Single Image to Image Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08527)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- 3D face reconstruction from images is important but challenging. Lack of training data with ground truth 3D shapes is a major issue.
- Reconstructing 3D face from an image set can be better than using a single image, but how to effectively leverage multiple images is an open problem.

Methods:
- Propose a CNN (R-Net) to regress 3DMM coefficients from a single image in a weakly-supervised manner, using a robust hybrid loss with both image-level (photometric, landmark) and perception-level (FaceNet feature) terms.
- Further propose a lightweight CNN (C-Net) to predict per-coefficient confidence scores for identity shape aggregation from an image collection. C-Net is trained without any ground truth labels to minimize reconstruction loss.

Main Contributions:
- Achieve state-of-the-art single image 3D face reconstruction through the proposed hybrid-level weakly supervised learning of R-Net. Significantly outperform previous methods.
- First learning-based method to reconstruct and aggregate 3D face shapes from an unconstrained image collection. Outperform heuristic aggregation methods.
- C-Net automatically learns to select high quality face images and exploit pose variations for complementary shape information aggregation.

In summary, this paper pushes the envelope of learning-based 3D face reconstruction to leverage both robust hybrid losses for single-image shape regression and auto-learned confidence prediction for multi-image shape aggregation. Both components achieve superior results over previous arts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a CNN-based 3D face reconstruction approach that leverages both image-level and perception-level information for weakly-supervised single image reconstruction and performs multi-image aggregation via learned confidence prediction, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are two-fold:

1. They propose a CNN-based single-image face reconstruction method which exploits hybrid-level image information (both low-level pixel information and high-level perceptual information) for weakly-supervised learning without ground-truth 3D shapes. Experiments show their method outperforms previous methods significantly in terms of accuracy and robustness.

2. They propose a novel multi-image face reconstruction aggregation method using CNNs, which can learn to measure image quality and exploit complementary information from different images to reconstruct more accurate 3D faces, without any explicit supervision signal. To the best of their knowledge, this is the first learning-based method for 3D face reconstruction and aggregation from an unconstrained image set.

In summary, the key contributions are a highly accurate and robust single-image face reconstruction method using a hybrid loss for weakly-supervised learning, and a novel learning-based aggregation method for multi-image 3D face reconstruction. Both methods achieve state-of-the-art performance without ground-truth 3D shape supervision.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a hybrid-level loss function that combines an image-level loss and a perception-level loss. Can you explain in more detail how these two losses complement each other and why using both is beneficial? 

2. The skin color based photometric error attention strategy is an interesting concept. Can you elaborate on how the skin probability map is constructed and how it helps improve robustness to occlusion and other appearance variations?

3. The paper argues that using only perceptual loss can lead to unsatisfactory 3D face shapes despite low photometric errors. What is the intuition behind this limitation and how does adding the image-level loss help address it? 

4. The confidence prediction subnet for multi-image reconstruction is trained without any ground truth labels. Can you walk through how the error is backpropagated to train this network in more detail? 

5. How exactly does the confidence prediction subnet exploit pose differences between images to improve multi-image aggregation? Can you analyze the relative confidence scores in more depth?

6. What modifications would be needed to extend the method to video-based 3D face reconstruction and aggregation? What additional challenges might arise?

7. The method relies on a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) for representation. How could the ideas be extended to an unrestricted 3D representation as some recent works have explored? What pros and cons exist?

8. Can you discuss in more depth how the method compares to traditional multi-image 3D reconstruction pipelines? What scenarios would warrant using the traditional vs learning-based approaches? 

9. What implicitly happens when backpropagating the loss function to train the reconstruction network R-Net? Does this process embed some notion of 3D face priors into the network weights?

10. The method currently handles identity and expression variation but fixes other attributes like hair style. How difficult would it be to extend to varying hair and how might the confidence prediction need to change?
