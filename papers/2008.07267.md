So in summary, it's a review of recent work and open questions in applying deep neural networks to active learning for text classification.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my understanding, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances in neural network-based active learning for text classification. Some key aspects in comparing it to other work:

- Scope: It focuses specifically on the intersection of active learning, text classification, and deep neural networks. Many existing surveys cover active learning more broadly or focus on non-neural approaches. This provides a targeted analysis of recent progress in using modern deep learning for active text classification.

- Taxonomy: It provides a novel taxonomy of query strategies based on the type of input information used (data-based, model-based, prediction-based). This offers a useful lens for categorizing strategies.

- Analysis: It summarizes recent experimental work, highlighting common datasets, models, and strategies. The analysis identifies trends and limitations, like lack of comparability between studies. 

- Advances: It reviews key recent advances in NLP and neural networks for text classification, analyzing their adoption in active learning research. Things like contextual word embeddings and transfer learning appear underexplored.

- Research Questions: It outlines open research questions to advance neural active learning for text classification. These span uncertainty estimation, representations, small data learning, evaluation, and meta-learning query selection.

Overall, this survey provides a holistic overview tailored to neural active text classification, unlike existing works with a broader scope. The taxonomy, analysis, and research questions offer useful structure for approaching progress in this subfield. Compared to other surveys, it more deeply connects recent NLP/neural advances to active learning challenges.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving uncertainty estimates in neural networks. The paper discusses how uncertainty estimation in neural networks is still challenging and an active area of research. Better uncertainty estimates could improve the performance of uncertainty-based active learning query strategies when using neural networks.

- Evaluating different text representations like word embeddings and language models for active learning. The adoption of modern text representations like BERT has been slow in active learning research. Systematically evaluating their impact could be beneficial.

- Developing techniques to handle small labeled datasets when using deep neural networks. Active learning aims to minimize labeled data, but DNNs often require large datasets. Methods like pre-training and transfer learning help, but more work is needed in this area.

- Enabling more comparable evaluations between different active learning techniques. Many recent papers use disjoint datasets, limiting comparability. Using common datasets would allow better assessment of progress.

- Exploring learning to learn or meta-learning for active learning query strategies. Rather than hand-designing query strategies, learning them could improve performance.

In summary, some of the key directions are improving uncertainty estimation and leveraging recent advances in NLP representations for neural network-based active learning on text, handling small labeled datasets, improving experimental evaluation, and learning optimal query strategies. Exploring these areas could significantly advance the state of the art.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a survey of active learning for text classification using deep neural networks (DNNs). Active learning aims to reduce the amount of labeled data required to train a model by iteratively querying an oracle (e.g. a human annotator) for labels on judiciously selected data points. The paper argues that DNNs have not been widely adopted for active learning, despite their strong performance on many NLP tasks, due to challenges with uncertainty estimation and requiring large amounts of data. 

The paper provides an overview of query strategies for active learning and categorizes them based on the information they use (random, data-based, model-based, prediction-based). It surveys recent work on active learning for text classification, analyzing models, datasets, and query strategies used. The paper identifies several open research questions, including improving uncertainty estimates for DNNs, systematically evaluating different text representations, dealing with small data for DNN training, improving experimental comparability, and using meta-learning to learn optimal query strategies. The paper concludes by arguing that adopting recent advances in NLP and DNNs for active learning is an important research direction.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new active learning approach for text classification using deep neural networks. The key idea is to query the most uncertain and representative instances for labeling based on an analysis of the decision boundary learned by the network. Specifically, the approach first trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the current labeled dataset. Then, it selects a batch of diverse and uncertain instances near the CNN's decision boundary by clustering the word embeddings of unlabeled instances. Instances that are closest to the cluster centroids are considered representative of that cluster and queried for labeling by the oracle. After adding the newly labeled instances, the CNN is retrained. This query strategy aims to improve the discrimination of the CNN by focusing labeling on uncertain and diverse instances near the decision boundary. The proposed approach was evaluated on several text classification benchmark datasets and found to achieve higher accuracy with less labeled data compared to passive learning and other active learning methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, it seems this paper is surveying the recent work on active learning for text classification using deep neural networks. The key points are:

- Active learning aims to reduce the amount of labeled data needed by selectively choosing which data points to label. This can increase model performance for the same amount of labeled data, or reduce the labeling effort while maintaining performance.

- Neural networks have become dominant for many NLP tasks like text classification, but have seen limited adoption in active learning settings. The paper investigates reasons for this.

- The paper provides a taxonomy of query strategies for active learning based on the type of information they use (data-based, model-based, prediction-based). 

- It surveys recent work at the intersection of active learning, text classification, and deep neural networks.

- It summarizes experimental setups in recent work, identifying trends and limitations like lack of comparability between papers.

- It outlines open research questions to advance neural network-based active learning for text classification.

In summary, the key focus seems to be providing a comprehensive overview of neural network-based active learning for text classification, analyzing adoption of recent NLP advances in this area, finding limitations of current work, and laying out directions for future research. The goal is to promote further progress in active learning using modern deep neural networks.
