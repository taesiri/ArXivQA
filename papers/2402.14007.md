# [Can Watermarks Survive Translation? On the Cross-lingual Consistency of   Text Watermark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14007)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text watermarking aims to tag content from large language models (LLMs) to prevent misuse. But current methods lack cross-lingual consistency - meaning watermarks become ineffective when text is translated to other languages. 

- This is concerning as watermarked text could be translated to bypass tracking. For example, fake English news could be generated by an LLM, translated to Chinese, and spread while escaping watermark detection.

Approach:
- The authors evaluate watermark consistency for 2 LLMs (Baichuan-7B, Llama-2-7b-chat) and 3 watermark methods (KGW, UW, SIR) across 4 target languages (Chinese, Japanese, French, German).

- They find watermarks lose strength after translation, with correlation dropping and strength deviation surging over 80\% on average. SIR performs best but still struggles.

- Based on this, they propose a Cross-lingual Watermark Removal Attack (CWRA) that translates prompts and responses to remove watermarks without quality loss. CWRA is very effective, reducing AUC from 0.95 to 0.67. 

Solution:
- To improve cross-lingual consistency, the authors identify two key factors: 1) semantic vocabulary clustering across languages, and 2) robust partition of vocabulary for similar contexts across languages.

- They propose a enhanced SIR method (X-SIR) that clusters semantically similar tokens across languages and assigns the same watermark biases. This greatly improves AUC under CWRA from 0.67 to 0.88.

Main Contributions:
- First work evaluating and highlighting lack of cross-lingual consistency in LLM watermarking
- Proposal of highly effective CWRA attack that exploits this weakness
- Analysis of key factors and proposal of X-SIR defense that significantly enhances cross-lingual robustness

Overall, this paper thoroughly investigates cross-lingual challenges for LLM watermarking, from evaluation to analysis to attack and defense proposals. The concepts and methods pave the way for more research on this crucial issue.
