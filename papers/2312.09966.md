# [Data and Approaches for German Text simplification -- towards an   Accessibility-enhanced Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09966)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In Germany, 12% of the population has difficulties comprehending standard written language. Simplified language versions are needed to make communication more accessible and inclusive.  
- Legal texts are especially challenging to simplify due to their technical nature and normative content.
- There is a lack of parallel German corpora containing both standard and simplified language, especially for the legal domain. 
- Existing datasets and models do not adequately consider accessibility requirements and participation of target users with cognitive/language impairments.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors launched the OPEN-LS project to develop a text simplification framework tailored for individuals with low literacy levels.
- They aim to integrate legal texts and enhance comprehensibility for people with linguistic/cognitive impairments.
- They propose a 4-level complexity hierarchy for legal text simplification, from an easy summary to the full original document.
- They plan to build on existing neural language models, while adjusting them to the application domain and evaluating accessibility-oriented metrics.  

Main Contributions:
- Systematic assessment of existing German text simplification datasets and approaches.
- Identification of gaps regarding legal texts, accessibility requirements, participation of target users.
- Outlining an ongoing research project (OPEN-LS) to address these gaps.
- Proposing specialized format with 4-level complexity hierarchy for legal text simplification.
- Defining future research priorities like extending datasets, incorporation of illustrations, development of accessibility-oriented evaluation methods.
