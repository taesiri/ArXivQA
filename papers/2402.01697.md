# [APT-Pipe: An Automatic Prompt-Tuning Tool for Social Computing Data   Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01697)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent work has shown the potential of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for labeling text data for social computing tasks. However, performance heavily depends on the quality of the input prompts. 
- Manual prompt tuning relies on expertise and prior dataset knowledge. Existing automated prompting techniques have limitations around unpredictable responses, slow speed, and difficulty identifying effective prompt components.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose APT-Pipe, an extensible automated pipeline for tuning prompts to improve ChatGPT's text classification performance. 
- APT-Pipe takes a small subset of manually labeled data and uses it to iterate through different prompt configurations. It selects the best prompt based on metrics like weighted F1 score.
- The pipeline has 3 main steps:
   1) Generate a template JSON prompt for classification
   2) Automatically select suitable few-shot examples to include
   3) Iteratively test different combinations of NLP metrics to embed in the prompt

Main Contributions:
- Implementation and evaluation of APT-Pipe across 12 text classification datasets from 3 domains
   - Shows improved performance over baseline prompts in 9/12 datasets
   - Increased F1 score by 7.01% on average
- Demonstration that tuned prompts generate responses in a consistent format 97% of the time
- Highlighting the pipeline's flexibility and extensibility 
   - Case studies integrating two additional tuning techniques

In summary, the paper introduces an automated prompt tuning framework to enhance ChatGPT's data annotation abilities for social computing tasks. Experiments across multiple datasets validate effectiveness and extensibility.
