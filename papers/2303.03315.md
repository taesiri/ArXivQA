# [MACARONS: Mapping And Coverage Anticipation with RGB Online   Self-Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03315)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How can an autonomous system efficiently explore and reconstruct unknown 3D environments using only RGB images, without relying on depth sensors or 3D supervision?The key points are:- The paper focuses on the problem of Next Best View (NBV) prediction and path planning for 3D reconstruction. NBV refers to identifying the next best camera position to improve coverage and reconstruction of a scene. - Most existing NBV methods rely on depth sensors and 3D supervision (e.g. 3D meshes or point clouds) for training. However, depth sensors have limitations for outdoor scenes captured by drones, and 3D supervision does not scale well to large, complex environments.- The paper proposes a method called MACARONS that can explore and reconstruct scenes using only RGB images, without depth sensors or 3D supervision. It uses a self-supervised, online learning strategy.- MACARONS has three main modules: depth prediction from RGB, volume occupancy prediction, and surface coverage gain prediction for NBV. These modules are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner.- A key contribution is the self-supervised training procedure that allows MACARONS to scale to large, unknown environments where no 3D ground truth is available. The model builds its own training data by exploring new scenes.In summary, the main research question is how to achieve efficient scene exploration and reconstruction using only RGB images in a self-supervised way, removing the need for depth sensors or 3D supervision data. The paper proposes MACARONS to address this challenge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Proposing MACARONS, the first deep learning based approach for next best view (NBV) computation and dense reconstruction of large 3D scenes from RGB images only. 2. A self-supervised, online learning process that allows the model to scale its learning to any kind of unknown environment with no explicit 3D supervision. The model jointly learns to explore new environments and reconstruct them using just an RGB camera.3. An architecture with 3 modules - depth prediction, volume occupancy prediction, and surface coverage gain prediction - that work together in a synergistic way to enable efficient exploration and mapping.4. A new loss function for surface coverage gain estimation that is simpler, improves interpretability, and works better than prior art, especially for online training with limited camera views.5. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a large-scale 3D reconstruction dataset, outperforming methods that use depth sensors and 3D supervision. The self-supervised online learning allows the model to generalize well to new scenes.In summary, the key novelty is in proposing the first deep learning method for NBV that works on large outdoor RGB images in a self-supervised manner during exploration. This is enabled by a synergistic model architecture and online training process. The self-supervision aspect allows the method to scale and generalize well to new environments like a drone would encounter.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method called MACARONS that can simultaneously learn to efficiently explore unknown 3D environments and reconstruct them in real-time using only an RGB camera, without requiring any 3D supervision or depth sensor data.The key ideas are:- A self-supervised, online learning pipeline that trains depth prediction, volume occupancy, and next best view modules together on-the-fly while exploring new scenes. - A novel loss for surface coverage gain prediction that enables training with sparse camera views.- Outperforming prior depth-sensor-based methods on large outdoor scenes by leveraging the scalability of the self-supervised RGB-only approach.In summary, MACARONS introduces a way to map unknown 3D environments using just an RGB camera and without any 3D supervision, by jointly learning depth prediction and view planning in a self-supervised manner during exploration.
