# [Wasserstein Nonnegative Tensor Factorization with Manifold   Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01842)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) is used for feature extraction from nonnegative multivariate data. However, existing NTF methods use loss functions like Euclidean distance that treat features equally, ignoring feature correlations or manifold structure of the data. 

- Some recent works have used Wasserstein distance in nonnegative matrix factorization but ignore tensor structure and manifold information.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Graph Regularized Wasserstein Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (GWNTF) method. 

- It uses a smooth Wasserstein distance between original tensor data and reconstructed tensor to exploit feature correlations.

- It adds a graph Laplacian regularizer on the latent factors to preserve manifold structure of the data.

- An efficient MM algorithm is derived to update the transport tensor and latent factor matrices.

Main Contributions:

- Novel use of Wasserstein distance and graph regularization together in tensor factorization to exploit feature correlations and manifold structure.

- Derivation of update rules for transport tensor and latent factors using auxiliary functions and MM algorithm.

- Experimental evaluation on image datasets shows improved performance over NMF and NTF baselines in clustering task.

- Demonstrates benefit of using both Wasserstein distance and manifold regularization in tensor factorization framework for multivariate data analysis.

In summary, the key idea is to integrate the strengths of Wasserstein distance and graph regularization into a tensor factorization approach to get improved data representations that outperform existing NMF/NTF methods. The experiments and analysis validate the advantages of the proposed GWNTF method.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a graph regularized Wasserstein nonnegative tensor factorization method that utilizes manifold structure information of data and feature correlations to learn low-rank representations of nonnegative tensorial data for improved clustering performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new tensor factorization method called Graph Regularized Wasserstein Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (GWNTF). The key aspects are:

1) It uses Wasserstein distance as the metric to measure the difference between the original tensor data and the reconstructed tensor from the factorization. This takes into account the correlations between different features. 

2) It incorporates a graph regularization term that preserves the local manifold structure of the tensor data samples. This captures the intrinsic geometry of the high-dimensional data.

3) It derives an efficient optimization algorithm based on Maximization-Minimization to update the factors. This provides a principled way to minimize the objective function.

4) It demonstrates through experiments on image clustering tasks that GWNTF outperforms other NMF and NTF-based methods in terms of various evaluation metrics like accuracy, NMI, etc. This shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In summary, the key novelty is in combining Wasserstein distance and graph regularization in the context of nonnegative tensor factorization, and developing an effective algorithm to optimize the model parameters. The superior experimental results validate the benefits of the proposed GWNTF method.
