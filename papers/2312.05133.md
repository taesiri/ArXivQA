## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents GIR, a novel 3D Gaussian inverse rendering framework for relightable scene factorization from multi-view images. The key idea is to leverage 3D Gaussians, which have shown strong potential compared to neural implicit representations, to estimate geometry, material properties, and illumination. The method addresses challenges in modeling normals and indirect illumination for the discrete 3D Gaussian representations. It proposes an efficient self-regularization approach to ensure visible Gaussians have obtuse angles between their shortest axis and the camera view, enabling accurate normal learning without supervision. For indirect illumination, it uses spherical harmonic coefficients to approximate ray tracing. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on relighting, novel view synthesis, and factorization tasks across multiple datasets. The results showcase photorealistic rendering and editing capabilities, highlighting the efficacy of 3D Gaussians for inverse rendering. By enabling real-time material editing and relighting, this work opens up new possibilities for practical applications requiring intricate material and lighting interactions.
