# [In-Context Example Ordering Guided by Label Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11447)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- In-context learning (ICL) with large language models shows promise for few-shot learning, but is sensitive to the choice and order of in-context examples. Using the same examples but different orderings can result in performance varying from near state-of-the-art to random guessing. 

- Prior work on optimizing example orderings requires additional labeled data beyond the in-context examples. 

- This paper examines how to select good orderings using only the in-context examples themselves and model probability outputs.

Proposed Solution
- Formulate in-context ordering as an optimization problem under 3 settings: 
   1) Only in-context examples
   2) Additional unlabeled examples 
   3) Additional unlabeled & prior label distribution

- Propose 2 principles for ordering guided by model probability predictions:
   1) Ordering should have minimum bias (KL divergence to uniform distribution) on null input  
   2) Observed label distribution on unlabeled data should match informative prior

- Instantiate principles into a scoring function and sampling-based selection method called Probability Distribution Ordering (PDO)

- Apply PDO with both direct probability and PMI scoring methods

Contributions 
- Show PDO improves accuracy and reduces variance across 13 classification datasets and 9 LLMs
- PDO reduces model miscalibration, improving reliability
- PDO matches performance of prior methods needing labeled data, using only model probability outputs 
- Analysis shows PDO can also improve example selection for a task over random baselines

Main conclusion is that optimizing example orderings based solely on model probability outputs is an effective approach to enhance ICL, without needing additional labeled data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes principles for optimally ordering in-context examples to improve few-shot classification performance of language models, using the models' own probability distributions to select orderings that reduce bias and match informative prior label distributions when available.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing two principles for selecting good orderings of in-context examples to improve the performance and calibration of in-context learning with large language models. Specifically:

1) When no unlabeled data is available, the paper proposes to select orderings that minimize the bias of the model towards certain labels on a null input. 

2) When unlabeled data and label priors are available, the paper proposes to select orderings that make the model's predicted label distribution on the unlabeled data close to the true prior label distribution.

The paper shows experimentally that these principles, implemented under their method "Probability Distribution Ordering" (PDO), can effectively improve accuracy, reduce variance, and calibrate confidence for in-context learning across a variety of models and datasets.

Additionally, the paper demonstrates PDO's ability to select better in-context examples at the task level, matching the performance of methods that require labeled data without needing it.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- In-context learning (ICL)
- Few-shot learning
- Autoregressive language models (LLMs)
- In-context example ordering
- Model calibration
- Confidence calibration
- Probability distribution ordering (PDO)
- Learning from label proportions
- Three settings with different assumptions:
  - Only labeled in-context examples
  - Additional unlabeled examples
  - Prior label distribution also known
- Two principles for ordering selection:
  - Minimize bias for null input
  - Match empirical label distribution to prior

The paper examines how to select good orderings of in-context examples to improve model performance and calibration, under different assumptions about what information is available. The proposed PDO method leverages output probability distributions to select orderings, inspired by learning from label proportions. Experiments show PDO improves accuracy, reduces variance, and enhances calibration across various models and datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two principles for in-context example ordering - Principle I when only in-context examples are available, and Principle II when an unlabeled dataset and prior label distribution are available. Explain these two principles and the intuitions behind them.

2. The paper categorizes the problem into three settings - FewShot, FewShotU, and FewShotUP based on what additional information is available beyond the in-context examples. Compare and contrast these three settings. What are the key differences in assumptions?

3. The paper proposes a scoring function called Probability Distribution Ordering (PDO) that implements Principle I and II for ranking in-context example orderings. Explain how PDO scoring works for the FewShot and FewShotUP settings. 

4. One component of PDO's formulation is the KL divergence between predicted and prior label distributions. Explain the intuition behind using KL divergence here and how it relates to the principles.

5. For the FewShot setting, the paper recommends using a uniform prior over labels. Why is a uniform distribution a reasonable choice here? What are some potential limitations?

6. The paper combines PDO with both the Direct and PMI scoring approaches. What are Direct and PMI scoring? And why is PDO orthogonal to them?

7. One claimed benefit of PDO is better confidence calibration. Explain what confidence calibration means and how PDO helps improve calibration.

8. The paper shows PDO can also help with task-level example selection. How does this relate to the overall goal of ordering examples? Why can the same principles apply?

9. The paper categorizes PDO as a "corpus-level" approach to ordering examples. What does this mean? How does it differ from other paradigms like "instance-level"?

10. What are some limitations of PDO identified in the paper? Can you think of other potential limitations not discussed? How might the method be extended or improved?
