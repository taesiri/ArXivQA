# [Strong Priority and Determinacy in Timed CCS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04618)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classical process algebras like CCS are typically used to model asynchronous concurrent systems which are inherently non-deterministic. They are not well-suited to model synchronous programming languages which combine concurrency with functional determinism. 

- Synchronous languages interact asynchronously at the micro-step level during each macro-step, but synchronize at the end of each macro-step to produce a deterministic outcome. Modeling this in classical process algebras is challenging.

- CCS extensions with priorities help resolve nondeterminism but are still not expressive enough to model synchronous programming languages. They also do not achieve full confluence needed for functional determinism.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "SynPaTick", an extension of CCS with clocks and strong priorities called precedence policies.

- Clocks act as global synchronization barriers to divide computations into macro-steps. Precedence policies refine CCS priorities to implement a constructive scheduling.

- Together these features permit modeling of synchronous programming with both concurrency and determinism. In particular, modeling Esterel-style signals that combine multicasting with determinism.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies constructive scheduling using strong precedences and clocks as a way to achieve confluence in CCS.

- Defines policy coherence for processes which are shown to be confluent under the constructive scheduling. Policy coherence generalizes Milner's confluence. 

- Shows a large class of "pivotable" and "input-scheduled" processes are policy coherent. This class properly extends confluent CCS processes and captures patterns in synchronous programming.

- Establishes maximal progress and deterministic properties for coherent processes useful for synchronous language compilation.

Overall, the paper makes a novel connection between classical concurrency theory and synchronous programming by strengthening process algebra with precedences and clocks. This reconciles asynchronous interactions with synchronous determinism within CCS.
