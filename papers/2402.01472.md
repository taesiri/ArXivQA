# [Synthetic Data for the Mitigation of Demographic Biases in Face   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Face recognition systems exhibit demographic biases, leading to unequal performance across gender, race, and age groups. These biases arise primarily from imbalanced representations of demographic groups in training data.
- Popular face recognition training datasets like CASIA-WebFace overrepresent white, male, middle-aged subjects. Systems trained on them inherit these biases.

Proposed Solution: 
- Fine-tune face recognition systems using synthetic datasets with controlled demographic distributions to mitigate bias.  
- Use GANDiffFace framework to synthesize datasets with controllable attributes and realistic intra-class variation.
- Evaluate two synthesis strategies - Syn-Asian (only Asian identities) and Syn-Mixed (balanced Asian, Black and White identities).

Experiments:
- Evaluate two face recognition systems - ArcFace and CosFace trained on biased CASIA-WebFace dataset.
- Identify bias against Asian subjects in original models using DiveFace and RFW test datasets.  
- Fine-tune both models separately with Syn-Asian and Syn-Mixed datasets.
- Compare fairness metrics across original and fine-tuned models to measure bias mitigation.

Results:
- For ArcFace, Syn-Mixed tuning improves fairness metrics and reduces FMR disparity for Asians.  
- For CosFace, Syn-Asian tuning decreases FMRs and increases overall accuracy.  
- Demonstrates synthetic data can mitigate demographic bias in face recognition.

Main Contributions:
- First study investigating synthetic data for bias mitigation in face recognition.
- Analysis of balanced vs. minority oversampling synthesis strategies.  
- Showcase of GANDiffFace for controlling attributes in synthetic datasets.
- Comprehensive evaluation using multiple recognition models, datasets and fairness metrics.

In summary, the paper effectively employs synthetic datasets to mitigate demographic biases in face recognition systems, providing useful insights into dataset design and model fine-tuning strategies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper investigates using synthetic face images with controllable demographics to fine-tune face recognition systems and mitigate their biases against underrepresented demographic groups.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is using synthetic data generated with GANDiffFace to fine-tune face recognition systems in order to mitigate demographic biases. Specifically, the authors fine-tune ArcFace and CosFace models using two synthetic datasets - Syn-Asian containing only Asian identities, and Syn-Mixed containing Asian, Black and White identities. They evaluate the fine-tuned models on real-world datasets like DiveFace and RFW to analyze if the demographic biases, especially against Asian subjects, have reduced after fine-tuning. The results show that fine-tuning with the Syn-Asian and Syn-Mixed datasets helps mitigate biases and improve fairness metrics to different extents for ArcFace and CosFace models. So in summary, the key contribution is demonstrating that synthetic data can be effectively used to improve demographic fairness of face recognition systems.

The paper investigates using synthetic face datasets generated by GANDiffFace, a framework combining GANs and diffusion models, to fine-tune ArcFace and CosFace face recognition systems. It aims to mitigate demographic biases exhibited by these systems against certain groups like Asians. Various fairness metrics are used to evaluate performance disparities across demographic groups before and after fine-tuning. The key goal is to improve demographic fairness in face recognition through synthetic data.
