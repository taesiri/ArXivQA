## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, the main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing and validating a new optimal control model of human response in pursuit tracking tasks that includes a disturbance input. Specifically, the authors:

- Develop an optimal control model of human operators performing pursuit tracking that incorporates a disturbance signal into the system dynamics. This allows the model to account for unexpected inputs that the human needs to reject.

- Validate the model with experimental data from a pursuit tracking task experiment with human subjects. The human control behavior showed evidence of trying to optimally estimate and reject the disturbance signal, matching the predictions of the theoretical model.

- Show that previously proposed optimal control models without an explicit disturbance input fail to fully explain the observed experimental data. The inclusion of the disturbance signal provides a better fit to the measured human tracking performance.

So in summary, the key contribution is an enhanced optimal control model of human manual tracking that can better capture the role of disturbance rejection, along with experimental validation. This addresses a limitations of previous human operator models in explaining pursuit tracking behavior.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a human control model with feedforward and feedback components. How is the feedforward component conceptualized and incorporated into the overall model structure? What assumptions are made about human ability to learn and utilize feedforward control?

2. The subsystem identification method parses measured human control behavior into feedforward versus feedback elements. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to direct identification of a complete model?

3. What signals and analyses allow the authors to quantify the contributions of feedforward versus feedback to overall human control behavior? How might additional signals provide further insights into control strategies?  

4. How might the proposed analysis approach be extended to incorporate time-varying control behavior as humans learn to control a system over multiple trials? Could the relative contributions of feedback and feedforward be seen to evolve over time?

5. The model validation rests heavily on being able to accurately match the measured human control inputs. What other model properties or prediction capabilities might be used to further validate the identified models?

6. How does the proposed structure compare to other existing conceptual models of human manual control? What elements are incorporated or neglected relative to crossover or optimal control models?

7. What implications does the quantification of feedforward and feedback contributions have for the design of shared or supervisory control systems? How might displays or automation algorithms be tailored based on this knowledge?

8. The paper focuses exclusively on continuous manual control tasks. How might the feedforward concept be translated to more cognitively complex tasks involving discrete decisions or control mode switches? 

9. What neurological evidence exists to motivate or substantiate the division of control into distinct feedforward and feedback processing? Do the models link to known cortical regions and pathways?

10. How might individual differences between subjects influence the utility of feedforward control and the balance between feedback and feedforward contributions? Would the model structure need to be adapted based on skill, experience, or other subject-specific factors?
