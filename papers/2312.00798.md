# [A Turing Test: Are AI Chatbots Behaviorally Similar to Humans?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00798)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
As AI systems like chatbots are rapidly advancing to the point of emulating human conversations and behaviors, it is important to understand their behavioral tendencies before entrusting them with impactful roles. This paper aims to evaluate whether chatbots exhibit human-like behaviors and personality traits that influence their decisions across different contexts. 

Method:
The authors conduct a Turing test by administering a Big Five personality questionnaire and having AI chatbots (ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4) play a suite of interactive games designed to reveal behavioral tendencies like cooperation, trust, fairness, etc. The chatbots' behaviors and personalities are compared to distributions from over 100,000 human subjects.

Key Findings:
- ChatGPTs' personality profiles fall within the range of human respondents, with higher agreeableness, lower neuroticism and greater consistency than humans.  

- In strategic games, chatbots cooperate more, are more trusting/reciprocal, and make decisions yielding higher partner payoffs than typical humans. Their objective functions suggest maximizing average welfare.

- Framing, context and experience influence chatbot behaviors much like humans. Their decisions shift when explaining choices, encountering different partners, investment sizes, occupations, etc.

- ChatGPT-4 passes a Turing test, producing actions statistically indistinguishable from humans in 5/8 games. Its behavior concentration causes it to outperform humans in a probability test.

Conclusion: 
Chatbots exhibit human-like behavioral traits and their cooperative deviations make them well-suited for roles like negotiation, dispute resolution and caregiving. Evaluating AI behaviors before real-world deployment provides understanding of their objectives and tendencies.
