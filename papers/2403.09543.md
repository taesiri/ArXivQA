# [Explorations in Texture Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09543)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates "texture learning" in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, it studies the identification of textures learned by CNN object classification models during training, and the extent to which these models rely on texture features to classify objects. Prior work has shown that CNNs tend to be biased towards textures rather than shapes, unlike human vision. But there has been limited analysis on exactly what kinds of textures are learned by CNNs and how they associate these textures with objects.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes building mappings between textures and objects to uncover textures learned by CNNs and their associations with objects. They use the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD), which contains images labeled with 47 texture classes like dotted, spiral, knitted etc. They input these texture-only images into an ImageNet-trained CNN and measure the probability of classification into each of the 1000 ImageNet object classes. This builds a mapping between textures and objects, quantified by the "effect size" metric.

Key Contributions:
- Uncovered and analyzed texture-object associations learned by CNNs, categorizing them into (1) expected and strongly present  (2) unexpected yet strongly present (3) expected but not present.
- Found models strongly associate certain textures like dotted, polka-dotted with the "bib" object class. Traced this to polka-dotted bib images in ImageNet training set. Demonstrates texture analysis can uncover subtle biases.  
- Showed models can generalize well on some textures (honeycomb) but not others (fish scales). Reveals lack of texture diversity in training data for some objects.
- Overall, the texture learning analysis provides a new direction for model interpretability and evaluating biases related to texture reliance.

In summary, the paper demonstrates an analysis of textures learned by CNNs and their associations with objects that provides additional insights into model behaviors and biases. The proposed texture-object association mapping enables further studies in understanding and improving CNN texture reliance.
