# [Responsible Artificial Intelligence: A Structured Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06910)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is no clear, agreed-upon definition of "responsible AI" in research or EU policy documents. Terms like "trustworthy AI" are used inconsistently.
- Current EU policy papers mention aspects of responsible AI but do not provide a unified definition or framework.
- There is a need to define responsible AI clearly to guide legal frameworks and help companies build ethical, secure, privacy-preserving, and explainable AI systems.

Proposed Solution: 
- Conduct a structured literature review to analyze definitions and key aspects of responsible AI.
- Extract a concise, overarching definition of responsible AI from this analysis. 
- Identify the core pillars and requirements of responsible AI systems.
- Outline a framework for developing responsible AI based on these pillars.

Key Contributions:
- First unified definition of responsible AI: Human-centered and ensures user trust through ethical, explainable decisions while preserving privacy/security.
- Identification of core pillars: ethics, explainability, privacy/security.
- Discussion of key requirements for each pillar to guide building responsible AI. 
- Proposed high-level framework with interdependent technical and ethical pillars leading to user trust.
- Discussion of tradeoffs between pillars and need for benchmarks.
- Limitations in accessibility of some literature sources.
- Future work on human-centered AI, benchmarks for requirements, holistic responsible AI framework.

In summary, this paper conducts an in-depth literature analysis to provide clarity on responsible AI - defining it and outlining key pillars and requirements for developing accountable, ethical, transparent, and privacy-preserving AI systems that maintain user trust. A high-level framework is proposed to guide further research and industry efforts towards realizing responsible AI.
