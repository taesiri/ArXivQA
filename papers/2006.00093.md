# [Explainable Artificial Intelligence: a Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00093)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can the large and growing body of research on explainable AI methods be organized and summarized in a systematic way? 

The authors note that research on explainable AI has expanded rapidly in recent years, leading to a plethora of methods across different domains and contexts. However, this knowledge is currently scattered across many papers and conferences. Therefore, the authors aim to carry out a systematic literature review to cluster and map out the landscape of XAI research. Their goal is to provide a structured classification system for the different strands of research in this field.

Specifically, the hierarchical classification system they propose contains four main clusters:

1) Review articles on XAI methods 

2) Theories and notions related to explainability

3) Methods for explainability 

4) Evaluations of explainability methods

The authors review and categorize over 350 papers within this framework. They summarize the state of XAI research in each of these areas and provide recommendations for future work. The taxonomy provides a way to organize the diverse and fragmented literature on XAI. Overall, the central research question is focused on systematically reviewing and mapping out the wide range of work on explainable AI.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This systematic review organizes the vast research on explainable artificial intelligence methods into 4 main categories - reviews of XAI literature, theories and notions of explainability, development of new XAI methods, and evaluation approaches for XAI methods - and proposes a hierarchical classification system and conceptual framework for the field.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading, this paper provides a comprehensive systematic review of research on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Here are some key ways it compares to other survey papers in this field:

- Scope: This review covers a very wide range of literature on XAI methods, concepts, evaluation approaches, etc. It is one of the most extensive surveys I've seen, organizing over 200 papers into a detailed taxonomy. Many other reviews focus on a narrower subset of XAI research, like methods for deep neural networks.

- Classification scheme: The authors propose a detailed hierarchical classification system with four main branches - reviews, theories/notions, methods, and evaluation. This provides a structured way to organize the diverse XAI literature. Other surveys have used different classification schemes, like grouping methods by input data type or model family. 

- Explanation of contributions: This review thoroughly summarizes the contributions of different categories of XAI research and provides examples. The sections on key notions, explanation types/structure, and evaluation approaches give more detail than most surveys.

- Recommendations: The paper concludes by identifying open challenges and providing recommendations for future XAI research directions. The discussion of integrating connectionist and symbolic AI methods for XAI is quite insightful. Many reviews do not provide this kind of forward-looking analysis.

- Recency: As a 2019 publication, this review covers very recent advancements in XAI compared to earlier surveys. It incorporates the latest thinking on concepts like algorithmic transparency.

Overall, I find this to be one of the most comprehensive and well-structured surveys of the XAI literature. The detailed taxonomy and coverage of recent developments make it a highly useful reference compared to other reviews focused on specific subareas or older papers. The analysis and recommendations help advance thinking in this rapidly evolving field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing a generally applicable framework for explainable AI (XAI) that can guide the advancement of new end-to-end methods. The paper suggests there is enough existing XAI research to construct such a framework, but it still needs to be done.

- Involving humans/end-users more in the development and evaluation of XAI methods, since explainability is a human-centric concept. They suggest drawing from human-computer interaction and social science fields more.

- Exploring the intersection of connectionist (data-driven) and symbolic (reasoning-based) AI paradigms for XAI. For example, using reasoning approaches on top of accurate learned models.

- Developing more structured formats of explanations that consider various notions of explainability and that can be trained on data using connectionist approaches.

- Focusing more on evaluating explainability with humans in the loop, such as designers and end users of AI systems, rather than just automated metrics.

- Resolving challenges around defining explainability concretely across textual, visual, and other explanation formats. 

- Addressing issues around determining the key properties of effective explanations for different users.

- Exploring the connections between explainability and related concepts like trust, transparency and privacy.

In summary, the authors suggest a continued focus on human-centered XAI, combining connectionist and symbolic AI, developing explanation evaluation methods, and formalizing the notions around explainability.
