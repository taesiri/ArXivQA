# [Training Neural Networks on RAW and HDR Images for Restoration Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03640)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is no consensus on how neural networks should be trained for image restoration tasks (denoising, deblurring, super-resolution) when operating on RAW or HDR images represented in linear color spaces. 
- Linear color spaces are not perceptually uniform - a small error at low brightness is more visible than at high brightness. But physical image formation models (noise, blur) are best defined in linear spaces.
- Should we train networks on linear images and use a perceptual loss? Or apply a perceptual encoding to the images first?

Methods:
- Compare training strategies on 3 image restoration tasks (denoising, deblurring, super-resolution) using 2 networks per task.
- Test linear images vs images encoded with PQ, PU21 or μ-law transfer functions.
- Test L1 loss on encoded images vs. losses with perceptual encoding on linear images.
- Train and evaluate on dataset of 122 HDR images with simulated noise and blur.

Results:
- Clear benefit to using perceptual image encoding - gains up to 10-15 dB compared to linear. 
- No evidence showing μ-law, PQ or PU21 is clearly superior.  
- Perceptual losses on linear images less effective than encoding images.

Conclusions:
- Networks should be trained on HDR/RAW images encoded with PQ, PU21 or μ-law transfer functions.
- This simple change brings substantial performance gains over default approach of using linear images.
- Findings provide clear guidelines for training image restoration networks on RAW/HDR data.

Main Contributions:
- First systematic study comparing training strategies for neural image restoration on linear/RAW/HDR images.
- Actionable guidelines provided on best practices for handling such image data.
- Up to 10-15 dB gains demonstrated by using perceptual image encoding, a simple change that is rarely employed currently.
