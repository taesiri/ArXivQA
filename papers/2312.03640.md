# [Training Neural Networks on RAW and HDR Images for Restoration Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03640)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores the best strategies for training neural networks on high dynamic range (HDR) and raw image data for common image restoration tasks like denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution. The key questions examined are: (1) Should networks be trained on linear color spaces representing absolute light values or display-encoded spaces with perceptual uniformity? (2) What loss functions work best with linear vs encoded data? The authors test networks on a dataset of HDR images using either linear RGB values or encoded values from the PQ, PU21 or Î¼-law perceptual transforms, paired with either a plain L1 loss or a custom loss that incorporates perceptual encoding. The results across six networks show that using one of the perceptual pixel encodings offers far better performance, with gains of 10-15dB over linear RGB, suggesting they better account for human perception. There is less evidence that custom losses outperform L1 when used with encoded data. The encoded results showcase fewer color artifacts and distortions. The findings provide simple but impactful guidelines to use encoded pixel representations over plain linear values for robust training of neural networks operating on raw or HDR images.
