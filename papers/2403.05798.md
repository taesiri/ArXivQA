# [$\textbf{S}^2$IP-LLM: Semantic Space Informed Prompt Learning with LLM   for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05798)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series forecasting. However, existing works have limitations such as (1) rigid prompt design lacking expressiveness to capture subtle temporal variations, and (2) underexplored semantic space in LLMs that could facilitate more informative time series representations. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Semantic Space Informed Prompt learning with LLM (S2IP-LLM) to align the pre-trained semantic space with time series embeddings for enhanced forecasting. The key ideas are:

(1) A time series tokenization module that decomposes the input into trend, seasonal and residual components, normalizes them, extracts patches from each component, and concatenates the patches to get expressive local contexts. 

(2) Semantic anchors are derived from pre-trained word token embeddings (semantic space) and aligned with time series embeddings by maximizing cosine similarity. Top-k similar semantic anchors are retrieved as prompts to enhance time series representations.

(3) The final representation, comprising aligned semantic anchors and time series embedding, is fed to the LLM for forecasting. Only positional embeddings and layer norms of LLM are fine-tuned.

Main Contributions:

- A specialized time series tokenization method to get expressive local contexts via decomposed component patching 

- Leveraging semantic anchors to align pre-trained semantic space and time series space, establishing a more informative joint space

- Semantic anchors used as prompts to provide indicative contexts for time series with different dynamics

- Achieves new state-of-the-art across multiple forecasting tasks and datasets. Ablations and visualizations demonstrate the necessity of semantic space informed prompting.
