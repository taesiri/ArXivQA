# [UniTeam: Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08611)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces the UniTeam agent, an improved baseline for the HomeRobot Challenge focused on mobile manipulation tasks like navigating to objects, picking them up, and placing them into different receptacles. The baseline agent utilizes perception from the Detic model, navigation and exploration skills for finding objects and destinations, and predefined actions for manipulation. UniTeam identifies deficiencies in these skills and makes several enhancements - adjusting detection confidence thresholds between objects and receptacles, adding decision-making for exploration to prevent getting stuck, incorporating collisions into navigation plans, expanding picking field-of-view, and refinements to the placing position and logic. UniTeam is evaluated in a simulated environment on 50 unique scenes over 1000 episodes, achieving 2\% task completion rate and 18.6% partial success rate, outperforming the original heuristic and learning-based baselines. Further improvements to perception are noted as the primary remaining bottleneck impacting performance. Overall, UniTeam demonstrates improved mobile manipulation capabilities through enhancements made to the baseline system across perception, navigation, picking, and placing skills.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

The paper introduces an agent called "UniTeam" to participate in the "HomeRobot: Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation" challenge. The goal of the challenge is to develop an agent that can navigate unfamiliar indoor environments and manipulate unknown objects based on natural language instructions. 

The baseline agent provided in the challenge framework has capabilities in perception, exploration, navigation, picking and placing. However, it has deficiencies leading to failures in certain situations. The key problems identified are:

- Inaccurate object detection leading to inability to find target objects
- Getting stuck in infinite loops during navigation
- Failing to pick up objects due to changing visibility after motion
- Inaccurate placement of objects leading to collisions or falls

To address these issues, the authors made several enhancements:

Perception:
- Implemented dynamic confidence thresholds for objects vs receptacles
- Added height threshold to filter floor areas incorrectly detected as objects

Exploration:  
- Enabled decision making between goals vs frontiers to prevent infinite loops
- Select receptacles based on highest probability match 

Navigation:
- Integrate collisions in planning to prevent repeating invalid moves 
- Position agent at center of receptacle for better placement

Picking: 
- Rotate agent left/right to expand field of view if object not visible
- Re-navigate if pick unsuccessful after retries

Placing:
- Approach receptacle slowly to get accurate distance
- Adjust place position to avoid drops from edges
- Place on surface if receptacle missing to avoid misses

Through these improvements, the agent achieved 2% success rate and 18.6% partial success rate on the challenge test set, outperforming the provided baselines. Further work is needed to address remaining perception challenges that underpin other failures. Potential directions include integrating behavioral search and few-shot imitation learning.
