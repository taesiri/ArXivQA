# [UniTeam: Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08611)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces the UniTeam agent, an improved baseline for the HomeRobot Challenge focused on mobile manipulation tasks like navigating to objects, picking them up, and placing them into different receptacles. The baseline agent utilizes perception from the Detic model, navigation and exploration skills for finding objects and destinations, and predefined actions for manipulation. UniTeam identifies deficiencies in these skills and makes several enhancements - adjusting detection confidence thresholds between objects and receptacles, adding decision-making for exploration to prevent getting stuck, incorporating collisions into navigation plans, expanding picking field-of-view, and refinements to the placing position and logic. UniTeam is evaluated in a simulated environment on 50 unique scenes over 1000 episodes, achieving 2\% task completion rate and 18.6% partial success rate, outperforming the original heuristic and learning-based baselines. Further improvements to perception are noted as the primary remaining bottleneck impacting performance. Overall, UniTeam demonstrates improved mobile manipulation capabilities through enhancements made to the baseline system across perception, navigation, picking, and placing skills.
