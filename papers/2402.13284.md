# [Structure Guided Large Language Model for SQL Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13284)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Structure Guided Large Language Model for SQL Generation":

Problem:
- Generating accurate SQL queries from natural language is challenging, as SQL is a structured language that must precisely match the database schema. 
- Existing SQL generation models rely primarily on the semantic capabilities of large language models (LLMs), overlooking inherent structural information in queries and databases. This can lead to inaccurate or unexecutable SQL.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a structure-to-SQL framework called Structure Guided SQL (SGU-SQL) that utilizes structural information to enhance LLM-based SQL generation.  
- It constructs graph-based structures to represent queries and database schemas, capturing dependencies and relationships.
- A structure linking model aligns nodes between the query structure and schema structure based on string matching and relevance scoring.
- The linked structure is decomposed into subtasks using a context-free grammar tree. Each subtask prompts the LLM to generate one SQL component at a time.

Main Contributions:
- Identifying limitations of overlooking structure in existing semantic SQL generation models.
- Proposing the novel SGU-SQL framework to incorporate structural information.
- Introducing graph-based query/schema representation and a learning model to link related structure components.  
- Leveraging grammar tree decomposition to prompt step-by-step SQL generation by LLMs.
- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance over 16 baselines on 2 benchmark datasets. Achieves 5-11% exec accuracy gains when combined with LLMs.

In summary, the key innovation is enhancing LLM-based SQL generation through explicit modeling and utilization of structural information in queries and databases. This alleviates semantic ambiguities and complex schema relationships that challenge purely semantic approaches.
