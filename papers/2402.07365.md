# [A Deep Learning Method for Optimal Investment Under Relative Performance   Criteria Among Heterogeneous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07365)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper focuses on the portfolio optimization problem faced by a large population of competing investors. Specifically, each investor seeks to maximize their exponential utility function under relative performance criteria - their final utility depends not just on their own terminal wealth but also how that wealth compares to that of other investors they compete with. This is set up as a stochastic graphon game, where the investors are indexed by $u\in[0,1]$. The graphon function $G(u,v)$ represents the interaction strength between investors $u$ and $v$. Mathematically the problem comes down to solving a continuum of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with interactions through the graphon. Computing Nash equilibria in this setting using traditional numerical methods is difficult, so the paper aims to develop a deep learning approach.  

Proposed Solution:
The key idea is to reformulate the problem as an optimal control problem and parametrize the controls $Y_0^u$ and $Z_t^u$ using neural networks that take the index $u$ as an input. This allows learning functions that generalize to the continuum of players instead of just a finite sample. The loss function for training is the terminal condition error on $Y_T^u$. Several financial models are tested, including a sanity check case of Black-Scholes with constant coefficients where the true Nash equilibrium is known in closed form. Convergence is analyzed based on the loss value and exploitability.

Main Contributions:
- First application of deep learning to simulate continuous graphon games with interactions through controls
- Novel neural network architecture that takes index $u$ as input to handle continuum of players  
- Explicit convergence analysis in terms of loss and exploitability
- Numerical experiments highlight effect of graphon interactions on strategies/wealth and provide financial insights
- Excellent performance demonstrated even on simple models where true solutions are known  

In summary, the paper makes important contributions regarding the application of deep learning in this domain through both methodological innovations and practical demonstrations.
