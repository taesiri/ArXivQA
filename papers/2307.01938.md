# [Physics-based Motion Retargeting from Sparse Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01938)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we retarget motions from sparse human sensor data to characters of different morphologies in real-time? 

Specifically, the paper aims to address two key challenges:

1. AR/VR systems only provide sparse sensory data about the user's pose from a headset and controllers, lacking lower body information. 

2. The target avatar may have a very different skeleton structure and proportions compared to a human. 

The central hypothesis is that physics-based simulation and deep reinforcement learning can be used to learn control policies that can retarget motions from sparse human input to characters of various morphologies in real-time. The policies can take the sparse data and generate full-body poses and physically valid motions for non-human characters, while respecting differences in proportions and physical properties.

The key innovations are:

- Using asymmetric actor-critic observations to provide more state information during training while still relying only on sparse data at test time.

- A flexible reward function that allows tuning the degree of imitation versus physical realism.

- Demonstrating real-time retargeting from real sparse data to physically simulated characters.

So in summary, the main research question is how to perform real-time motion retargeting from sparse human input to non-human characters using physics-based simulation and deep reinforcement learning. The central hypothesis is that this approach can overcome the challenges of sparse input data and differing morphologies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a method for real-time motion retargeting from sparse human sensor data to control physics-simulated characters of different morphologies. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Proposing an imitation-based reinforcement learning approach to learn policies that can drive physics-simulated characters while tracking sparse real-time user input from AR/VR devices.

- Introducing a flexible reward formulation that allows controlling the degree of imitation versus reliance on physics, enabling retargeting between differently shaped characters.

- Demonstrating results on three characters: a mouse, dinosaur, and human, using sparse headset and controller inputs. The method generates high-quality and physical motions.

- Performing ablations to validate the design choices, including the impact of the reward terms, observation asymmetry, and amount of training data.

- Showing the capability to track real motions from unseen users and from only headset input, which is an extremely challenging one-point tracking problem.

In summary, the key contribution is enabling real-time retargeting from sparse user input to characters of varying morphologies through a physics-based reinforcement learning approach. The method removes the need for target-specific motion data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to retarget motion from sparse human sensor data to simulated characters of different morphologies in real-time using reinforcement learning to train policies that control the characters in a physics simulator, enabling avatar control and self-expression in VR/AR while respecting physical constraints.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel method for motion retargeting from sparse user inputs to non-human characters using physics-based simulation and reinforcement learning. Here are some key comparisons to other work in this field:

- Most prior work on motion retargeting focuses on kinematic methods to map motions between humanoids or characters with similar morphology. This paper tackles the more challenging problem of retargeting to very different character morphologies by using physics-based simulation.

- Other physics-based character animation methods focus on tracking reference motions, but don't address the problem of retargeting from live sparse user input. This paper shows results driven by real headset and controller data.

- Unlike some prior physics-based retargeting work that requires artist-generated reference animations for each new character, this method only relies on easy-to-obtain human mocap data and simple kinematic retargeting to provide training signal.

- Compared to the concurrent QuestSim work, this method demonstrates retargeting to non-human characters and enables real-time control, whereas QuestSim targets human avatars and is not real-time.

- The Neural3Points method also uses RL to drive characters from sparse input, but requires a full-body pose predictor and is user-specific. This method is more direct and generalizable.

- The technique of using asymmetric actor-critic observations is novel in this domain and shown to be critical for learning from sparse inputs.

Overall, this paper pushes the boundaries of physics-based retargeting to very different morphologies from live sparse input data. The main limitations are the reliance on bipedal morphology and challenges with highly dynamic motions. But within its scope, it demonstrates an important advancement for immersive character control.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing methods to handle more challenging motion sequences with fast and dynamic movements or uncorrelated upper/lower body motions. The authors note their physics-based controller can sometimes fail on such complex motions, while a kinematic controller may be able to better handle teleporting between poses. They suggest a hybrid approach could help combine the benefits of both methods.

- Increasing the complexity of characters handled beyond just bipedal characters. The authors mention providing the policy with skeleton information, using graph neural networks, or training an auxiliary network to find mappings between different skeletons as ways to potentially control more complex characters. 

- Improving the quality of retargeting by supplying additional information to the policy beyond just the sparse headset and controller data, such as information about the user's environment captured through sensors.

- Exploring other forms of stylization and control over the motion by modifying the reward function or training multiple policies to represent different styles that could be smoothly blended.

- Developing more advanced methods for handling situations where multiple characters need to coordinate and interact, rather than just focusing on a single isolated character.

- Testing the approach on a greater diversity of motions and characters to better understand the limitations and how well it generalizes.

In summary, the main suggestions are around enhancing the complexity of motions and characters handled, providing more control over style and coordination, and improving the quality and robustness of the method through hybrid techniques and additional sensory information.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a method for real-time motion retargeting from sparse human sensor data to simulated characters of varying morphologies. The method uses reinforcement learning to train control policies that can drive physics-based characters in a simulated environment. During training, full human motion capture data is used to generate reward signals that encourage the character to mimic the human poses and motions as closely as possible. The key idea is that the physics simulation and contact constraints will naturally resolve differences between the human and character, allowing for retargeting between quite different body shapes. At test time, the trained policies can be conditioned only on sparse headset and controller data from a human user, and generate physically plausible motions and poses for the character in real-time. The method is demonstrated on three characters: a dinosaur, a mouse, and a human-like character. The results show an ability to successfully retarget challenging motions like dancing and sports behaviors using only the sparse real-time input. Ablation studies analyze the impact of various design choices.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for physics-based motion retargeting from sparse inputs to control diverse virtual characters. The method uses reinforcement learning to train policies that can generate physically valid poses and motions for different virtual characters based only on sparse input from VR devices like a headset and hand controllers. During training, the policies learn to map the sparse input to full body poses while respecting the unique physical properties of each character through interaction in a simulated environment. The key ideas are using asymmetric actor-critic training to provide more state information to the value function, imitating rough kinematic retargeting of mocap data as a reward signal, and incorporating contact and regularization rewards. After training, the policies can generate motions for new characters not seen during training, and can react in real-time to sparse input from real users wearing VR headsets.

Experiments demonstrate retargeting walking and running motions from real headset data to three different characters: a mouse, dinosaur, and human. The method is able to generate realistic poses and motions that match the sparse input while adhering to each character's physical constraints. Ablation studies validate the contributions of the asymmetric training, contact rewards, and kinematic retargeting. Limitations include difficulty with very dynamic motions and reliance on bipedal morphology. Overall, the work enables physics-based avatar control for embodiment of users in virtual characters of varying sizes and shapes based on typical sparse VR inputs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a method to retarget motions in real-time from sparse human sensor data to characters of various morphologies. The method uses reinforcement learning to train a policy to control characters in a physics simulator. Only human motion capture data is required for training, without relying on artist-generated animations for each avatar. This allows using large motion capture datasets to train general policies that can track unseen users from real and sparse data in real-time. The policy is trained with deep reinforcement learning to control simulated characters in a physically realistic virtual environment. The reward function encourages the simulated character to imitate a rough kinematic pose estimated from the human motion capture data, while respecting physical constraints. After training, the policy can be driven purely by sparse headset and controller input to generate physically plausible poses and motions for characters with different body shapes and skeleton structures.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper addresses the problem of animating virtual characters to mimic a user's motion using sparse motion data from AR/VR devices like a headset and controllers. This is challenging because the avatar may have a different skeleton structure than a human, and the mapping between them is unclear. Also, the sparse sensory data provides limited information about the user's full body pose.

- The paper proposes a method to retarget motions in real-time from sparse human sensor data to characters of various morphologies using reinforcement learning. The method trains policies to control characters in a physics simulator, requiring only human motion capture data and no artist-generated animations. This allows using large mocap datasets to train general policies that can track real users in real-time.

- The method is demonstrated on three characters - a dinosaur, mouse, and human. It shows the avatar poses often match the user well despite having no sensor data of the lower body.

- Key components enabling this are: kinematic retargeting to map poses, imitation and contact rewards, action regularization, and asymmetric actor-critic observations. The physics simulation also helps generate plausible motions.

- Benefits include enabling embodiment of users in non-human avatars in AR/VR using sparse data, avoiding artist animation of each character, and generating motions respecting physical constraints. Limitations include handling very dynamic motions or morphologically complex characters.

In summary, the key problem is retargeting motions from sparse user data to characters with different morphology in real-time, which is addressed using a physics-based deep RL approach. The results demonstrate plausibly mimicking user motions for non-human avatars.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper "Physics-based Motion Retargeting from Sparse Inputs":

1. The paper focuses on retargeting human motion to non-human characters with different morphologies based on the sparse sensor data from AR/VR devices. However, how would the method perform for human-to-human retargeting where the source and target characters have very different body proportions (e.g. retargeting from an adult to a child)? Would directly mimicking joint angles still work well in that case?

2. The method uses reinforcement learning to train physics-based control policies for each character. How sensitive is the training process to the choice of reward function components and their weights? Is there a principled way to set these rather than manual tuning?

3. For training, the method relies on having paired data between the full human pose and sparse sensor data. However, is it possible to train the policies using only unlabeled human motion data and unlabeled sensor data separately? How would this affect the quality of the resulting policies?

4. The policies are conditioned entirely on the current sensor input. How would incorporating some notion of future predicted poses or motion affect the quality and robustness of the retargeting?

5. The method performs a rough kinematic retargeting to generate training data. How does the fidelity of this initial retargeting affect the final policy? Will a completely inaccurate kinematic retargeting still work just as well after training?

6. Can the policies generalize to controlling creatures with novel morphologies not seen during training by leveraging the simulation? Or does the training process need to see a wide enough variety of body shapes and proportions?

7. The tails and ears of the creatures are controlled passively or fixed during training. Can the policies also learn to actively control these secondary appendages in a natural way? What changes would be needed?

8. For real-time control, can the policy run fully on device or does it require a PC/cloud backend? What are the bottlenecks for on-device deployment of such policies?

9. The method is demonstrated on bipedal characters. How challenging would it be to extend it to more complex quadrupeds or other morphology types? Would the same overall pipeline apply?

10. Could conditional policies be trained that allow intuitive control over stylistic aspects like making motions more dynamic or conservative? What kinds of conditioning inputs would help achieve this?
