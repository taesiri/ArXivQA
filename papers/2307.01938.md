# [Physics-based Motion Retargeting from Sparse Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01938)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we retarget motions from sparse human sensor data to characters of different morphologies in real-time? Specifically, the paper aims to address two key challenges:1. AR/VR systems only provide sparse sensory data about the user's pose from a headset and controllers, lacking lower body information. 2. The target avatar may have a very different skeleton structure and proportions compared to a human. The central hypothesis is that physics-based simulation and deep reinforcement learning can be used to learn control policies that can retarget motions from sparse human input to characters of various morphologies in real-time. The policies can take the sparse data and generate full-body poses and physically valid motions for non-human characters, while respecting differences in proportions and physical properties.The key innovations are:- Using asymmetric actor-critic observations to provide more state information during training while still relying only on sparse data at test time.- A flexible reward function that allows tuning the degree of imitation versus physical realism.- Demonstrating real-time retargeting from real sparse data to physically simulated characters.So in summary, the main research question is how to perform real-time motion retargeting from sparse human input to non-human characters using physics-based simulation and deep reinforcement learning. The central hypothesis is that this approach can overcome the challenges of sparse input data and differing morphologies.
