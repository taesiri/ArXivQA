# [Under-actuated Robotic Gripper with Multiple Grasping Modes Inspired by   Human Finger](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12502)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing under-actuated grippers lack versatility and adaptability in grasping objects of various shapes and sizes. They cannot adjust the grasping range and contact surface area.
- Fully-actuated grippers are complex and expensive. Simple yet versatile grippers are needed.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel 3-finger under-actuated gripper is proposed. It has retractable phalanges to change contact surface areas like a human finger. 
- A reconfigurable mechanism with self-locking allows the gripper to switch between 5 grasping modes to grasp objects of different sizes.
- It is driven by a single motor for both grasping and reconfiguring motions.  

Key Contributions:
- Retractable phalanges based on slider-rail mechanisms to modulate contact areas for better adaptability. Mathematical modeling of the retraction is provided.
- Reconfigurable structure to expand grasping range. A gear-rack system with self-locking enables various grasping modes from the same motor.
- Achieves 5 distinct grasping modes spanning a large range of object sizes. Actively changes range via reconfiguration and passively adapts shape via finger retraction.
- Experiments validate grasping of diverse objects using different modes. Measurements confirm significant contraction of phalanges for improved adaptability.

In summary, the key novelty is an under-actuated yet highly adaptable gripper design merging actively reconfigurable and passively compliant elements. It expands the versatility of under-actuated grippers greatly using elegantly simple mechanisms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents a novel under-actuated robotic gripper with reconfigurable multi-mode grasps enabled by a retractable finger linkage mechanism inspired by human hands.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is constructing a novel under-actuated gripper with capabilities of high adaptability and a large grasping range of objects' dimensions. Specifically, the key novelties highlighted are:

1) Presenting an innovative linkage mechanism to achieve the retraction of the phalanges for changing contact areas between the fingers and objects, thereby varying the friction to improve grasping stability. 

2) The gripper can perform grasping and reconfiguring simultaneously with a single motor, considerably reducing control and mechanism complexity. 

3) The capability to achieve five distinct grasping modes by combining finger adaptability and reconfiguration. The different modes can grasp objects with various sizes and contours, enhancing grasp stability.

In summary, the main contribution is developing an under-actuated robotic gripper with retractable fingers that can adaptively grasp objects across a wide range of dimensions while being controlled by just a single motor. The gripper demonstrates versatility, adaptability and stable grasping using innovative retractable phalanges and reconfigurable modes.
