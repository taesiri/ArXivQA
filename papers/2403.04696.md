# [Fact-Checking the Output of Large Language Models via Token-Level   Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04696)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Fact-Checking the Output of Large Language Models via Token-Level Uncertainty Quantification":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are prone to generating factually incorrect or fabricated content, referred to as "hallucinations". These hallucinations can be dangerous as they may be obscured by other accurate content, making them hard to detect.
- Current LLM services lack mechanisms for detecting unreliable generations to caution users.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a novel fact-checking pipeline to detect hallucinations in LLM outputs using token-level uncertainty quantification (UQ).
- They introduce a new token-level UQ method called Claim-Conditioned Probability (CCP) which measures the model's uncertainty in the factual correctness of each token. CCP filters uncertainty unrelated to factuality.
- CCP outperforms baselines by removing the impact of uncertainty about what claim to generate next and what words to use to express it. It focuses purely on uncertainty in the factuality of generated claims.

Contributions:
- Novel fact-checking pipeline using token-level UQ to highlight unreliable LLM generations for end users.
- CCP token-level UQ method that significantly improves over baselines in spotting hallucinations for 6 LLMs across 3 languages.
- New evaluation approach leveraging automatic fact-checking of generated biographies.
- Empirical analysis showing token-level UQ can rival complex systems that use external knowledge to spot factual errors.
- Human evaluation confirming that the pipeline can effectively evaluate uncertainty methods.

In summary, the paper introduces an interpretable approach leveraging uncertainty signals from the LLM itself to detect potential factual inaccuracies in model outputs, without needing external knowledge sources. The proposed methods advance capacities for spotting and cautioning against model hallucinations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for fact-checking large language model generations based on quantifying uncertainty at the token level, aggregated into atomic claim scores, which is shown to be competitive with tools leveraging external knowledge sources across multiple models and languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel framework for fact-checking large language model (LLM) generations using token-level uncertainty quantification. It provides a procedure for estimating the uncertainty of atomic claims generated by a white-box LLM and highlighting potentially incorrect fragments.

2) It proposes a novel method for token-level uncertainty quantification called Claim-Conditioned Probability (CCP) that outperforms several baseline methods on six LLMs and three languages. CCP measures only the uncertainty of a particular claim value expressed by the model.

3) It designs a novel approach to evaluation of token-level UQ methods for white-box LLMs based on fact-checking, which can be applied to other white-box LLMs.

4) It provides an empirical and ablation analysis of the method for fact-checking LLM generations, and finds that the uncertainty scores produced can help spot claims with factual errors for six LLMs over three languages.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel framework and method for fact-checking LLM outputs using token-level uncertainty quantification, along with a rigorous evaluation methodology.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How exactly does the proposed Claim-Conditioned Probability (CCP) method remove the impact of uncertainty about what claim to generate on the current step and what surface form to use? Could you provide more details on the theoretical formulation behind this?

2. The paper mentions implementing CCP using NLI at the word level. What were the key challenges in adapting NLI for this purpose and how were they addressed? For example, what context did you provide to the NLI model?

3. What were some of the key ablation studies performed to validate design choices in the CCP method, such as the choice of aggregation technique, NLI context, handling of function words, etc.? What insights did these provide?

4. The benchmark dataset construction process using FactScore for automatic evaluation is interesting. What are some limitations of this approach? What percentage of claims were you unable to match between the LLM output and FactScore's extraction?

5. What findings from the qualitative analysis provide insights into why CCP outperforms baselines like maximum probability? Could you provide 1-2 examples highlighting this?

6. The human evaluation results seem quite promising for the proposed approach. What plans do you have to scale up the human annotation effort to further validate performance? What guidelines were provided to human annotators?

7. What are some key challenges in adapting the proposed pipeline from the biography generation task to other domains like scientific paper generation or news article generation?

8. The proposed approach relies on access within the LLM to generate alternatives and probabilities. How do you foresee applying similar UQ-based fact-checking to black-box API access scenarios?

9. What directions for future work do you see as most promising to make the pipeline more practical - for example, replacing components like the NLI model or the claim extraction steps with cheaper alternatives?

10. From analyzing cases where CCP incorrectly labels claims, what weaknesses of the approach have you identified? How might the theoretical formulation be expanded to handle some of these cases better?
