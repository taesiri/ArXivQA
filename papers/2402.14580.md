# [Savvy: Trustworthy Autonomous Vehicles Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14580)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely heavily on AI/ML models for detection, recognition and planning. However, recent AV incidents show that over-reliance on AI/ML leads to failures in time-critical situations, resulting in loss of control and collisions. 
- Analysis of AV incidents reveals two key issues: (1) Confusion in command and control between the AI system and a reliable supervisory system, and (2) AI systems optimized for maximal accuracy without considering time constraints, failing to make timely decisions.

Proposed Solution: 
- A new AV architecture called SAVvy (Trustworthy Autonomous Vehicles) is proposed, with two key components:
   - Safety-Critical Control (SCC) system: Retains overall command and control of the vehicle to guarantee safety and timeliness. Monitors and schedules different AI modules. Takes over control when AI cannot respond on time.
   - Time-Sensitive Intelligent Modules (TSIMs): Self-contained AI modules for perception and planning tasks. Use dynamic neural networks that can tune themselves to trade-off accuracy for timeliness if needed to meet time bounds set by SCC.

- A concept called Time-aware Predictive Quality Degradation (TPQD) is introduced. AI models are tuned to maximize outcome quality within the available time bounds, even if the output is not optimal. This prevents the system from failing to act due to aiming for perfect accuracy.  

Key Contributions:
- Identifies key limitations of existing AV architectures in terms of confusion in control and lack of time awareness in AI systems.
- Proposes a new architecture with separated SCC system for oversight and control, and tunable AI modules that are time-aware.
- Introduces the concept of TPQD to trade-off some accuracy for timeliness when needed, while still exploiting AI capabilities.
- Paves the way for trustworthy AVs that balance safety, reliability and performance.

The paper analyzes real AV incidents, proposes a preliminary architecture design to address issues, and sets stage for empirical evaluation of the core TPQD concept.
