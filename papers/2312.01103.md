# [Code-Mixed Text to Speech Synthesis under Low-Resource Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01103)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Building text-to-speech (TTS) systems for code-mixed languages like Hindi-English is challenging due to lack of code-mixed speech datasets and complex methods required. The authors target building a high-quality TTS system for Hindi-English code-mixed text for e-commerce applications like voice assistants and chatbots.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a transliteration model to convert English text to Devanagari script to create a common script for training.
- Mix the Hindi and transliterated English text-audio pairs to create a pseudo code-mixed dataset.
- Train Tacotron2 (text-to-spectrogram) + Waveglow (spectrogram-to-audio) models on this mixed dataset.
- Compare single-speaker and multi-speaker models with pre-training and transfer learning.
- Show that mix-data pre-trained single speaker model with transfer learning performs the best.

Main Contributions:
- A simple and effective transliteration method to mix Hindi and English data to tackle code-mixed TTS without actual code-mixed data.
- Comparative analysis of single-speaker and multi-speaker models showing single-speaker adaptation works better. 
- Mix-data pre-training helps in superior quality and also enables low-resource voice adaptation with just 3 hours of target speaker data.
- The proposed model beats Google TTS system in side-by-side tests on code-mixed examples, indicating production level performance.

In summary, the paper presents data efficient solutions using transfer learning to build high-quality code-mixed TTS which is useful for voice assistant applications.
