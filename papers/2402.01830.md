# [Peer-review-in-LLMs: Automatic Evaluation Method for LLMs in   Open-environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01830)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) rely on small, domain-specific benchmarks with human-curated labels. These have limitations: they only assess performance on confined tasks rather than general capabilities, and may suffer from benchmark leakage where the test data was inadvertently used for training. Recent human evaluation platforms are the gold standard but are slow and costly. There is a need for an efficient, automatic way to evaluate LLMs that aligns with human preferences.

Proposed Solution - Peer-Review in LLMs:
The authors propose a novel unsupervised evaluation approach called "peer-review-in-LLMs". LLMs themselves act as peer reviewers, engaging in mutual assessments on unlabeled data to achieve comprehensive evaluations without human feedback. 

Specifically:
- LLMs in a pool answer open-ended questions to produce responses. 
- Responses are anonymized and paired up. LLMs are randomly assigned to review pairs and judge which response is better.  
- Each LLM has a learnable confidence weight representing its evaluation capability.
- A consistency optimization process adjusts weights to maximize alignment between confidence and response scores.
- This is based on the assumption that higher performing LLMs can evaluate more accurately and achieve higher scores.
- The optimized peer-review system produces an LLM leaderboard closest to human preferences.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of peer-review for automatic, unsupervised evaluation of LLMs without human labels.
- Formalized consistency optimization method to adjust LLM rankings based on mutual assessments. 
- Proposal of 3 metrics - PEN, CIN, LIS to measure alignment with human rankings.
- Experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness for obtaining rankings closer to human preferences.

In summary, this paper presents a novel direction for LLM evaluation utilizing peer-review mechanisms and consistency optimization to automatically produce rankings aligned with human preferences without manual annotation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel unsupervised evaluation method for large language models called "peer-review-in-LLMs", where models act as peer reviewers to evaluate each other's responses to unlabeled questions and are ranked based on maximizing the consistency between their confidence weights as reviewers and their scores as contestants.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel automatic evaluation framework called "peer-review-in-LLMs" for large language models (LLMs). The key ideas and contributions are:

1. It utilizes a peer-review mechanism where LLMs themselves act as reviewers to evaluate each other on unlabeled questions without relying on human feedback. This is an unsupervised evaluation approach.

2. It formalizes a consistency optimization problem to adjust each LLM's capability score based on the assumption that higher capability LLMs can evaluate others more accurately while also achieving higher scores. This aligns the final LLM rankings closer to human preferences.  

3. It proposes three new metrics called PEN, CIN, and LIS to measure the gap between the learned LLM rankings and human rankings. 

4. It validates the proposed approach on multiple datasets, showing it can effectively rank LLMs closer to human preferences in an unsupervised manner.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an automatic unsupervised "peer-review-in-LLMs" evaluation framework and consistency optimization method to rank LLMs without human annotations, along with new metrics to measure alignment with human preferences.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a "peer-review" mechanism for LLMs to evaluate each other. What are the potential biases that could arise from having models evaluate themselves, and how does the paper attempt to address these?

2. The consistency assumption is core to the proposed method. Why is it reasonable to assume higher capability LLMs can evaluate others more accurately? What evidence supports this? And what are the limitations?

3. The paper uses Elo ratings to compute model scores. Why was Elo chosen over other rating systems? What adjustments were made to the standard Elo formula and why? How sensitive are the results to this rating scheme?

4. Three evaluation metrics are proposed - PEN, CIN, and LIS. What are the motivations and interpretations behind each one? What are their relative advantages/drawbacks? 

5. The method is validated on 3 datasets. What are the key differences between these datasets and why were they chosen? How do the results vary across datasets and what inferences can be made?

6. Ablation studies are performed by varying the confidence weights $w$. What do these experiments demonstrate about the consistency assumption? What additional analyses could be done?

7. The paper claims the method is unsupervised and automatic. But the model pool $\mathcal{M}$ still requires some human curation. How could this pool be constructed in a more unsupervised manner?

8. The consistency optimization aims to align model confidence and scores. But how is a minimizer guaranteed to exist? Could adjustments to the loss function improve optimizer convergence?

9. The method relies on unlabeled open-ended questions. Would performance change if questions explicitly target model capabilities and deficiencies? How could the question dataset $\mathcal{Q}$ be improved?

10. The current analysis is limited to English language models. How could the approach be adapted to a multilingual setting for evaluating cross-lingual models? What additional complexities would arise?
