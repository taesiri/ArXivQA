# [Interventional Fairness on Partially Known Causal Graphs: A Constrained   Optimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10632)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing methods for achieving causal fairness assume that the true causal DAG representing the causal relationships between variables is fully known. However, in many real-world cases, the true causal DAG is unknown and we may only obtain a partially directed graph like an MPDAG from observational data and background knowledge. The paper aims to address the problem of achieving causal fairness based on interventions when only partial knowledge about the causal structure is available.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a framework for achieving interventional fairness on partially known causal graphs represented as MPDAGs. The key ideas are:

1) Model the prediction $\hat{Y}$ as a function of all observational variables $\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{A}$. This gives rise to another MPDAG over the augmented set of variables. 

2) Leverage the concept of interventions and the resulting MPDAG to formally discuss the identification of interventional fairness criterion. Provide conditions under which the fairness measure is identifiable from observational data.

3) Formulate a constrained optimization problem to balance between prediction accuracy and fairness. The fairness constraint penalizes the discrepancy between interventional distributions under different sensitive attribute values.

Main Contributions:

- Establish a modeling technique that enables performing causal inference formally after modeling the prediction as the effect of all observables.

- Provide identification results regarding when the interventional fairness measure can be expressed in terms of observational densities.

- Develop a framework for achieving approximate interventional fairness on MPDAGs via constrained optimization.

- Demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on simulated and real-world datasets. The method allows trading off between accuracy and fairness by tuning a balancing parameter.

In summary, the paper presents a principled approach for attaining causal fairness when only partial causal graphical knowledge is available, advancing the capability of fair machine learning methods applicable in real-world problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework for achieving causal fairness based on interventions when the true causal graph is partially known, specifically a class of causal DAGs called Partially Directed Acyclic Graphs (PDAGs) that can be learned from observational data combined with domain knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a framework for achieving causal fairness based on the notion of interventions when the true causal graph is partially known. Specifically, the main contributions are:

1) It proposes a modeling technique on the predictor, which gives rise to a causal MPDAG on which it is feasible to perform causal inference formally.

2) It analyzes the identification condition over the interventional fairness measure on the MPDAG. 

3) It develops a framework for achieving interventional fairness on partially known causal graphs, specifically MPDAGs, as a constrained optimization problem that balances between fairness and accuracy.

The proposed approach allows for learning fair predictions from observational data when the underlying causal DAG is not fully known but only partially specified as an MPDAG. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results on simulated and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

The paper proposes a framework to achieve interventional fairness on partially known causal graphs, specifically MPDAGs, which can be learned from observational data and background knowledge. It formulates a constrained optimization problem to balance fairness and accuracy. The paper also analyzes the identification of interventional fairness criteria on MPDAGs. Key concepts like sensitive attributes, discrimination, and the trade-off between accuracy and fairness in machine learning models are discussed in the context of achieving causal notions of fairness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper assumes the absence of selection bias and latent confounders. What modifications would need to be made to the proposed framework to account for selection bias or latent confounders in the causal graph?

2. The paper models the predictor $\hat{Y}$ as a function of all observable variables. What are the advantages and limitations of this modeling approach compared to only using definite non-descendants of the sensitive attribute?

3. The paper shows that modeling the predictor in this way gives rise to another causal MPDAG $\mathcal{G}^*$. Explain the significance of being able to construct this "augmented" MPDAG and how it facilitates the analysis.

4. Explain the key ideas behind the proof of Theorem 1 which shows that the augmented graph $\mathcal{G}^*$ is an MPDAG consistent with the background knowledge. What property of Meek's orientation rules is leveraged?

5. Proposition 1 provides an identification formula for the distribution of $\hat{Y}$ under interventions on the MPDAG $\mathcal{G}^*$. Walk through the key steps in the proof of this result. 

6. The paper utilizes the MMD measure to quantify distributional differences between intervention groups. Discuss the strengths and limitations of using MMD versus other distributional divergence measures in this context.

7. The experimental results show tradeoffs between accuracy and fairness at different values of Î». Explain what factors contribute to this tradeoff relationship. Are there scenarios where no such tradeoff may exist?

8. The proposed method assumes interventional fairness as the notion of fairness. How readily could this approach be adapted to other causal fairness criteria like counterfactual fairness or path-specific fairness? What challenges may arise?

9. Beyond fairness, discuss some other potential applications where the idea of modeling a prediction variable on an MPDAG could be useful for causal inference.

10. The paper focuses on linear models for continuous variables and contingency tables for discrete variables. How could the proposed approach be extended to modern machine learning models like neural networks? What additional considerations would come into play?
