# [Concrete Subspace Learning based Interference Elimination for Multi-task   Model Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06173)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called Concrete Subspace Learning to address the issue of task interference in multi-task model fusion. The key idea is to identify a common low-dimensional subspace across fine-tuned models targeting different downstream tasks, then perform model merging within this shared subspace to leverage common information while mitigating negative interference. Specifically, they formulate a bi-level optimization problem to meta-learn a concrete mask parameterized by temperature and logits to capture the shared subspace. In the inner loop, model fusion is performed using techniques like Task Arithmetic or AdaMerging to maximize performance. In the outer loop, the concrete mask logits are optimized to find a beneficial subspace common across tasks. This concrete mask provides a differentiable relaxation of a discrete mask. Extensive experiments were conducted on vision and language domains with fully fine-tuned and LoRA fine-tuned models. The results demonstrate superior performance over comparison methods like Task Arithmetic, Ties-Merging and AdaMerging. The effectiveness highlights the promise of identifying and utilizing shared subspaces for multi-task model fusion. Key strengths include the method's versatility as an add-on and its ability to resolve task interference while retaining model capabilities.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method called Concrete Subspace Learning to address the issue of task interference when merging multiple task-specific models into a unified multi-task model. 

The key problem is that directly merging task-specific models can introduce interference between different tasks, negatively impacting the performance of the merged multi-task model. Existing techniques try to resolve such conflicts by evaluating individual model parameters in isolation, overlooking their collective impact. 

The proposed solution, Concrete Subspace Learning, identifies a common low-dimensional subspace across tasks and utilizes the shared information within this subspace to alleviate interference without significantly compromising overall performance.

Specifically, the problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization, with the top-level objective being to learn a shared subspace mask and the lower-level goal being maximizing the multi-task model's performance. The mask induces sparsity to identify the subspace. A novel differentiable Concrete mask based on continuous relaxation of discrete distributions enables gradient-based optimization.

The method can seamlessly integrate with existing techniques like Task Arithmetic and AdaMerging as an add-on, enhancing them to Concrete Task Arithmetic and Concrete AdaMerging. Extensive experiments on vision and language tasks demonstrate consistent improvements and state-of-the-art results.

The key contributions are: (1) Proposing Concrete Subspace Learning to address task interference via a shared low-dimensional subspace. (2) A bi-level optimization framework and meta-learning approach to learn the subspace. (3) Enhanced techniques Concrete Task Arithmetic and Concrete AdaMerging. (4) Demonstrating strong empirical performance exceeding existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method called Concrete subspace learning to identify a common low-dimensional subspace across tasks and use the shared information within it to address the issue of task interference in multi-task model fusion without significantly impacting overall performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing the CONtinuous relaxation of disCRETE (Concrete) subspace learning method to identify a common low-dimensional subspace of model parameter space and leverage the shared information within it to address the issue of task interference in multi-task model fusion.

2) Modeling the problem as a bi-level optimization problem and introducing a meta-learning framework to find the Concrete subspace mask through gradient-based techniques. 

3) Introducing enhanced variations of two multi-task model fusion techniques known as Task Arithmetic and AdaMerging, termed Concrete Task Arithmetic and Concrete AdaMerging.

4) Conducting extensive experiments on both vision and language domains to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the Concrete subspace learning approach to tackle task interference in multi-task model fusion, formulating it as a bi-level optimization problem, and showing its effectiveness empirically. The enhanced Task Arithmetic and AdaMerging techniques are secondary contributions that also demonstrate the versatility of the core Concrete subspace learning idea.
