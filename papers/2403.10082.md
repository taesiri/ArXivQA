# [CrossGLG: LLM Guides One-shot Skeleton-based 3D Action Recognition in a   Cross-level Manner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10082)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for one-shot skeleton-based action recognition rely solely on low-level joint location information and lack guidance from high-level semantics. This leads to issues like loss of important motion details, difficulty in grasping overall motion characteristics, and weak generalization ability.

Solution: 
The paper proposes CrossGLG, a novel framework that leverages knowledgeable text descriptions from language models to guide skeleton feature learning in a global-local-global manner:

1) Global-to-Local Guidance: A global action description is used to guide the model to focus on informative local joints. A Joint Importance Determination module aligns its outputs with the key joints derived from the text to focus the encoder on important areas.

2) Local-to-Global Guidance: Non-local interactions between local joint-level motion descriptions and skeleton features are built to exchange information and summarize a high-level global representation.

To handle asymmetry between training/inference, a dual-branch architecture is designed - one branch for skeleton encoding and one branch for cross-modal guidance. A shared classifier encourages consistency between branches so only the skeleton encoder is needed at test time.

Contributions:
- First work to utilize language model text descriptions for one-shot skeleton-based recognition
- Proposes CrossGLG framework with global-local-global cross-modal guidance 
- Designs a dual-branch architecture to address training/inference asymmetry
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets while being efficient at test time
- Can serve as a plug-and-play module to enhance various skeleton encoders

In summary, the paper introduces an effective approach to inject high-level human knowledge through text to guide one-shot skeleton-based action recognition, with strong empirical results. The dual-branch design also makes the method efficient at test time.

The paper proposes a cross-modal guidance framework called "CrossGLG" that uses text descriptions from LLMs to guide skeleton feature learning in a global-to-local and then local-to-global manner. Key components include using a global text description to guide focus on informative joints, establishing non-local interactions between joint-level text and skeleton features, and a dual-branch architecture to address asymmetry between training and inference. The goal is effective one-shot 3D action recognition by incorporating human knowledge guidance at both global and local levels.
