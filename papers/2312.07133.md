# [Text2AC-Zero: Consistent Synthesis of Animated Characters using 2D   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07133)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a zero-shot approach for generating temporally consistent videos of animated characters using pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. It employs text-based motion diffusion models to produce a sequence of human skeletons and depth maps that guide the T2I model to generate video frames. To achieve temporal consistency between frames, the paper introduces two key components: Spatial Latent Alignment and Pixel-Wise Guidance. The former aligns the latent codes between frames based on pre-computed cross-frame dense correspondences from DensePose. The latter steers the diffusion process to minimize visual discrepancies between frames. Experiments demonstrate that the approach outperforms existing zero-shot text-to-video methods in terms of pixel-wise consistency and user preference. The paper also introduces a new metric called Human Mean Squared Error to numerically evaluate temporal consistency. Overall, this is a novel zero-shot paradigm for animated character video synthesis that leverages pre-trained components and boosts consistency without any training.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models are computationally expensive to train and require large-scale video datasets. Their zero-shot alternatives using pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models fail to produce temporally consistent videos, with generated content drifting and flickering between frames.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a zero-shot approach to generate consistent videos of animated characters by leveraging pre-trained T2I and text-based motion diffusion models. It introduces two main components:

1) Spatial Latent Alignment: Attempts to align latent codes between video frames based on pre-computed cross-frame dense correspondences from DensePose. This provides an injective mapping between pixels across frames to propagate latents and RGB values for consistency.

2) Pixel-Wise Guidance: Steers the diffusion process to minimize visual discrepancies between frames using the dense correspondences. It computes an L2 difference between corresponding pixels and uses its gradient to update the latents.

Main Contributions:

- A zero-shot paradigm to produce consistent and continuous videos of diverse animated characters using pre-trained diffusion models, without needing large-scale video training data.

- Two main components - Spatial Latent Alignment and Pixel-Wise Guidance to significantly boost temporal consistency leveraging cross-frame dense correspondences.

- Introduction of a new metric, Human Mean Squared Error, to numerically evaluate temporal consistency by comparing pixel values of the animated character.

- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance over existing zero-shot T2V approaches, with a ~10% error reduction in the proposed metric and 76% user preference.

In summary, the paper presents a novel zero-shot approach to generate high-quality and consistent videos of animated characters by effectively utilizing pre-trained assets, overcoming limitations of existing T2V methods.
