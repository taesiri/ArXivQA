# [Text2AC-Zero: Consistent Synthesis of Animated Characters using 2D   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07133)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a zero-shot approach for generating temporally consistent videos of animated characters using pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. It employs text-based motion diffusion models to produce a sequence of human skeletons and depth maps that guide the T2I model to generate video frames. To achieve temporal consistency between frames, the paper introduces two key components: Spatial Latent Alignment and Pixel-Wise Guidance. The former aligns the latent codes between frames based on pre-computed cross-frame dense correspondences from DensePose. The latter steers the diffusion process to minimize visual discrepancies between frames. Experiments demonstrate that the approach outperforms existing zero-shot text-to-video methods in terms of pixel-wise consistency and user preference. The paper also introduces a new metric called Human Mean Squared Error to numerically evaluate temporal consistency. Overall, this is a novel zero-shot paradigm for animated character video synthesis that leverages pre-trained components and boosts consistency without any training.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a zero-shot approach to generate temporally consistent videos of animated characters using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models by aligning latents across frames and providing pixel-wise guidance based on dense correspondences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A zero-shot approach for generating temporally consistent videos of animated characters using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. This eliminates the need for training computationally expensive text-to-video models on large video datasets.

2) The introduction of two main components - Spatial Latent Alignment and Pixel-Wise Guidance - to align the latent codes across video frames and steer the diffusion process towards minimizing discrepancies between frames. This boosts temporal consistency.

3) A new evaluation metric called Human Mean Squared Error to measure the pixel-wise consistency of the animated characters across frames.

4) Qualitative and quantitative experiments showing the proposed method outperforms existing zero-shot text-to-video approaches in terms of temporal consistency and user preference.

In summary, the main contribution is a zero-shot framework to generate videos of animated characters with improved temporal consistency over prior arts, using pre-trained components and without needing expensive model training or fine-tuning.

The paper proposes a zero-shot approach for generating temporally consistent videos of animated characters using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Key ideas include using text-based motion diffusion models to generate guidance signals, aligning latents across frames to improve consistency, and introducing pixel-wise guidance based on dense correspondences between frames.
