# [Adversarial Nibbler: An Open Red-Teaming Method for Identifying Diverse   Harms in Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12075)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
As text-to-image (T2I) AI models like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Imagen grow in capability and availability, it is critical to evaluate their safety and mitigate potential harms. Most testing focuses on explicitly unsafe inputs, but subtle "implicitly adversarial" inputs that seem harmless can still trigger models to generate offensive imagery. Thoroughly evaluating safety requires uncovering diverse edge cases through "red teaming".

Solution - The Adversarial Nibbler Challenge:
The authors introduce a public "red teaming" competition called the Adversarial Nibbler Challenge to crowdsource implicitly adversarial text prompts that expose safety issues in T2I models. It engages diverse participants through gamification, enables iterative refinement of attacks, and gathers rich human annotations on failure modes. This facilitates proactive, thorough auditing to promote responsible T2I development.

Key Contributions:
- Novel methodology for scaled collaborative red teaming of AI safety issues using public participation 
- Analysis of over 10k text prompts tested against multiple T2I models, with both human and machine harm annotations 
- Identification of creative new attack strategies like visual/semantic ambiguity and cultural exploitation
- Benchmark dataset and visualization tools for the community
- Guidelines and framework for continual, data-centric auditing of AI generative models

Main findings: 
Even the most advanced T2I models still fail on 14% of images humans consider harmful but machines label "safe". Participant submissions reveal complex, subtle attack vectors highlighting the need for sustained safety evaluation and adaptation rather than simply blocking explicitly unsafe inputs.
