# [Entity-level Factual Adaptiveness of Fine-tuning based Abstractive   Summarization Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15162)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Abstractive summarization models often generate factually inconsistent content when there is a knowledge conflict between the parametric knowledge embedded in the model and the knowledge in the input document.
- Prior work has focused on factual consistency on original datasets, but has not analyzed the model's robustness to knowledge conflicts (i.e. factual adaptiveness). 

Key Contributions:
- Introduces the concept of "factual adaptiveness" to measure robustness of summarization models to knowledge conflicts using two metrics - conditional likelihood ($M_{CL}$) and factual consistency ($M_{FC}$).
- Analyzes various summarization models on factual adaptiveness and finds that methods that improve factual consistency do not necessarily enhance robustness to knowledge conflicts.  
- Proposes a controllable counterfactual data augmentation method to synthesize samples with adjustable degrees of knowledge conflict. Replaces entities based on parametric knowledge of language models.
- Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method effectively improves factual adaptiveness of models by mitigating entity-level hallucinations from knowledge conflicts while maintaining performance on original test sets.

In summary, this paper formalizes the concept of factual adaptiveness to evaluate robustness of summarization models to knowledge conflict. It reveals that factual consistency on original data and adaptiveness to knowledge conflicts are not strongly correlated. The proposed counterfactual data augmentation strategy enhances adaptiveness while preserving consistency.
