# [Deep Learning with Parametric Lenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00408)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- There is a lack of rigorous, unifying mathematical frameworks for analyzing and explaining machine learning algorithms. Most analysis is done heuristically, which limits transparency and scalability.
- Core aspects of gradient-based learning that need to be captured: (i) parametric computation (ii) bidirectionality of information flow (iii) differentiation. 

Proposed Solution:
- Develop the mathematical notion of a "parametric lens", built compositionally from simpler categorical constructs:
    - Parametric categories ($\Para$): capture parametric maps $f: P \times X \to Y$
    - Lenses from functional programming: capture bidirectional/invertible transforms
    - Cartesian reverse differential categories: abstract differentiation
- Show how models, optimisers, loss functions, learning rates etc. can all be uniformly framed as parametric lenses.
- Composition of simpler parametric lenses yields complex learning systems. Modularity enables comparative analysis.

Contributions:
- Powerful, unifying semantics for gradient-based learning algorithms, encompassing:
    - Different models beyond neural networks (e.g. boolean circuits)
    - Different optimisers (gradient descent, Adam, momentum etc.) 
    - Different loss functions (MSE, binary cross-entropy, softmax etc.)
- Principled mathematical explanation of what is being "learned" and "backpropagated". 
- Enables easier implementation, experimentation and analysis. Showcased via Python library.
- Foundation for further extensions, e.g. modelling architectures, probabilistic/unsupervised learning.

The paper thus develops parametric lenses as a fundamental mathematical structure underpinning gradient-based learning. The lens perspective brings abstraction, uniformity and compositionality, while still covering diverse practical instances of machine learning.
