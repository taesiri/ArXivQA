# [Intention Action Anticipation Model with Guide-Feedback Loop Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12450)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of anticipating human intention from egocentric videos. Specifically, it focuses on predicting the next action indicating intention based on observing video frames before a target time. This is challenging because human activities are complex, dynamic and sometimes ambiguous. Prior works have limitations in exploiting temporal contexts across different time scales. 

Method:
The paper proposes a Hierarchical Complete-Recent (HCR) fusion model to address the limitations. The key ideas are:

1) Extract both complete features (from entire video) and recent features (from end of video). Complete features provide global context while recent ones focus on critical recent cues. 

2) Propose a Guide-Feedback Loop (GFL) mechanism to model interplay between one complete and one recent feature. It allows guidance, feedback and interactive update between them through attention and residuals.

3) Aggregate multiple complete features with each recent feature using a MultiComplete-Recent Feature Aggregation module based on GFL and Transformer.

4) Hierarchically fuse all complete and recent features to make final intention prediction.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel strategy to treat complete and recent features differently based on their attributes. Provides new perspective for action anticipation.

2) GFL mechanism enables effective interaction between features via guidance, feedback etc. Improves representational ability.  

3) Concepts of global-local and multi-scale temporal context modeling allows capturing comprehensive temporal cues.

The experiments on two datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed HCR model. Both quantitative results and qualitative visualization verify the efficacy of the model components.
