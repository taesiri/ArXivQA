# [ADT: Agent-based Dynamic Thresholding for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01488)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Anomaly detection is critical in many domains, but setting appropriate thresholds is challenging. Static or manually-defined thresholds are not useful for complex and dynamic data.  
- Existing dynamic thresholding methods have limitations in performance, robustness and stability.

Proposed Solution:
- Models the thresholding problem in anomaly detection as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
- Proposes an agent-based dynamic thresholding (ADT) framework using Deep Q-Network (DQN) to provide adaptive optimal thresholding control.
- Utilizes an autoencoder for feature learning and anomaly scoring from complex time series data. 
- ADT takes the anomaly scores as input and adjusts the threshold between a passive mode (threshold=1) and an active mode (threshold=0).

Key Contributions:
- Models anomaly detection thresholding as an MDP and solves it with DQN for the first time.
- Integrates autoencoder with the proposed ADT framework for anomaly detection.
- ADT is very data-efficient, requiring <1% of data for training.
- Experiments on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate ADT's superior thresholding capability, stability and robustness.
- Significantly outperforms benchmark methods in anomaly detection performance, achieving best F1 scores up to 0.999.
- Provides in-depth analysis of the effect of key parameters.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel dynamic thresholding approach for anomaly detection using deep reinforcement learning, with demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. The agent-based method provides adaptive optimal control of thresholds.
