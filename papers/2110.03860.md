# [Token Pooling in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03860)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: 

How do dynamic processes in superconductors relate to the laws of thermodynamics, specifically the second law about entropy and irreversibility?

The key points relevant to this research question are:

- The paper examines the history of how physicists viewed superconducting transitions, in terms of whether they were reversible (no entropy increase) or irreversible (with entropy increase from Joule heating).

- Before 1933 superconducting transitions were seen as irreversible with Joule heating. But after the discovery of the Meissner effect in 1933, they were viewed as reversible to avoid contradicting the second law. 

- The paper argues this was illogical, since Joule heating in the normal state should not depend on origins of currents in the superconducting state. 

- Experimental evidence is presented on phenomena like persistent currents in the presence of resistance, suggesting superconducting processes are not fully reversible.

- The paper suggests conventional theories of superconductivity based on equilibrium thermodynamics are inconsistent regarding entropy and irreversibility. 

In summary, the central hypothesis is that standard theoretical frameworks may fail to fully capture the thermodynamic nature of superconducting transitions and dynamics. The evidence aims to highlight inconsistencies with the second law assumption of reversibility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of the main contributions:

- The paper discusses the history of how physicists' views on whether the superconducting transition is reversible or irreversible have changed over time. 

- It highlights that before 1933, physicists believed the transition from the superconducting state to the normal state was irreversible due to Joule heating. 

- After the discovery of the Meissner effect in 1933, physicists had to change their view and consider the transition reversible, to avoid contradicting the 2nd law of thermodynamics.

- The paper argues that this change in viewpoint was illogical, since the dissipation of energy in the normal state should not depend on how the current was generated in the superconducting state.

- It points out that no theory of superconductivity, including the conventional BCS theory, can explain how a current could be dissipated in the normal state without Joule heating.

- The paper presents experimental results on persistent currents and voltages in superconducting rings that provide evidence of irreversibility and Joule heating, contradicting the conventional reversible view. 

- It concludes that the belief in the 2nd law led to an inconsistent theory of superconductivity, and physicists should reconsider the status of the 2nd law based on logic and experimental evidence.

In summary, the main contribution is highlighting the contradictory history and theories of reversible vs. irreversible superconducting transitions, and providing experimental support showing irreversibility and implications for reconsidering the 2nd law.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review, here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of superconductivity:

- The paper focuses on analyzing the thermodynamic reversibility of the superconducting transition, especially in relation to the Meissner effect and Joule heating. This ties into fundamental questions about whether superconductivity can be described within equilibrium thermodynamics. Other recent work by J.E. Hirsch has similarly questioned the internal consistency of conventional BCS theory regarding reversibility and the Meissner effect.

- The author provides a historical overview of how views on the reversibility of the superconducting transition have evolved since the 1930s. This historical context is useful, as most current research does not delve into the origins of the theoretical foundations in depth.

- A significant portion of the paper is devoted to discussing experimental observations of persistent currents and spontaneous voltage in superconducting rings. The author argues these effects provide evidence for violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Comparatively fewer experimental papers focus on the thermodynamic implications; rather they aim to understand the underlying mechanisms behind persistent currents.

- Theoretical analysis of the Ginzburg-Landau equations demonstrates their limitations for describing the dynamics of the superconducting transition. Other theoretical work utilizes GL theory extensively, so this critical perspective stands out. 

- Overall, the themes of irreversibility and connections to the second law of thermodynamics make this paper quite unique compared to other contemporary research on superconductivity, which tends to stay within the standard theoretical framework. The historical analysis and experimental evidence provide context for reconsidering long-standing fundamental assumptions.

In summary, this paper provides a rare critical examination of the foundations of superconductivity theory, complemented by historical analysis and experimental results. This sets it apart from most current research, which operates wholly within the standard BCS/GL theoretical framework.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper discusses the historical belief that the transition from the superconducting to normal state involves irreversible Joule heating, and how this view was changed in the 1930s to consider the transition as reversible to avoid contradicting the Meissner effect and the second law of thermodynamics, resulting in an inconsistency in conventional theories of superconductivity regarding Joule heating that persists today.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of this paper suggest a few future research directions:

- Further experimental studies of dynamic processes in superconductors to clarify the issue of whether the superconducting transition violates the second law of thermodynamics. They suggest experiments investigating how surface screening currents are damped when superconductivity is destroyed.

- Theoretical development of a model that can fully describe the dynamics of the superconducting transition, including changes in velocities and angular momenta of charge carriers. The current theories like Ginzburg-Landau theory have limitations in explaining the dynamics.

- Studies of persistent currents and voltage generation in asymmetric superconducting rings to further probe the thermodynamic nature of superconductivity. The authors suggest experiments varying parameters like the switching frequency between superconducting and normal states.

- Experiments investigating the force propelling charge carriers in the Meissner effect and other superconductivity dynamics. There are open questions about what provides the driving force when standard electromagnetic forces seem insufficient.

- Broader reconsideration of belief in the absolute validity of the second law of thermodynamics. The experimental results mentioned in this paper appear to challenge the second law, so the authors suggest the physics community re-evaluate this long-standing assumption.

In summary, the main future directions are further experiments probing the dynamic processes and thermodynamics of superconductivity, developing theories to explain the observed dynamics, and questioning underlying assumptions like the absolute status of the second law of thermodynamics. The authors aim to spur research to resolve inconsistencies in the current understanding of superconductivity.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper discusses the transition from the superconducting to normal state in a magnetic field and how it relates to the laws of thermodynamics. Historically, before 1933 this transition was considered an irreversible process with Joule heating. But after the discovery of the Meissner effect in 1933, physicists considered it a reversible process to avoid contradicting the second law of thermodynamics. The author argues that this change in thinking was illogical, since Joule heating in the normal state should not depend on how the current appeared in the superconducting state. He reviews experimental evidence showing that persistent currents can exist with nonzero resistance, indicating Joule heating occurs, contradicting the conventional theories of superconductivity based on equilibrium thermodynamics. The author concludes that the belief in the validity of the second law of thermodynamics has led to inconsistencies in theories of superconductivity and conflicts with experimental results.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper discusses the history of how physicists have viewed the superconducting transition in a magnetic field and its relation to the laws of thermodynamics. Prior to 1933, the transition from the superconducting to normal state in a magnetic field was considered an irreversible thermodynamic process because of Joule heating from the decay of screening currents. However, after the discovery of the Meissner effect in 1933, physicists had to consider the transition as reversible to avoid contradiction with the second law of thermodynamics. This led to the contradiction that Jorge Hirsch has pointed out between conventional superconductivity theory based on equilibrium thermodynamics and the presence of Joule heating. 

The paper reviews experimental evidence related to this history and contradiction. Persistent currents and voltage oscillations have been observed in superconducting rings with non-zero resistance, indicating Joule heating occurs and the transition is not fully reversible. The author argues the belief in the validity of the second law of thermodynamics has led to illogical and experimentally inconsistent claims about superconductivity over the past century. He concludes the physics community should abandon this belief and recognize superconducting transitions and persistent currents may represent new directed forms of thermal motion not accounted for in thermodynamics.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the method used in the paper:

This paper theoretically analyzes the transition from the superconducting to normal state in a magnetic field from the perspective of thermodynamics and irreversible processes. It reviews the history of how this transition was viewed - initially as an irreversible process involving Joule heating before 1933, and then after the discovery of the Meissner effect in 1933, as a reversible process to avoid contradiction with the second law of thermodynamics. The paper argues that the conventional theories of superconductivity, which were developed using equilibrium thermodynamics, are inconsistent with the generation of Joule heat that should occur during the transition. Experimental results on phenomena like persistent currents and dc voltages in superconducting rings are analyzed to provide evidence of irreversible Joule heating, indicating that the thermodynamic treatment may not be valid. Overall, the paper uses a theoretical analysis of thermodynamics along with a review of experimental results to critique the conventional reversible understanding of the superconducting transition.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the issue of the consistency between the conventional theory of superconductivity and the laws of thermodynamics. Some key points:

- The paper discusses how before 1933, the transition from the superconducting to normal state in a magnetic field was considered an irreversible process with Joule heating. 

- After the discovery of the Meissner effect in 1933, this view changed and the transition was considered reversible to avoid contradiction with the second law of thermodynamics. 

- The author argues that this change in perspective contradicted logic, since Joule heating in the normal state should not depend on how the current was generated in the superconducting state.

- The conventional theory of superconductivity was developed within equilibrium thermodynamics, but implicitly assumes dissipation and Joule heating. 

- The author cites experimental evidence of Joule heating during the superconducting transition, contradicting the assumption of reversibility.

- The key problem addressed is the inconsistency between the irreversible dissipation processes experimentally observed in superconductors and the reversible framework used in the conventional theory of superconductivity.

In summary, the paper is focused on highlighting the contradictions between the conventional theory of superconductivity and experimental observations when analyzed through the lens of thermodynamics and irreversible processes like Joule heating. The reversibility assumption in the theory seems inconsistent with actual superconductor behavior.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper examines the relationship between superconducting transitions and the laws of thermodynamics. The author notes that before 1933, the transition from the superconducting to normal state in a magnetic field was considered an irreversible thermodynamic process due to Joule heating. However, after the discovery of the Meissner effect in 1933, physicists began considering this transition as reversible, to avoid contradicting the second law of thermodynamics. The Meissner effect, where a superconductor expels magnetic flux, would violate the second law if the transition generated Joule heating. To resolve this, physicists postulated after 1933 that the screening current is damped without generating heat during the transition. 

The paper argues that this revised viewpoint contradicted both logic and experimental evidence. The process of a current dissipating heat should not depend on how the current was originally generated in the superconducting state. Experiments have also demonstrated persistent currents and voltage differences with partial resistance, conflicting with the heat dissipation assumption. The paper concludes that the conventional theories of superconductivity are internally inconsistent, as they predict Joule heating yet claim the transitions are reversible. Blind belief in the second law led to these contradictions, indicating it may need re-examination for processes like superconductivity. Overall, the history and experimental results suggest superconducting transitions involve irreversible thermodynamics, requiring new theories that can properly account for Joule heating.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper discusses the history and issues surrounding the conventional theories of superconductivity and their consistency with the laws of thermodynamics. Before 1933, the transition from the superconducting to normal state in a magnetic field was considered an irreversible process with Joule heating. But after the discovery of the Meissner effect in 1933, this view changed because the Meissner effect would contradict the second law of thermodynamics if Joule heating occurred during the transition. To avoid this contradiction, physicists started considering superconducting transition as a reversible, equilibrium process without Joule heating. The author argues that this change sacrificed logic, as the dissipation process in the normal state should not depend on how the current originally arose in the superconducting state. The conventional theories of superconductivity, created within equilibrium thermodynamics, cannot explain how current can be damped without Joule heating. The author reviews experimental evidence of persistent currents and quantum oscillations that challenge the reversibility assumption. He concludes that blind belief in the second law has led to inconsistencies in superconductivity theories and contradictions with experiment, and the physical community should reconsider absolute status of the second law.

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we improve the computational efficiency and cost-accuracy trade-off of vision transformers?

More specifically, the authors aim to develop a better token downsampling method to reduce the computational cost of vision transformers while preserving accuracy. They hypothesize that there is redundancy in the intermediate representations produced by vision transformers, and this redundancy can be exploited to downsample tokens without significantly impacting accuracy. 

The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:

- They analyze the computational complexity of different components of vision transformers and identify that fully-connected layers, not attention, are the main bottleneck. 

- They argue that score-based token pruning methods have limitations in preserving information.

- They show that softmax attention acts as a smoothing operator, producing redundant intermediate representations.

- They formulate the downsampling problem as minimizing the reconstruction error when approximating the full set of tokens with a smaller subset.

- They propose "Token Pooling", a novel non-uniform data-aware method to select a subset of tokens via clustering algorithms like K-Means/K-Medoids.

- Their method outperforms prior downsampling techniques like score-based pruning and achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between cost and accuracy on vision transformers.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that redundancy in intermediate representations of vision transformers can be exploited by a better downsampling approach to improve efficiency. The key contribution is the proposed Token Pooling method using clustering to minimize reconstruction error.

Token Pooling uses clustering algorithms to aggregate similar tokens, minimizing the reconstruction error when reducing the number of tokens. Experiments show Token Pooling achieves significantly better computation-accuracy trade-offs compared to prior downsampling techniques for vision transformers.

In summary, the key contribution is a new downsampling method for vision transformers that uses clustering to minimize reconstruction error when reducing tokens.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other research on vision transformers:

- This paper focuses specifically on improving the computational efficiency of vision transformers through a new token downsampling technique called Token Pooling. Many other papers have looked at efficiency, but they tend to focus only on improving the self-attention mechanism rather than the overall architecture.

- The analysis in Section 3 provides useful insights into why existing methods like score-based pruning have limitations - they fail to account for redundancy and tend to either retain similar tokens or prune away too much information. This motivation is different from other approaches.

- The proposed Token Pooling method is novel in formulating the downsampling as a clustering problem to minimize reconstruction error. Most prior work uses uniform downsampling methods borrowed from CNNs. Using clustering to explicitly model redundancy is a unique approach.

- The experiments comprehensively compare Token Pooling against score-based methods like PoWER-BERT, random selection, token pruning, etc. under the same training protocol. Many papers introduce a new method but do not compare as extensively. 

- The gains shown from Token Pooling are significant - up to 42% computation reduction for the same accuracy. This demonstrates it is a strong advancement over prior methods.

- The method itself is simple and flexible enough to apply to many transformer architectures. Many other techniques require modifying the architecture more heavily.

Overall, this paper makes excellent contributions in efficiency improvements for vision transformers, with a novel clustering-based downsampling approach, extensive comparative experiments, and impressive gains over previous techniques. The insights and analysis into properties of vision transformers are also valuable for this emerging field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing better token downsampling/pruning techniques specifically designed for vision transformers. The authors propose Token Pooling in this paper, but suggest there is room for improvement and further research into downsampling methods optimized for vision transformers.

- Exploring different clustering algorithms or formulations of the downsampling objective for Token Pooling. The authors mainly use K-Means/K-Medoids clustering in this work, but suggest trying other clustering approaches as future work.

- Applying Token Pooling to other vision transformer architectures besides DeiT. The authors demonstrate benefits for DeiT models, but suggest Token Pooling could likely improve other vision transformer architectures as well.

- Combining Token Pooling with other efficiency techniques like neural architecture search, quantization, etc. The authors propose using Token Pooling along with techniques like varying feature dimensionality, but suggest integrating it with other methods could lead to further gains.

- Developing techniques to automatically determine the downsample ratio K for each layer. The authors use a predefined schedule for K, but suggest automating the setting of K as future work.

- Further analysis into the information redundancy in vision transformer representations. The authors provide some analysis of the smoothing effects of attention, but suggest further study of the redundancies could inform future downsampling designs.

- Applying Token Pooling to natural language processing transformers. The authors focus on computer vision, but suggest their technique could also be relevant for NLP models.

Overall, the main themes seem to be improving Token Pooling itself, applying it to new models/tasks, combining it with other methods, and better understanding the source of representational redundancy that makes downsampling effective. The authors propose Token Pooling as a promising step, but outline many opportunities for future work in this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new token downsampling method called Token Pooling for vision transformers to improve their computational efficiency. The authors first analyze the computational bottlenecks in vision transformers and show that most of the computation is spent in fully-connected layers rather than attention. They also analyze limitations of prior token pruning methods based on significance scores. The paper then motivates token downsampling by showing that attention layers act as low-pass filters, producing redundant tokens. The proposed Token Pooling method minimizes the reconstruction error when downsampling tokens by formulating it as a clustering problem. Specifically, it runs K-Means or K-Medoids clustering on the token features to select a diverse subset of tokens. Experiments on ImageNet classification using DeiT models demonstrate that Token Pooling provides significantly better computation-accuracy trade-off compared to prior downsampling techniques like grid pooling and score-based pruning. With Token Pooling, the authors are able to reduce computations in DeiT models by over 40% with similar or better accuracy. The simple and effective Token Pooling operator has the potential to benefit many vision transformer architectures.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper proposes a novel token downsampling method called Token Pooling for vision transformers. Vision transformers have shown great success in computer vision tasks but their high computational cost limits their application in resource-constrained settings. The paper first analyzes the computational bottleneck in vision transformers and finds that the fully-connected layers constitute the majority of computations, not the attention layers. The paper argues that images and intermediate features in vision transformers contain redundancy that can be exploited to reduce computations via downsampling. They formulate token downsampling as an optimization problem of minimizing the reconstruction error when reducing the number of tokens. The proposed Token Pooling method solves this optimization efficiently using clustering algorithms like K-Means and K-Medoids. Experiments show Token Pooling significantly outperforms prior downsampling techniques like grid pooling and token pruning in terms of computation-accuracy tradeoff on ImageNet classification. Applied to DeiT models, Token Pooling improves efficiency by 42% with matched accuracy.

In summary, this paper identifies the computational bottleneck in vision transformers as the fully-connected layers rather than attention. It proposes Token Pooling, a new way to perform token downsampling in transformers by minimizing reconstruction error when reducing tokens. Token Pooling uses clustering algorithms to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Experiments demonstrate Token Pooling provides the best computation-accuracy tradeoff compared to prior methods like grid pooling and token pruning. When applied to DeiT models, Token Pooling can improve efficiency by 42% with matched accuracy on ImageNet classification. The proposed technique is simple yet effective at exploiting redundancy in vision transformers to improve efficiency.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new token downsampling technique called Token Pooling for vision transformers. The key idea is to formulate token downsampling as an optimization problem of minimizing the reconstruction error when reducing the number of tokens. Specifically, given the output tokens from a transformer block, the goal is to find a smaller set of tokens that best preserves the information in the original set after upsampling. The paper shows that this reconstruction error minimization can be efficiently achieved by clustering algorithms like K-Means and K-Medoids. The output tokens are taken as the cluster centers. Compared to prior methods based on scoring and pruning tokens, this clustering approach provides a more accurate and diverse approximation of the original tokens. The Token Pooling operator aggregates similar tokens to remove redundancy while retaining important information. Experiments on ImageNet show that inserting Token Pooling layers significantly improves the computation vs. accuracy trade-off of vision transformers.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper focuses on reducing the computational requirements and improving the efficiency of vision transformers. Specifically, it addresses the following key questions/problems:

- What is the computational bottleneck in vision transformers? The paper analyzes the cost breakdown and shows that the fully-connected layers, rather than the attention mechanism, are the main bottleneck, consuming over 80% of computation. 

- What are the limitations of prior work on efficient transformers, particularly score-based token pruning methods like PoWER-BERT? The paper argues that these methods have suboptimal computation-accuracy tradeoffs due to retaining redundant tokens and pruning informative ones.

- Can we exploit the inherent redundancy in visual data and transformer representations to downsample tokens more efficiently? The paper proposes that attention layers act implicitly as low-pass filters, inducing redundancy. This motivates a reconstruction error minimizing formulation for downsampling.

- How can we downsample tokens by optimally aggregating information and minimizing the reconstruction error? The paper proposes Token Pooling, which uses clustering algorithms to solve this optimization problem in a computationally efficient manner.

- Does this approach provide improved accuracy-computation tradeoffs compared to prior methods? Experiments on ImageNet show that Token Pooling consistently outperforms prior downsampling techniques across computational budgets and architectures. For example, it achieves the same accuracy as DeiT using 42% fewer FLOPs.

In summary, the key focus is developing a principled and efficient token downsampling operator to reduce the computation in vision transformers and improve their accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. The core ideas are exploiting redundancy and reconstructibility via clustering.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes Token Pooling, a novel downsampling method for vision transformers that improves computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The authors first analyze the computational cost of vision transformers and find that the fully-connected layers consume over 80% of compute, while softmax attention is not the bottleneck. They note that images and intermediate features contain redundancy, which can be exploited by downsampling. The paper formulates token downsampling as a reconstruction error minimization problem and shows it can be efficiently solved with clustering algorithms like K-Means and K-Medoids. This aggregates similar tokens and retains a diverse, representative set of tokens. The proposed Token Pooling layer is inserted after transformer blocks and outperforms prior methods like score-based pruning in the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. Experiments on ImageNet show Token Pooling reduces computations by 42% in DeiT models with similar or better accuracy. Theoretically, the paper relates softmax attention to low-pass filtering, which explains the induced feature redundancy. Overall, Token Pooling is a simple and effective operator for vision transformers that reduces computational requirements while maintaining accuracy through strategic aggregation of visual information.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel token downsampling method called Token Pooling for vision transformers. The authors first analyze the computational complexity of vision transformers and identify that the fully-connected layers, not the attention layers, are the main bottleneck. They then argue that the attention layers act like a smoothing filter, introducing redundancy in the token representations. Motivated by this, they propose Token Pooling which efficiently exploits this redundancy by minimizing the reconstruction error when downsampling tokens. Specifically, Token Pooling performs clustering on the token features to obtain a smaller representative set that best approximates the original tokens. Compared to prior methods like score-based pruning used in PoWER-BERT, Token Pooling provides a better accuracy-computation trade-off. Experiments on ImageNet show that their method applied to DeiT models significantly reduces computations by 42% while maintaining accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a simple yet effective token downsampling technique for vision transformers that outperforms prior methods.
