# [Efficient Vision-and-Language Pre-training with Text-Relevant Image   Patch Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07883)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision Transformer (ViT) models are increasingly used in large-scale Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models. However, modeling lengthy visual sequences from high-resolution images leads to high computational costs during training and inference.
- Prior works on accelerating ViTs focus on computer vision tasks and remove redundant tokens based on visual semantics only, ignoring language context. This is unsuitable for cross-modal VLP models.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes TRIPS - an efficient VLP approach with Text-Relevant Image Patch Selection to reduce redundant visual tokens under guidance of the textual context.
- A novel text-relevant patch selection layer is introduced that dynamically computes text-dependent visual attention to identify attentive visual tokens and merges inattentive ones in an end-to-end manner.
- This layer preserves attentive tokens with text guidance and fuses inattentive tokens into one, thereby reducing the visual sequence length to enhance efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- First work to accelerate VLP models by reducing image tokens with assistance of linguistic context.
- Design of the text-relevant patch selection layer that selects visual tokens dynamically based on alignment with text in a parameter-efficient way.
- Experiments show ~40% efficiency gains with competitive or better performance on 5 vision-language tasks by incorporating TRIPS into existing VLP models like ALBEF and mPLUG.
- By increasing input image resolution while maintaining cost, TRIPS utilizes additional visual tokens to further improve downstream task performance.

In summary, the paper makes VLP models much more efficient by eliminating visually redundant tokens in alignment with text, through the novel design of the text-relevant image patch selection approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient vision-language pre-training model called TRIPS that selectively reduces redundant image tokens under the guidance of textual context to accelerate training and inference without compromising performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as:

1. It introduces an efficient vision-and-language pre-training model featuring Text-Relevant Image Patch Selection (TRIPS). This is the first attempt to reduce the computational cost of VLP models by diminishing image tokens with the assistance of linguistic context.

2. It proposes a novel text-relevant patch-selection layer, which can dynamically compute text-dependent visual attention to identify attentive (or critical) image tokens and merge inattentive ones with text guidance in an end-to-end manner. 

3. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TRIPS can enhance the training and inference efficiency of VLP models while incurring lower computational costs. Moreover, by increasing the input image resolution, TRIPS leverages additional image tokens to achieve superior performance without increasing computational expenses.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient VLP approach called TRIPS to reduce redundant image tokens with text guidance, which accelerates VLP models while maintaining or improving performance on downstream vision-language tasks.

The paper introduces an efficient VLP approach called TRIPS that uses a text-guided patch selection layer to progressively reduce redundant image tokens in the visual encoder. This improves computational efficiency while maintaining performance on various downstream vision-language tasks. Key ideas include using the textual context to identify attentive vs inattentive image tokens, preserving the former and fusing the latter. Overall the focus is on accelerating ViT-based VLP models and cross-modal fusion through selective reduction of visual sequences.
