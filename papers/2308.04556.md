# [FocalFormer3D : Focusing on Hard Instance for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04556)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we improve the recall rate and reduce false negatives in 3D object detection, especially for occluded or hard to detect objects?The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling and identifying false negatives (missed detections) in a multi-stage manner can guide 3D object detectors to focus more on excavating these hard instances, thereby boosting recall rates. In particular, the paper proposes a method called "Hard Instance Probing" (HIP) to progressively probe for false negatives across stages. This allows the model to concentrate on excavating the hard, occluded objects that were missed in earlier stages. The paper then shows how this HIP method can be instantiated in a 3D object detector called FocalFormer3D, demonstrating improved recall and reduced false negatives.In summary, the core research question is how to reduce false negatives in 3D detection, with the key hypothesis being that explicitly probing for hard instances in a multi-stage manner will excavate more of the challenging, occluded objects. FocalFormer3D serves as an implementation of this HIP approach.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a 3D object detection method called FocalFormer3D that uses a multi-stage heatmap prediction strategy called Hard Instance Probing to focus on detecting difficult objects, along with a transformer-based decoder module for refining object candidates, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and Waymo datasets for both LiDAR-only and multi-modal 3D detection.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in 3D object detection:- It focuses specifically on improving recall and reducing false negatives, which has been an understudied area in recent 3D detection methods. Many papers focus more on overall accuracy metrics like mAP.- It proposes a novel Hard Instance Probing (HIP) framework to identify and focus on hard examples during training. This is a unique approach compared to other hard example mining techniques. - It achieves state-of-the-art results on major datasets like nuScenes and Waymo using a simple and efficient architecture. Many other top papers use more complex model designs.- For multi-modal detection, it uses a relatively simple fusion approach compared to methods like lift-splat-shoot or BEVFormer camera encoders. But it still achieves strong performance.- It demonstrates the value of transformers for 3D detection, whereas earlier SOTA models relied more on convolutional networks. The deformable transformer decoder is an interesting design choice.- It does not require any extra segmentation labels or datasets like some other methods. The model architecture and training process are fairly straightforward.- It performs well in both detection and tracking settings, showing the versatility of the approach. Some detectors optimize more for one task.Overall, I would say this paper distinguishes itself by its novel focus on reducing false negatives in a principled way, combined with strong results using simple and efficient model designs. The Hard Instance Probing concept seems like a useful contribution applicable to many 3D perception tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest are:- Extending the hard instance probing (HIP) method to camera-based detectors. The authors note a key limitation is that HIP currently relies on the assumption that object centers produce Gaussian-like peaks in the BEV heatmap, which may not hold for camera-based detectors where heatmaps tend to be fan-shaped. Modifying HIP to work with other heatmap distributions could broaden its applicability.- Applying HIP to long-range 3D detection. The authors state there has been limited exploration of hard instances in long-range detection, so evaluating HIP in this setting could be interesting future work.- Investigating alternative ways to identify hard vs easy instances beyond using the BEV heatmap response. The authors mention this is currently a heuristic approach that may not generalize, so exploring other indicators of instance difficulty could improve the method.- Optimizing the computation efficiency and latency of the multi-stage heatmap encoder and decoding modules. The authors provide a latency analysis and suggest there are opportunities to optimize things like the Top-K selection process.- Exploring stronger fusion techniques for the multi-modal variant, such as those used in other state-of-the-art detectors. The authors used a simple fusion approach and suggest investigating more sophisticated methods.- Enhancing the box refinement network to improve bounding box orientation/angle prediction. The authors show some failure cases arise from incorrect box angles despite accurate centers.- Applying HIP to related domains like 2D object detection or panoptic segmentation to see if it transfers well. Evaluating the generalizability of the approach to other tasks.In summary, the main future directions focus on broadening HIP to other detectors and tasks, optimizing computational efficiency, improving box regression, and researching alternative hard instance identification techniques. Overall, the authors position HIP as a promising research direction for improving recall and reducing false negatives in vision tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents FocalFormer3D, a 3D object detection model that focuses on reducing false negatives (missed detections). It introduces a multi-stage heatmap prediction approach called Hard Instance Probing (HIP) to identify false negatives and guide the model to focus on detecting those hard instances during training. Specifically, it accumulates true positive predictions into a positive mask to exclude easy instances in subsequent stages, enabling the model to concentrate on false negatives. This results in high-recall object candidates. FocalFormer3D also uses a transformer-based decoder module to efficiently refine the candidates into the final detections. Experiments on nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that FocalFormer3D achieves state-of-the-art detection performance. The high recall and accuracy are attributed to the effectiveness of the hard instance probing technique in excavating difficult objects. The model ranks 1st on the nuScenes detection and tracking leaderboard.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new 3D object detection method called FocalFormer3D that improves recall by focusing on hard false negative instances. The method uses a multi-stage heatmap encoder network that implements a Hard Instance Probing (HIP) strategy to generate high-recall object candidates. At each stage, it masks out easy positives from prior stages and focuses on predicting the remaining hard false negatives in the heatmaps. The hard instances are collected across stages as object candidates. A deformable transformer decoder is then used to refine the candidates and eliminate false positives. FocalFormer3D demonstrates strong performance on nuScenes for both LiDAR-only and multi-modal detection settings. Without any bells and whistles, it achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes 3D detection and tracking benchmarks, ranking 1st place among published LiDAR-based methods at the time of submission. The gains are attributed to the hard instance probing scheme, which improves recall by around 6-8 points in average recall across multiple center distance thresholds compared to prior arts. This allows FocalFormer3D to effectively reduce false negatives.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a 3D object detection method called FocalFormer3D that focuses on detecting hard instances to improve prediction recall. The main components are:1. A multi-stage heatmap encoder network that implements a Hard Instance Probing (HIP) strategy to produce high-recall object proposals. It uses accumulated positive masking on the bird's eye view (BEV) heatmaps to focus on false negative detections from prior stages during training. This allows it to progressively discover hard instances.  2. A deformable transformer decoder network that takes the object proposals and refines them. It represents proposals as box-level queries and enhances them with a Box-Pooling module to incorporate local BEV context. This allows refining the boxes in a local region rather than just using point features. It also uses a rescoring strategy to eliminate false positives.In summary, the multi-stage heatmap encoder aims to increase object recall, especially for hard instances. The deformable decoder then refines the object proposals to remove duplicates and false positives. Together this improves detection accuracy while focusing on reducing false negatives.
