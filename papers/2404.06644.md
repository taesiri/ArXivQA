# [Khayyam Challenge (PersianMMLU): Is Your LLM Truly Wise to The Persian   Language?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06644)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is challenging, especially for non-English languages like Persian where quality resources are lacking. Existing Persian datasets have limitations in diversity, complexity, and metadata. Automatic translation also causes inaccuracies. 

Solution: The authors introduce the "Khayyam Challenge" (PersianMMLU), a meticulously curated benchmark with 20,192 multiple-choice questions spanning 38 diverse tasks excerpted from Persian exams. It covers various subjects and ages to assess different facets of LLMs. 

Key Features:
(i) Comprehensive coverage of topics assessing language comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall
(ii) Rich metadata like difficulty levels, descriptive answers, human performance 
(iii) New non-contaminated data avoiding translation errors 
(iv) Origination in Persian tailored for native speakers
(v) Inherent scalability through updated exams

Experiments & Results: Various Persian LLMs were evaluated, with GPT-4 showing best performance. Overall models struggled in technical domains needing reasoning. Analysis revealed dependence between human and LLM accuracy on difficulty. GPT-4 outperformed humans on intentionally tricky "trapped" questions. Some models displayed bias towards certain choices.

Impact: Khayyam Challenge enhances Persian LLM evaluation by highlighting limitations to motivate enhancements. Its diversity and metadata facilitate detailed analysis. As an original non-translated resource, it captures linguistic and cultural nuances. The work marks a significant step in assessing Persian language understanding abilities of LLMs.
