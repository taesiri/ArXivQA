# [ZeRO++: Extremely Efficient Collective Communication for Giant Model   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10209)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper presents a system of optimizations called ZeRO++ that aims to reduce the communication overhead of the ZeRO distributed training method when training large deep learning models. The main research question is how to reduce the communication volume and overhead associated with gathering model parameters and synchronizing gradients across many GPUs during distributed training with ZeRO. The key ideas proposed are:- Using quantization to compress model weights during the gather operations in the forward and backward passes. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be communicated.- Creating hierarchical partitions of the model weights so that some communication collects can be restricted to within a node, avoiding slower inter-node communication. - Designing a novel gradient synchronization method using hierarchical all-to-all communication and quantization to significantly reduce the amount of gradient data that needs to be communicated between nodes.The main hypothesis is that by optimizing these three areas to reduce communication volume, the system can improve the scalability and throughput of distributed training with ZeRO on clusters with limited inter-node bandwidth or small per-GPU batch sizes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the key contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces three novel communication optimizations (qwZ, hpZ, qgZ) that collectively reduce the communication overhead of the ZeRO optimizer by 4x for training giant deep learning models. 2. qwZ uses blocked quantization to reduce the communication volume of weight all-gather by 50%. 3. hpZ eliminates inter-node all-gather communication during backward propagation by hierarchical partitioning of model weights.4. qgZ proposes a new all-to-all quantized gradient reduction to reduce gradient communication by 75% compared to reduce-scatter.5. The paper provides an optimized implementation that enables overlapping of computation and communication as well as custom CUDA kernels to realize the performance benefits. 6. Extensive evaluations demonstrate up to 2.4x speedup over ZeRO baseline across various model sizes, consistent benefits in both high and low bandwidth clusters, and negligible impact on model convergence.7. The techniques are implemented as part of the open-sourced DeepSpeed library to benefit the community.In summary, the key innovation is the set of algorithmic and systems optimizations that dramatically improve the communication efficiency of distributed training using the ZeRO optimizer, enabling more efficient training for extremely large deep learning models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my review, the main point of this paper is to introduce several optimizations to the ZeRO optimizer called ZeRO++ that reduces communication overhead during distributed training of large deep learning models. Specifically, it uses techniques like quantization, hierarchical partitioning of weights, and a novel gradient reduction method to reduce communication volume by 4x, enabling much higher throughput and scalability when training giant models across hundreds of GPUs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my high-level thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper focuses on communication optimizations for model parallel training, specifically for ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer). Most prior works have focused on optimizing data parallel training, so this provides a novel angle.- The paper introduces three main techniques - quantized weight communication, hierarchical weight partitioning, and quantized gradient communication - that work together to reduce communication overhead in ZeRO. These seem like novel ideas not explored in prior work. - The quantized communication techniques are related to previous work on model quantization and gradient compression, but tailored for the ZeRO setting where model states are partitioned across GPUs.- The hierarchical weight partitioning is related to some prior works like MiCS, but differs in only replicating weights instead of all model states to reduce memory overhead.- The evaluation shows impressive throughput and scaling results on large models (up to 138B parameters), significantly outperforming ZeRO baselines. Few other works have evaluated such large models in a comparable setting.- The paper demonstrates these optimizations translate to real system speedups rather than just theoretical analysis. The optimizations are also open-sourced for broader use.- One limitation is that the techniques are specific to ZeRO and not as generally applicable compared to optimizations for data parallelism. But ZeRO has become popular for large model training.In summary, the paper introduces novel techniques for communication-efficient model parallel training that outperform state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins, demonstrated on very large scale models. The ideas seem novel compared to prior art and the paper shows compelling empirical results.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest include:- Further improving the quantization techniques to reduce the impact on model accuracy. The paper mentions using more advanced and efficient quantization algorithms in the future.- Exploring the applicability of the techniques like hierarchical partitioning and quantized communication to other parallelism approaches beyond just ZeRO. The paper notes their methods are not limited to ZeRO stage 3.- Applying the quantized communication techniques to reduce latency of operations like all-gather and reduce-scatter in general, beyond ZeRO.- Supporting lower precision number representations like FP8 or INT4 to further reduce communication volumes. The paper briefly mentions this as a direction.- Extending the techniques to train even larger models at trillion parameter scale. The paper envisions their methods helping push towards giant trillion parameter models.- Exploring statistical and adaptive quantization methods that can adjust quantization parameters dynamically based on data statistics.- Further optimizing the CUDA kernels and computation scheduling to minimize overheads.- Evaluating the techniques on a broader range of models beyond just natural language models presented in the paper.So in summary, the main future directions seem to be around improving the quantization quality, applying the methods to broader contexts, supporting lower precision representations, optimizing implementations further, and pushing towards even larger scale modeling. The authors present their work as helping democratize large scale training, so extending applicability and scalability appear as key future goals.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:This paper presents ZeRO++, a system of optimizations to reduce communication overhead in distributed training of large deep learning models using the ZeRO optimizer. ZeRO++ has three main components: 1) Quantized weight communication (qwZ) which uses blocked quantization to compress weights during forward propagation all-gather. 2) Hierarchical weight partitioning (hpZ) which maintains a full model copy within each node to eliminate inter-node communication during backward propagation all-gather. 3) Quantized gradient communication (qgZ) which uses a novel all-to-all collective quantized reduction to compress gradients during backward propagation. Together these optimizations reduce the total communication volume of ZeRO by 4x. Extensive evaluations on models up to 138 billion parameters show ZeRO++ improves throughput by up to 2.4x over ZeRO baseline on up to 384 GPUs. It also achieves similar throughput using 4x lower bandwidth as the baseline. Finally, convergence analysis indicates ZeRO++ does not impact model accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper presents ZeRO++, a set of optimizations to improve the communication efficiency of the ZeRO distributed training method for large deep learning models. ZeRO partitions model states like weights and gradients across GPUs to save memory, but has high communication costs. ZeRO++ proposes three techniques to reduce this communication. First, it uses blocked quantization to compress weights during forward propagation all-gather. Second, it holds a full replica of weights on each node to avoid inter-node communication during backward propagation. Third, it replaces reduce-scatter with a novel quantized all-to-all algorithm for gradient aggregation that reduces volume and preserves accuracy. The authors implement ZeRO++ optimizations in CUDA and evaluate performance on up to 384 GPUs. Experiments show ZeRO++ achieves up to 2.4x higher throughput than ZeRO baseline across various model sizes. It also enables similar throughput as the baseline on 4x lower bandwidth networks. The optimizations compose well and reduce communication volume 4x. Convergence is similar to the baseline. The authors open source ZeRO++ to make large model training more efficient and accessible.
