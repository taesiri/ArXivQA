# [Trust Regions for Explanations via Black-Box Probabilistic Certification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11168)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the issue that local explanation methods for machine learning models, while useful for explaining individual predictions, generally do not provide any guarantee on how widely applicable the explanations are for nearby examples. The authors formalize a novel problem called "black box probabilistic explanation certification" to address this issue. 

Given a black box model, an explanation method, an example, and a fidelity metric (e.g. stability of the explanation), the goal is to find the largest hypercube centered at the example such that when the explanation is applied to all examples within this hypercube, a fidelity criterion is met with high probability. Finding such a "trust region" around an example has benefits like providing insights into model behavior over a region, explanation reuse leading to efficiency gains, and serving as a meta-metric for comparing explanation methods.

Proposed Solution: Ecertify
The authors propose an approach called Ecertify to solve this problem using only black box access to the model. Ecertify has two key components:

1. An outer algorithm that searches over candidate hypercube widths, leveraging information from certified and violating widths found in previous iterations to guide the search. 

2. Three inner strategies with increasing complexity that are used to check if a candidate hypercube width can be certified: 
   - Uniform sampling
   - Uniform incremental sampling 
   - Adaptive incremental sampling

These strategies provide guarantees on the probability that the minimum fidelity over the hypercube differs from its empirical estimate by no more than a tolerance level.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of the black box probabilistic explanation certification problem
- Ecertify approach to solve this problem with theoretical guarantees 
- Analysis providing exponential tail bounds on the probability estimations
- Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrating accuracy of estimates and computational gains from explanation reuse

The paper introduces a novel perspective for evaluating explanation methods in terms of certified regions, rather than individual examples. Ecertify also has practical benefits like explanation reuse leading to efficiency improvements.
