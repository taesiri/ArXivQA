# [Assessing the Unitary RNN as an End-to-End Compositional Model of Syntax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05719)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is: Can unitary evolution recurrent neural networks (URNs) model hierarchical syntactic structures in language more effectively than long short-term memory networks (LSTMs)?Specifically, the authors aim to compare URNs and LSTMs on their ability to model context-free long distance dependencies as well as mildly context-sensitive cross-serial dependencies. They hypothesize that URNs will outperform LSTMs on these tasks due to their compositionality and ability to retain all information over long distances. The key hypothesis is that the compositionality and mathematical properties of URNs make them better suited for capturing complex syntactic patterns compared to more opaque models like LSTMs.To test this, the authors train URNs and LSTMs on two synthetic pattern languages - a context-free Dyck language for nested dependencies and a cross-serial dependency language inspired by linguistic phenomena. They find that URNs generalize better and are less prone to overfitting. The authors conclude that URNs show promise as explainable models of syntax that can recognize hierarchical structures, unlike LSTMs which struggle on deeper nesting. Overall, the central hypothesis is that URNs are superior syntactic models compared to LSTMs due to their compositionality and long-distance retention of information. The experiments on artificial languages aim to demonstrate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing and assessing the Unitary Recurrent Neural Network (URN) as an end-to-end compositional model of syntax. Specifically:- The paper shows both theoretically and experimentally that the URN satisfies strict compositionality, as the representation of a sequence is the composition (via matrix multiplication) of the representations of its parts. This compositionality results from the use of unitary matrices in the URN architecture.- Through experiments on synthetic languages exhibiting context-free and mildly context-sensitive patterns, the URN demonstrates an ability to model hierarchical structure and long-distance dependencies. It outperforms LSTMs on these tasks in terms of generalization and avoiding overfitting.- The URN achieves this syntactic modeling capability with minimal architectural complexity and full transparency, as it lacks non-linear activations. This makes it more amenable to analysis compared to other RNN architectures. - The authors position the URN as extending previous work on compositional vector space semantics, by offering a compositional model of syntax learning. The URN handles semantic interpretation in a principled way through matrix composition.In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating the URN's effectiveness and interpretability as an end-to-end compositional syntax learner, through comparison to LSTMs on modeling complex syntactic patterns. The simplicity, compositionality and generalizability of the URN are highlighted as significant advantages.

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:This paper assesses the unitary-evolution recurrent neural network (URN) model of syntax, demonstrating that it can learn both context-free and mildly context-sensitive patterns, while retaining mathematical tractability and strict compositionality.
