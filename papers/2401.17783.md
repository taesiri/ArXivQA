# [SDRDPy: An application to graphically visualize the knowledge obtained   with supervised descriptive rule algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17783)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Data scientists can extract knowledge from data, but lack interfaces for experts to easily understand and utilize the results. 
- This is also an issue with supervised descriptive rule discovery (SDRD) algorithms. Experts lack tools to visualize the results intuitively. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents SDRDPy, a desktop application for graphical and tabular visualization of SDRD algorithm results. 
- It can process and evaluate rules from any SDRD algorithm without needing adaptations to the code. 
- It provides overall rule analysis, metrics, contingency tables, scatter plots, and detailed data coverage for each rule.
- The interface is user-friendly for expert analysis and allows exporting reports.

Key Contributions:
- SDRDPy fills a gap by providing the first customizable visualization tool for a wide variety of SDRD algorithms. 
- It focuses on intuitive understanding of rules, data, quality metrics and their interrelationships.
- The tool adapts to any algorithm and data format used without the need for the researcher to make adaptations.
- It enables detailed expert analysis that is easy to export and share across domains like medicine, industry, etc.
- The application is extendable to more algorithms and environments like big data and data streaming.

In summary, SDRDPy uniquely contributes an expert-focused, customizable and adaptable visualization tool to promote intuitive understanding and practical utilization of knowledge from supervised descriptive rule discovery algorithms across application domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.
