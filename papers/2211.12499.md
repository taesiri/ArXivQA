# [Instant Volumetric Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12499)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to create instant digital avatars that can be modeled and rendered in real-time from a short monocular RGB video. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

- A deformable neural radiance field modeled with neural graphics primitives and embedded around a parametric face model can enable fast optimization and rendering of photorealistic facial avatars from video.

- Leveraging the geometric prior of the parametric face model can help the neural radiance field extrapolate better to novel views. 

- Conditioning the neural radiance field on facial expression parameters can compensate for details not modeled geometrically like wrinkles and mouth interior.

- Establishing a canonical space and using a deformation field to map between canonical and input spaces allows modeling dynamic sequences efficiently.

So in summary, the main research aims to develop a methodology to reconstruct high-quality animatable avatars nearly instantaneously from monocular video by combining ideas like canonical spaces, deformation fields, neural radiance fields, and parametric face models. The fast generation and rendering are key goals compared to previous avatar reconstruction methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a novel method called Instant Volumetric Head Avatars (INSTA) for quickly reconstructing photo-realistic and animatable 3D digital avatars from monocular RGB video input. 

- Using a dynamic neural radiance field based on neural graphics primitives embedded around a parametric face model. This allows modeling the dynamic appearance and geometry of the face.

- Achieving significantly faster training time (minutes rather than hours/days) compared to prior state-of-the-art methods while producing higher quality results.

- Leveraging the geometric prior of the parametric face model to help with novel view synthesis and pose extrapolation.

- Demonstrating high quality avatar reconstruction on a variety of real subjects, with comparisons to other state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be a new method for very rapidly optimizing high quality 3D facial avatars from monocular video, enabled by a surface-embedded dynamic neural radiance field architecture. The speed and quality improvements over prior work are the key results.
