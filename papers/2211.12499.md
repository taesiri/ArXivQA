# [Instant Volumetric Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12499)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to create instant digital avatars that can be modeled and rendered in real-time from a short monocular RGB video. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

- A deformable neural radiance field modeled with neural graphics primitives and embedded around a parametric face model can enable fast optimization and rendering of photorealistic facial avatars from video.

- Leveraging the geometric prior of the parametric face model can help the neural radiance field extrapolate better to novel views. 

- Conditioning the neural radiance field on facial expression parameters can compensate for details not modeled geometrically like wrinkles and mouth interior.

- Establishing a canonical space and using a deformation field to map between canonical and input spaces allows modeling dynamic sequences efficiently.

So in summary, the main research aims to develop a methodology to reconstruct high-quality animatable avatars nearly instantaneously from monocular video by combining ideas like canonical spaces, deformation fields, neural radiance fields, and parametric face models. The fast generation and rendering are key goals compared to previous avatar reconstruction methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a novel method called Instant Volumetric Head Avatars (INSTA) for quickly reconstructing photo-realistic and animatable 3D digital avatars from monocular RGB video input. 

- Using a dynamic neural radiance field based on neural graphics primitives embedded around a parametric face model. This allows modeling the dynamic appearance and geometry of the face.

- Achieving significantly faster training time (minutes rather than hours/days) compared to prior state-of-the-art methods while producing higher quality results.

- Leveraging the geometric prior of the parametric face model to help with novel view synthesis and pose extrapolation.

- Demonstrating high quality avatar reconstruction on a variety of real subjects, with comparisons to other state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be a new method for very rapidly optimizing high quality 3D facial avatars from monocular video, enabled by a surface-embedded dynamic neural radiance field architecture. The speed and quality improvements over prior work are the key results.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on instant volumetric head avatar reconstruction:

- Leverages neural graphics primitives (NGPs) for fast training and rendering compared to traditional NeRF methods. This is similar to some other recent works like Neural Actor that also use NGPs.

- Uses a parametric face model (FLAME) to guide the geometry and deformation field. Other works like Nerface and IMAvatar also exploit parametric face models but this paper shows improved quality and speed. 

- Achieves training in under 10 minutes on a single GPU. This is much faster than other state-of-the-art methods like IMAvatar (~5 days) and Nerface (~3 days). The fast training time enables instant avatar creation.

- Demonstrates high quality view synthesis and rendering, outperforming baselines like NHA, Nerface and IMAvatar in terms of visual quality according to both quantitative metrics and human perception.

- Extrapolates better to novel views compared to other methods by leveraging the FLAME geometry prior. This is an important capability for AR/VR avatars.

- Only requires an RGB video as input, making it easy to apply to standard webcam or smartphone videos. Other data-driven avatar methods often require specialized capture setups.

Overall, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in instant avatar creation with innovations in geometry-guided neural rendering that enable fast training and high quality view synthesis from monocular video. The results convincingly beat other recent methods in terms of speed, quality, and view generalization.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called Instant Volumetric Head Avatars (INSTA) that can create photo-realistic, animatable 3D avatars from monocular RGB videos in just a few minutes by optimizing a deformable neural radiance field embedded in a parametric face model.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Improving the quality and detail of the hair region. Currently, the hair modeling is not as high quality as the face interior modeling. Better hair representation could improve the viewpoint extrapolation.

- Better approximating the mouth region geometry. The 3DMM model used does not contain teeth geometry. Adding teeth geometry could improve the quality of the mouth region, especially for viewpoint extrapolation.

- Improving rendering speed to enable real-time high resolution video conferencing in AR/VR. The current rendering speed is real-time for 512x512 resolution, but needs to be faster for higher resolutions needed in immersive applications.

- Making the training process a background process to continuously update and refine the avatar during a conversation. This could help capture initially unseen regions or details and update the avatar accordingly over time.

- Addressing failure cases such as geometry misalignment issues from the face tracking, artifacts from extreme facial expressions, and artifacts when extrapolating beyond the training expressions.

So in summary, the main future directions are: improving hair and mouth region detail/quality, increasing rendering speed for higher resolutions, making training a continuous background process, and addressing current failure cases. The overall goal is to improve quality and interactivity to enable realistic avatar-based telepresence.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents Instant Volumetric Head Avatars (INSTA), a novel approach for quickly reconstructing photo-realistic digital avatars from a single monocular RGB portrait video. INSTA models a dynamic neural radiance field based on neural graphics primitives embedded around a parametric face model. The pipeline is trained on a short monocular RGB video capturing the subject under different expressions and views. While state-of-the-art methods can take days to train an avatar, INSTA can reconstruct a digital avatar in under 10 minutes, orders of magnitude faster. By leveraging the geometry prior of the parametric face model, INSTA can extrapolate well to unseen poses. Experiments show INSTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and training time. The key contributions are the surface-embedded dynamic neural radiance field allowing fast optimization, and the 3DMM-driven regularization of the density field to enable better pose extrapolation, important for AR/VR applications.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents Instant Volumetric Head Avatars (INSTA), a novel approach for reconstructing photo-realistic digital avatars instantaneously from monocular RGB video. The key idea is to model a dynamic neural radiance field based on neural graphics primitives embedded around a parametric face model. Specifically, they use FLAME to track the facial expressions and poses from the input video. A deformation field is then established around the surface using a bounding volume hierarchy. Points sampled during volumetric rendering are transformed to a canonical space using this deformation field to query the neural radiance field, which is conditioned on facial expression parameters to model details not captured by FLAME. The neural radiance field is optimized using a photometric loss and a geometric regularization loss based on depth maps rendered from the FLAME model to improve viewpoint extrapolation. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, this approach achieves higher rendering quality while being orders of magnitude faster, requiring only around 10 minutes to reconstruct a digital avatar on modern GPU hardware. The method demonstrates high-quality novel view synthesis and the ability to generate photo-realistic avatars instantaneously.
