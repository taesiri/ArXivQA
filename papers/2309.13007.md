# [ReConcile: Round-Table Conference Improves Reasoning via Consensus among   Diverse LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13007)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review of the paper, the central hypothesis is that engaging multiple large language models (LLMs) in a collaborative, multi-round discussion with confidence estimation and convincing explanations can improve their collective reasoning capabilities beyond what any individual LLM can achieve on its own. 

The key elements of their proposed method called ReConcile seem to be:

1) Using multiple diverse LLMs as "agents" in a round-table discussion format, as opposed to just using multiple instances of the same model as in prior work. This diversity aims to get complementary benefits from different model families.

2) Facilitating multi-round discussions where agents can update their answers and explanations based on insights from other agents, with the goal of convincing each other to reach better consensus.

3) Estimating confidence scores for the answers given by each agent, and using these scores to weigh the final voted answer after discussion concludes.

4) Providing "convincing samples" with human explanations that can correct initially wrong answers, to teach agents how to generate convincing explanations.

Through experiments on commonsense and math reasoning tasks, they show ReConcile improves over individual LLMs and outperforms prior single-agent and multi-agent methods. The results seem to support their central hypothesis that collaborative discussion between diverse LLMs can enhance reasoning capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing ReConcile, a multi-model multi-agent framework designed to improve reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through consensus building. The key ideas are:

- Using multiple diverse LLMs (ChatGPT, Bard, Claude2) as agents in a round table conference to promote diverse thoughts and discussion. 

- Facilitating multi-round discussions between the agents where they try to convince each other to reach better consensus by generating convincing explanations. 

- Estimating confidence of each agent's response and using it to determine the final answer through weighted voting.

- Showing through experiments on commonsense and math reasoning datasets that ReConcile outperforms prior single-agent and multi-agent methods. It also outperforms GPT-4 on some benchmarks.

- Demonstrating that even a stronger model like GPT-4 as one of the agents in ReConcile sees significant accuracy gains from discussion with weaker models, highlighting the benefit of mutual feedback.

In summary, the main contribution is a new multi-agent framework that leverages diverse LLMs in collaborative discussion with confidence estimation and convincingness to improve reasoning and consensus building. The method shows promising results on multiple benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-agent framework called ReConcile where diverse large language models like ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude2 engage in round-table discussions, estimate confidence in their responses, and learn to generate convincing explanations using human demonstrations in order to reach better consensus and improve reasoning capabilities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper focuses on multi-agent reasoning, which aims to improve reasoning capabilities by having multiple large language models (LLMs) collaborate and discuss solutions. This is an emerging field of research that builds on recent advances in LLMs. 

- Compared to single-agent reasoning methods like self-consistency and self-refinement, this paper introduces a more sophisticated multi-agent framework where models can discuss solutions through multiple rounds, convince each other using human explanations, and aggregate using confidence estimates. The results demonstrate clear improvements over single-agent baselines.

- The key innovation compared to prior multi-agent debate frameworks is the use of diverse LLMs rather than just multiple instances of the same model. By combining complementary strengths of different model families like ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, more novel insights are generated through discussion. 

- The concept of selecting convincing explanations that can rectify an incorrect prediction is novel. This technique of "in-context learning from explanations" helps models improve through the discussion.

- Estimating confidence of black-box LLMs and using it to weight each agent's contribution is an impactful addition not explored by prior multi-agent systems.

- The round-table conference format here seems more flexible than strict debate formats, allowing models to continuously update their solutions each round based on others' reasoning.

- Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both commonsense and mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to existing approaches. Notably, the method even exceeds a much stronger model like GPT-4 on some datasets.

In summary, this work pushes forward the frontier of multi-agent reasoning research through several innovations like diverse models, convincing explanations, confidence estimation, and a flexible discussion framework. The substantial gains over both single- and multi-agent baselines validate the promise of this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Experiment with more diverse agents in ReConcile, including more powerful models like GPT-4. The authors showed initial experiments using GPT-4 as one of the agents in ReConcile, and found it could still benefit from discussion with comparatively weaker models. They suggest further exploration of involving agents with varied capabilities.

- Develop better techniques for eliciting and calibrating confidence estimates from black-box LLMs. The authors used a simple post-hoc verbal technique to obtain confidence values. They suggest investigating learned models for confidence estimation and calibration. 

- Study the effectiveness of ReConcile on more complex reasoning tasks that require deeper multi-step reasoning and commonsense knowledge. The authors experimented with math and commonsense reasoning datasets, but suggest trying more challenging benchmarks.

- Analyze the generated discussions and explanations more deeply using metrics beyond just accuracy. This could reveal more insights into how the discussion process leads to improved reasoning.

- Experiment with more rounds of discussion to find the optimal number of rounds. The authors found gains saturated after 2-3 rounds, but suggest exploring if more rounds could provide further benefits.

- Develop better methods for final answer aggregation, beyond weighted voting. This could potentially help improve results, especially when involving agents with varied capabilities.

- Investigate how to make the framework more sample efficient and reduce the need for human explanations. The authors required some human explanations as convincing samples, but suggest ways to minimize this requirement.

In summary, the key future directions focus on expanding the diversity of models and tasks, improving confidence estimation, analyzing the discussion process better, finding optimal hyperparameters like number of rounds, developing better answer aggregation methods, and reducing the need for human explanations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing versions of ReConcile with more diverse agents, including more recent models beyond ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude2. The authors suggest trying GPT-4 as one of the agents, but also exploring involvement of other state-of-the-art models as they emerge.

- Exploring alternative methods for confidence estimation and recalibration beyond the simple rescaling approach used in this work. The authors note that more sophisticated methods like Platt scaling could be beneficial but were not used here due to the few-shot nature of ReConcile.

- Experimenting in settings where the agents have more varied capabilities, instead of roughly similar performance like ChatGPT, Bard and Claude2. The weighted voting scheme becomes less effective in such cases, so developing better aggregation techniques would be useful.

- Trying ReConcile on a broader range of reasoning tasks beyond the mathematical, commonsense and scientific reasoning datasets used in this paper. Evaluating how the approach transfers to new domains could reveal insights. 

- Extending ReConcile to open-sourced models instead of relying only on API-based ones, to enable more control, avoid API limitations, and mitigate prompt engineering needs. The authors acknowledge current open-source models have issues following long prompts, but suggest this could change with future model releases.

- Analyzing the generated explanations in more depth using qualitative methods and human evaluations. This could shed light on how the explanations and discussion evolve.

- Exploring alternative prompting approaches to generate the explanations instead of only using chain-of-thought, to potentially further improve the diversity of reasoning processes.

In summary, the main suggested future directions are exploring more diverse agents, confidence estimation techniques, aggregation methods, tasks, models (open-sourced ones), and explainability approaches to further improve ReConcile's capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes ReConcile, a multi-agent framework for improving reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through discussions between diverse models. ReConcile consists of multiple rounds of discussion between LLM agents who try to convince each other to reach a consensus. In each round, ReConcile creates a discussion prompt for each agent containing the other agents' answers, explanations, confidence levels, and demonstrations of human explanations that can rectify incorrect answers (convincing samples). Agents use this prompt to update their answers, aiming to convince others. Once agents reach a consensus or exceed a round limit, ReConcile aggregates agents' answers via confidence-weighted voting. Experiments using ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude as agents show ReConcile improves over single- and multi-agent baselines on reasoning tasks, even surpassing GPT-4. Analysis shows diverse agents and convincing samples provide significant gains. ReConcile reaches better consensus faster than prior multi-agent debate methods. Overall, ReConcile demonstrates the potential of diverse LLMs mutually discussing complex problems and learning from each other to improve reasoning.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the limitations of current large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks, and proposes a new method called ReConcile to enhance their reasoning capabilities. 

Specifically, the key problems/questions it aims to address are:

- LLMs still struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require multiple steps of logical thinking and integration of background knowledge. They are prone to making mistakes due to lack of enough reasoning diversity.

- Most current methods that aim to improve reasoning in LLMs rely on a single model, either via self-reflection or sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths within the same model. But relying on a single model limits reasoning diversity and external feedback.

- Recently proposed multi-agent debating frameworks also typically rely on multiple instances of the same underlying LLM model (e.g. ChatGPT), limiting diversity. Moreover, they lack capabilities like confidence estimation and generating convincing explanations. 

- The paper investigates whether combining multiple diverse LLMs in a collaborative multi-agent setup can lead to better reasoning through discussion, consensus, and the ability to convince other agents.

In summary, the key limitations this paper tries to address are the lack of reasoning diversity and external feedback in current methods, and proposes a multi-model multi-agent framework called ReConcile to improve reasoning performance.
