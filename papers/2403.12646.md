# [Prompt-fused framework for Inductive Logical Query Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12646)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge graphs (KGs) suffer from incompleteness, including missing edges and emerging new entities. 
- Existing methods for logical query answering focus on handling missing edges but overlook emerging entities. 
- Most methods also lack a holistic understanding of the entire logical query when reasoning over it.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a prompt-fused framework called Pro-QE for inductive logical query answering. 
- It represents emerging entities by leveraging both local context (nearby nodes) and global context (relation domains/ranges) to obtain comprehensive representations.  
- A self-attention mechanism is used to enable information exchange between different neighbors.
- A query prompt is generated from the symbolic query to inject holistic query understanding into the reasoning process.  

Main Contributions:
- Emphasizes the significance of the inductive setting with emerging entities for logical queries.
- Advocates for holistic logical query understanding instead of decomposing queries. 
- Proposes the prompt-fused Pro-QE framework to address emerging entities and enable holistic reasoning.
- Introduces new benchmarks for evaluating inductive logical query answering.
- Experiments show Pro-QE outperforms baselines by large margins. Ablations verify the efficacy of each module.

In summary, this paper identifies key limitations of existing logical query answering methods regarding emerging entities and holistic reasoning. It proposes the Pro-QE framework to address these issues through context-aware representation learning and query prompt injection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pro-QE for inductive logical queries.
