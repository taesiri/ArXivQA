# [Denoising Task Difficulty-based Curriculum for Training Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10348)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models have shown promising performance for generative modeling tasks, but there are conflicting perspectives on the relative difficulties of denoising tasks across timesteps. Some works argue denoising is more difficult at larger timesteps while others claim earlier timesteps pose greater challenges.
- This discrepancy impedes accurate interpretation of previous studies and hinders development of sophisticated training methods that utilize timestep-wise variation in difficulty.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper first analyzes task difficulty from two aspects: 
    1) Convergence behavior across timesteps, revealing faster convergence at larger timesteps
    2) Change in relative entropy between consecutive distributions, showing decrease over timesteps
- Based on the observations that earlier timesteps are more difficult, the paper proposes an easy-to-hard curriculum learning approach for training diffusion models:
    - Timesteps/noise levels are organized into clusters of descending difficulty 
    - Models are trained sequentially on clusters, progressing from higher to lower timesteps
    - After curriculum training, models learn jointly across all timesteps 
- The curriculum design and pacing strategy aim to leverage benefits of curriculum learning to enhance diffusion training

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis of denoising task difficulties, resolving conflicts in prior works
- Introduction of a curriculum learning strategy tailored for diffusion models that sequences easier-to-harder tasks
- Demonstrated superiority of proposed approach over baseline training without curriculum, in terms of performance, convergence speed, and compatibility with advanced diffusion techniques
- Extensive validation across tasks (unconditional, class-conditional, text-to-image generation), datasets (FFHQ, ImageNet, CIFAR-10, COCO), and models (DiT, EDM)

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions through its in-depth study of diffusion model Attributes and application of insights to develop an effective curriculum methodology that sequentially structures diffusion training in an easy-to-hard manner for performance and convergence improvements.
