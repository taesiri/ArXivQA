# [Stochastic-Constrained Stochastic Optimization with Markovian Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04312)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper studies stochastic-constrained stochastic optimization, where the goal is to minimize an expected loss function subject to an expected constraint being below a threshold. The key challenge is that the functions are sampled from a Markov chain, so data samples have inherent dependence and bias. The paper develops primal-dual stochastic gradient algorithms based on extending the drift-plus-penalty method to the Markovian data setting. Two algorithms are proposed - one for known mixing time that sets parameters based on mixing time, and one adaptive method for unknown mixing time using AdaGrad-style parameter tuning. Both methods provide regret and constraint violation guarantees that reveal the dependence on mixing time. The adaptive method automatically tunes parameters without knowledge of horizon length or mixing time. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods on a classification problem with fairness constraints. Overall, the paper initiates the study of stochastic approximation methods for constrained stochastic optimization that can handle non-i.i.d. Markovian data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes primal-dual stochastic gradient methods using data sampled from a Markov chain for solving stochastic optimization problems with stochastic constraints, generalizing existing methods that assume i.i.d. data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It initiates the study of stochastic approximation algorithms for stochastic-constrained stochastic optimization using non-i.i.d. data samples that follow a Markov chain. 

2) It develops primal-dual stochastic gradient methods using data sampled from a Markov chain, which can be seen as primal-dual variants of Markov chain SGD. Specifically, it extends the drift-plus-penalty algorithm to the Markovian data setting.

3) It proposes two variants of drift-plus-penalty - one for the case when the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain is known, and another for the unknown mixing time case. Both algorithms are adaptive in terms of not needing the time horizon.

4) It provides regret and constraint violation bounds for both algorithms that demonstrate how their performance depends on the mixing time. It also analyzes the optimality gap and feasibility gap for the stochastic optimization problem.

5) For the unknown mixing time case, it develops an AdaGrad-style adaptive drift-plus-penalty algorithm combined with the multi-level Monte Carlo gradient estimation scheme. This is also the first AdaGrad variant of drift-plus-penalty.

6) It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods through numerical experiments on a classification problem with fairness constraints using synthetic Markovian data.

In summary, the main contribution is developing primal-dual stochastic gradient methods for stochastic optimization with constraints using non-i.i.d. Markovian data samples.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Stochastic-constrained stochastic optimization (SCSO): The problem formulation studied in the paper, involving minimizing an expected loss function subject to an expected constraint function.

- Markov chain stochastic gradient descent (SGD): A variant of stochastic gradient methods where data samples follow a Markov process rather than being independent and identically distributed.

- Mixing time: A measure of how fast a Markov chain converges to its stationary distribution. A key parameter quantified in the paper's analyses.  

- Drift-plus-penalty (DPP): A primal-dual stochastic optimization algorithm, originally developed for SCSO with i.i.d. data. The paper proposes extensions of DPP to handle Markovian data.

- Ergodic/Markovian constraints: The constraint functions in the paper's online convex optimization formulation follow a Markov chain, described as ergodic or Markovian constraints.

- Regret bound: A performance measure for online learning algorithms indicating the difference in cumulative loss compared to the best fixed solution. One of the quantities analyzed. 

- Constraint violation: Another performance measure indicating the cumulative violation of constraints over time. Analyzed alongside regret.

- Adaptivity: Algorithm parameters updated based on previous iterations only, without knowledge of time horizon. The DPP variants in the paper are adaptive.

Some other potentially relevant terms are Slater's condition, optimality gap, feasibility gap, obliviousness to mixing time, MLMC (multi-level Monte Carlo) estimation, etc.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the performance of the ergodic drift-plus-penalty algorithm compare to vanilla drift-plus-penalty when the mixing time is known? What are the key differences in the analysis? 

2) What is the intuition behind using time-varying parameters $V_t$ and $\alpha_t$ that depend on the mixing time? How does this help adapt the algorithm to the non-i.i.d. data setting?

3) The regret bound achieved by the ergodic DPP algorithm has an additional $\tmix^{1-\beta}$ factor compared to vanilla DPP. What causes this additional factor and how can it be explained intuitively? 

4) Under what conditions can the tighter $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\tmix T})$ regret and constraint violation bounds be achieved? What is the intuition behind why Slater's condition leads to an improvement?

5) What modifications were made to the drift-plus-penalty algorithm to make it adaptive when the mixing time is unknown? Why is an AdaGrad-style adaptive algorithm suitable here?  

6) How does the multi-level Monte Carlo gradient estimation scheme help provide guarantees when the mixing time is unknown? What are the key properties leveraged in the analysis?

7) The adaptive DPP algorithm can handle adversarial constraints as well. How does the analysis change compared to the stochastic constraints setting? What bounds can be shown?

8) What practical challenges need to be handled when implementing the algorithms, such as controlling the variance of gradient estimates? How can we make the methods more stable?

9) Can the techniques proposed here be extended to handle non-convex objectives and constraints? What new challenges arise in that setting?

10) The experiments are on a simple classification problem. What other complex application domains can these methods be applied to and evaluated on? What metrics would be suitable for evaluation?
