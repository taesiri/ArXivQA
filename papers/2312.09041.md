# [Graph Neural Networks with Diverse Spectral Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09041)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called "diverse spectral filtering" (DSF) to enhance graph neural networks (GNNs) for learning on complex graphs with regional heterogeneity. It argues that most existing spectral GNNs assume homogeneous spectral filtering, using identical filter weights to mine distinct local graph contexts. This fails to capture diverse regional graph patterns. To address this, DSF learns node-specific filter weights to exploit varying local structures properly. In particular, the diverse filter weights have two components - a shared global one and a local one that adapts along network edges to reflect regional differences. This balances global and local information. DSF formulates an optimization problem to assist in learning these diverse filters while avoiding overfitting. It decomposes the weights into global and local components to capture common structure while adapting to regional variations. Experiments on 10 datasets demonstrate DSF consistently improves state-of-the-art spectral GNNs like GPR-GNN, BernNet and JacobiConv for node classification, achieving gains up to 4.92\%. DSF also produces more diverse and interpretable filters that capture both conformal graph structure and regional heterogeneity.
