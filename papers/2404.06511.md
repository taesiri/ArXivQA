# [MoReVQA: Exploring Modular Reasoning Models for Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06511)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Video question answering (videoQA) is an important task for assessing video understanding and reasoning capabilities of AI systems. Prior work has largely relied on end-to-end blackbox models or modular systems with single-stage program generation, both of which have limitations in accuracy, interpretability and compositional generalization. 

- The paper investigates limitations of single-stage modular approaches, finding they can lead to brittle behavior as the entire complex reasoning program must be generated upfront without grounding in the actual video. This is quantified by proposing a simple but strong baseline called JCEF which outperforms single-stage modular methods.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new multi-stage, modular reasoning model called MoReVQA that decomposes the complexity over event parsing, grounding and reasoning stages. 

- Key idea is to ground the language in video content at multiple steps to resolve ambiguities and support more robust reasoning. An external memory manages information flow across stages. All stages use few-shot prompted large models without training.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes and analyzes limitations of single-stage modular videoQA methods using a simple but effective JCEF baseline
- Introduces a new multi-stage framework MoReVQA that modularizes event parsing, grounding and reasoning for videoQA
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple videoQA benchmarks while producing interpretable outputs
- Shows extensions to related video-language tasks like grounded QA and paragraph captioning

In summary, the paper presents a new perspective on effectively combining modularity and multi-stage planning in videoQA systems to advance state-of-the-art while improving interpretability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new multi-stage, modular video question answering framework called MoReVQA that decomposes reasoning into interpretable event parsing, grounding, and reasoning stages and achieves state-of-the-art performance while also outperforming a simple but strong baseline method that uniformly samples frames and captions them for final prediction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a simple but strong baseline called Just Caption Every Frame (JCEF) which outperforms prior visual programming methods for video question answering. This highlights limitations in single-stage planning approaches which can lead to brittle behavior.

2) It introduces a new multi-stage, modular reasoning model called MoReVQA that decomposes the reasoning process into distinct stages - event parsing, grounding, and reasoning. This alleviates issues with single-stage approaches by effectively decomposing the underlying task complexity. 

3) The proposed MoReVQA model achieves state-of-the-art results on four standard videoQA benchmarks, outperforming both training-free baselines as well as some prior fully-finetuned methods. It also shows strong performance on extensions to related tasks like grounded videoQA and paragraph captioning.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) a simple yet strong baseline highlighting limitations of prior work (2) a new interpretable, modular multi-stage reasoning model for videoQA that advances the state-of-the-art (3) demonstration of the approach across diverse videoQA tasks and extensions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Video question answering (videoQA) - The main task that is addressed, which involves answering natural language questions about the content of videos.

- Modularity - Using individual modules focused on specific sub-tasks rather than a single monolithic model. A key design principle explored.

- Multi-stage reasoning - Breaking down the reasoning process into multiple stages, such as event parsing, grounding, and final reasoning/prediction. 

- Interpretability - A goal of the method is to provide more interpretable outputs at each stage compared to end-to-end black-box models.

- Just Caption Every Frame (JCEF) - A simple but strong baseline proposed that uniformly samples frames from a video, captions each using a VLM module, and feeds the captions to an LLM module to produce an answer.

- MoReVQA - The full proposed model name, which stands for Modular Reasoning for Video Question Answering. Incorporates modularity, multi-stage reasoning, grounding, and an external memory.

- Event parsing - The first stage of MoReVQA that analyzes the question to extract key events, temporal relations, etc.

- Grounding - The second stage that identifies relevant regions of the video for the question, resolving ambiguities.

- Reasoning - The final prediction stage that reasons about specific events and their relationships before outputting an answer.

In summary, the key themes are around multi-stage modular architectures for videoQA, balancing accuracy and interpretability.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new multi-stage, modular reasoning framework called MoReVQA. Can you explain in detail the motivation behind moving from a single-stage to a multi-stage approach? What were some of the limitations identified with prior single-stage models?

2. The paper introduces a simple but strong baseline called JCEF. Can you walk through how JCEF works and why it is able to outperform more complex single-stage models? What does this tell us about the brittleness of single-stage planning?

3. MoReVQA consists of three key stages - event parsing, grounding, and reasoning. For each stage, can you explain what specific sub-tasks it focuses on and how it fits into the overall pipeline? Why is the grounding stage in particular important?

4. External memory plays an important role in MoReVQA by maintaining state across stages. Can you discuss some of the key pieces of information stored in memory and how subsequent stages leverage this? How does this differ from end-to-end models?

5. The paper evaluates MoReVQA on multiple videoQA datasets spanning different domains and video lengths. Can you summarize the key results and how MoReVQA compares to single-stage baselines and prior state-of-the-art methods? Where does it achieve the biggest gaps?

6. Can you walk through Figure 5 step-by-step and analyze the qualitative outputs of MoReVQA compared to JCEF and ViperGPT+? How do the intermediate outputs provide more transparency into the reasoning process?

7. An ablation study in Table 2 analyzes the impact of different stages of MoReVQA. What can we conclude about the importance of each stage and their complementary nature? How much does performance degrade without certain stages?

8. The authors showcase extensions of MoReVQA to grounded QA and paragraph captioning. Can you summarize these results and discuss how the modular design allows flexibility to other domains? What changes were needed to support these tasks?

9. What do you see as the main limitations of MoReVQA and this style of modular approach? Where is there still room for improvement in video understanding tasks compared to end-to-end models?

10. If you had access to MoReVQA, what kinds of additional analysis would you perform to further understand the capabilities and failure modes of the model? What other video domains or tasks would you be interested in evaluating?
