# [Enhancing Efficiency in Sparse Models with Sparser Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18926)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models are effective for scaling up models without increasing computational costs. However, they suffer from computational inefficiency as many parameter values are multiplied by zeros or low activation values. 

- Larger expert size exacerbates this issue. Selecting one expert per token already leads to significant waste. More fine-grained, adaptive selection is needed.

Method: 
- Proposes XMoE, a novel MoE design to enhance efficacy and efficiency. Key ideas:
  - Use smaller experts to enable more precise selection of useful parameters.
  - Adaptive, threshold-based router allows tokens to determine required number of experts based on complexity.

- Router initially sends tokens to many experts to ensure effectiveness. But over time, training leads to sparser expert selection to improve efficiency.

- Can also apply XMoE to dense models by dividing feedforward layers into smaller experts. Enables sparse computation at inference time.

Contributions:
- Identifies and addresses computational inefficiency issue in sparse MoE models.

- XMoE outperforms existing MoE methods in language modeling and machine translation with same computational budget.

- Achieves over 50% reduction in FLOPs with minimal impact on performance. 

- Shows potential of sparse models over dense counterparts with sparse inference.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel MoE design called XMoE that uses smaller experts and an adaptive router to improve efficiency of sparse models without compromising effectiveness. Both quantitative experiments and analyses demonstrate the advantages over existing methods.
