# [Learning A Sparse Transformer Network for Effective Image Deraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11950)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to design an effective image deraining model based on sparse Transformers. The key hypotheses are:

1) Using sparse attention instead of standard dense self-attention in Transformers can help the model focus on more useful features and avoid noisy interactions for image deraining. 

2) Introducing a top-k selection operator to adaptively retain only the most important attention scores can lead to better sparse attention.

3) Adding a mixed-scale feedforward network can help the model better leverage multi-scale features important for image deraining.

4) Using a mixture of experts module to provide complementary refinement can further boost deraining performance.

The overall goal is to develop a sparse Transformer architecture that can outperform existing methods for single image deraining by effectively modeling both local and global dependencies in a selective way. The core ideas are sparsifying attention to avoid irrelevant features and strengthening multi-scale processing.
