# [A Memetic Algorithm To Find a Hamiltonian Cycle in a Hamiltonian Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07886)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the NP-complete Hamiltonian Cycle (HC) problem, which involves finding a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once in a given graph. This is an important problem with applications in areas like DNA sequencing, vehicle routing, etc. However, finding Hamiltonian cycles, especially in large graphs, is computationally challenging. The paper particularly focuses on solving instances from the Flinders University Hamiltonian Cycle Problem Challenge Set, which contains 1001 structurally complex Hamiltonian graph instances that are difficult for standard HC algorithms.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a memetic algorithm that combines a population-based search with specialized local search methods. Key aspects of the approach include:

- Use of a tree-structured population of agents, each maintaining a current and best solution. This balances exploration of the search space and exploitation of good solutions.

- Introduction of a graph sparsification technique that heuristically removes potential "surplus" edges, aiming to reduce the graph's treewidth and make the search easier.  

- Augmentation approach that dynamically adds more useful edges back to the sparse graph during the search if a solution is not found.

- Use of Recursive Arc Insertion (RAI) and Lin-Kernighan heuristic (LKH) as local searches to optimize solutions.

- Incorporation of a polynomial-time "Naive algorithm" that tries to quickly construct a solution using dynamic programming on the graph structure.

- Application of transitive closure reduction to transform the problem into a Traveling Salesman Problem instance, creating a more correlated search landscape.

Contributions:

- The memetic algorithm solves 655 of the 1001 challenge instances, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches designed for bounded-treewidth graphs. This demonstrates the generalizability of the method.

- It shows significantly better computational runtime than other methods for most problem instances, especially larger graphs.

- The algorithm is able to solve structurally complex graphs with high treewidths that other methods fail on.

- The paper provides an extensive experimental analysis and comparison with multiple competitive baseline techniques.

In summary, the paper presents a novel memetic algorithm using sparsification, augmentation and specialized local search that pushes state-of-the-art in finding Hamiltonian cycles for structurally diverse and challenging graphs. The proposed technique generalizes well and shows superior performance over existing methods.
