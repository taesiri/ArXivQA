# [Cosmological Distance Measurement of 12 Nearby Supernovae IIP with   ROTSE-IIIB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0916)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can unfiltered CCD photometry from ROTSE-III telescopes, combined with minimal color data and spectroscopy, be used to measure cosmological distances and probe cosmic expansion using Type IIP supernovae?The key points are:- The authors develop a new image differencing technique called ImageDiff to obtain precise photometry from the ROTSE-III telescopes, even for supernovae close to the cores of their host galaxies. - They establish empirical models for the time evolution of temperature and photospheric velocity for SNe IIP using data from well-studied events. These models allow interpolation/extrapolation of the temperature and velocity using limited photometric and spectroscopic measurements.- They apply the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) using the ROTSE photometry and models to estimate distances to 12 SNe IIP at z<0.06.- They perform cosmological analysis on these distance measurements to extract the Hubble constant, finding a value of 72.9 ± 5.7 km/s/Mpc that is consistent with ΛCDM model values from other probes.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the unfiltered ROTSE photometry combined with minimal additional data can successfully measure SNe IIP distances for cosmology, which the authors demonstrate using their new photometry pipeline, evolution models, EPM measurements and cosmological fits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Development of a new image differencing technique for ROTSE supernova photometry. The new method provides more accurate and efficient photometry, especially for supernovae located close to the core of their host galaxy. 2. Establishing empirical models for the time evolution of key supernova properties (photospheric velocity and temperature) using a small sample of well-observed SNe IIP. These models allow the properties to be estimated from limited data.3. Applying the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) to a sample of 12 nearby SNe IIP using ROTSE photometry and optical spectroscopy. Distances are measured for each supernova.4. Performing a cosmological analysis using the EPM distances to measure the Hubble constant. The value obtained, H0 = 72.9 +/- 5.7 km/s/Mpc, is consistent with other probes.5. Demonstrating the potential of SNe IIP as cosmological distance indicators that can provide an independent probe of cosmic expansion. The distance precision achieved is competitive despite the limited photometric and spectroscopic data.In summary, the paper shows how an unfiltered, photometric survey like ROTSE can be used effectively for supernova studies and cosmology. The new image differencing and empirical models allow accurate distances to be determined from the sparse ROTSE data. This provides a path for using SNe IIP for precision cosmology in the future with larger samples.
