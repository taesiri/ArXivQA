# [Cosmological Distance Measurement of 12 Nearby Supernovae IIP with   ROTSE-IIIB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0916)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can unfiltered CCD photometry from ROTSE-III telescopes, combined with minimal color data and spectroscopy, be used to measure cosmological distances and probe cosmic expansion using Type IIP supernovae?The key points are:- The authors develop a new image differencing technique called ImageDiff to obtain precise photometry from the ROTSE-III telescopes, even for supernovae close to the cores of their host galaxies. - They establish empirical models for the time evolution of temperature and photospheric velocity for SNe IIP using data from well-studied events. These models allow interpolation/extrapolation of the temperature and velocity using limited photometric and spectroscopic measurements.- They apply the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) using the ROTSE photometry and models to estimate distances to 12 SNe IIP at z<0.06.- They perform cosmological analysis on these distance measurements to extract the Hubble constant, finding a value of 72.9 ± 5.7 km/s/Mpc that is consistent with ΛCDM model values from other probes.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the unfiltered ROTSE photometry combined with minimal additional data can successfully measure SNe IIP distances for cosmology, which the authors demonstrate using their new photometry pipeline, evolution models, EPM measurements and cosmological fits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:1. Development of a new image differencing technique for ROTSE supernova photometry. The new method provides more accurate and efficient photometry, especially for supernovae located close to the core of their host galaxy. 2. Establishing empirical models for the time evolution of key supernova properties (photospheric velocity and temperature) using a small sample of well-observed SNe IIP. These models allow the properties to be estimated from limited data.3. Applying the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) to a sample of 12 nearby SNe IIP using ROTSE photometry and optical spectroscopy. Distances are measured for each supernova.4. Performing a cosmological analysis using the EPM distances to measure the Hubble constant. The value obtained, H0 = 72.9 +/- 5.7 km/s/Mpc, is consistent with other probes.5. Demonstrating the potential of SNe IIP as cosmological distance indicators that can provide an independent probe of cosmic expansion. The distance precision achieved is competitive despite the limited photometric and spectroscopic data.In summary, the paper shows how an unfiltered, photometric survey like ROTSE can be used effectively for supernova studies and cosmology. The new image differencing and empirical models allow accurate distances to be determined from the sparse ROTSE data. This provides a path for using SNe IIP for precision cosmology in the future with larger samples.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents an analysis of 12 nearby Type IIP supernovae using photometry from the ROTSE-IIIb telescope and spectroscopy to measure distances with the Expanding Photosphere Method, from which they determine a Hubble constant of 72.9 km/s/Mpc consistent with other measurements.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on using Type IIP supernovae for cosmology:- This paper utilizes unfiltered ROTSE photometry along with some spectroscopy to measure distances to 12 low-redshift SNe IIP using the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM). Other recent EPM studies have tended to rely on more extensive filtered photometry and spectroscopy (e.g. Gall et al. 2016, 2018). Using the unfiltered data is a novel approach that required developing corrections to estimate the V-band flux.- The paper establishes empirical models for the time evolution of ejecta velocity and temperature based on measurements for well-observed SNe IIP. This allows distances to be estimated from limited epochs of data by extrapolating the models. Other studies have also developed parameterized models to standardize SNe IIP, such as the Standardized Candle Method (SCM) based on velocities (e.g. de Jaeger et al. 2017).- From the distance measurements, the paper estimates the Hubble constant as H0 = 72.9 +5.7/-4.3 km/s/Mpc, consistent with Planck CMB and other results. This demonstrates the potential of SNe IIP for measuring cosmic expansion. However, the sample is still small compared to cosmological analyses using hundreds of SNe Ia (e.g. DES, Abbott et al. 2019).- The analysis accounts for peculiar velocities, which can be significant for nearby SNe. Other cosmology studies have often imposed redshift cuts to minimize this effect (e.g. z > 0.01), but this paper models peculiar velocities directly.- Overall, this paper makes progress in developing SNe IIP as cosmological distance indicators using limited data, but larger samples will be needed to make them competitive with established methods like SNe Ia in constraining cosmological parameters. The empirical standardization approach shows promise for expanding studies to higher redshifts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Obtaining a larger sample of SNe IIP at higher redshifts to improve the cosmology constraints. The current sample of 12 SNe IIP at low redshift is just reaching the point of being systematics-dominated, so a larger sample is needed.- More careful consideration of the underlying time evolution models for velocity and temperature. The empirical models used here captured the behavior reasonably well, but more physics-based models could help reduce systematics.- Better constraining the shock breakout times for SNe IIP, as that can significantly reduce the distance uncertainties in the EPM method. - Further testing the EPM method on stripped-envelope supernovae like SNe Ib/Ic over shorter time baselines during their light curve rise. Preliminary results on SN 2007gr suggest this could work.- Reducing the overall uncertainties, both statistical and systematic. This will require larger samples, improved evolution models, and tighter control of sources of error.- More careful handling of the effects of the dilution factor in transforming observed fluxes to physical radii and temperatures. This will be important as overall uncertainties decrease.- Testing potential generalizations of the EPM method to even higher redshifts by exploiting the demonstrated consistency of SNe IIP over the plateau phase.In summary, the key future directions revolve around accumulating larger samples, improving the modeling, reducing uncertainties, and extending this technique to greater distances to improve cosmological constraints. The results so far suggest SNe IIP have strong potential as competitive distance indicators using the EPM method.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents an analysis of 12 nearby Type IIP supernovae observed with the ROTSE-IIIb telescope. The authors develop a new image differencing technique to achieve precise photometry of the supernovae, even when close to the core of the host galaxy. Optical spectra and broadband photometry of well-studied supernovae are used to establish temporal models for the evolution of ejecta velocity and photospheric temperature. These models are applied to the ROTSE sample to facilitate distance measurements via the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM). Distances ranging from 10-212 Mpc are measured. The Hubble constant is estimated to be $72.9^{+5.7}_{-4.3} {\rm~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ based on these distance measurements, consistent with $\Lambda$CDM model values. Overall, the EPM technique shows promise for precision cosmology using SNe IIP.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper presents a cosmological analysis using distances measured for 12 Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) observed with the ROTSE-IIIb telescope over 2004-2013. The authors introduce a new image differencing technique to obtain improved photometry from the ROTSE images. They establish models for the time evolution of ejecta velocity and photospheric temperature of SNe IIP using a sample of well-observed events. These models allow them to extrapolate velocity and temperature to the epochs of the ROTSE SNe sample using as little as a single spectroscopic observation. Distances are then calculated with the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) using the ROTSE photometry along with velocity and temperature estimated from the models. Systematic uncertainties are propagated, including the impact of peculiar velocities which are modeled via simulation. Finally, the authors derive a measurement of the Hubble constant from their SNe IIP sample, finding H0 = 72.9^{+5.7}_{-4.3} km/s/Mpc, consistent with other probes. The EPM technique shows promise for measuring cosmological parameters with SNe IIP given improvements to the sample size and handling of systematics.In summary, the key aspects are: 1) New image differencing software to enable improved photometry from ROTSE images of SNe IIP. 2) Modeling the time evolution of velocity and temperature of SNe IIP using well-observed events. 3) Applying models to ROTSE sample to estimate velocity and temperature from limited data. 4) Measuring distances with EPM using ROTSE photometry and modeled velocity/temperature. 5) Cosmological analysis of SNe IIP sample to constrain Hubble constant. 6) Demonstrating potential of EPM technique for cosmology given larger samples and control of systematics.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:This paper utilizes the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) to estimate distances to 12 Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) discovered by the ROTSE telescope survey. The EPM relates the angular size of the expanding photosphere to its linear size based on the measured velocity. It requires estimating the photospheric velocity and effective temperature at epochs during the plateau phase of SNe IIP. The authors establish empirical models for the evolution of these parameters anchored to spectroscopic measurements at a single epoch. They obtain distances by fitting this model to ROTSE unfiltered photometry calibrated to the V band, with minimal additional photometry. Peculiar velocity uncertainties are addressed via simulation. Using these distance measurements, the value of the Hubble constant is estimated.

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the following key questions and problems:1. How to improve the precision of distance measurements for Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) using the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM)? 2. How to extract Hubble constant H0 in the nearby universe using distance measurements for SNe IIP?3. How to obtain accurate photometry, especially for ROTSE images where the supernova may lie close to the host galaxy nucleus? They develop a new image differencing technique to address this.4. How to establish models for the time evolution of key supernova properties like photospheric velocity and temperature, which are needed as inputs for EPM distance measurements? They develop empirical models based on observations of well-studied SNe IIP.5. Testing if SNe IIP can provide competitive measurements of cosmological parameters like H0 compared to other methods like SNe Ia.In summary, the key focus is improving distance measurements and cosmology using SNe IIP, by addressing issues like photometry, modeling time evolution of supernova properties, and applying the EPM technique to a sample of 12 low-redshift SNe IIP observed by the ROTSE telescope. The new image differencing technique, empirical models for supernova property evolution, and EPM distance estimates are the core contributions.
