# [InfuserKI: Enhancing Large Language Models with Knowledge Graphs via   Infuser-Guided Knowledge Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11441)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to lack of domain knowledge. Although methods exist to enhance LLMs with knowledge graphs, they require fine-tuning the model on both known and unknown knowledge, leading to data inefficiency.

- There is a need for efficiently integrating unknown knowledge from domain knowledge graphs into LLMs without unnecessarily overlapping with knowledge the model already knows. However, injecting entirely new knowledge risks catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose InfuserKI, an Infuser-Guided Knowledge Integration framework to selectively integrate unknown knowledge from knowledge graphs into LLMs while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. 

- It features a knowledge detection module to identify unknown knowledge triplets and convert them to multiple choice questions to evaluate the LLM's knowledge. 

- For knowledge integration, InfuserKI utilizes knowledge adapters trained on the unknown triplets to encode the new knowledge separate from the base LLM parameters. 

- Crucially, it introduces a knowledge Infuser module that examines the LLM's internal states to determine whether to engage the knowledge adapter to enhance the output, blocking unnecessary information about known knowledge.

- A relation classification task further enhances the generalization of integrated knowledge.

Main Contributions:

- InfuserKI enables efficiently integrating purely unknown knowledge from knowledge graphs into LLMs without needing to retrain on known knowledge, preventing unnecessary overlaps.

- The Infuser's selective fusion of knowledge adapter outputs mitigates catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge.

- Experiments on UMLS and MetaQA graphs demonstrate InfuserKI's effectiveness in knowledge integration, maintaining performance at larger scales, and exhibiting strong generality.

In summary, InfuserKI provides an efficient and adaptive approach to inject new factual knowledge into LLMs while preserving previously learned information, helping enhance performance on knowledge-intensive downstream tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an Infuser-guided Knowledge Integration framework to integrate unknown knowledge from knowledge graphs into large language models while adaptively determining whether to enhance the original model output to mitigate catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The paper studies a novel problem of effectively integrating unknown knowledge from knowledge graphs into large language models without affecting known knowledge. 

2. The paper proposes a new knowledge integration framework called Infuser-Guided Knowledge Integration (InfuserKI). This framework features an infusing mechanism to selectively add new information to language models while minimizing impact on prior knowledge, helping prevent catastrophic forgetting.

3. The paper introduces a relation classification task in InfuserKI aimed at improving linguistic representations learned by the adapters and enhancing model generality. 

4. Evaluations on UMLS and MetaQA datasets demonstrate InfuserKI's effectiveness in knowledge integration with less forgetting, sustained performance with large-scale data, and superior generality on unseen templates and downstream tasks compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the InfuserKI framework for efficiently integrating unknown knowledge from knowledge graphs into language models while preventing catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. The key innovation is the infusing mechanism for adaptive selection between supplementary information and original language model outputs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an "Infuser-Guided Knowledge Integration" framework. What is the key intuition behind using an infuser module to guide knowledge integration? How does it help mitigate catastrophic forgetting?

2. The knowledge adapters used in this framework are positioned in the feedforward network (FFN) layers instead of the attention layers. What is the rationale behind this design choice? How do FFN layers facilitate effective knowledge storage and integration?  

3. The paper introduces a relation classification task on top of the question answering objective. What purpose does this auxiliary task serve? How does it enhance the generality of integrated knowledge to unseen situations?

4. When integrating knowledge graphs into language models, what are some key challenges that need to be addressed? How does InfuserKI tackle issues like efficiency, precision, and catastrophic forgetting?  

5. The framework detects unknown knowledge via multiple choice questions derived from knowledge triplets. What are the benefits of using a multiple choice format here? How does it enable precise knowledge evaluation?

6. Explain the working and training process of the knowledge Infuser module. What type of information does it derive from the LLM's internal states? How does that guide adaptive knowledge selection?  

7. How does InfuserKI balance integrating new knowledge while also retaining previously acquired knowledge? What is the role of known samples during Infuser pre-training?

8. What architectural modifications does InfuserKI make to the base LLM? Where does it add extra components and why? How parameter-efficient is this approach?

9. The results show that bottom layers are more effective for knowledge injection while top layers suit correction. Explain why this difference exists. What do the transformer layer roles reveal?

10. What scope limitations exist in applying the InfuserKI framework? When might the approach underperform if base LLM capabilities are insufficient? What are interesting future work directions?
