# [InfuserKI: Enhancing Large Language Models with Knowledge Graphs via   Infuser-Guided Knowledge Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11441)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to lack of domain knowledge. Although methods exist to enhance LLMs with knowledge graphs, they require fine-tuning the model on both known and unknown knowledge, leading to data inefficiency.

- There is a need for efficiently integrating unknown knowledge from domain knowledge graphs into LLMs without unnecessarily overlapping with knowledge the model already knows. However, injecting entirely new knowledge risks catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose InfuserKI, an Infuser-Guided Knowledge Integration framework to selectively integrate unknown knowledge from knowledge graphs into LLMs while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. 

- It features a knowledge detection module to identify unknown knowledge triplets and convert them to multiple choice questions to evaluate the LLM's knowledge. 

- For knowledge integration, InfuserKI utilizes knowledge adapters trained on the unknown triplets to encode the new knowledge separate from the base LLM parameters. 

- Crucially, it introduces a knowledge Infuser module that examines the LLM's internal states to determine whether to engage the knowledge adapter to enhance the output, blocking unnecessary information about known knowledge.

- A relation classification task further enhances the generalization of integrated knowledge.

Main Contributions:

- InfuserKI enables efficiently integrating purely unknown knowledge from knowledge graphs into LLMs without needing to retrain on known knowledge, preventing unnecessary overlaps.

- The Infuser's selective fusion of knowledge adapter outputs mitigates catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge.

- Experiments on UMLS and MetaQA graphs demonstrate InfuserKI's effectiveness in knowledge integration, maintaining performance at larger scales, and exhibiting strong generality.

In summary, InfuserKI provides an efficient and adaptive approach to inject new factual knowledge into LLMs while preserving previously learned information, helping enhance performance on knowledge-intensive downstream tasks.
