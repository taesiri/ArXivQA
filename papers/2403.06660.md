# [FashionReGen: LLM-Empowered Fashion Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06660)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "FashionReGen: LLM-Empowered Fashion Report Generation":

Problem: 
The paper addresses the task of automatic fashion report generation (termed FashionReGen), which involves comprehending fashion content, analyzing trends, and generating insightful reports. This is traditionally done manually by fashion experts, requiring high labor cost and prone to bias. Developing an automated solution for fashion report generation is valuable but challenging due to the need for: 1) fine-grained recognition of fashion details, 2) domain knowledge for analysis, and 3) proper integration of multimedia information.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an intelligent Fashion Analyzing and Reporting (FAR) system empowered by GPT models (GPT-FAR) for automatic end-to-end fashion report generation based on catwalk analysis. GPT-FAR consists of:
1) Catwalk Understanding: A GPT-4V based tagger is used to interpret garments in catwalk images by classifying category and tagging attributes. A two-stage cleaning process is applied to refine tags. 
2) Collective Analysis: Metrics like mix and YoY index are computed at category and attribute-level to analyze trends collectively. Charts are plotted.
3) Report Generation: GPT-4V generates overall textual analysis conditioned on charts. Focused analysis is provided for categories. Charts, images and text are integrated into a hybrid, multi-page report.

Main Contributions:
1) Presents FashionReGen, a novel, domain-specific, and valuable but complex task for testing LLMs' capability.
2) Proposes GPT-FAR, an end-to-end pipeline enabling automatic fashion analysis and report generation based on catwalk data.
3) Develops a system for users to generate their own fashion reports on selected collections.

The paper demonstrates automated fashion report generation empowered by LLMs for an underexplored domain-specific task, with both research and practical significance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes GPT-FAR, an intelligent fashion analyzing and reporting system empowered by large language models to enable automatic generation of fashion reports based on catwalk analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Presenting FashionReGen, a high-level domain-specific task with significant research and application value. 

2) Proposing GPT-FAR, a system for automatic fashion report generation based on effective catwalk observation and analysis.

3) Developing a complete platform to enable users to generate their own fashion reports on specific collections.

So in summary, the paper introduces the novel and valuable task of automated fashion report generation, proposes a system (GPT-FAR) to address this task using large language models, and implements this as a platform for generating custom fashion reports. The core contribution is presenting this new task and an end-to-end system for tackling it.
