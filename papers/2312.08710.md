# [Gradient Informed Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08710)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning method called Gradient Informed Proximal Policy Optimization (GI-PPO) that integrates analytical gradients from differentiable environments into the PPO algorithm. The key idea is to define an "alpha-policy" that incorporates the analytical policy gradients and serves as a locally superior policy target. By adjusting the alpha value, the method can manage the influence of the analytical gradients based on estimates of their variance and bias. Specifically, the alpha value is reduced when high variance or bias is detected in the gradients, making the method less dependent on the gradients in those cases. To incorporate the alpha-policy into PPO, the method uses a surrogate loss function that restricts PPO updates to be done in the vicinity of both the original policy and the alpha-policy. Experiments across optimization problems, physics simulations, and traffic control environments demonstrate that GI-PPO outperforms baseline PPO as well as other methods that use analytical gradients. A key advantage is that GI-PPO can effectively leverage these gradients even when they are biased, as in the traffic environments. Overall, the method strikes an effective balance between gradient-based and PPO-based policy updates.
