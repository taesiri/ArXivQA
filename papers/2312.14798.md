# [Semantic Parsing for Complex Data Retrieval: Targeting Query Plans vs.   SQL for No-Code Access to Relational Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14798)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-SQL systems map natural language questions into SQL queries to retrieve information from databases. However, SQL is complex even for programmers and accuracy drops sharply for complex SQL queries. This is an issue for using text-to-SQL to provide no-code data access.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce an intermediary query language called Query Plan Language (QPL) that is executable, less complex than SQL, and modularly compositional.
- Decompose complex natural language questions into simpler sub-questions that can map more accurately to modular QPL query components. 
- Use neural language models to map decomposed questions to QPL plans.
- Convert QPL plans to equivalent modular SQL queries.

Key Contributions:
- Design of the Query Plan Language (QPL) as an intermediary representation between natural language and SQL. QPL is executable, simple, compositional.
- Automatic conversion of the Spider text-to-SQL dataset into QPL representation.
- Analysis showing QPL prediction achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on complex SQL queries. 
- Proposal of question decomposition strategies to improve compositional mapping of complex questions to QPL queries.
- Demonstration that modular QPL plans translated to SQL achieve better accuracy on complex queries compared to direct SQL prediction.

In summary, the paper introduces QPL to simplify the target representation for text-to-SQL systems. By decomposing questions and generating modular QPL, the approach aims to improve complex query handling to provide accurate no-code access to relational data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a modular query plan language called QPL designed to improve the accuracy of complex semantic parsing for querying databases by decomposing questions into simpler sub-questions that can be more easily mapped to executable query components.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The design of Query Plan Language (QPL), which is a modular dataflow language that encodes the semantics of SQL queries. QPL is designed to be more learnable by modern neural semantic parsing architectures while also being easier for non-programmers to verify the validity of query plans. The paper demonstrates how neural large language models can benefit from QPL's modularity to generate complex query plans in a compositional manner using question decomposition strategies and planning.

Key aspects of the contribution include:

- The automatic conversion of the Spider text-to-SQL dataset into a version with equivalent QPL expressions 

- Analysis of the QPL data to determine the lower accuracy of existing text-to-SQL systems on complex compositional queries

- Presentation of ways to address the challenge of complex queries in an iterative, user-controlled manner using fine-tuned LLMs and prompting strategies to predict QPL query plans from natural language in a compositional manner

In summary, the main contribution is using the modular and interpretable QPL language to improve text-to-SQL for complex queries.

The paper introduces a Query Plan Language (QPL) as an intermediary compositional query language between natural language questions and SQL code. It investigates question decomposition strategies and using LLMs to map decomposed questions to modular QPL plans. The goal is to make complex data retrieval more accessible to non-programmers. Experiments are conducted on a version of the Spider text-to-SQL dataset converted to QPL, evaluating different methods for generating QPL plans.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the Query Plan Language (QPL) represent the semantics of complex SQL queries in a more modular and interpretable way compared to raw SQL? What are the key advantages of using QPL over SQL for non-technical users?

2. The paper mentions using a question decomposition strategy to break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions. How is this implemented? What models or techniques are used to perform the question decomposition? 

3. The paper talks about a planning stage after question decomposition to generate the full QPL plans. How does this planning work? Does it involve sequencing the simpler sub-plans? What constraints need to be satisfied?

4. What is the conversion process to go from QPL expressions to executable SQL code using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)? How deterministic and lossless is this conversion?

5. How was the Spider dataset converted to include QPL expressions? Was this an automatic process? What percentage of the original SQL queries could be converted to semantically equivalent QPL?

6. For the direct QPL prediction experiments, why does constraining the beam search during inference lead to better performance? How do the results compare to state-of-the-art text-to-SQL models?

7. The results show better performance on complex QPL plans compared to SQL queries. Why does the modular structure of QPL make complex queries easier for the models to learn and generate accurately?

8. What approaches were attempted for learning the question decomposition in a weakly supervised manner? How effective were those approaches compared to having full supervision with ground truth decomposed questions?

9. The paper mentions issues in converting some valid QPL plans into executable CTE SQL. What are the main causes of the conversion failures? How can the conversion process be made more robust?

10. How can the overall approach proposed in the paper be adapted to work in an interactive setting? What additional components would be needed to enable back-and-forth clarification with non-technical users?
