# [Semantic Parsing for Complex Data Retrieval: Targeting Query Plans vs.   SQL for No-Code Access to Relational Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14798)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-SQL systems map natural language questions into SQL queries to retrieve information from databases. However, SQL is complex even for programmers and accuracy drops sharply for complex SQL queries. This is an issue for using text-to-SQL to provide no-code data access.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce an intermediary query language called Query Plan Language (QPL) that is executable, less complex than SQL, and modularly compositional.
- Decompose complex natural language questions into simpler sub-questions that can map more accurately to modular QPL query components. 
- Use neural language models to map decomposed questions to QPL plans.
- Convert QPL plans to equivalent modular SQL queries.

Key Contributions:
- Design of the Query Plan Language (QPL) as an intermediary representation between natural language and SQL. QPL is executable, simple, compositional.
- Automatic conversion of the Spider text-to-SQL dataset into QPL representation.
- Analysis showing QPL prediction achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on complex SQL queries. 
- Proposal of question decomposition strategies to improve compositional mapping of complex questions to QPL queries.
- Demonstration that modular QPL plans translated to SQL achieve better accuracy on complex queries compared to direct SQL prediction.

In summary, the paper introduces QPL to simplify the target representation for text-to-SQL systems. By decomposing questions and generating modular QPL, the approach aims to improve complex query handling to provide accurate no-code access to relational data.
