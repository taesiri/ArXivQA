## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding road structures is critical for autonomous driving. Road structures are often represented as lane graphs (directed acyclic graphs) comprising centerline curves (vertices) and their connectivity relationships (edges). 
- Accurately extracting lane graphs from onboard sensors is challenging due to the complexity of road topologies.
- Existing methods have limitations in modeling both vertices and edges of lane graphs. They focus mainly on vertices, while simply embedding edge information in the network.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes LaneGraph2Seq, a novel framework that utilizes a language model with vertex-edge encoding and connectivity enhancement to extract lane graphs.

- It represents the lane graph's vertices and edges as sequences of tokens, transforming graph prediction into a sequence prediction problem.

- A bird's-eye-view encoder and Transformer decoder acquire graph features and predict graph sequences respectively. 

- Classifier-free guidance and nucleus sampling are used during inference to improve connectivity and sampling diversity.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces an innovative vertex-edge encoding approach to serialize lane graphs into sequences and enable simultaneous analysis of visual features and graph attributes using a language model.

- Employs classifier-free guidance and nucleus sampling during inference to enhance connectivity conditions and edge prediction accuracy.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating superior lane graph extraction capabilities.

- Provides qualitative results showcasing highly accurate predictions of overall road layouts and continuity of junction points.

In summary, LaneGraph2Seq is a novel framework that successfully tackles the problem of complex lane graph extraction from onboard sensors by representing the graph as sequences and leveraging language modeling. The vertex-edge encoding and connectivity enhancement techniques are key innovations that set it apart from prior arts.
