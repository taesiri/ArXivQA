# [Efficacy of Utilizing Large Language Models to Detect Public Threat   Posted Online](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02974)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Online communities enable unchecked propagation of harmful content. Recent incidents like the Sillim subway tragedy demonstrated this risk as threats spread rapidly online.  
- Relying solely on human content moderators has limitations in efficiency, cost, and accuracy at massive scales. This strains existing governance models.

Solution Proposed:
- Explore using large language models (LLMs) like GPT and PaLM to automatically detect public threats in online posts. 
- Custom data collection tools gathered Korean post titles from an online community, with 500 non-threat and 20 threat examples.
- Tested if GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and PaLM can accurately classify posts as "threat" or "safe" when prompted.

Key Findings:
- All LLMs showed strong accuracy in detecting threats and non-threats, passing goodness of fit statistical tests.
- GPT-4 performed best overall with 97.9% non-threat and 100% threat accuracy.
- Affordability analysis found PaLM API pricing highly cost-efficient.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrated LLMs can effectively augment human moderation to help mitigate emerging online risks.
- Provided framework for evaluating LLMs on ability to identify threats in diverse linguistic contexts. 
- Showed strengths/limitations of different LLMs for content moderation.
- Highlighted need for unbiased models and ethical oversight before implementation.

In summary, the paper makes a robust case for utilizing LLMs to supplement human content analysis but underscores considerations around transparency, bias, and governance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper examines the efficacy of using large language models to detect public threats in online posts, finding GPT variants and PaLM demonstrate strong accuracy in classifying threatening vs non-threatening content.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contribution of this paper is:

Evaluating the efficacy of using large language models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and PaLM, to detect public threats posted in online communities. The paper details an experimental methodology involving collecting threat and non-threat post titles from a Korean online community, prompting the LLMs to classify each post, and statistically analyzing the accuracy of the models using chi-square tests. The key findings are that all tested LLMs demonstrate strong accuracy in identifying threats, with GPT-4 performing the best overall. The paper concludes that LLMs show promise to effectively augment human content moderation and help mitigate emerging online risks like threatening posts. However, considerations around potential biases and ethical implications are highlighted before real-world implementation.

In summary, the core contribution is an experimental evaluation quantitatively demonstrating the potential of LLMs to accurately detect public threats posted online to assist with content moderation at scale.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the main keywords or key terms associated with it appear to be:

- Large Language Model(s) (LLM)
- Content Moderation 
- Public Threat
- Online Community
- Threat Detection
- GPT-3.5
- GPT-4
- PaLM
- Chat-Bison
- Accuracy
- Affordability
- Ethics

The paper examines using large language models for content moderation and public threat detection in online communities. It tests models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and PaLM's Chat-Bison on a dataset of Korean forum post titles labeled as threats or non-threats. The analysis focuses on accuracy, affordability, and ethical considerations when applying these AI systems for automated moderation. So the key terms reflect this focus and the models evaluated in the study.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a custom HTTP tool to collect data from DC Inside while adhering to ethical guidelines. Can you expand more on how this tool was designed and what specific measures were taken to ensure ethical data collection? 

2. In curating the dataset, the paper states that strict adherence to the community's scraping policies per robots.txt was prioritized. What were some key scraping guidelines outlined there and how exactly did you ensure compliance with terms of service during data gathering?

3. The base prompt engineering seems vital for the models to correctly classify threats. Can you walk through the process and considerations behind crafting this prompt? Were there iterations and how was the final version designed?

4. Statistical analysis relied on chi-square tests to evaluate model accuracy, but what other statistical approaches did you consider? Why was chi-square testing ultimately selected and what were its benefits over other methods? 

5. The results section compares accuracy across models, but are there other evaluation criteria you considered during experimentation? What metrics beyond accuracy would be valuable for model selection here? 

6. For the PaLM API, you mentioned certain challenges arose in retrieving responses in the desired format. Can you elaborate on the specific issues faced and how the prompting or interpretation process could be improved?

7. What steps were taken during data analysis to account for biases that may be present in the models and avoid unintended censorship? How can the methodology be enhanced to further address ethical AI considerations?

8. The paper acknowledges differences in results when applying models to new languages and cultural contexts. What recommendations would you have for adapting this approach to English language content moderation? 

9. What were some key limitations or challenges faced when implementing this methodology for threat detection? How can the experimental design be strengthened to address these issues in future work?

10. Overall, how do you see this threat detection methodology evolving in the future as models continue to advance in capability? What emerging innovations show the most promise for this application?
