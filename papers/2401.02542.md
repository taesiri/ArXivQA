# [A Community Detection and Graph Neural Network Based Link Prediction   Approach for Scientific Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02542)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This LaTeX source code does not contain a research paper. It defines a large number of journal options for the `mdpi.cls' document class.

Specifically, it allows an author to specify the journal name (e.g. `\journal{entropy}`) when using this document class, and it will automatically define macros for the full journal name, short journal name, DOI abbreviation, ISSN number, and other formatting options tailored for that journal.

So in summary, this does not contain a research paper itself, but rather configuration to allow easy formatting of papers for different MDPI journals when using their LaTeX template. The main contribution is defining journal-specific formatting macros to simplify LaTeX manuscript preparation for submission to the respective MDPI journals.
