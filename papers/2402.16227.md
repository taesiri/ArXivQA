# [Scaling Robust Optimization for Multi-Agent Robotic Systems: A   Distributed Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16227)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-agent systems with robots/vehicles are becoming complex with increasing size and uncertainty from noise or disturbances.
- Existing methods can handle stochastic noise or deterministic disturbances, but not both robustly in a scalable manner.
- There is a need for distributed algorithms that are robust, handle both noise types, and computationally efficient.

Proposed Solution:
- Combine robust optimization, distribution steering, and distributed optimization.
- Provide tractable approximations for relevant robust constraints in multi-robot systems. These include constraints on state mean, chance constraints, covariance constraints. 
- Reformulate the robust constraints to decouple the effect of feedforward and feedback control variables.
- Develop a distributed algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the robust optimization problem.

Main Contributions:
- First work to integrate robust optimization, distribution steering and distributed architectures for multi-agent control.  
- Computationally efficient approximations for robust constraints suited to multi-robot systems.
- Distributed algorithm building on ADMM that is scalable.
- Demonstrated effectiveness in handling noise and disturbances, and scalability up to 100 agents through simulations.

In summary, the paper develops a distributed framework to achieve robust and scalable optimization for multi-agent systems under uncertainty. It makes both theoretical and practical contributions through reformulations and a distributed algorithm. The performance is shown in simulation comparisons and in problems with up to 100 agents.
