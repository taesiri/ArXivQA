# [OpenAsp: A Benchmark for Multi-document Open Aspect-based Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04440)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing OpenAsp, a new benchmark dataset for multi-document open aspect-based summarization. The key highlights are:

1) OpenAsp is the first open aspect-based summarization dataset in the multi-document setting, with high-quality summaries collected through a novel efficient protocol.

2) The proposed protocol extracts aspect-based summaries from existing generic multi-document summaries, avoiding the need to manually read long documents or write summaries from scratch.

3) Analysis shows OpenAsp has diverse and challenging properties. Baseline models demonstrate a gap in performance, posing open research questions.

4) The protocol and dataset collection process is cost-effective and can be expanded to supply more data.

In summary, the paper presents OpenAsp as a valuable new resource to advance research on targeted multi-document summarization through open aspects. The introduced protocol also enables efficient creation of such datasets.

The paper introduces a new dataset called OpenAsp for multi-document open aspect-based summarization, which is collected efficiently via a novel annotation protocol based on extracting aspects and summaries from existing generic multi-document summaries. The paper analyzes the properties and quality of the OpenAsp dataset, and implements several baseline models, including variants of BART, PRIMERA, and ChatGPT, to demonstrate the challenges the dataset poses. Concepts like abstractiveness, coherence, consistency, relevance, and aspect relevance are used to assess the quality of the dataset, while metrics like ROUGE are used to evaluate the baseline models. The key terms cover the different summarization tasks, the dataset and annotation protocol, evaluation metrics, and baseline models explored in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an efficient protocol to extract aspect-based summaries from generic multi-document summaries. What are the two key assumptions this protocol makes and how does the paper justify them through analysis?

2. The paper applies controlled crowdsourcing for aspect extraction and alignment. What is controlled crowdsourcing and why was it preferred over directly hiring expert annotators?

3. The proposed protocol avoids the expensive process of reading full document sets and writing summaries from scratch. What techniques are employed specifically to avoid this? 

4. The paper introduces a curation phase after initial annotation to clean the dataset. What are some examples of modifications done during curation and what guidelines were developed for curators?

5. The analysis shows that over 60% of consecutive sentence pairs in aspect summaries also appear consecutively in the generic summary. Why does this phenomenon occur and how does it impact summary coherence?

6. The paper analyzes the characteristics of annotated aspects in terms of coverage, distinctness and collectiveness. What do the analysis results imply about the quality of annotated aspects? 

7. The analysis reveals varying extents of extractiveness/abstractiveness in the collected summaries. How is this diversity characterized and why does it occur?

8. The multi-document coverage analysis shows lower dispersion scores compared to the source datasets. What causes this difference and what does it imply about information consolidation in aspect summaries?

9. The baseline models demonstrate clear gaps in performance compared to oracle summaries. What architectural improvements can help bridge this gap for the open aspect-based multi-document summarization task?  

10. The human evaluation ranks model relevance quite low despite decent ROUGE scores. What could explain this discrepancy and why is it problematic for model development?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a summary of the paper:

The paper introduces OpenAsp, a new benchmark dataset for open aspect-based multi-document summarization. Aspect-based summarization aims to generate summaries that focus on specific subtopics (aspects) within a document or set of documents on a common topic. Previous datasets have limitations such as a closed set of aspects, single document inputs only, or synthetic/low-quality data.

To address these limitations, OpenAsp contains 1,310 high-quality aspect-based summaries over 419 topics based on existing multi-document summarization datasets DUC and MultiNews. The summaries were generated through a novel, efficient crowdsourcing protocol, where annotators identify open aspects and extract relevant sentences from reference summaries rather than reading full document sets. This makes data collection scalable while ensuring summary quality.

OpenAsp has multi-document inputs averaging 7,930 words over 10.4 documents per topic. The open aspects are concise subtopics present within the documents, with each topic having 1-7 unique aspects. Analysis shows OpenAsp has high relevance, consistency, coherence and coverage of important subtopics.

Experiments with strong summarization models like BART, PRIMERA and ChatGPT show that OpenAsp presents challenges for current methods. The best ROUGE-1 score is only 33.7, demonstrating significant room for improvement.

In summary, OpenAsp contributes the first open-domain, multi-document dataset for aspect-based summarization containing realistic and high-quality human annotations. The data collection protocol also enables efficient extension to other datasets. OpenAsp drives progress on meeting precise user information needs from large document collections.
