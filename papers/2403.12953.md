# [FutureDepth: Learning to Predict the Future Improves Video Depth   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12953)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Depth estimation from images is important for 3D perception tasks like autonomous driving, AR/VR, etc. Using multiple video frames can improve depth accuracy over single images, but most methods have high complexity. 

- Existing video depth methods using cost volumes or optical flow are slow. Attention-based methods are more efficient but less accurate. They also lack temporal consistency as they process each frame independently.

- There is a need for an accurate, efficient and temporally consistent video depth estimation method.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes FutureDepth, a novel video depth approach using future prediction and masked reconstruction.

- A Future Prediction Network (F-Net) is trained to iteratively predict future features. This captures motion cues to help depth estimation.

- A Reconstruction Network (R-Net) is trained via masked auto-encoding to identify multi-frame correspondences.

- At inference, F-Net and R-Net generate query features containing motion and scene information. These are integrated via cross-attention into the depth decoder to enhance prediction.

- A refinement network further improves depth details using the query features.

Main Contributions:
- F-Net trained with multi-step future prediction loss without teaching forcing, enforcing robust motion understanding.

- R-Net trained with adaptive masked reconstruction identifies multi-view correspondences.

- Query features from F-Net and R-Net efficiently provide useful cues to decoder and refinement network.

- Extensive experiments show FutureDepth sets new state-of-the-art accuracy on NYUDv2, KITTI, DDAD and Sintel. It has better efficiency than existing video depth methods and mono methods.

- Temporal consistency is significantly improved over other methods.

In summary, FutureDepth pushes state-of-the-art in video depth estimation using future prediction and masked reconstruction to exploit spatial and temporal cues efficiently.
