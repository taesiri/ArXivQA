# [Optimized View and Geometry Distillation from Multi-view Diffuser](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06198)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an optimized approach called Unbiased Score Distillation (USD) to address limitations in extracting consistent multi-view images and high-fidelity geometry from a single-view image using multi-view diffusion models like Zero-1-to-3. The authors identify a critical bias in the unconditional noise prediction from Zero-1-to-3 that causes suboptimal results when using typical score distillation strategies. To address this, USD utilizes unconditioned noise from stable diffusion models instead. USD significantly refines the underlying radiance field. The paper further employs a two-stage fine-tuning strategy on top of DreamBooth to specialize the diffusion model for the target object and effectively denoise renderings from the radiance field. This produces high-quality novel views that align with the distilled radiance field while preserving detail. Finally, geometry and texture are recovered with input view consistency supervision. Experiments demonstrate that the approach generates comparable or sometimes better quality views and geometry than methods trained on large datasets without restrictions on camera angles. The insight on rectifying score distillation bias could inspire improved distillation strategies for future work.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating consistent multi-view images and high-quality 3D geometry from a single image using image-conditioned diffusion models is an emerging field. However, existing methods have limitations such as inconsistent synthesized views and over-smoothed geometry. Previous works enforce consistency by restricting camera angles or requiring extra supervision like normal maps. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an optimized distillation strategy to address the limitations without camera angle restrictions or extra supervision. The key ideas are:

1) Identify and rectify bias in unconditional noise prediction from the Zero-1-to-3 diffusion model using noise from Stable Diffusion. This Unbiased Score Distillation (USD) enhances radiance field optimization. 

2) Use the optimized neural radiance field (NeRF) as a multi-view consistency prior instead of 3D volumes or ray aggregation used before. 

3) Specialize a 2D diffusion model to the target object via a two-stage DreamBooth fine-tuning to effectively denoise NeRF renderings for high-quality multi-view generation.

4) Reconstruct geometry and texture from the refined views using NeuS while enforcing input view consistency.


Main Contributions:

- Identified and rectified critical bias in commonly used score distillation from Zero-1-to-3 using USD with Stable Diffusion noise. Significantly improves radiance field optimization.

- Optimized NeRF used as multi-view consistency prior instead of volumes or ray aggregation. Ensures coherent geometry and views.  

- Two-stage specialized diffusion model via DreamBooth to denoise NeRF renders for high-quality target-specific multi-view images.

- Comparable or better consistency and quality than state-of-the-art methods without camera angle limitations or extra supervision. Demonstrates the potential of optimized distillation strategies.

In summary, the paper introduces an optimized distillation approach that achieves impressive multi-view image and 3D geometry quality without restrictions on flexibility. The identified bias issue and proposed rectification provides valuable insights that can inspire further research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an Unbiased Score Distillation technique and a two-stage diffusion model personalization process to address issues with multi-view consistency and geometry quality when extracting 3D shapes from the Zero-1-to-3 diffusion model for novel view synthesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an Unbiased Score Distillation (USD) strategy to address the bias issue in the unconditional noise predictions from the Zero-1-to-3 multi-view diffusion model. Specifically, the paper shows that directly using the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) technique with Zero-1-to-3 leads to suboptimal results due to the bias in the predicted unconditional noises. 

To address this, the paper introduces USD which uses the unconditional noises from a 2D diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) instead of Zero-1-to-3's noises. This helps optimize the underlying radiance field more effectively.

Additionally, the paper proposes a two-stage fine-tuning scheme to specialize a 2D diffusion model for consistent novel view synthesis from the optimized radiance field. It also uses view score distillation during geometry recovery to ensure consistency with the input view.

In summary, the main contribution is identifying the bias issue in Zero-1-to-3's unconditional noise predictions, and proposing the USD strategy along with consistent view synthesis and geometry recovery techniques to address this limitation.
