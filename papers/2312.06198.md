# [Optimized View and Geometry Distillation from Multi-view Diffuser](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06198)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an optimized approach called Unbiased Score Distillation (USD) to address limitations in extracting consistent multi-view images and high-fidelity geometry from a single-view image using multi-view diffusion models like Zero-1-to-3. The authors identify a critical bias in the unconditional noise prediction from Zero-1-to-3 that causes suboptimal results when using typical score distillation strategies. To address this, USD utilizes unconditioned noise from stable diffusion models instead. USD significantly refines the underlying radiance field. The paper further employs a two-stage fine-tuning strategy on top of DreamBooth to specialize the diffusion model for the target object and effectively denoise renderings from the radiance field. This produces high-quality novel views that align with the distilled radiance field while preserving detail. Finally, geometry and texture are recovered with input view consistency supervision. Experiments demonstrate that the approach generates comparable or sometimes better quality views and geometry than methods trained on large datasets without restrictions on camera angles. The insight on rectifying score distillation bias could inspire improved distillation strategies for future work.
