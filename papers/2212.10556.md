# [Unleashing the Power of Visual Prompting At the Pixel Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10556)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is: Can visual prompting at the pixel level match or exceed the performance of other methods like linear probing for adapting foundation models to new visual tasks? The authors note that prior visual prompting methods like VPT and VP have shown potential, but still lag behind simpler approaches like linear probing. This paper aims to improve visual prompting to make it a competitive or superior approach. The key ideas explored are:1) Modifying the prompting design to avoid corrupting original image information by shrinking the image and padding prompts around it. 2) Incorporating techniques like input diversity and gradient normalization from adversarial example generation to improve optimization and generalization of the visual prompts.Through experiments on 12 datasets, the authors demonstrate their enhanced visual prompting (EVP) method sets a new state-of-the-art for visual prompting and also exceeds linear probing, showing the promise of this paradigm. The central hypothesis is that proper modifications to the prompting methodology can unleash the full potential of visual prompting at the pixel level.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing an enhanced visual prompting (EVP) method to improve the performance of foundation models on downstream visual recognition tasks. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Treat the prompt as a separate component and pad it around a shrinked image, instead of directly adding the prompt to the image. This avoids corrupting the original image and allows independent optimization of the prompt.- Apply techniques from adversarial attack literature like input diversity and gradient normalization to improve the generalization ability of the prompt. - Extensive experiments show EVP significantly outperforms prior visual prompting methods like VP and VPT. More importantly, it even exceeds the common linear probing baseline and approaches fully fine-tuning on some datasets, demonstrating visual prompting can be a powerful paradigm for adapting foundation models.In summary, the main contribution is presenting an effective visual prompting approach and showing its potential to surpass other adaptation methods, unlocking the power of prompting for computer vision models. The simple yet high-performing design can inspire more research into visual prompt learning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes an improved visual prompting method called EVP that shrinks and pads images to avoid corrupting them, and incorporates techniques from adversarial attacks like gradient normalization and input diversity to enhance prompt generalization, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 12 image classification benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in the field of visual prompt learning:- This paper aims to improve the performance of visual prompting methods at the pixel level, an area that has been explored in some prior works like VP and VPT but where the results have been less competitive. The key novelties in this paper that aim to enhance visual prompting are separating the prompt from the image instead of directly combining them, and incorporating techniques from adversarial attack literature like gradient normalization and input diversity.- Compared to VPT which adds learnable tokens inside ViT architectures, this work focuses on manipulating the pixels directly. The results demonstrate clear improvements over VPT, suggesting prompt design in the pixel space could be more effective. - This approach outperforms the simple baseline of linear probing while using a comparable number of parameters. Showing visual prompting can exceed linear probing is an important result, since linear probing is commonly used.- The performance reaches 82.5% average across 12 datasets using a CLIP model. This substantially outperforms prior visual prompting works like VPT, and is a new state-of-the-art result in this field.- The method is shown to work well across different data scales, from few-shot to full datasets. It also demonstrates improved robustness to out-of-distribution data compared to other approaches.- While prompting methods for vision lag behind NLP, this work shows visual prompting can be quite effective with the right design choices. The gap to fully fine-tuning is also reduced, highlighting the promise.In summary, by carefully designing the form of visual prompts and training procedure, this paper pushes the state of the art for visual prompting and shows it can surpass techniques like linear probing. The robustness and few-shot results are also notable. Overall it represents an important advance in understanding how to successfully prompt vision models.
