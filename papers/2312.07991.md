# [Accelerating the Global Aggregation of Local Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07991)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper focuses on accelerating the global aggregation of local explanation methods like Anchor that highlight input tokens impacting a model's predictions. Direct aggregation is prohibitively expensive, so they develop an anytime algorithm to efficiently compute top-k most influential terms. Specifically, they design a probabilistic model handling noise and irrelevant occurrences in anchors. For optimization, they reduce Anchor sampling, use score bounds to filter candidates, and leverage incremental evaluation to provide early results. Experiments demonstrate their techniques significantly accelerate aggregation from hours to minutes with little quality loss. For example, their method finds better terms in 10 seconds than alternatives do in 10 minutes. By quickly revealing globally impactful phrases, their optimizations make aggregation practical for online model analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper devises techniques to accelerate the computation of globally aggregating the local explanation scores of input tokens, specifically aiming to efficiently identify the top-k most impactful words for a model according to different aggregation functions, while accounting for noise and irrelevant occurrences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Designing a probabilistic aggregation model called $\gpr$ that aims to identify words that are likely to be anchors (i.e. have high impact on model predictions) while accounting for noise and irrelevant occurrences. 

2. Developing optimizations and accelerations for computing the top-$k$ impactful words globally using anchor explanations, including an anytime algorithm that quickly approaches high quality top-$k$ candidates. These optimizations provide up to 30x speedup over naive aggregation.

3. An experimental analysis showing the effectiveness of the proposed probabilistic aggregation model and optimizations in identifying top impactful terms faster compared to baseline aggregations. The experiments also validate that the optimizations significantly reduce computation time while maintaining good quality.

In summary, the paper focuses on efficiently identifying globally impactful words/terms by aggregating local anchor explanations, using a probabilistic model and optimizations to accelerate computation and deal with noise. The main outcome is an efficient anytime method to extract insights about model behavior from anchor attributions.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Local explanation methods like Anchor highlight input tokens that impact a model's predictions. Aggregating these local explanations over a dataset provides global model insights, like most influential words. 
- However, naive aggregation is prohibitively expensive, taking hours or days to process a dataset. This makes it infeasible for interactive analysis tools.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop optimizations to accelerate global aggregation of Anchor explanations and compute top-k most influential words. Some optimizations are Anchor-specific, others apply broadly.
- Design a probabilistic model called $\gpr$ that accounts for noise and irrelevant occurrences, avoiding bias toward frequent but unimportant words.

Contributions: 
- Anytime algorithm that maintains top-k candidates, approaching top quality quickly, with up to 30x speedup.
- Optimizations likeconfidence thresholding, candidate filtering and masking that accelerate Anchor specifically.
- Probabilistic model $\gpr$ that estimates word distributions for anchors vs non-anchors via maximum likelihood. Uses these to score words.
- Experimental evaluation showing proposed methods accelerate aggregation from hours to minutes with little quality loss. $\gpr$ also consistently outperforms other aggregations.
- Adaptation of evaluation method from prior work to measure quality of top-k terms by removing them and measuring prediction drop.

In summary, this paper provides optimizations and new aggregation methods to make global explanation of models via Anchor token attributions feasible and useful for interactive analysis, reducing computation from multiple hours to minutes. The solutions provide both speed and quality improvements.
