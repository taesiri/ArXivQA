# [Accelerating the Global Aggregation of Local Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07991)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper focuses on accelerating the global aggregation of local explanation methods like Anchor that highlight input tokens impacting a model's predictions. Direct aggregation is prohibitively expensive, so they develop an anytime algorithm to efficiently compute top-k most influential terms. Specifically, they design a probabilistic model handling noise and irrelevant occurrences in anchors. For optimization, they reduce Anchor sampling, use score bounds to filter candidates, and leverage incremental evaluation to provide early results. Experiments demonstrate their techniques significantly accelerate aggregation from hours to minutes with little quality loss. For example, their method finds better terms in 10 seconds than alternatives do in 10 minutes. By quickly revealing globally impactful phrases, their optimizations make aggregation practical for online model analysis.
