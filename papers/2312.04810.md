## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called "RS-Corrector" to address racial stereotypes exhibited in generated images from latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. The authors first analyze Stable Diffusion and find it produces images that reinforce common racial stereotypes for certain groups. To correct this, RS-Corrector establishes an anti-stereotypical preference in the latent space to guide adjustment of the latent code during inference. Specifically, it learns to distinguish anti-stereotypical and stereotypical latent representations using a collected fair dataset and negative stereotypical images. An anti-stereotypical latent prior is obtained to capture the most discerning features. This prior is then used alongside a direct contrastive constraint to update the latent code towards anti-stereotypical representations that yield fairer, higher quality images across races. Experiments demonstrate RS-Corrector successfully mitigates racial stereotypes and biases while improving facial aesthetics and attribute fairness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Textual Inversion and DreamBooth. Notably, RS-Corrector requires no fine-tuning and minor inference computation, making it an efficient and effective approach to correcting biases in generative models.
