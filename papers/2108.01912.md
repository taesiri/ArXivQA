# Internal Video Inpainting by Implicit Long-range Propagation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we perform video inpainting by implicitly propagating information from known regions to unknown regions, without relying on external optical flow estimation? The key hypothesis is that by training a convolutional neural network on the test video to overfit the known regions, it can learn to fill in the missing regions based on implicit propagation of information over time, rather than needing explicit optical flow guidance.In more detail:- The paper proposes a novel internal learning approach for video inpainting, where a CNN is trained directly on the test video itself. - This avoids issues with external training on large datasets, which can suffer from domain gap problems when applied to new test videos.- It also avoids reliance on estimated optical flow to explicitly propagate information between frames, which can fail for large masks, slight motions, or incorrect frame selection.- Instead, the paper hypothesizes that by overfitting the CNN to the known regions in the test video, the network can learn to implicitly propagate information from known to unknown regions based on inherent spatio-temporal correlations in natural videos.- This implicit propagation is enabled by properties of CNNs like weight sharing and translational equivalence of convolutions.- The method is enhanced with regularization terms to handle challenging cases like ambiguity and deficiency in the video.So in summary, the main research question is whether video inpainting can be achieved through implicit learning and propagation in an internal training framework, without optical flow guidance. And the results aim to demonstrate this hypothesis and approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a novel internal learning framework for video inpainting that implicitly propagates information from known regions to unknown regions without needing explicit optical flow estimation. - Designing two regularization terms - an anti-ambiguity term and a gradient regularization term - to handle challenging cases like ambiguous backgrounds or long-term occlusion where cross-frame information is unavailable or ambiguous.- Demonstrating state-of-the-art inpainting performance on the DAVIS dataset both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results of a user study also indicate the method is preferred.- Showing the flexibility of the approach by extending it to inpainting with only a single frame mask and very high resolution (4K) video inpainting.In summary, the key novelty seems to be in formulating video inpainting as an internal learning problem and propagating information implicitly over time without optical flow, made robust by the regularization terms. The experiments validate the effectiveness of this approach and show how it can be extended to more challenging settings.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in video inpainting:- It proposes a novel internal learning approach without using optical flow for propagation. Most prior video inpainting methods rely on estimating optical flow between frames and propagating information along the flow. However, optical flow estimation can be challenging and error-prone, especially in the missing regions. This paper shows that implicit propagation can be achieved without optical flow.- The method is flexible and achieves strong results across different video domains. Many recent learning-based video inpainting methods require training on large video datasets which may not generalize well. This internal learning approach adapts to each test video and can handle videos from different domains like autonomous driving, animation, etc.- It addresses ambiguity and deficiency cases using novel regularization losses. The anti-ambiguity loss helps generate sharper details in ambiguous regions. The gradient stabilization loss reduces flicker in deficient frames. These help handle challenging scenarios better.- The method is extended to novel tasks like inpainting with a single-frame mask and high-resolution 4K video inpainting. The flexibility of the approach allows these extensions to challenging settings not addressed before.- The internal learning formulation is analyzed in detail in terms of model capacity, video complexity, mask generation, etc. This provides useful insights on deep internal learning for video tasks.Overall, the key novelty is the implicit propagation idea and the analysis and extensions based on it. The work pushes the boundaries of deep internal learning for video processing. It also benchmarks methods on real and diverse videos which is lacking in prior work. The losses proposed also have the potential to benefit other video processing tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring different network architectures and loss functions to further improve the quality and temporal consistency of the inpainting results. The authors mention that finding the optimal balance between the different regularization losses remains an open question.- Incorporating external semantic information or priors to help generate more realistic details in regions that are constantly occluded and have no reliable cross-frame information. The authors show an example where their method fails to generate the correct shape for an occluded part of an object. Integrating natural image priors could help address this.- Extending the method to online/real-time video inpainting by developing models and training strategies that are faster. The current approach involves training the model from scratch on each new video, which is slow. - Applying the internal learning strategy to other video processing tasks beyond inpainting, such as video prediction, interpolation, etc. The idea of learning only from the test data itself without large external datasets could be useful for other tasks.- Exploring the use of deeper network architectures, adversarial/GAN losses, and recurrent networks to further improve video consistency and coherence in the inpainting results.- Evaluating the approach on more real-world video datasets beyond DAVIS to better understand its practical applicability. Extending it to handle challenges in real videos like camera motion.So in summary, the main directions are improving the visual quality, temporal consistency, efficiency of the approach, expanding the applications, and conducting more rigorous real-world testing. Internal learning is a promising area for video processing that warrants further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new framework for video inpainting using an internal learning strategy. Unlike previous methods that rely on optical flow for propagating information across frames, this method trains a convolutional neural network on the input video to implicitly learn to complete missing regions based on available information. The model is trained by masking known regions with augmented object masks to force it to learn to complete masked areas based on unmasked areas. The method handles challenging cases like ambiguous backgrounds and long-term occlusion through two regularization terms - an anti-ambiguity term to generate high-frequency details and a gradient regularization term to enforce temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the DAVIS dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance. The method is also extended to related tasks like object removal from high-resolution 4K videos using only a single frame mask. Overall, the internal learning approach shows strong potential for flexible and effective video inpainting without the need for large datasets.
