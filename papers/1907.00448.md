# [Self-Supervised Dialogue Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00448)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we utilize the sequential order of utterances as a self-supervised signal to improve dialogue learning?The key points are:- The sequential order of utterances contains important information for coherent dialogues. However, most existing neural dialogue systems do not explicitly model or utilize this order information.- The paper proposes a new self-supervised task called "inconsistent order detection" to explicitly capture the order flow in dialogues. The task is to predict whether a sampled utterance triple is ordered correctly or not.- A sampling-based self-supervised network (SSN) is proposed to solve this task. It samples reference utterance triples from history to provide context and avoid the forgetfulness problem when encoding long dialogues.- The SSN is incorporated into existing dialogue learning frameworks through adversarial training, so it provides an order-based signal to improve coherence and relevance of generated responses.- Experiments show SSN helps advance state-of-the-art in both open-domain and task-oriented dialogue scenarios by better utilizing the order information.In summary, the key hypothesis is that modeling order as a self-supervised signal can improve neural dialogue learning. The SSN and training frameworks are proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces a new self-supervised task called inconsistent order detection to explicitly capture the sequential order information in dialogues. 2. It proposes a sampling-based self-supervised network (SSN) to solve the inconsistent order detection task. The SSN uses sampled references from the dialogue history to avoid the forgetfulness problem when encoding long dialogues.3. It shows how the proposed SSN can be used to improve existing dialogue systems in both open-domain and task-oriented scenarios through adversarial training. 4. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance using the proposed methods on two dialogue datasets - OpenSubtitles (open-domain) and Movie-Ticket Booking (task-oriented).In summary, the key innovation is using the proposed inconsistent order detection task and sampling-based SSN to explicitly model the important sequential order signal in dialogues. This order information is then used to guide dialogue systems to generate more coherent and relevant responses during training.
