# [Self-Supervised Dialogue Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00448)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we utilize the sequential order of utterances as a self-supervised signal to improve dialogue learning?

The key points are:

- The sequential order of utterances contains important information for coherent dialogues. However, most existing neural dialogue systems do not explicitly model or utilize this order information.

- The paper proposes a new self-supervised task called "inconsistent order detection" to explicitly capture the order flow in dialogues. The task is to predict whether a sampled utterance triple is ordered correctly or not.

- A sampling-based self-supervised network (SSN) is proposed to solve this task. It samples reference utterance triples from history to provide context and avoid the forgetfulness problem when encoding long dialogues.

- The SSN is incorporated into existing dialogue learning frameworks through adversarial training, so it provides an order-based signal to improve coherence and relevance of generated responses.

- Experiments show SSN helps advance state-of-the-art in both open-domain and task-oriented dialogue scenarios by better utilizing the order information.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that modeling order as a self-supervised signal can improve neural dialogue learning. The SSN and training frameworks are proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new self-supervised task called inconsistent order detection to explicitly capture the sequential order information in dialogues. 

2. It proposes a sampling-based self-supervised network (SSN) to solve the inconsistent order detection task. The SSN uses sampled references from the dialogue history to avoid the forgetfulness problem when encoding long dialogues.

3. It shows how the proposed SSN can be used to improve existing dialogue systems in both open-domain and task-oriented scenarios through adversarial training. 

4. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance using the proposed methods on two dialogue datasets - OpenSubtitles (open-domain) and Movie-Ticket Booking (task-oriented).

In summary, the key innovation is using the proposed inconsistent order detection task and sampling-based SSN to explicitly model the important sequential order signal in dialogues. This order information is then used to guide dialogue systems to generate more coherent and relevant responses during training.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a self-supervised learning approach to model the sequential order in dialogues. Specifically, it introduces an inconsistent order detection task, where a model needs to predict whether a sampled utterance triple follows the correct order or not. A sampling-based self-supervised network is then proposed to solve this task. This network is further used in a joint training framework with dialogue models to improve dialogue coherence and relevancy. The key idea is to leverage the sequential order as an explicit self-supervision signal for better dialogue learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on dialogue systems:

- It proposes a new self-supervised task called "inconsistent order detection" to explicitly model the sequential order in dialogues. Most prior work either encodes the full dialogue history in a hierarchical encoder, or focuses only on the current utterance. The proposed task helps capture intermediate sequential order.

- It introduces a sampling-based self-supervised network (SSN) to solve the inconsistent order detection task. The SSN samples reference triples from the dialogue history in each iteration to approximate encoding the full history, avoiding the forgetfulness problem with hierarchical encoders.

- The paper shows how SSN can be incorporated into existing dialogue learning frameworks like adversarial training and D3Q via a joint training approach. Using SSN to provide an order-based reward signal improves coherence and relevance.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art results on two dialogue tasks - open-domain generation (OpenSubtitles dataset) and task-oriented learning (Movie-Ticket Booking dataset). This demonstrates the broad applicability of the proposed techniques.

Overall, the key novelty is using order as self-supervision for dialogue through the inconsistent order detection task and SSN model. The results validate order as an effective learning signal, advancing the state-of-the-art in dialogue coherence and relevance. The ideas could potentially generalize to exploiting order in other temporal sequence modeling tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Applying the proposed self-supervised learning approach to other types of temporal order in different NLP tasks beyond just dialogue systems. The authors mention that their method of using inconsistent order detection as a self-supervised signal could be generalized to other tasks with sequential order.

- Exploring different network architectures and sampling strategies for the self-supervised network (SSN). The authors mention that their approach represents an initial exploration into using order as self-supervision, implying further work could be done on optimizing the model architecture and sampling techniques.

- Adapting the approach to other dialogue learning frameworks beyond adversarial training. While the paper focuses on using the SSN for adversarial training, the authors suggest the order predictions could be incorporated into other dialogue learning frameworks as well.

- Evaluating the approach on other dialogue datasets and tasks. The method is only evaluated on two datasets - OpenSubtitles and a movie ticket booking dataset. Testing on additional dialogue datasets and tasks would further demonstrate its effectiveness.

- Incorporating other self-supervisory signals beyond just order. The authors focus solely on order as a self-supervisory signal, but suggest combining it with other signals could further improve dialogue learning.

- Exploring methods to reduce the computational overhead of sampling. The sampling process introduces additional computation, so investigating ways to optimize this could improve efficiency.

In summary, the main future directions are centered around extending the approach to other tasks/datasets, optimizing the model architecture and sampling process, and incorporating additional self-supervisory signals. Overall the authors position their work as an initial foray into order-based self-supervision for dialogue that could be built upon.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised learning method to improve the coherence and relevance of dialogue systems. It introduces a new task called inconsistent order detection, where the model is trained to predict whether a sampled utterance triple is in the correct order based on the dialogue context. To solve this task, the authors propose a sampling-based self-supervised network (SSN) which encodes target triples along with sampled reference triples from the dialogue history. This allows the model to capture useful ordering information without suffering from forgetting earlier dialogue context. The SSN is incorporated into existing dialogue models through adversarial training, where it scores generated responses based on their consistency with the dialogue order. Experiments on open-domain and task-oriented dialogue datasets show improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods by explicitly modeling the utterance order. Overall, the paper demonstrates that inconsistent order detection is an effective self-supervised task for improving dialogue coherence and relevance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a self-supervised learning method to improve neural dialogue systems. The key idea is to introduce a new task called inconsistent order detection. In this task, the model is given a sampled triple of utterance pairs from a dialogue and must predict whether the triple is in the correct order or not. The authors argue that accurately modeling the sequential order of utterances is important for generating coherent dialogues. However, most existing methods do not explicitly capture this order signal. 

To address this, the paper proposes a sampling-based self-supervised network (SSN) to solve the inconsistent order detection task. The SSN encodes utterance triples using an utterance encoder and order reasoning layer. It is trained by sampling reference triples from the dialogue history to provide context. The SSN can then be incorporated into existing dialogue systems through adversarial training, so the order prediction guides utterance generation towards more coherent dialogues. Experiments on two datasets show SSN improves state-of-the-art neural dialogue systems for both open-domain chitchat and task-oriented dialogues. The key contributions are introducing the new self-supervised order detection task, the sampling-based SSN model, and demonstrating effectiveness on multiple dialogue tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised learning task called inconsistent order detection to explicitly model the sequential order of utterances in dialogues. To solve this task, the paper introduces a sampling-based self-supervised network (SSN) that samples reference utterance triples from the dialogue history and predicts whether a target utterance triple is correctly ordered or not. The SSN encodes each utterance pair in the triple using a bidirectional LSTM, reasons about the order using another LSTM, and concatenates the embeddings to make the final prediction. The SSN is trained using sampled ordered and misordered triples from the dialogue. Then, the SSN is incorporated into existing dialogue systems using adversarial training - it tries to identify misordered samples from the dialogue model as bad. This encourages the dialogue model to generate utterances that are coherent with the dialogue history according to the order predicted by the SSN.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of utterance blandness and incoherence in dialogue systems. Specifically:

- Dialogue systems often generate bland and incoherent responses due to maximizing unconditioned probability. 

- Existing methods do not explicitly model the sequential order of utterances, which is important for coherence.

- The paper proposes using the sequential order as a self-supervised signal to improve dialogue learning. 

The key question addressed is: How can we leverage the sequential order of utterances as a self-supervised signal to guide more coherent and relevant dialogue learning?

To summarize, the paper focuses on improving dialogue learning by explicitly modeling and utilizing the sequential order of utterances through a self-supervised task. This aims to address common issues like blandness and incoherence in existing dialogue systems.
