# [Different Tokenization Schemes Lead to Comparable Performance in Spanish   Number Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13754)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates how different tokenization schemes for Spanish plural nouns impact a language model's ability to make number agreement predictions. Specifically, it examines whether morphologically-aligned tokenization (e.g. splitting "libros" into "libro" and "s") leads to better performance on an article-noun agreement task compared to other tokenization approaches. 

Methods:
- Extracted plural Spanish nouns from a dataset and categorized them as single-token, multi-token morphemic (aligned with morphology), or multi-token non-morphemic. 
- Artificially re-tokenized some words to be morphologically aligned.  
- Assessed agreement prediction by having BETO predict articles for nouns and comparing plural vs singular article probabilities.
- Compared agreement success across original vs artificial tokenization schemes. 
- Analyzed noun embeddings with linear discriminant analysis.

Results: 
- All tokenization schemes lead to high accuracy in article-noun agreement.
- Artificially morphologically-aligned words lead to successful but slightly lower performance than original tokenization.
- An embedding axis separates singular/plural but maps all plural types similarly. Other axes separate plural types.

Conclusions:
- Morphologically-aware tokenization performs similarly to other schemes for agreement. It generalizes but is not strictly required. 
- Model may rely on multiple agreement mechanisms for different plural types.
- Future work could causally probe different embedding axes for agreement.

Main Contributions:
- Compares different plural noun tokenization schemes for Spanish in an agreement prediction task
- Shows artificial morphological splitting leads to successful generalization 
- Provides analysis of embedding overlaps and discriminability across tokenization types
- Suggests multiple agreement mechanisms may be present
