# [Different Tokenization Schemes Lead to Comparable Performance in Spanish   Number Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13754)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates how different tokenization schemes for Spanish plural nouns impact a language model's ability to make number agreement predictions. Specifically, it examines whether morphologically-aligned tokenization (e.g. splitting "libros" into "libro" and "s") leads to better performance on an article-noun agreement task compared to other tokenization approaches. 

Methods:
- Extracted plural Spanish nouns from a dataset and categorized them as single-token, multi-token morphemic (aligned with morphology), or multi-token non-morphemic. 
- Artificially re-tokenized some words to be morphologically aligned.  
- Assessed agreement prediction by having BETO predict articles for nouns and comparing plural vs singular article probabilities.
- Compared agreement success across original vs artificial tokenization schemes. 
- Analyzed noun embeddings with linear discriminant analysis.

Results: 
- All tokenization schemes lead to high accuracy in article-noun agreement.
- Artificially morphologically-aligned words lead to successful but slightly lower performance than original tokenization.
- An embedding axis separates singular/plural but maps all plural types similarly. Other axes separate plural types.

Conclusions:
- Morphologically-aware tokenization performs similarly to other schemes for agreement. It generalizes but is not strictly required. 
- Model may rely on multiple agreement mechanisms for different plural types.
- Future work could causally probe different embedding axes for agreement.

Main Contributions:
- Compares different plural noun tokenization schemes for Spanish in an agreement prediction task
- Shows artificial morphological splitting leads to successful generalization 
- Provides analysis of embedding overlaps and discriminability across tokenization types
- Suggests multiple agreement mechanisms may be present


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates how different tokenization schemes for Spanish plural nouns impact a language model's ability to predict the correct definite or indefinite article, finding that while morphologically-aligned tokenization performs well, it does not significantly outperform other schemes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper investigates how different tokenization schemes for Spanish plural nouns impact a language model's ability to make number agreement predictions. The authors find that while morphologically-aligned tokenization performs slightly better, other schemes like single-token plurals still facilitate high agreement accuracy. Further, the model shows evidence of generalization by making accurate predictions even for plural nouns that have been artificially re-tokenized along morphological boundaries. 

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating that while morphologically-aware tokenization can improve performance, it is not strictly required for a language model to learn and apply morphological agreement patterns. The paper also provides analysis exploring how embeddings for different plural tokenization schemes both overlap and diverge.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Tokenization schemes - The paper investigates different methods for tokenizing words in Spanish, including single-token, morphologically-aligned, and non-morphologically aligned schemes.

- Number agreement - The task examined in the paper is about a language model's ability to predict the correct definite or indefinite article (which encodes grammatical number) before Spanish plural nouns.  

- Morphological generalization - The paper tests whether inducing artificial morpheme-like boundaries in words leads to successful article prediction, suggesting a form of morphological generalization.

- Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) - LDA is used to examine whether language model embeddings for different plural tokenization schemes overlap or are discriminable along different axes.

- Causal interventions - The discussion section mentions using causal interventions on embedding axes to further understand how different tokenization schemes rely on the same or different internal agreement mechanisms. 

- Spanish - The language examined in the paper is Spanish, so it focuses specifically on number agreement and plural noun tokenization schemes in Spanish.

In summary, the key terms cover the tasks, models, and languages examined, as well as some of the analysis techniques used. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper artificially induces morphemic tokenizations for originally non-morphemic plural nouns. Why was this done, and what specific research questions does this artificial manipulation allow the authors to address?

2. The agreement task involves predicting singular vs plural definite/indefinite articles for noun phrases. What are some potential limitations of using article prediction as a proxy for assessing number agreement capabilities? Could you propose alternative or complementary agreement tasks to address those limitations?  

3. The paper finds that agreement accuracy is high regardless of plural noun tokenization scheme. However, the artificial morphemic scheme leads to slightly lower accuracy than the original non-morphemic scheme. What factors might explain this subtle performance decrement?

4. The linear discriminant analysis reveals one axis that does not distinguish between different plural tokenization schemes, but other axes that do separate them. What does this suggest about the model's number agreement mechanisms for different tokenization types? 

5. The paper does not directly manipulate or intervention on the model's internal representations. What experiments could you design to more directly test the causal role of the embedding space axes identified via LDA?

6. What range of morphological phenomena, languages, and language models could be tested in future work to expand upon and generalize the current findings? What challenges might arise in designing those additional experiments?

7. The agreement task uses a simplistic cloze-style prompt structure. What are some ways the syntactic prompting context could be made more complex while still assessing number agreement capabilities?

8. The paper acknowledges its agreement task has near ceiling performance. What modifications could make the task more challenging while remaining ecologically valid?

9. The tokenization schemes correspond to frequency differences. What additional analyses could help disambiguate effects of tokenization, morphology, and frequency? 

10. The paper focuses on number morphology and agreement. How might the artificial tokenization approach be extended to other morphological phenomena like tense, case marking, derivational morphology etc.? What new challenges might emerge?
