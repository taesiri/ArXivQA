# [The Reasons that Agents Act: Intention and Instrumental Goals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07221)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Characterizing the intentions of AI agents is an important challenge for understanding and building safe AI systems. However, there is no universally accepted definition of "intention" that is applicable to artificial agents. Simply ascribing intentions to AI systems is also controversial. The paper aims to provide formal definitions of intention that are grounded in philosophy, capture the common-sense notion of intent, and can be applied to real-world machine learning systems like reinforcement learning agents and language models.

Proposed Solution: The paper first informally operationalizes the concept of "intending to cause" an outcome. Through examples, it shows this captures direct intent as opposed to indirect intent or accidental side-effects. The operationalized definition also satisfies desiderata like the agent having knowledge of the causal effects of its actions. The paper then formalizes this definition in two ways:

1) Subjective intention: Defines the intention with which an agent chooses its policy, using the framework of structural causal influence models (SCIMs) to represent the agent's subjective beliefs. Compares the expected utility of the agent's policy to an alternate policy under a "contextual intervention" that fixes certain outcomes that the agent intended.

2) Behavioral intention: Defines intention based on how an agent, modeled as a policy oracle, adapts its behavior to interventions that fix intended outcomes. Shows this definition coincides with subjective intent for a robustly optimal policy oracle.

The paper further relates subjective intent to actual causality and instrumental goals, proving intention and instrumental incentives share identical graphical criteria in SCIMs. It also demonstrates inferring intentions of RL agents and language models based on their behavioral adaptations.

Main Contributions:

- Provides intuitive operationalizations and formal definitions of intention grounded in philosophy
- Definitions apply to computational agents and capture direct intent, side-effects, subjectivity, means-end consistency  
- Relates intent to actual causality and instrumental goals 
- Allows inferring intentions from agent behavior under interventions, without knowing agent's goals
- Assesses intentions of RL and language model agents


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces formal definitions of intention for AI agents, grounded in philosophy, that capture the intuitive notion of intent and relate to concepts like actual causality and instrumental goals, and shows how the definitions can be used to assess and infer the intentions of reinforcement learning agents and language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It provides an operationalization and formal definition of the intention with which an AI agent acts, grounded in philosophy and past work on algorithmic intent. The definitions capture the intuitive notion of intent and satisfy desiderata from past work.

2) It relates the definition of intent to other important concepts like actual causality and instrumental goals. It is shown that if an agent intentionally causes an outcome, then their decision was an actual cause of that outcome in their subjective model. The definition is also related to instrumental control incentives.  

3) It provides graphical criteria for intention that are identical to those for instrumental control incentives. This shows the close connection between intention and instrumental goals.

4) It demonstrates how the behavioral definition of intent can be used to assess and infer the intentions of real-world AI systems like reinforcement learning agents and language models, without needing to know the agent's goals.

In summary, the main contribution is an operationalized definition of intent suitable for AI systems, with formal results relating it to other concepts, and a demonstration of how it can be used to assess the intentions of real ML systems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Intention - The paper provides formal definitions of intention applicable to AI systems, grounding them in philosophy and relating them to concepts like agency, manipulation, responsibility, etc.

- Causality - The paper relates intention to causal concepts like actual causality and structural causal models. It shows that if an agent intentionally causes an outcome, then their decision was an actual cause of the outcome.

- Instrumental goals - The paper connects the concept of intention to instrumental goals and control incentives, which are important in AI safety literature. It shows intention and instrumental goals share graphical criteria.

- Reinforcement learning - The paper demonstrates how the proposed definition of behavioral intention can be used to assess and infer the intentions of reinforcement learning agents based on how they adapt behavior to interventions. 

- Language models - Similarly, the definitions are used to infer and evaluate the intentions of language models like GPT-4 in different interaction scenarios.

- Agency - The concept of intention is shown to be important for notions of agency, manipulation, responsibility, etc. ascribed to AI systems.

Some other terms that come up are structural causal influence models, policy oracles, robust optimality, subjective vs. behavioral intent, etc. But the main ideas focus on formally defining and operationalizing intention for AI systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes both a subjective and a behavioral definition of intention. What is the key difference between these two definitions and why did the authors feel it was important to propose both?

2. The paper relates intention to the concept of "actual causality." What is actual causality and how does relating it to intention ensure the agent has knowledge of the effects of its actions?

3. Instrumental goals are an important concept discussed in AI safety literature. How does the proposed definition of intention formally relate to instrumental goals? What theoretical result demonstrates this connection?

4. The completeness result for the graphical criteria shows that, given certain graphical conditions, there always exists a set of structural equations for which the agent will have the intention in question. Why is this an important theoretical result? 

5. The paper demonstrates evaluating intention in both reinforcement learning agents and language models. What assumptions need to hold for the behavioral definition to be reasonably applied in these cases? How might these assumptions be violated in practice?

6. How does the proposed definition of intention deal with settings where an agent might have multiple distinct reasons for carrying out an action? Provide an example where this situation arises.  

7. What changes would need to be made to generalize the proposed definitions to settings with multiple decision nodes or competitive multi-agent settings? What new challenges might arise?

8. The definition requires evaluating intention under different hypothetical interventions. What practical challenges arise when trying to assess real-world AI systems based on a potentially infinite set of required interventions? 

9. What kinds of interventions were made to assess the intentions of the language model examples? How was it determined whether the model meaningfully changed its behavior in response?

10. The definition judges side-effects of actions as unintentional. How might the definition be extended to also capture the concept of obliquely or indirectly intended outcomes in a rigorous way?
