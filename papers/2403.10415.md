# [Gradient based Feature Attribution in Explainable AI: A Technical Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10415)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Explainable AI (XAI) research has proliferated recently to explain opaque AI models. However, among the plethora of XAI methods, gradient-based feature attribution specifically for neural networks has not been comprehensively surveyed. This paper aims to provide an in-depth review of gradient-based explanation methods.

Solutions:
The paper categorizes gradient-based explanations into four groups:

1. Vanilla gradients methods like Backpropagation, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM. They directly use gradients or variants to explain models. 

2. Integrated gradients methods like Integrated Gradients, Blur IG, Guided IG. They accumulate gradients along a path from a baseline to the input to address saturation issues with vanilla gradients.

3. Bias gradients methods like FullGrad. They consider both input gradients and bias gradients when attributing predictions.  

4. Postprocessing methods like SmoothGrad, VarGrad. They add noise to inputs to smooth noisy saliency maps.

For each category, the paper introduces key algorithms, analyzes motivations and details, and provides a timeline depicting the evolution of ideas. It also discusses evaluations like human assessment, pointing game, insertion/deletion, and randomization tests. 

Main Contributions:

- Comprehensive taxonomy and review of gradient-based explanation methods
- Chronological timeline showing progression of key ideas
- Introduction and analysis of main algorithms in each category
- Broad coverage of quantitative evaluation metrics
- Discussion of general XAI challenges and specific issues in gradient-based explanations

The detailed analysis provides a holistic understanding of the field's progress to help guide future research by identifying limitations and open challenges. By substantiating core hypotheses and addressing fragility/security issues, more rigorous gradient-based explanation methods can be developed.
