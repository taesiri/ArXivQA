## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) system for medical image classification to enable quick and accurate disease diagnosis from anywhere. The system first uses transfer learning with the MobileNetV3 model to extract meaningful feature representations from the images. It then employs a novel Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) algorithm for feature selection to reduce the feature space and select only the most relevant features, improving classification performance. The system was evaluated on three medical image datasets - ISIC-2016, PH2, and Blood-Cell. Results showed that combining CGO for feature selection with stochastic gradient descent for classification achieved top accuracy of 88.39\% on ISIC-2016, 97.52\% on PH2, and 88.79\% on Blood-Cell, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The proposed system demonstrates how IoMT devices can capture medical images, leverage cloud computing resources to train classification models using transfer learning and metaheuristic optimization, and deploy these models on fog nodes to enable real-time analysis and disease diagnosis, even in low-resource settings. The system provides an effective architecture for ubiquitous, accurate medical image classification to improve healthcare.
