# [Medical Image Classification Using Transfer Learning and Chaos Game   Optimization on the Internet of Medical Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07437)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) system for medical image classification to enable quick and accurate disease diagnosis from anywhere. The system first uses transfer learning with the MobileNetV3 model to extract meaningful feature representations from the images. It then employs a novel Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) algorithm for feature selection to reduce the feature space and select only the most relevant features, improving classification performance. The system was evaluated on three medical image datasets - ISIC-2016, PH2, and Blood-Cell. Results showed that combining CGO for feature selection with stochastic gradient descent for classification achieved top accuracy of 88.39\% on ISIC-2016, 97.52\% on PH2, and 88.79\% on Blood-Cell, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The proposed system demonstrates how IoMT devices can capture medical images, leverage cloud computing resources to train classification models using transfer learning and metaheuristic optimization, and deploy these models on fog nodes to enable real-time analysis and disease diagnosis, even in low-resource settings. The system provides an effective architecture for ubiquitous, accurate medical image classification to improve healthcare.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing approaches for automatic detection and prediction of diseases like melanoma and leukemia using medical images in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems are not able to achieve high efficiency. This leads to patients not getting adequate treatments early and increased death rates. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new IoMT system for medical image classification that can be used anywhere. The system has two main stages:

1. Transfer Learning (TL) based feature extraction using MobileNetV3 model. This extracts relevant features from the medical images.

2. Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) based feature selection to remove unnecessary features and improve performance. This is key for IoMT systems.

The extracted features are fed into CGO which selects the most relevant features to build the classification model using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

Main Contributions:

- The proposed IoMT system helps reduce human intervention in medical centers and provides fast diagnosis with low resourced systems.

- Transfer learning using MobileNetV3 effectively extracts features from the medical images.

- The CGO feature selection approach analyzes each pixel embedding and selects only the most discriminative features to improve classification performance.

- Extensive evaluation using ISIC-2016, PH2 and Blood-Cell datasets shows the proposed approach achieves accuracy of 88.39% on ISIC-2016, 97.52% on PH2 and 88.79% on Blood-cell outperforming existing methods.

In summary, the paper proposes a new IoMT based medical image classification system using transfer learning for feature extraction and chaos game optimization for feature selection that can provide efficient diagnosis with limited resources. Evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art approaches.
