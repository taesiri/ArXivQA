# [Dexterous Legged Locomotion in Confined 3D Spaces with Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03848)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing quadruped locomotion controllers can handle terrain challenges underneath the robot, but have limited ability to navigate confined 3D spaces (e.g. tunnels, pipes) that impose all-around constraints. 
- Cyclic gaits from existing RL methods may not enable the agile 3D maneuvers needed. 
- End-to-end learning with sparse rewards for far goals is inefficient.

Proposed Solution:
- A hierarchical locomotion controller combining a high-level classical planner and a low-level RL policy.
- The high-level planner efficiently plans feasible waypoint poses using local information. 
- The low-level policy is trained via RL to follow these waypoints using only local terrain observations.

Key Contributions:
- Novel hybrid classical and learning-based approach for quadruped navigation in confined spaces.
- High-level planner enables longer-range navigation by providing local subgoals.
- Low-level policy can focus on dexterous maneuvers rather than long-range navigation.  
- Significantly more efficient training than end-to-end methods.
- Simulation experiments show higher success rate in traversing challenging confined spaces compared to alternatives.
- Demonstrated sim-to-real transfer by deploying trained policy on a real quadruped robot.

In summary, the key innovation is in combining classical high-level planning with a learnable low-level policy that allows efficient exploration of diverse locomotion maneuvers needed for confined spaces. This hierarchical approach outperforms alternatives in enabling reliable quadruped navigation in complex 3D environments.
