# [Self-evolving Autoencoder Embedded Q-Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11604)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents face challenges in sequential decision-making tasks involving large, complex, and diverse state and action spaces. Key issues include computational intractability in finding optimal solutions and difficulty in balancing exploration and exploitation without precise environment models. This hinders real-world applicability.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Self-evolving Autoencoder embedded Q-Network (SAQN). It features two key components:

1) Self-evolving Autoencoder (SA): An autoencoder with an evolving architecture that grows and prunes neurons based on a bias-variance strategy. This allows automatic adaptation to diverse observations during exploration without manual tuning. The compact latent representations capture pertinent environment features.

2) Integration with a Q-Network (QN): The SA pre-trains an encoder to generate a latent space fed into the QN. This boosts QN training efficiency by reducing observation correlations that contribute to overestimation errors. The QN then determines optimal actions to maximize rewards.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel self-evolving autoencoder approach that autonomously evolves its architecture to form effective latent representations tailored to the RL task.

2) Theoretical analysis on how the bias-variance strategy controls network evolution to capture concise encodings of raw observations.

3) Seamless fusion of the self-evolving autoencoder with a Q-Network to enhance sequential decision-making.

4) Comprehensive experiments on 3 benchmark & 1 real-world molecular optimization environment demonstrate SAQN's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in most cases. 

The self-evolving autoencoder's adaptability combined with the Q-Network addresses key RL challenges, enabling improved decision-making. This advances real-world applicability across diverse domains.
