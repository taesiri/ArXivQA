## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A Survey on Robotics with Foundation Models: Toward Embodied AI":

Problem:
While robots have made progress in controlled environments, achieving human-level intelligence for general purpose tasks in unstructured real-world settings remains challenging. Key difficulties include perception, reasoning, decision-making, control and generalization. Recent large foundation models like LLMs and VLMs have shown superhuman capabilities in specific areas, presenting an opportunity to advance embodied AI systems. 

Solutions:
This paper provides a comprehensive survey on applying foundation models to autonomous robotic manipulation, categorizing approaches into high-level planning and low-level control. 

High-Level Planning:
- Uses natural language, code or planning languages to decompose complex tasks and generate executable step-by-step plans. Foundation models assist with command interpretation, visual perception, reasoning through intricate tasks.
- Enhancements include integrating vision models for target identification, incorporating external knowledge and real-time feedback to guide planning.

Low-Level Control: 
- Focuses on precisely executing commands by determining parameters like robot arm positions. Foundation model capacity enables learning multiple skills and making fine-grained decisions concurrently.
- Main directions are policy learning via RL/IL, modeling environment dynamics, and representation learning by freezing or learning from foundation models.

Recent methods combine high and low-level components in large robotic foundation models, akin to the cerebrum and cerebellum collaboration.

The paper also surveys datasets, simulators and benchmarks for training and evaluation. Finally, it discusses key challenges around efficiency, safety, sample complexity and foundation model hallucination, and suggests research directions.

Contributions:  
- Comprehensive taxonomy and review of applying foundation models for robotic manipulation
- Highlights planning strategies, control techniques, and their enhancement
- Summarizes key resources and benchmarks in this area 
- Discusses persisting challenges and future avenues for advancing embodied AI
