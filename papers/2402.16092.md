# [StochCA: A Novel Approach for Exploiting Pretrained Models with   Cross-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16092)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Effectively transferring knowledge from large-scale pretrained models to downstream tasks is an important challenge, as na√Øve fine-tuning may not fully leverage the rich representations. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Stochastic Cross-Attention (StochCA), a novel fine-tuning approach for Vision Transformers (ViT).

- The key idea is to selectively retrieve useful knowledge from the pretrained model using cross-attention during fine-tuning. Specifically, the queries come from the target model being trained, while keys and values come from the corresponding block of the fixed pretrained model.

- Cross-attention is performed stochastically in each block during training, regulated by a probability hyperparameter. Only self-attention is used during inference.

- This allows fine-tuning the target model's queries and MLP layers to efficiently extract and utilize relevant features from the pretrained model for the target task.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes StochCA, a simple yet effective fine-tuning technique to selectively leverage pretrained knowledge using stochastic cross-attention.

- Demonstrates StochCA's effectiveness on transfer learning and domain generalization benchmarks, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

- Shows compatibility of StochCA with existing methods, with synergistic gains when combined.

- Provides analysis revealing StochCA's ability to retrieve useful representations from pretrained models.

In summary, the key novelty is a stochastic cross-attention approach for ViTs to selectively exploit pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning, with versatility across tasks and compatibility with existing methods.
