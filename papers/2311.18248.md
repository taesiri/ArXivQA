# [mPLUG-PaperOwl: Scientific Diagram Analysis with the Multimodal Large   Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18248)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It builds the first high-quality scientific diagram analysis dataset called mPLUG-Paper to support learning abilities like correlating multiple diagrams, keeping consistency with preceding content, and being interactable with users.

2. It carefully designs three multimodal tasks (Multimodal Diagram Captioning, Multimodal Diagram Analysis, and Outline Recommendation) to simulate real paper-writing scenarios. It also proposes a GPT-based evaluation metric called CIDEr^gpt to better measure paragraph analysis quality.

3. It fine-tunes a strong baseline model called mPLUG-PaperOwl based on an existing MLLM and performs comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of multimodal inputs and training strategies. The ablation studies also provide insights into model improvement.

In summary, this paper focuses on strengthening the scientific diagram analysis abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models to move a step closer to a versatile paper-writing copilot. The newly constructed dataset, carefully designed tasks, and strong baseline model are the main contributions.
