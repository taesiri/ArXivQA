# [Tasks That Language Models Don't Learn](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11349)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper argues that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, despite their impressive capabilities, lack a comprehensive understanding of certain aspects of language due to their text-only training. Specifically, they miss out on the rich multimodal nature of human language acquisition involving visual, auditory, and other sensory inputs.

- This sensory deprivation means LLMs may have "blind spots" in processing stylistic, orthographic, visual, and auditory features of language. Their understanding of the supradiegetic aspects of language (how it looks and sounds) is limited compared to the diegetic, semantic content. 

- Drawing on philosophical thought experiments like Mary's Room, the paper contends there are experiential aspects of language LLMs cannot learn from text alone, posing challenges for developing models that truly understand language like humans.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a benchmark called the H-Test comprising 10 classification tasks testing LLMs' ability to infer visual and auditory properties of language they have never directly experienced.

- Tasks include identifying words with one letter uppercase, words starting with vowels, rhyming words etc. Intuitive for humans, but require sensory grounding absent in LLM training.

Main Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrates through H-Test that leading LLMs like Claude, Anthropic, LLaMA, GPT-3.5 etc. stay near 50% accuracy, close to random chance, highlighting linguistic "blind spots."

- Shows common LLM improvements like more data, model scale, computational power, multi-step reasoning do not easily solve H-Test, strengthening the claim that sensory experience is critical.

- Performance gap between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (80% accuracy) shows multimodality may be imperative for comprehensively learning language. But smaller multimodal models don't automatically do better.

- Overall makes a case for key perceptual differences between human and LLM language processing, raising philosophical questions about the depth of language understanding current text-trained models can achieve.

Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this summary further. I aimed to capture the core essence as concisely yet completely as possible.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper argues that current large language models have significant gaps in comprehending the visual and auditory aspects of language due to their sensory-deprived training, which limits their ability to fully acquire certain types of linguistic knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a set of tasks called the H-Test to evaluate the ability of language models to understand the visual and auditory aspects of language. Specifically, the key points about the contribution are:

1) The paper argues that current large language models (LLMs) lack the ability to truly comprehend certain sensory and perceptual aspects of language that humans naturally integrate due to their text-only training. The H-Test aims to quantify and categorize such linguistic "blind spots".

2) The H-Test consists of 10 distinct classification tasks that require integrating knowledge about how language looks visually or sounds auditorily. These tasks are difficult for LLMs as they have never directly experienced the sensory aspects involved.

3) Experiments on leading proprietary LLMs show they struggle on the H-Test, performing only slightly better than random chance. This highlights limitations in their language understanding caused by lack of multimodal sensory experiences during training.  

4) The paper shows that simply scaling up model size, training data, or using reasoning techniques does not substantially improve performance on the H-Test. This suggests sensory understanding of language requires different methods beyond standard language modeling approaches.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and empirical demonstration of the H-Test benchmark to reveal and categorize aspects of linguistic comprehension that remain challenging for current LLMs due to the absence of perceptual experiences in their training.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Large language models (LLMs) - The paper focuses on analyzing and critiquing the capabilities of large language models like ChatGPT that are trained on vast amounts of text data. 

- Sensory deprivation - A key concept is the idea that LLMs experience a form of "sensory deprivation" during training since they only have access to textual data, lacking the rich multimodal inputs humans integrate.

- Diegetic vs supradiegetic information - The paper draws on concepts from film theory to distinguish between propositional, semantic information (diegetic) and the physical form of language (supradiegetic). It argues LLMs may struggle with supradiegetic aspects involving stylistic and sensory comprehension.

- Thought experiment of Mary - The paper references the classic philosophical thought experiment about Mary who gains new knowledge upon experiencing color vision, using this idea as an analogy for the sensory limitations of LLMs.

- H-Test - The paper introduces a suite of tasks called the H-Test to evaluate LLMs' capacity to understand visual, auditory and physical aspects of language they lack direct experience of.

- Blind spots - A key hypothesis is these sensory-perceptual capabilities represent inherent "blind spots" for LLMs trained solely on text, highlighting gaps in their linguistic knowledge.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that current LLMs have "blind spots" in comprehending certain sensory and perceptual aspects of language. What specific limitations of the training methodology and architecture of LLMs lead to these blind spots? How might these be addressed?

2. The H-Test benchmark is used to evaluate the capacity of LLMs to understand orthographic, visual, and auditory components of language. In what ways could the H-Test be expanded or adapted to provide a more comprehensive assessment of an LLM's perceptual capabilities? 

3. The concept of "diegetic" vs "supradiegetic" information from language is introduced. What are some examples of linguistic concepts that would fall into each category? Are there alternative frameworks for categorizing information that might align better with an LLM's capabilities?

4. The paper draws an analogy between the thought experiment of Mary's room and the training of LLMs on text corpora alone. What are the limitations of this analogy? In what ways does an LLM's understanding fundamentally differ from human comprehension?  

5. The authors attempt to explain the performance improvement from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 but fail to fully account for it. What hypotheses might better explain this increase in capability on the H-Test? How could these be tested?

6. The lack of strong improvement on the H-Test from simply scaling up LLMs or adding more data is noteworthy. What architectural innovations could enable LLMs to acquire the multimodal comprehension skills assessed in this benchmark?

7. The CoT prompting technique is found to decrease model performance on the H-Test. Why might explicit reasoning fail to capture the sensory-perceptual aspects tested in these tasks? How do humans solve such tasks differently?  

8. In what ways are the A/B classification tasks in the H-Test limited in their capacity to evaluate the full spectrum of multimodal language understanding? What other task designs could supplement this assessment?

9. The paper argues LLMs have an incomplete understanding of language due to their sensory deprivation. Could complete language understanding be achieved through alternate pathways not dependent on human-like sensory experiences?

10. The authors note several philosophical motivations for exploring the sensory gap in LLM comprehension. What ethical implications arise from the "blind spots" observed in LLMs through experiments like the H-Test?
