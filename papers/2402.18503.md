# [Detection of Micromobility Vehicles in Urban Traffic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18503)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of detecting micromobility vehicles (MMVs) like e-scooters, bicycles, and skateboards in urban traffic environments. Detecting these small vehicles is challenging due to their size, movements, potential for occlusions, and motion blur. Robust detection of MMVs is critical for ensuring safety and efficient transportation systems.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel model called FGFA-YOLOX that combines the accuracy of single-frame detection models like YOLOX with the temporal coherence of video object detection methods like Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation (FGFA). Specifically, FGFA-YOLOX enhances YOLOX by aggregating and aligning feature maps from neighboring frames using optical flow. This brings in temporal context to aid YOLOX in detection.

Main Contributions:
1) A new detection model FGFA-YOLOX that fuses single-frame detection with video object detection to reliably detect MMVs in complex urban scenes.

2) A new dataset called PolyMMV containing annotated MMV data from real-world urban videos. This facilitates further research.

3) Extensive experiments demonstrating FGFA-YOLOX achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. The model handles challenges like occlusions, motion blur and improves temporal consistency.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in advancing MMV detection for urban transportation safety. FGFA-YOLOX sets a new state-of-the-art by synergizing between single and multi-frame detection strategies. The new dataset also enables further research in this emerging area.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a video object detection model called FGFA-YOLOX that combines single-frame YOLOX detection with multi-frame feature aggregation for improved detection of micromobility vehicles in complex urban traffic environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. Proposing a novel video object detection architecture, FGFA-YOLOX, that is adapted for micromobility vehicle (MMV) detection. This model combines the strengths of single-frame object detection (accuracy and speed of YOLOX) with the richer feature representation of video object detectors (through flow-guided feature aggregation).

2. Constructing a new dataset, PolyMMV, focused on micromobility scenarios to evaluate MMV detection methods. This dataset, along with source code and model weights, is made publicly available to ensure reproducibility and promote further research.

So in summary, the key innovations presented are an adapted object detection model tailored for detecting small and thin vehicles in video, alongside a custom benchmark dataset to rigorously validate performance. The fusion of single-frame and video object detection methodologies allows enhanced understanding of urban mobility patterns. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of considering spatio-temporal information for reliably detecting micromobility vehicles in complex real-world conditions.
