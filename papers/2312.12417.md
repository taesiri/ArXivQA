# [Device Scheduling for Relay-assisted Over-the-Air Aggregation in   Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12417)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) allows edge devices to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model while keeping data decentralized. However, scaling up the number of devices in FL is challenging due to limited communication resources and power constraints of edge devices. 

- Over-the-air computation (AirComp) can aggregate signals directly over the air to improve communication efficiency but suffers from noise and channel distortions, especially from devices with poor channel conditions (stragglers).

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a relay-assisted FL system where some devices transmit gradients directly to the parameter server (PS) and some devices transmit via a relay. A joint device scheduling and power control algorithm is developed.

- Devices are scheduled to maximize number of participating devices under power and distortion constraints. Transmit power is optimized for direct and relayed devices.

- A priority metric ranks devices by available power and channel conditions. Devices are iteratively added to relayed set based on priority until power constraints are violated.

- For each relayed set, optimal power allocation minimizes number of direct devices violating power constraint, maximizing participation.

Main Contributions:
- Novel relay-assisted FL architecture with a joint scheduling and power control algorithm to maximize device participation under power and distortion constraints.

- Devices scheduled based on available power, channel conditions and relay constraints using an iterative greedy algorithm.

- Dynamic power setting allows unused power to accumulate over rounds, increasing participation in later rounds.

- Significant performance gains demonstrated over benchmark schemes in terms of number of scheduled devices and final model accuracy, especially for increasing number of devices.

In summary, the paper provides an efficient relay-assisted FL system with an intelligent device scheduler to maximize device participation for improving model accuracy.
