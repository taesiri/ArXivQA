# [Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03006)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to develop and improve diffusion models for discrete data like text and images. The key hypothesis is that by designing discrete corruption processes that add more structure beyond uniform transitions, the authors can significantly improve the performance of discrete diffusion models (D3PMs) on tasks like text generation and image generation.

The paper introduces several new D3PM variants that use structured transition matrices, including:

- D3PM with an absorbing "mask" state, inspired by masked language models like BERT. 

- D3PM with transitions based on nearest neighbors in a learned embedding space for text data.

- D3PM with transitions modeled on a discretized Gaussian to capture local structure in images.

The central hypothesis is that by designing the transition matrices of the forward diffusion process to incorporate relevant structure and domain knowledge, the reverse diffusion models can be trained more effectively as generative models for text and images. The paper aims to demonstrate that these structured D3PMs can improve over previous discrete diffusion models with uniform transitions, and can even exceed the performance of continuous diffusion models on tasks like image generation. The experiments and results are intended to validate the hypothesis that structure in the discrete transitions helps diffusion models for various kinds of discrete data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), a class of generative models for discrete data that generalizes previous work on discrete diffusion models. The key ideas are:

- Defining a flexible framework for discrete diffusion models that allows specifying different Markov transition matrices to control the discrete corruption process. This is in contrast to previous work that mainly used uniform or binary corruption processes. 

- Proposing several structured transition matrices tailored to text and image data, including matrices based on token embeddings, discretized Gaussians, and absorbing states.

- Achieving strong empirical results, outperforming baselines and in some cases competing with or exceeding continuous diffusion models, for text generation on character and word levels and image generation on CIFAR-10.

- Introducing a new training loss that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy term, which improves sample quality.

- Drawing connections between discrete diffusion and models like BERT, autoregressive models, and mask-based generative models.

Overall, the work demonstrates the potential of discrete diffusion models and how carefully designing the discrete corruption process can lead to improved results over previous approaches. The flexible framework enables incorporating useful structure and inductive biases for different data types.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), a class of generative models for discrete data such as text and images. Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related work:

- Most prior work on diffusion models has focused on continuous state spaces like images and audio. This paper demonstrates diffusion models can work well directly on discrete data like text without needing to embed in a continuous space.

- The paper shows how the framework of D3PMs allows flexibly defining different discrete corruption processes (the diffusion process) beyond just uniform noise, unlike previous discrete diffusion models. This includes diffusion processes based on token similarity for text, and locality for images.

- For text generation, D3PMs achieve strong results compared to other non-autoregressive baselines, almost matching a comparable autoregressive Transformer model on a large text dataset using only 10 steps. This demonstrates the potential of discrete diffusion for text.

- For image generation, D3PMs approach or exceed the performance of previous continuous diffusion models in log-likelihoods and sample quality on CIFAR-10. This is a surprising result showing discrete diffusion can compete with strong continuous models.

- The paper draws connections between D3PMs and models like BERT, autoregressive models, and mask-based generative models. It shows these can be viewed as special cases of D3PMs, unifying them within the diffusion framework.

- Compared to the state-of-the-art, D3PMs are still outperformed by large autoregressive models for text and some continuous diffusion models for images. But the flexibility of the framework provides many opportunities for improvements.

Overall, the paper makes both technical and conceptual contributions in extending diffusion models to discrete data in a principled and flexible way. The results demonstrate discrete diffusion models are a promising approach compared to existing generative models for text and images.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several promising future research directions:

- Further improving discrete diffusion models by incorporating advances from continuous diffusion models, such as alternative losses like the reweighted objective from DDPM or the resampled variational bound from i-DDPM. Also optimizing hyperparameters like number of timesteps and noise schedules.

- Exploring a wider range of structured discrete corruption processes that embed additional domain knowledge, beyond the ones presented in this paper. The flexibility to design the transition matrices is a key advantage of the D3PM framework.

- Evaluating generative models on a more diverse set of metrics beyond IS/FID/NLL, which may not fully reflect performance across different use cases and populations. 

- Applying discrete diffusion models to other domains beyond images and text, such as graphs, 3D shapes, chemistry, etc. The ability to embed structure into the corruption process could be quite useful.

- Further improving scaling properties of discrete diffusion models to even larger state spaces and sequence lengths.

- Connecting discrete diffusion models to related approaches like denoising autoencoders and iterative refinement/insertion-deletion models. Leveraging these connections could lead to improvements.

In summary, the key future directions are: improving performance via advances from continuous diffusion, designing better structured corruption processes, evaluating on more diverse metrics, applying to new domains, improving scaling, and building connections to related approaches. The flexibility of discrete diffusion makes it a promising framework for further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), a class of generative models for discrete data that generalizes previous work on diffusion models for categorical variables. The key idea is to define more structured transition matrices for the diffusion process that gradually corrupts the data, beyond previous approaches that used uniform transitions. This includes matrices based on Gaussian kernels, nearest neighbors in embedding space, and those with absorbing states. Experiments show that these structured transitions significantly improve results on text and image datasets compared to uniform transitions, with the absorbing state models excelling on text and the Gaussian-inspired transitions doing best for images. The paper also draws connections between D3PMs and models like BERT, autoregressive models, and mask-based generative models. Overall, D3PMs are shown to be a flexible framework for discrete data generation that can incorporate useful structure and inductive biases.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), a new class of generative models for discrete data like text and images. D3PMs are based on diffusion models, which gradually corrupt data over multiple steps into noise, and then train a reverse process to recover the original data. The key innovation is defining structured corruption processes that transition preferentially between similar discrete states, instead of corrupting data uniformly at random. For text, the authors design a diffusion process based on token similarity in an embedding space. For images, they use a discretization of a Gaussian kernel to corrupt more locally. They also explore a corruption process with an absorbing "mask" state, drawing connections to BERT and masked language models. These choices of structured corruption processes significantly improve results on text and image datasets over previous discrete diffusion models. The authors demonstrate strong performance on CIFAR-10 generation and character-level text modeling, approaching or exceeding comparable continuous diffusion models. They also successfully scale these discrete diffusion models to large vocabularies for text generation. Overall, this work expands the applicability of diffusion models to discrete data by introducing more flexible corruption processes.

In summary, this paper introduces a new class of generative models called D3PMs that apply diffusion modeling techniques to discrete data like text and images. By designing structured corruption processes that transition preferentially between similar states, D3PMs significantly improve on previous discrete diffusion models. The authors demonstrate strong experimental results, highlighting the benefits of designing corruption processes adapted to the structure of different discrete data types. This expands the reach of diffusion models to new modalities of data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), a class of generative models for discrete data that builds on diffusion probabilistic models. D3PMs define a forward Markov chain that gradually corrupts data into noise, along with a reverse Markov chain that is trained to denoise the latent variables back towards the data distribution. A key contribution is going beyond previous diffusion models that use uniform transition probabilities, by designing structured transition matrices that allow domain knowledge to be incorporated into the corruption process. For text, the authors use similarities between token embeddings to enable gradual corruption. For images, they design a diffusion process that corrupts preferentially to more similar states, mimicking continuity. The paper demonstrates improved performance on text and image generation tasks using these structured diffusion models compared to simpler uniform diffusion baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing two main issues:

1. Diffusion models have shown impressive results for image and waveform generation in continuous state spaces, but have not been extensively explored for discrete data like text or quantized images. The authors aim to develop and improve diffusion models for these discrete domains.

2. Prior work on discrete diffusion models has mainly used simple uniform transition probabilities during the corruption process. The authors propose using more structured transition matrices that incorporate domain knowledge about the relationships between discrete states. This provides more control over the corruption and denoising process.

Specifically, the paper introduces Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), which are diffusion models adapted for categorical/discrete data. The key contributions are:

- Proposing several structured transition matrices for corrupting data in the forward diffusion process, including matrices based on token embeddings for text and discretized Gaussians for images. 

- Introducing a loss function that combines the standard variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy term, which improves sample quality.

- Demonstrating strong empirical performance on character-level text modeling and image modeling on CIFAR-10. The discrete diffusion models actually exceed the performance of continuous diffusion models on CIFAR-10 in terms of log-likelihoods.

- Drawing connections between D3PMs and models like BERT and autoregressive models.

Overall, the paper shows discrete diffusion can be a highly effective generative modeling approach when structure is built into the corruption process, with competitive results on text and image tasks.
