# Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to develop and improve diffusion models for discrete data like text and images. The key hypothesis is that by designing discrete corruption processes that add more structure beyond uniform transitions, the authors can significantly improve the performance of discrete diffusion models (D3PMs) on tasks like text generation and image generation.The paper introduces several new D3PM variants that use structured transition matrices, including:- D3PM with an absorbing "mask" state, inspired by masked language models like BERT. - D3PM with transitions based on nearest neighbors in a learned embedding space for text data.- D3PM with transitions modeled on a discretized Gaussian to capture local structure in images.The central hypothesis is that by designing the transition matrices of the forward diffusion process to incorporate relevant structure and domain knowledge, the reverse diffusion models can be trained more effectively as generative models for text and images. The paper aims to demonstrate that these structured D3PMs can improve over previous discrete diffusion models with uniform transitions, and can even exceed the performance of continuous diffusion models on tasks like image generation. The experiments and results are intended to validate the hypothesis that structure in the discrete transitions helps diffusion models for various kinds of discrete data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), a class of generative models for discrete data that generalizes previous work on discrete diffusion models. The key ideas are:- Defining a flexible framework for discrete diffusion models that allows specifying different Markov transition matrices to control the discrete corruption process. This is in contrast to previous work that mainly used uniform or binary corruption processes. - Proposing several structured transition matrices tailored to text and image data, including matrices based on token embeddings, discretized Gaussians, and absorbing states.- Achieving strong empirical results, outperforming baselines and in some cases competing with or exceeding continuous diffusion models, for text generation on character and word levels and image generation on CIFAR-10.- Introducing a new training loss that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy term, which improves sample quality.- Drawing connections between discrete diffusion and models like BERT, autoregressive models, and mask-based generative models.Overall, the work demonstrates the potential of discrete diffusion models and how carefully designing the discrete corruption process can lead to improved results over previous approaches. The flexible framework enables incorporating useful structure and inductive biases for different data types.
