# Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to develop and improve diffusion models for discrete data like text and images. The key hypothesis is that by designing discrete corruption processes that add more structure beyond uniform transitions, the authors can significantly improve the performance of discrete diffusion models (D3PMs) on tasks like text generation and image generation.The paper introduces several new D3PM variants that use structured transition matrices, including:- D3PM with an absorbing "mask" state, inspired by masked language models like BERT. - D3PM with transitions based on nearest neighbors in a learned embedding space for text data.- D3PM with transitions modeled on a discretized Gaussian to capture local structure in images.The central hypothesis is that by designing the transition matrices of the forward diffusion process to incorporate relevant structure and domain knowledge, the reverse diffusion models can be trained more effectively as generative models for text and images. The paper aims to demonstrate that these structured D3PMs can improve over previous discrete diffusion models with uniform transitions, and can even exceed the performance of continuous diffusion models on tasks like image generation. The experiments and results are intended to validate the hypothesis that structure in the discrete transitions helps diffusion models for various kinds of discrete data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), a class of generative models for discrete data that generalizes previous work on discrete diffusion models. The key ideas are:- Defining a flexible framework for discrete diffusion models that allows specifying different Markov transition matrices to control the discrete corruption process. This is in contrast to previous work that mainly used uniform or binary corruption processes. - Proposing several structured transition matrices tailored to text and image data, including matrices based on token embeddings, discretized Gaussians, and absorbing states.- Achieving strong empirical results, outperforming baselines and in some cases competing with or exceeding continuous diffusion models, for text generation on character and word levels and image generation on CIFAR-10.- Introducing a new training loss that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy term, which improves sample quality.- Drawing connections between discrete diffusion and models like BERT, autoregressive models, and mask-based generative models.Overall, the work demonstrates the potential of discrete diffusion models and how carefully designing the discrete corruption process can lead to improved results over previous approaches. The flexible framework enables incorporating useful structure and inductive biases for different data types.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper introduces Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), a class of generative models for discrete data such as text and images. Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related work:- Most prior work on diffusion models has focused on continuous state spaces like images and audio. This paper demonstrates diffusion models can work well directly on discrete data like text without needing to embed in a continuous space.- The paper shows how the framework of D3PMs allows flexibly defining different discrete corruption processes (the diffusion process) beyond just uniform noise, unlike previous discrete diffusion models. This includes diffusion processes based on token similarity for text, and locality for images.- For text generation, D3PMs achieve strong results compared to other non-autoregressive baselines, almost matching a comparable autoregressive Transformer model on a large text dataset using only 10 steps. This demonstrates the potential of discrete diffusion for text.- For image generation, D3PMs approach or exceed the performance of previous continuous diffusion models in log-likelihoods and sample quality on CIFAR-10. This is a surprising result showing discrete diffusion can compete with strong continuous models.- The paper draws connections between D3PMs and models like BERT, autoregressive models, and mask-based generative models. It shows these can be viewed as special cases of D3PMs, unifying them within the diffusion framework.- Compared to the state-of-the-art, D3PMs are still outperformed by large autoregressive models for text and some continuous diffusion models for images. But the flexibility of the framework provides many opportunities for improvements.Overall, the paper makes both technical and conceptual contributions in extending diffusion models to discrete data in a principled and flexible way. The results demonstrate discrete diffusion models are a promising approach compared to existing generative models for text and images.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several promising future research directions:- Further improving discrete diffusion models by incorporating advances from continuous diffusion models, such as alternative losses like the reweighted objective from DDPM or the resampled variational bound from i-DDPM. Also optimizing hyperparameters like number of timesteps and noise schedules.- Exploring a wider range of structured discrete corruption processes that embed additional domain knowledge, beyond the ones presented in this paper. The flexibility to design the transition matrices is a key advantage of the D3PM framework.- Evaluating generative models on a more diverse set of metrics beyond IS/FID/NLL, which may not fully reflect performance across different use cases and populations. - Applying discrete diffusion models to other domains beyond images and text, such as graphs, 3D shapes, chemistry, etc. The ability to embed structure into the corruption process could be quite useful.- Further improving scaling properties of discrete diffusion models to even larger state spaces and sequence lengths.- Connecting discrete diffusion models to related approaches like denoising autoencoders and iterative refinement/insertion-deletion models. Leveraging these connections could lead to improvements.In summary, the key future directions are: improving performance via advances from continuous diffusion, designing better structured corruption processes, evaluating on more diverse metrics, applying to new domains, improving scaling, and building connections to related approaches. The flexibility of discrete diffusion makes it a promising framework for further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), a class of generative models for discrete data that generalizes previous work on diffusion models for categorical variables. The key idea is to define more structured transition matrices for the diffusion process that gradually corrupts the data, beyond previous approaches that used uniform transitions. This includes matrices based on Gaussian kernels, nearest neighbors in embedding space, and those with absorbing states. Experiments show that these structured transitions significantly improve results on text and image datasets compared to uniform transitions, with the absorbing state models excelling on text and the Gaussian-inspired transitions doing best for images. The paper also draws connections between D3PMs and models like BERT, autoregressive models, and mask-based generative models. Overall, D3PMs are shown to be a flexible framework for discrete data generation that can incorporate useful structure and inductive biases.
