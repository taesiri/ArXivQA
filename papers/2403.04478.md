# [Improved Focus on Hard Samples for Lung Nodule Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04478)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Lung cancer is a serious threat and early diagnosis using CT images can reduce mortality. However, manually examining CT images is challenging.  
- Existing CNN-based lung nodule detection methods have difficulties detecting hard nodules (small size, variable shapes, adhered to tissues).  
- Only few public lung datasets are available and lung nodules are harder to detect than objects in natural images.

Proposed Solution:
- Improve feature extraction and training strategy to enhance model's focus on hard nodules.
- Introduce deformable convolution to adjust receptive fields and better cover nodule regions.
- Apply self-paced learning strategy to simulate radiologist's learning process - first learn easy samples, then gradually focus on hard samples.

Main Contributions:
- Propose deformable dense block (DDB) based on deformable conv to enhance network's focus on nodule regions.
- Apply self-paced learning strategy to focus model on hard nodule samples during training.  
- Achieve 0.934 CPM score on LUNA16 dataset, improving over baseline TSCNN (0.925 CPM) and other CNN methods.
- Show deformable convolution and self-paced learning are effective for improving detection of hard lung nodules in CT images with few available datasets.

In summary, the key ideas are to improve feature extraction and training strategy to better focus on hard nodule areas and samples. The techniques help deal with key challenges in lung nodule detection using CT images.
