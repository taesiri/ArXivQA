# [Scope is all you need: Transforming LLMs for HPC Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09440)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis seems to be:

Can smaller, domain-specific language models perform better than larger, general-purpose language models on specialized tasks? 

Specifically, the authors question whether large language models pre-trained on multiple programming languages unrelated to HPC are necessary for good performance on HPC-specific tasks. They hypothesize that smaller models trained only on HPC languages and codebases would be more efficient and achieve superior results. 

To test this, they propose a novel tokenizer called Tokompiler tailored to HPC code structure and syntax. They apply Tokompiler to pre-train two state-of-the-art models on a Fortran code corpus and evaluate against models using conventional tokenization. 

The key hypothesis is that their specialized tokenizer will enable smaller, domain-specific models to outperform larger general models that have not been optimized for HPC tasks and languages. The perplexity experiments seem intended to validate whether their Tokompiler tokenizer allows more efficient training and improved representation of HPC code for downstream applications.

In summary, the central research question is whether smaller, domain-specific models can surpass larger, general models on specialized HPC tasks when equipped with a tailored tokenizer like Tokompiler that is designed to capture HPC structure and semantics. The authors hypothesize this will be the case.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel tokenizer called Tokompiler that is designed specifically for preprocessing code for language model pre-training targeting HPC tasks. The key ideas behind Tokompiler are:

- Anonymizing variable names, numbers, and strings in the code to avoid learning misleading human semantics. 

- Generating language-oriented tokens based on abstract syntax tree (AST) parsing to better capture code structure and context.

- Incorporating techniques like token splitting and random number attachment to reduce reliance on specific token replacements.

The paper shows through perplexity evaluations that integrating Tokompiler with existing models like PolyCoder and SPT-Code significantly improves their ability to comprehend Fortran code structure and semantics. The smaller vocabulary size also speeds up training time. 

Overall, the paper demonstrates the potential of designing specialized tokenizers like Tokompiler to transform language models for improved performance on domain-specific tasks like HPC code completion and optimization. It opens up future work on developing domain-specific LLMs catering to unique demands of HPC compared to using large generic pre-trained models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on applying language models to high-performance computing code:

- The paper focuses specifically on developing a domain-specific language model for HPC, rather than taking a general pretrained language model and fine-tuning it on HPC code. This idea of creating smaller, domain-specific LLMs is novel compared to most prior work.

- The proposed tokenizer Tokompiler is designed particularly for HPC and aims to capture structural and language syntax while ignoring misleading human semantics like variable names. This differs from tokenizers in other code LLMs that retain more human semantics.

- The authors question the need for large, general purpose LLMs for HPC and argue smaller, domain-focused models may be more efficient. They aim to re-evaluate each design choice in existing LLMs. This direction of smaller domain models contrasts the trend toward ever-larger models.

- The paper demonstrates significant perplexity improvements from using Tokompiler to tokenize code for pretrained models like SPT-Code and PolyCoder. Most prior work has used standard BPE tokenization so this shows the impact of a domain-specific tokenizer.

- The focus is specifically on high-performance computing languages like Fortran, whereas most code LLMs target more general programming languages. There is less prior work tailored for HPC code.

- The paper does not evaluate on downstream tasks yet, whereas most existing papers demonstrate performance on tasks like code generation. But perplexityimprovement suggests potential gains on tasks.

In summary, the novel contributions are the domain-specific design, specialized tokenizer for HPC, questioning of general LLM needs, and demonstration of perplexity gains on HPC code. The approach contrasts the trend of larger multipurpose models in much existing research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying Tokompiler to C and C++ corpora and integrating more code representations like data-flow graphs (DFG) and intermediate representation (IR) to enhance the model's understanding of code structure and behavior. 

- Fine-tuning the Tokompiler pre-trained models on downstream HPC tasks like OpenMP pragma generation and MPI domain decomposition to evaluate their performance.

- Evaluating the benefits of Tokompiler on larger and more complex HPC codebases beyond the GitHub corpus used in this work.

- Exploring the use of Tokompiler for other parallel programming APIs like OpenACC, CUDA, SYCL etc. beyond just OpenMP and MPI.

- Investigating the interpretability and explainability of code generated by Tokompiler empowered models, which is important for user trust and validation.

- Comparing Tokompiler with other HPC-specific tokenization methods to further optimize it for HPC tasks.

- Developing additional domain-specific LLMs using the Tokompiler approach for other specialized domains beyond HPC.

- Continuing to re-evaluate and optimize each design choice made in existing LLMs to build efficient and performant models tailored for HPC.

In summary, the key future work is centered on extending and evaluating Tokompiler more thoroughly, using it to build domain-specific LLMs for HPC and other domains, and further rethinking LLM designs for HPC-oriented tasks.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel tokenization method called Tokompiler that is designed specifically for preprocessing code for language model pre-training on high-performance computing (HPC) tasks. Tokompiler involves anonymizing variable names, numbers, and strings in the code, then generating language-oriented tokens based on abstract syntax tree (AST) parsing of the anonymized code. It also incorporates token splitting to break down multi-part tokens like variable names, and random number attachment to reduce reliance on specific token replacements. Tokompiler enables language models to focus on code structure and context without memorizing misleading human semantics like variable names. It provides improved generalization and code completion accuracy compared to traditional tokenizers, while still allowing semantics to be restored for interpretability. The method is evaluated by integrating it with Polycoder and SPT-Code models and measuring perplexity on a Fortran code corpus, showing significantly reduced perplexity.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem or question being addressed is:

How can we develop more efficient and effective language models tailored specifically for high-performance computing (HPC) code tasks? 

The paper points out that existing large language models (LLMs) applied to HPC are very large, computationally expensive to train, and often pretrained on unrelated programming languages and natural languages. This seems counterintuitive when the goal is an LLM optimized for HPC-specific tasks.

To address this, the paper proposes developing smaller "domain-specific LLMs" focused specifically on languages and tasks relevant to HPC. As a first step, they present a new tokenization method called Tokompiler designed specifically for preprocessing code for HPC and compilation tasks.

So in summary, the core question is how to create smaller, more efficient, and more specialized LLMs for HPC rather than rely on general-purpose LLMs that are unnecessarily large and broad. The Tokompiler tokenizer is presented as an initial approach to transform LLMs for improved performance on HPC code tasks.
