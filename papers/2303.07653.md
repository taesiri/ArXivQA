# [NEF: Neural Edge Fields for 3D Parametric Curve Reconstruction from   Multi-view Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07653)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we reconstruct 3D parametric curves representing the geometric shape of an object using only 2D edge maps from multi-view images? The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing a self-supervised pipeline to learn a neural implicit field (called Neural Edge Field or NEF) to represent the 3D edge density distribution purely from 2D edge maps of multi-view images. - Designing NEF training losses (W-MSE, consistency, sparsity) to deal with challenges in learning from sparse and inconsistent 2D edge maps across views.- Extracting 3D edge points from the optimized NEF and further reconstructing parametric curves through a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy.- Providing technical designs to learn a range-limited, view-independent NEF and iteratively fit curves with endpoint regularization.- Introducing a new benchmark dataset and showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods that take 3D point clouds as input.In summary, the key hypothesis is that 3D parametric curves can be effectively reconstructed in a self-supervised manner through intermediate representation learning of NEF purely from 2D edge maps of multi-view images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel self-supervised method for 3D parametric curve reconstruction from multi-view images. The key ideas are:- Learning a neural implicit field called Neural Edge Field (NEF) to represent the 3D edge density of an object using only 2D edge maps from images as supervision. This avoids the need for 3D labels or correspondence. - Several technical designs to ensure learning a range-limited, view-independent NEF that can robustly extract 3D edges, including using an edge density map, weighted loss, and consistency loss.- An iterative coarse-to-fine optimization strategy to fit parametric curves to the extracted 3D edge points from NEF. It first fits lines greedily, then upgrades to BÃ©zier curves with endpoint connection.- A new benchmark dataset called ABC-NEF with 115 CAD models for evaluating 3D curve extraction methods. Experiments show the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods that use 3D point clouds as input.In summary, the key contribution is a novel self-supervised pipeline to reconstruct 3D parametric curves from only 2D edge maps, by learning an intermediate NEF representation. It shows potential for leveraging 2D supervision and multi-view images for 3D geometric tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a method to reconstruct 3D parametric curves representing geometric edges from multi-view images by learning a neural implicit field (Neural Edge Field) for edge density prediction and optimizing cubic Bezier curve fitting in a coarse-to-fine manner; experiments on a synthetic dataset of CAD models show the method outperforms existing state-of-the-art curve reconstruction techniques that take point clouds as input.
