# [NEF: Neural Edge Fields for 3D Parametric Curve Reconstruction from   Multi-view Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07653)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we reconstruct 3D parametric curves representing the geometric shape of an object using only 2D edge maps from multi-view images? The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing a self-supervised pipeline to learn a neural implicit field (called Neural Edge Field or NEF) to represent the 3D edge density distribution purely from 2D edge maps of multi-view images. - Designing NEF training losses (W-MSE, consistency, sparsity) to deal with challenges in learning from sparse and inconsistent 2D edge maps across views.- Extracting 3D edge points from the optimized NEF and further reconstructing parametric curves through a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy.- Providing technical designs to learn a range-limited, view-independent NEF and iteratively fit curves with endpoint regularization.- Introducing a new benchmark dataset and showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods that take 3D point clouds as input.In summary, the key hypothesis is that 3D parametric curves can be effectively reconstructed in a self-supervised manner through intermediate representation learning of NEF purely from 2D edge maps of multi-view images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel self-supervised method for 3D parametric curve reconstruction from multi-view images. The key ideas are:- Learning a neural implicit field called Neural Edge Field (NEF) to represent the 3D edge density of an object using only 2D edge maps from images as supervision. This avoids the need for 3D labels or correspondence. - Several technical designs to ensure learning a range-limited, view-independent NEF that can robustly extract 3D edges, including using an edge density map, weighted loss, and consistency loss.- An iterative coarse-to-fine optimization strategy to fit parametric curves to the extracted 3D edge points from NEF. It first fits lines greedily, then upgrades to Bézier curves with endpoint connection.- A new benchmark dataset called ABC-NEF with 115 CAD models for evaluating 3D curve extraction methods. Experiments show the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods that use 3D point clouds as input.In summary, the key contribution is a novel self-supervised pipeline to reconstruct 3D parametric curves from only 2D edge maps, by learning an intermediate NEF representation. It shows potential for leveraging 2D supervision and multi-view images for 3D geometric tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a method to reconstruct 3D parametric curves representing geometric edges from multi-view images by learning a neural implicit field (Neural Edge Field) for edge density prediction and optimizing cubic Bezier curve fitting in a coarse-to-fine manner; experiments on a synthetic dataset of CAD models show the method outperforms existing state-of-the-art curve reconstruction techniques that take point clouds as input.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on 3D parametric curve reconstruction:- The paper proposes a novel self-supervised approach using only 2D image edge maps as input to reconstruct 3D parametric curves. Most prior works require 3D inputs like point clouds or meshes. Using just images makes the method more widely applicable.- The core idea is to learn an implicit neural representation called Neural Edge Fields (NEF) to model the 3D edge density distribution. This is inspired by recent neural radiance fields like NeRF, but focused specifically on edges rather than view synthesis. - To train the NEF, the paper introduces several technical innovations to deal with challenges of sparse edges and view inconsistencies in 2D. This includes weighted losses and consistency regularization tailored for edges.- For curve reconstruction, the paper takes a coarse-to-fine optimization approach to fit parametric curves to the NEF edge points. This involves iterative line fitting and upgrading to Bezier curves with endpoint regularization.- Experiments demonstrate superior performance to prior state-of-the-art methods PIE-Net, PC2WF, and DEF on a range of metrics, despite using only images rather than 3D data. The self-supervised approach also shows more robustness.- Limitations include slower training time compared to NeRF and difficulties handling textured objects or internal edges. But the image-based approach has strong potential for generalization.Overall, this paper presents a novel learning-based solution for a challenging 3D vision problem using images alone. The NEF representation and tailored training objectives offer unique advantages over prior work. If the limitations can be addressed, the methodology could enable more practical 3D curve reconstruction from images.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Improving the training speed of the Neural Edge Fields (NEF). They mention reducing the number of views or integrating other voxel-based NeRF methods as possible ways to accelerate training.- Handling textured objects better. The 2D edge maps can be noisy for textured objects, so they suggest improving classification of texture vs. geometric edges in images and recognizing texture edges in the NEF. - Reconstructing internal edges. Currently the method is limited to external visible edges. The authors suggest incorporating 3D cues like point clouds or shape priors could help recover internal edges.- Simplifying the network architecture. The authors mention the current network architecture could potentially be optimized to be more efficient.- Generalizing to real-world scenes. The paper shows some initial real-world results, but more investigation is needed for robust performance on real images with inaccurate camera poses.- Applications beyond CAD models. While the method was demonstrated on CAD models, exploring how it could generalize to more varied real-world shapes and objects is an area for future work.- Combining with other 3D representations. The authors suggest integrating the extracted curves with other 3D representations like meshes or point clouds could be worthwhile to explore.So in summary, the main directions are improving efficiency, robustness to textures/noise, recovering internal structures, generalizing beyond the current domain, and integrating the curves into downstream 3D tasks. The paper lays solid groundwork that can be built upon along these directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method for reconstructing 3D parametric curves representing the prominent edges of an object from a set of calibrated multi-view images. The key idea is to learn a neural implicit field, referred to as a Neural Edge Field (NEF), that encodes the spatial density distribution of the 3D edges. The NEF is optimized using a rendering loss that compares rendered 2D edge maps to ground truth edges from the input images. To extract parametric curves from the NEF, the edge densities are thresholded to obtain 3D edge points which are then fit iteratively using a coarse-to-fine approach, first with lines and then cubic Bézier curves. Experiments on a synthetic dataset of CAD models show the proposed self-supervised method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques that use 3D supervision. The main contributions are a way to learn 3D edges from only 2D edge maps, technical designs to ensure a robust NEF, and an optimization strategy to reconstruct parametric curves from the NEF.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:This paper proposes a new method for 3D parametric curve reconstruction from multi-view images. The method first learns a neural implicit field, called a Neural Edge Field (NEF), to represent the density distribution of 3D edges. The NEF is optimized using a rendering loss that compares rendered 2D edge maps to ground truth edge maps from input images. This allows end-to-end training of the NEF using only 2D supervisions. Several technical innovations are introduced, including a learnable scaling function to map NEF densities to a standardized range, and losses to encourage sparsity and cross-view consistency. After optimizing the NEF, parametric curves are extracted by treating the NEF density as a 3D point cloud and fitting cubic Bezier curves. A coarse-to-fine optimization strategy is used, first fitting straight lines greedily, then upgrading to Bezier curves and refining all curves jointly. Experiments on a dataset of CAD models show the method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods that use 3D point clouds as input. The self-supervised pipeline using only images is more robust and generalizable.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes learning a neural implicit field called a Neural Edge Field (NEF) to represent the density distribution of 3D edges for an object using only 2D edge maps from multi-view images as supervision. The NEF is optimized using a rendering loss like in NeRF, where edge maps rendered from the NEF are compared to ground truth edge maps from images. To handle challenges like sparsity and inconsistency of 2D edges, the paper introduces several technical modifications to the training, including a weighted MSE loss, consistency loss, and sparsity loss. Once the NEF is trained, 3D edge points are extracted by thresholding the edge density field. Finally, parametric curves are fit to the 3D edges through a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy, first fitting lines greedily, then upgrading to Bézier curves and optimizing all control points jointly. Experiments show the self-supervised NEF method outperforms existing supervised methods taking 3D point clouds as input.
