# [DeepCover: Advancing RNN Test Coverage and Online Error Prediction using   State Machine Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06966)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) lack interpretability due to their inherent complexity, posing challenges in understanding their internal decision-making processes. This lack of explainability limits the ability to validate and test RNN models.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a methodology called DeepCover to extract a state machine (SM) representation from a trained RNN model. The extracted SM exposes the internal state transitions of the RNN, providing insights into its logic. 

The key ideas are:

1) Extract SM from RNN using k-means clustering on RNN state vectors to define SM states. This considers the distribution of states and better retains functionality compared to prior gridding approaches.

2) Evaluate extracted SM quality using four proposed metrics: Purity, Richness, Goodness and Scale. Experiments showed the extracted SM achieves higher scores on these metrics compared to prior art.

3) Leverage the SM for:
   a) Defining six coverage criteria to effectively evaluate RNN test suites: New Final State Coverage, Out of Boundary Final State Coverage, etc. Statistical tests validated efficacy of criteria.

   b) Training a tree-based model using SM state features to predict RNN errors during runtime with over 80% AUC. 

Main Contributions:

- K-Means based SM extraction algorithm that defines states based on patterns in PM state distribution

- Four quantitative SM quality metrics: Purity, Richness, Goodness and Scale

- Six SM coverage criteria for evaluating RNN test suites, validated statistically  

- Method to predict RNN errors during runtime by training tree model on SM state features

Overall, the paper advances RNN explainability, testing and monitoring by extracting an interpretable SM representation and leveraging it to provide insights into the RNN's decision-making process.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a methodology for extracting simplified state machine models from recurrent neural networks to enhance their interpretability, enable definition of targeted test coverage criteria, and facilitate real-time error prediction during operation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a K-Means clustering based algorithm to extract a state machine (SM) model from a recurrent neural network (RNN). The algorithm considers the distribution of primary model (PM) states and defines SM states accordingly to improve explainability of the PM.

2. Introducing four metrics to evaluate the quality of extracted SM models: Purity, Richness, Goodness, and Scale. These provide quantitative assessment of how well the SM mimics the functionality of the PM.

3. Defining six coverage criteria focused on specific aspects of the SM to evaluate test suites for the PM: New Final State Coverage, Out of Boundary Final State Coverage, Basic Final State Coverage, Basic/Weighted Label and Final State Coverage, etc. The efficacy of criteria is validated statistically using Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing.

4. Proposing a tree-based model using explainable features from the SM state space to predict potential errors in the PM during runtime with over 80% AUC on experimental datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is using SM extraction to improve RNN explainability, which then enables enhanced testing and monitoring of RNN models through coverage criteria evaluation and online error prediction.
