# [When Prompt-based Incremental Learning Does Not Meet Strong Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10445)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: How can we develop an incremental learning method that does not rely heavily on strong pretraining and can bridge the gap between the pretraining task and unknown future tasks?The key hypotheses/claims seem to be:- Existing prompt-based incremental learning methods rely heavily on strong pretraining (e.g. on ImageNet-21k), which limits their effectiveness when the pretraining task is very different from the incremental learning tasks.- Learning to generate prompts adaptively based on the input, instead of retrieving prompts from a fixed pool, can help reduce the reliance on pretraining and bridge the gap between pretraining and incremental tasks.- Regularizing the prompt generator with a knowledge pool that summarizes class-specific statistics can prevent it from learning ineffective knowledge.- The proposed Adaptive Prompt Generator (APG) with the knowledge pool regularization can enable effective incremental learning without strong pretraining, while still benefiting from pretraining when available.In summary, the main hypothesis is that adaptive prompt generation along with knowledge pool regularization can make prompt-based incremental learning more robust and less reliant on intensive pretraining. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Developing a learnable adaptive prompt generator (APG) to reduce the negative effects of the gap between pretraining tasks and unknown future tasks in incremental learning. The APG can unify prompt retrieval and learning into a single trainable module.- Proposing a knowledge pool to regularize the APG and prevent it from learning ineffective knowledge. The knowledge pool retains class-specific statistics from previous tasks. - Showing that the proposed method significantly outperforms advanced exemplar-free incremental learning methods without pretraining on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets. It also achieves comparable performance to prompt-based methods relying on strong pretraining.- Demonstrating that the method can ease reliance on intensive pretraining for incremental learning. The adaptive prompting scheme appears effective even without strong pretraining, while still benefiting from pretraining if available.- Highlighting an important but overlooked issue in prompt-based incremental learning - the gap between pretraining and future tasks. The work reveals the limitations of existing prompting schemes in this regard.In summary, the key contribution seems to be developing a more flexible and adaptive prompting framework for incremental learning that does not rely heavily on strong pretraining like prior arts. The proposed APG and knowledge pool help bridge the gap between tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a comparison to other related research:- This paper focuses on addressing the issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning for deep neural networks. The key problem it tries to tackle is that existing prompt-based incremental learning methods rely heavily on strong pretraining, which may not generalize well to new tasks with a large domain gap from the pretraining data. - Most prior work on incremental learning has focused on using rehearsal of old data or regularization techniques to mitigate forgetting. Some recent works explore prompt-based methods, but still depend on a fixed pretrained backbone model. - This paper proposes a more flexible adaptive prompting scheme called APG that can learn to generate task-specific prompts on the fly based on the input. This reduces reliance on pretraining and bridges the gap between pretraining and new tasks.- The proposed APG module takes intermediate features as input to generate class-specific prompts in a trainable manner. It maintains an extensible prompt candidate list to aggregate knowledge over time. The method also uses a knowledge pool to regularize APG and prevent ineffective knowledge.- Key differences from prior prompt-based methods:    - Generates prompts dynamically rather than retrieving from fixed pool    - Unifies prompt retrieval and learning into one trainable module    - Uses knowledge pool for regularization    - Does not require strong pretraining- The experiments show solid gains over previous exemplar-free methods without pretraining, and achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art when pretrained weights are used. This demonstrates the flexibility of the approach.- Overall, the adaptive prompting scheme is a novel way to reduce dependence on pretraining for incremental learning. The unified retrieval and learning scheme for prompts is innovative compared to prior work. The results validate its effectiveness on standard benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Unfortunately I cannot provide a meaningful TL;DR for this technical paper since it requires understanding the details of the methods proposed. However, in summary, this paper proposes a new approach called Adaptive Prompt Generation (APG) to improve prompt-based incremental learning methods. The key ideas are:- Existing prompt-based incremental learning methods rely heavily on strong pretrained models and fail when there is a gap between the pretraining task and future tasks. - APG uses a learnable prompt generator instead of fixed prompts, allowing it to adapt prompts over time and reduce the effects of the task gap.- APG maintains a knowledge pool to help regularize and prevent forgetting in the prompt generator and classifier. - Experiments show APG achieves strong performance without pretraining and is comparable to existing methods with strong pretraining.So in one sentence: The paper proposes a learnable prompting scheme called APG to improve incremental learning without relying heavily on pretraining.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Exploring more advanced architectures for the adaptive prompt generator (APG). The paper uses a relatively simple cross-attention mechanism to generate prompts, but they suggest exploring more powerful generative models like autoregressive transformers could improve performance.- Applying the adaptive prompting approach to other incremental learning settings beyond image classification, such as object detection, segmentation, etc. The core idea of adaptive prompting could potentially transfer to other task types.- Exploring adaptive prompting for multimodal and lifelong learning settings. The current method is designed for incremental learning on a single visual modality, but extending it to handle multiple modalities (e.g. vision + audio) or more open-ended lifelong learning scenarios is an interesting direction.- Combining rehearsal-based methods with adaptive prompting. The current approach is exemplar-free, but integrating a memory bank of exemplars could provide additional old task knowledge to further improve prompts.- Evaluating the approach on larger-scale datasets and benchmarks. The experiments focus on smaller datasets like CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, but scaling up to much larger benchmarks would better evaluate the method.- Studying theoretical connections between adaptive prompting and continual/meta learning. The paper suggests analyzing the similarities and differences in terms of minimizing interference between tasks.- Comparing adaptive prompting to regularization-based continual learning methods. Conducting ablation studies to compare with popular regularization techniques like EWC could provide insight into the benefits of adaptive prompting.So in summary, the main directions are improving the prompt generator architecture, applying it to new incremental learning problems and settings, combining it with existing methods like rehearsal, and further theoretical analysis. Evaluating the approach at larger scales is also highlighted as an important future direction.
