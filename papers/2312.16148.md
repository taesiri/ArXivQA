# [The Media Bias Taxonomy: A Systematic Literature Review on the Forms and   Automated Detection of Media Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16148)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Media bias is a complex issue that can significantly impact public perception of events. However, there is no clear taxonomy organizing the different concepts and types of biases that fall under the umbrella term "media bias". Also, recent advancements in computer science methods for automatically detecting media bias have not been systematically reviewed. 

Solution:
The authors propose a novel "Media Bias Taxonomy" that structures media bias into four main categories: linguistic, cognitive, text-level context, and reporting-level. Each category contains several subtypes of biases. This taxonomy helps establish common ground and clarify relationships between different bias concepts studied across disciplines.

The authors also conduct an extensive literature review of computer science techniques for automatically detecting media bias published between 2019-2022. They classify methods into six key groups: traditional NLP, transformer-based ML, non-transformer ML, non-neural network ML, graph-based approaches, and provide an overview of available datasets.

Key Contributions:
- A systematic taxonomy organizing concepts related to media bias based on extensive literature review
- Comprehensive analysis of recent advancements in computational methods for media bias detection 
- Identification of trends such as increased use of transformer models leading to performance gains
- Overview of 123 media bias datasets and their characteristics
- Analysis of relevant psychological literature and discussion of cognitive biases affecting media bias perception
- Identification of promising future directions like integrating psychological insights into datasets and systems to improve automatic detection.

Overall, this review significantly clarifies the media bias landscape, provides valuable insights into the state-of-the-art in detection methods, and lays groundwork facilitating future interdisciplinary advances in this critical area of research.
