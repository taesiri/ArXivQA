# [The Media Bias Taxonomy: A Systematic Literature Review on the Forms and   Automated Detection of Media Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16148)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Media bias is a complex issue that can significantly impact public perception of events. However, there is no clear taxonomy organizing the different concepts and types of biases that fall under the umbrella term "media bias". Also, recent advancements in computer science methods for automatically detecting media bias have not been systematically reviewed. 

Solution:
The authors propose a novel "Media Bias Taxonomy" that structures media bias into four main categories: linguistic, cognitive, text-level context, and reporting-level. Each category contains several subtypes of biases. This taxonomy helps establish common ground and clarify relationships between different bias concepts studied across disciplines.

The authors also conduct an extensive literature review of computer science techniques for automatically detecting media bias published between 2019-2022. They classify methods into six key groups: traditional NLP, transformer-based ML, non-transformer ML, non-neural network ML, graph-based approaches, and provide an overview of available datasets.

Key Contributions:
- A systematic taxonomy organizing concepts related to media bias based on extensive literature review
- Comprehensive analysis of recent advancements in computational methods for media bias detection 
- Identification of trends such as increased use of transformer models leading to performance gains
- Overview of 123 media bias datasets and their characteristics
- Analysis of relevant psychological literature and discussion of cognitive biases affecting media bias perception
- Identification of promising future directions like integrating psychological insights into datasets and systems to improve automatic detection.

Overall, this review significantly clarifies the media bias landscape, provides valuable insights into the state-of-the-art in detection methods, and lays groundwork facilitating future interdisciplinary advances in this critical area of research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper systematically reviews over 3,000 research publications on computer science methods for detecting media bias published between 2019-2022, proposes a novel taxonomy that connects related bias concepts, highlights trends showing transformers have led to performance improvements, and argues for increased interdisciplinarity by integrating insights on bias perception from fields like psychology into datasets and methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

1) A systematic literature review that provides a structured and comprehensive overview of the application of computer science methods for detecting media bias. This includes clarifying and establishing connections among the various concepts employed in the field of media bias.

2) The introduction of a novel "Media Bias Taxonomy" that organizes the different definitions and concepts related to media bias into distinct types. This taxonomy aims to mitigate ambiguity around the various terms used in media bias research.

3) A categorization and summary of computer science contributions to media bias detection into six categories: traditional natural language processing methods, simple non-neural ML techniques, transformer-based and non-transformer-based machine learning, non-neural network based approaches, and graph-based models. 

4) A brief summary of the state-of-the-art psychological research on media bias and how insights from social science and computer science research can benefit each other.

In summary, the main contribution is a systematic literature review that establishes a structure for the media bias domain through the introduction of a novel taxonomy, along with an analysis of trends and promising directions in the automated detection of media bias. The goal is to facilitate future interdisciplinary research between computer science and social sciences.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors categorize computer science methods into traditional NLP, transformer-based ML, non-transformer-based ML, non-neural network ML, and graph-based approaches. Can you explain the key differences between these categories and why the authors chose to structure the methods this way?

2. Transformer-based models have become very popular for media bias detection tasks. What are some of the main advantages of transformers over other ML techniques? And what challenges still remain when applying them to bias detection?

3. The authors highlight that graph-based approaches have unique capabilities for analyzing bias in social networks. What type of bias analysis can graph methods enable that other techniques may struggle with? And what are some examples of how researchers have applied graph methods to bias tasks?  

4. The literature review reveals that recent ML advancements have not yet been fully incorporated across all subtypes of bias. Can you discuss 2-3 major bias subtypes where you think transformers or other advanced ML could be better utilized based on trends in other areas?

5. The authors argue that computer science bias research lacks conceptual work and awareness of cognitive aspects of bias perception. Do you agree? And if so, can you suggest 1-2 ways that computational methods could better incorporate insights from psychology and social science?

6. Media bias datasets often have low annotator agreement, indicating confusion around bias concepts. What are 1-2 ways the authors suggest annotator background and questions could be standardized to improve agreement and quality?  

7. The taxonomy organizes bias into linguistic, cognitive, text-level, reporting-level, and related concepts. Can you choose one category and discuss the 2-3 most significant subtypes of bias it contains?

8. The authors cite recent advancements showing performance gains from multi-task learning across domains. Do you think a multi-task approach could be effective for bias detection? And if so, what tasks and datasets might you explore?

9. The review covers 1996-2022, but mainly focuses on 2019-2022 ML advancements. Do you think the authors should have included more historical methods and datasets? Why or why not?  

10. The authors plan to repeat their analysis in three years. What are 2-3 new trends or methods you predict could significantly advance by then based on the current state of research?
