# [Decentralized Lifelong Path Planning for Multiple Ackerman Car-Like   Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11767)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Path planning for multiple non-holonomic robots (specifically car-like robots with Ackermann steering) in continuous domains is challenging. Efficient and high-quality solutions are lacking, especially in lifelong settings where robots must continuously take on new tasks.

- Existing multi-robot path planning (MRPP) methods work well for robots moving on grids but cannot be directly applied to robots with kinematics constraints. Methods designed for car-like robots lack scalability and success rate guarantees.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes two algorithms - a decentralized algorithm called Priority-inherited Backtracking for Car-like Robots (PBCR) and a centralized algorithm called Enhanced Conflict-based search for Car-like Robots (ECCR).

- Both algorithms rely on using a small set of fixed motion primitives to transition between robot states. These primitives can be combined to form near-optimal paths between start and goal poses. Some local adjustments are then made to form complete trajectories.

- PBCR adapts the prioritization mechanism from the PIBT algorithm for grid-based multi-robot pathfinding. It involves one-step decentralized planning for each robot. 

- ECCR enhances the previous CL-CBS algorithm by using more informed focal search to find lower-cost trajectories. It replans at intervals to work in lifelong settings.

Key Contributions:

- Introduction of a count-based exploration heuristic in PBCR to prevent deadlocks and improve success rates.

- Significantly better scalability and success rate for PBCR compared to prior decentralized methods, with manageable optimality tradeoff.

- Lower-cost trajectories in ECCR relative to CL-CBS owing to more focused search.

- Thorough simulation-based evaluation confirming SOTA performance on metrics like success rate, flowtime, makespan.

- Demonstration of real-world execution of planned trajectories on car-like robots.

In summary, the key contribution is the development of two performant algorithms for path planning of multiple car-like robots in continuous environments, with a particular focus on enabling decentralized planning. Both simulation and real-world validation confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
