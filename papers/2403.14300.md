# [DexDribbler: Learning Dexterous Soccer Manipulation via Dynamic   Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14300)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Learning dexterous manipulation skills that involve coordinating locomotion and manipulating moving objects with legs is very challenging, yet common and useful as seen in animals playing soccer. Prior reinforcement learning methods that purely rely on rewards struggle to learn such skills. Specifically, they fail to perform sharp turns and stops while dribbling a ball on smooth surfaces. 

Method:
The paper proposes a framework to provide high-level dynamic supervision for guiding complex articulation policy learning. A feedback controller estimates necessary body motions based on ball and robot states to achieve desired ball maneuvers. The output body motions are used to shape rewards during training to align the low-level joint motion policy. This enables learning maneuvers like deliberate overshooting to stop a fast rolling ball.

Additionally, a context-aware state estimator network infers environment factors and ball dynamics to facilitate sim-to-real transfer. For real-world deployment, a neural-aided Kalman filter combines ball detections from onboard cameras with estimator network outputs for robust state estimation.

Contributions:
- Integrates model-based supervision within model-free reinforcement learning to guide intricate skills learning.

- Learning framework outperforms prior methods in complex ball manipulation tasks like sharp cuts and turns during dribbling.

- Generalizable for various legged robots and terrains with easy simulator adaptation.

- Enables reliable real-world deployment through context-aware state estimation and sensor fusion for robust ball tracking.

Overall, the paper presents an effective learning pipeline to teach legged robots dynamic object manipulation skills requiring coordination between locomotion and dexterous limb articulations.
