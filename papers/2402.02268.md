## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Federated Learning with New Knowledge: Fundamentals, Advances, and Futures":

Problem:
Federated learning (FL) systems face challenges in dealing with new knowledge, including new features, tasks, models and algorithms. Incorporating such knowledge is important for reducing costs, extending system lifespan, and enabling sustainable development of FL. However, there lacks a systematic analysis on how to incorporate different types of new knowledge into FL.

Solution:
This paper provides a taxonomy and thorough analysis of incorporating new knowledge into FL:

1) New features: Methods like federated domain generalization, out-of-distribution detection and domain adaptation are proposed. They aim to improve model generalization, detect new features, and adapt models to new feature distributions.

2) New tasks: Task-personalized FL and self-supervised FL are discussed. They allow customization and leverage unlabeled data for better cross-task generalization. Federated continual learning is also introduced to continually learn new tasks.

3) New models: Strategies are provided for incorporating large foundation or language models into FL, like through knowledge distillation. Architectural transfer between old and new models is also discussed.  

4) New algorithms: Questions are raised regarding timing and efficiency of switching federated aggregation algorithms.

The paper also comprehensively discusses future directions considering efficiency, security, and more complex setups. For each type of new knowledge, analysis is provided on its incorporation process and impact.

Main Contributions:
- Provides first taxonomy and systematic analysis of incorporating new knowledge into federated learning
- Thoroughly examines incorporation of new features, tasks, models and algorithms
- Discusses impact of arrival timing and form of new knowledge 
- Comprehensively analyzes future priorities for sustainable evolution of federated learning

In summary, this paper presents fundamental analysis to enable federated learning systems to continuously evolve by effectively incorporating new knowledge from various sources over time.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey on incorporating new knowledge from different sources into federated learning to achieve continuous updates and sustainable development of federated learning systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing the first systematic and comprehensive survey with analysis and discussion on how federated learning (FL) can achieve continuous updates and development in the face of new knowledge. Specifically, the paper:

1) Defines new knowledge in FL from four sources: features, tasks, models, and algorithms. For each source, the paper thoroughly analyzes what the new knowledge looks like and how to effectively incorporate it into existing FL systems.

2) Discusses the impact of the form and timing of new knowledge arrival on its incorporation into FL systems. 

3) Comprehensively examines future research priorities for the continuous development of FL with the incorporation of new knowledge, considering factors such as scenario setups, efficiency, and security.
