# [Veagle: Advancements in Multimodal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08773)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal models like Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have limitations in accurately interpreting images and answering questions, especially when there is text embedded within images. This is a common real-world scenario but a challenge for current models.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces a new model called Veagle that incorporates a dynamic mechanism to project encoded visual information directly into the language model. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of visual contexts.

- Key components of Veagle:
  - Uses a visual encoder from mPlugOwl to extract high-level visual features
  - Integrates a superior vision abstractor from mPlugOwl to enhance visual processing
  - Leverages the Q-Former module from InstructBLIP 
  - Employs the Mistral language model for exceptional language understanding
  - Strategically fuses these components to align textual and visual information

- Training scheme:
  - Pre-training stage: LLM alignment using image-text pairs
  - Fine-tuning stage: frozen LLM and encoder, fine-tune remainder of model on curated datasets

Contributions:
- Veagle outperforms previous benchmarks by 5-6% on visual question answering and image understanding tasks
- Showcases improved comprehension of text embedded within images
- Establishes new state-of-the-art for accuracy on standard VQA datasets
- Provides full code and model access to advance research 

The paper makes notable contributions in pushing forward multimodal learning to handle intricacies of interpreting text in images. Veagle represents the new cutting-edge with its strategic integration of components and curated data.
