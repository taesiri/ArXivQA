# [On the (In)Compatibility between Group Fairness and Individual Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07174)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the compatibility between group fairness, defined as statistical parity, and individual fairness in machine learning models. Specifically, it examines whether it is possible to simultaneously achieve optimal statistical parity while also satisfying individual fairness constraints like Lipschitz continuity or ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-individual fairness. There is an inherent conflict between these notions of fairness, so the goal is to analyze when they can be compatible.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes studying the compatibility by analyzing the optimal statistical parity solutions that minimize the $L^2$ loss subject to achieving statistical parity (independence between the predictions and sensitive attributes). This builds on prior work showing these solutions can be characterized via optimal transport maps. The paper then studies whether these optimal transport solutions also satisfy common definitions of individual fairness.

Main Contributions:

- Shows an inherent incompatibility between optimal statistical parity solutions and Lipschitz individual fairness under mild assumptions (Theorem 1). Intuitively, statistical parity requires applying different maps to individuals with the same qualifications but different sensitive attributes, which violates Lipschitz continuity.

- Provides a sufficient condition for when the optimal statistical parity solution satisfies ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-individual fairness (Lemma 2). The bound on the maximum map distortion is shown to be tight.  

- Analyzes what portions of the Pareto frontier between accuracy and statistical disparity are compatible with ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-individual fairness when optimal solutions are incompatible (Theorem 2). shows compatibility for a non-trivial portion of the frontier when $\epsilon < \delta$.

- Provides composition guarantees that allow extending the compatibility results to scenarios where the prediction comes from composing a trained model satisfying some individual fairness notion with the optimal transport post-processing step.

Overall, the paper provides a detailed theoretical analysis to highlight scenarios where both forms of fairness can be achieved simultaneously. The results help guide practitioners to compatible solutions and provide insights into the inherent tensions between common notions of fairness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper studies the theoretical conditions under which group fairness, defined as statistical parity between sensitive groups, and individual fairness, defined as similar treatment of similar individuals, are compatible in optimizing machine learning models, specifically focusing on the case of $L^2$-objective learning models that maximize utility subject to statistical parity constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is providing theoretical analysis on the compatibility between group fairness (specifically statistical parity) and individual fairness in machine learning. The key results include:

1) Establishing sufficient conditions for when optimal statistical parity learning (minimizing L2 error while enforcing statistical parity) is compatible with individual fairness constraints like Lipschitz or (epsilon,delta)-individual fairness. 

2) Analyzing cases where there is a conflict between optimal statistical parity learning and individual fairness. In these cases, the paper studies which portions of the Pareto frontier between statistical disparity and L2 error are compatible with individual fairness.

3) Providing composition guarantees - if a trained model satisfies some level of individual fairness, what are the compatibility guarantees on the composition of that model with the optimal statistical parity learning post-processing steps.

Overall, the paper advances the theoretical understanding of when and how much these two desirable fairness properties - statistical parity (group fairness) and individual fairness - can be simultaneously achieved. The results provide guidance to practitioners on compatible methods for attaining both properties.

The paper studies the compatibility between group fairness notions like statistical parity and individual fairness constraints. It focuses on the optimal tradeoff solutions (Pareto frontier) for statistical parity under an $L^2$-objective learning framework. Key concepts include Wasserstein disparity to quantify statistical disparity, K-Lipschitz and $(\epsilon,\delta)$ definitions of individual fairness, and compatibility analysis between group and individual fairness in post-processing and pre-processing settings. The paper provides sufficient conditions for compatibility as well as results on the portion of the Pareto frontier that satisfies individual fairness constraints.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the intuition behind using the Wasserstein distance to quantify statistical disparity between groups? Does it capture relevant aspects of fairness better than other metrics?

2. The authors prove compatibility results between group fairness and individual fairness under certain assumptions. How restrictive are these assumptions in practice when applying the methods to real-world datasets? 

3. For the case when optimal group fairness is incompatible with fixed individual fairness constraints, what guidance does the characterization of the compatible portion of the Pareto frontier provide for practitioners?

4. How does the choice of the loss function in the group fairness optimization problem affect the subsequent compatibility analysis and results? Would different loss functions lead to substantially different conclusions?

5. The composition results provide guarantees when composing a trained model satisfying IF constraints with the proposed post-processing steps. How tight are these composition guarantees? Could they be further improved?

6. How does the generalization of the individual fairness definitions to allow sensitivity-dependent mappings affect the practical applicability of achieving joint group and individual fairness?

7. What further assumptions need to be made on the joint distribution of qualifications and sensitive attributes for the results in this paper to hold? When might they be violated in practice?

8. Could the analysis be extended to study compatibility with other group fairness definitions beyond statistical parity? What technical challenges would need to be overcome?

9. The empirical evaluations validate the theoretical findings on two datasets. To what extent could the conclusions generalize to other application domains? What additional experiments could be beneficial?

10. For incompatible cases, is relaxing group fairness always preferable to relaxing individual fairness constraints, as done in this paper? What practical guidance exists on this question?
