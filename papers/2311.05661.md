# [Prompt Engineering a Prompt Engineer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05661)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces a method for optimizing prompts for large language models by using the model itself and components inspired by optimization algorithms, demonstrating performance improvements on academic benchmarks and real world prompts.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a method called PE2 for automatically engineering prompts for large language models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is challenging as it requires complex reasoning to examine model errors, hypothesize about limitations in the prompt, and communicate the task clearly. Recent work shows LLMs can be meta-prompted to do automatic prompt engineering, but their potential is not fully tapped due to insufficient guidance to elicit reasoning capabilities. This paper focuses on "prompt engineering the prompt engineer" - constructing a meta-prompt to more effectively guide the LLM's prompt engineering ability. The key ideas are providing detailed instructions/context and incorporating optimization concepts like batch size and step size into the meta-prompt. The proposed PE2 method consistently improves on initial prompts across tasks like math reasoning, instruction induction, counterfactual evaluation, and real-world prompt optimization. PE2 makes meaningful, targeted edits to prompts, corrects erroneous instructions, and shows non-trivial counterfactual reasoning. However, limitations still exist due to issues like neglecting instructions and hallucinating rationales. Overall, PE2 demonstrates strong automatic prompt engineering capabilities, but there is still room for improvement by addressing factors like lack of instruction following and hallucination tendencies.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates the problem of "prompt engineering a prompt engineer" - constructing an effective meta-prompt to guide language models to automatically improve prompts for downstream tasks. The authors introduce several meta-prompt components to encourage step-by-step reasoning and provide clear instructions and context. Drawing inspiration from optimization concepts, they also incorporate verbalized counterparts of batch size, step size, and momentum. Through systematic experiments on mathematical reasoning, instruction induction, counterfactual evaluation, and a production prompt task, they identify an optimal combination called PE2. PE2 consistently outperforms prior prompt optimization methods, making targeted edits to fix erroneous or incomplete prompts. It exhibits non-trivial counterfactual reasoning abilities, devising novel arithmetic rules when uninformed of the intended base system. Despite these achievements, PE2 is still bounded by core language model limitations like neglecting instructions or hallucinating rationales. Future work involves further improvements to PE2's reasoning and mitigating these issues. Overall, this paper makes important progress on the challenging task of "prompt engineering the prompt engineer".

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of prompt engineering for large language models:

- The focus on "prompt engineering a prompt engineer", i.e. optimizing the meta-prompt used for automatic prompt engineering, is novel. Most prior work has focused on developing prompt engineering techniques, not on optimizing the instructions for those techniques. 

- The paper introduces several new components for the meta-prompt, such as a step-by-step reasoning template, context specification, and verbalizations of optimization concepts like batch size and momentum. The systematic analysis of these different components is a key contribution.

- The paper demonstrates strong empirical performance, outperforming prior automatic prompt engineering methods like Iterative APE and APO. The gains are particularly notable on counterfactual reasoning tasks, indicating the method's ability to handle atypical situations.

- The analysis of the model's behavior and case studies on prompt edits provides useful insights. However, the limitations regarding hallucination and neglecting instructions highlight important areas for future improvement.

- Compared to concurrent work like OPRO, this paper has a more narrow focus on prompt optimization rather than general optimization. The prompts found do not seem to transfer well between models of different scale. Direct comparison is difficult due to differences in models and compute resources.

Overall, this paper makes excellent progress on an underexplored area. The introduction of new meta-prompt components, extensive analysis, and strong results help advance the field of automatic prompt engineering. More work is still needed to address model limitations, improve instruction following, and enable cross-model prompt transferability. But this provides a solid foundation to build upon.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the instruction following abilities and addressing hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs). The authors note limitations where the LLM neglects instructions in the meta-prompt or hallucinates incorrect rationales when provided hints. Overcoming these issues could lead to better automatic prompt engineering.

- Applying PE2 to optimize its own meta-prompt in a self-referential way. The authors suggest using PE2 to improve the meta-prompt itself, drawing inspiration from related techniques like prompt breeding. This could lead to further enhancements in the method's capabilities.

- Comparing PE2 to other automatic prompt optimization methods like OPRO in a controlled setup. The authors were unable to directly compare PE2 and OPRO due to differences in models and compute budgets. Doing an apples-to-apples comparison could reveal further insights. 

- Testing the transferability of optimized prompts across different LLM architectures. The paper shows prompts do not always transfer well between models. Studying prompt optimization methods that can find universally effective prompts could be valuable.

- Applying prompt optimization to broader tasks beyond the academic datasets tested. The authors demonstrate applicability to a production prompt, but testing on more real-world tasks could better reveal the method's versatility.

- Developing prompting strategies specialized for long prompts. The paper shows long prompts may need different hyperparameters. Research into specialized techniques for optimizing lengthy prompts could be useful.

In summary, the main future directions relate to improving LLMs' abilities, testing prompt optimization techniques more rigorously, and expanding the applications of methods like PE2 to real-world settings and long prompts. Overall, the authors lay out a research agenda for continued advancements in automatic prompt engineering.

What are some ways the instruction following and reasoning abilities could be improved in future work? For example, by providing more demonstrations, adding recursive reasoning steps, or using techniques like debate and counterfactual prompting.

4. The paper demonstrates that good initialization is important for automatic prompt engineering. However, providing a fully good prompt as initialization could make the task trivial. What are some ways to strike a balance, such as providing an initial prompt that is reasonably good but still leaves room for non-trivial improvements?
