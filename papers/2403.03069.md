# [Improving Variational Autoencoder Estimation from Incomplete Data with   Mixture Variational Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03069)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are widely used for density estimation and representation learning. However, they typically require full (non-missing) data during training.
- Missing data can significantly increase the complexity of the posterior distribution over the latent variables compared to the fully observed case. This causes a mismatch between the variational distribution and true posterior, leading to biases in the fitted VAE model.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use mixture variational distributions to better match the more complex posteriors under missing data
- Present two strategies:
   1. Finite variational mixtures - Directly learn a mixture distribution over latents
   2. Imputation variational mixtures - Learn a conditional VAE to impute missing data and use it to construct a mixture distribution

Key Contributions:

- Show missing data can greatly increase complexity of the posterior distribution over latents, requiring more flexible variational families

- Propose finite and imputation variational mixture strategies to address this, enabling use of same families as the complete data case

- Derive objectives for learning the mixture distributions based on ELBO and importance weighted losses

- Evaluate on synthetic and real-world incomplete datasets, showing mixtures improve accuracy over non-mixture baselines

- Analysis shows mixtures better capture multi-modal incomplete data posteriors. Imputation mixtures yield most well-behaved latent space.

- Overall, demonstrate variational mixtures are an effective approach for estimating VAEs under missing data, improving over existing methods. Enable reuse of useful inductive biases from the complete data case.
