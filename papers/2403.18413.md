# [HyRRT-Connect: A Bidirectional Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees Motion   Planning Algorithm for Hybrid Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18413)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the motion planning problem for hybrid systems, which exhibit both discrete state transitions (jumps) and continuous-time dynamics (flows). Solving this problem to find a feasible trajectory connecting given initial and final states is challenging. The paper proposes a bidirectional sampling-based motion planning algorithm called HyRRT-Connect as a computationally efficient solution. 

Solution:
HyRRT-Connect simultaneously constructs two search trees - one growing forward in time from the initial state set and another in reverse time from the final state set. It defines a novel backward-in-time hybrid system to represent the time-reversed dynamics. As the two trees expand, the algorithm checks if they overlap within a tolerance. If yes, the overlapping partial trajectories are reversed and concatenated to form an approximate motion plan. 

To address potential discontinuities in the plan introduced by allowing overlaps, the paper defines a reconstruction process. This simulates forward in time from the end of the forward partial trajectory, following the jumps and flows of the reversed backward trajectory input. As the overlap tolerance converges to zero, the gap between the reconstructed trajectory's endpoint and final state also goes to zero.

Main contributions:
1) First bidirectional RRT algorithm for hybrid system motion planning 
2) Formal definition of backward-in-time hybrid system dynamics 
3) Theoretical analysis showing convergence of reconstructed motion plans to desired final state
4) Demonstrated computational speedups on a bouncing ball system and walking robot example

Overall, the paper makes key contributions in efficiently searching the hybrid state-input space by propagating bidirectional trees. The reconstruction process and analysis provide completeness guarantees. Evaluations highlight the improved performance over prior hybrid motion planning techniques.
