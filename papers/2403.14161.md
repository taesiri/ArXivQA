# [Extrinsic Calibration of Multiple LiDARs for a Mobile Robot based on   Floor Plane And Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14161)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mobile robots are increasingly equipped with multiple LiDAR sensors for perception. However, these LiDARs often have non-overlapping fields of view (FoV).  
- Extrinsic calibration of such LiDARs is challenging using existing methods that require a calibration target or common features in overlapping FoV.
- For ground robots, most LiDAR observations are of the floor plane which can bias calibration towards just floor alignment. 
- High-density LiDARs also suffer from "bleeding points" noise which degrades calibration accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
- Accumulate point clouds while the robot is moving to create a common FoV for calibration.
- Segment the point clouds into floor plane and other objects.
- Two-step extrinsic calibration process:
   1) Rough refinement using floor plane under the assumption all LiDARs see the same floor.
   2) Optimization using point distances between object clouds.
- New noise filter considering LiDAR scanning patterns rather than just distance.

Main Contributions:
- Extrinsic calibration method for non-overlapping LiDARs using floor plane and object clouds. Enables calibration even if mostly floor points.
- Two-step approach with rough refinement handles floor dominance issue.
- Noise filter tailored for high-density LiDAR scanning patterns.
- Evaluations in simulation and on a real robot show higher accuracy than existing methods.
- Proposed method reduces initial extrinsic error by up to 92% in simulation.
- Noise filter has higher precision and recall than traditional filters.
- Calibrated LiDARs successfully create consistent 3D maps.

In summary, the key innovation is the use of segmented floor and object clouds in a two-step calibration process to accurately calibrate multiple LiDARs with minimal overlap viewing mostly the floor plane. The scanning-pattern aware noise filter also helps improve real-world performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method for extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs with non-overlapping fields of view on a mobile robot, using segmented floor plane and object point clouds accumulated while the robot is moving to enable accurate calibration even when the observations are primarily composed of the floor plane.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A method for extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs with non-overlapping fields of view (FoV). The method utilizes segmented floor plane and object point clouds accumulated while the robot is in motion to estimate the movement trajectory and extrinsic parameters in a two-step process.

2) A noise removal module that considers the scanning patterns of LiDARs to effectively reduce noise. This is useful when calibrating high-density LiDARs. 

3) Evaluations in simulation that demonstrate the proposed method achieves higher accuracy in calibrating two and four LiDARs compared to conventional methods, regardless of the type of objects in the environment.

4) Experiments on a real robot showing that the proposed noise removal module outperforms traditional methods in reducing noise, and that the estimated extrinsic parameters successfully create consistent 3D maps from LiDARs with non-overlapping FoV.

In summary, the main contribution is an accurate and robust method for extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs on a mobile robot, even when the LiDARs have mostly floor plane observations.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The proposed method utilizes both floor plane and object point clouds for extrinsic calibration. Why is it beneficial to use both types of point clouds instead of just one? How does using both improve accuracy?

2. The method proposes a two-step estimation process involving rough refinement and optimization. Why is this two-step approach used instead of a single optimization process? What are the advantages?

3. The noise removal module considers the scanning pattern when dynamically changing the noise threshold. Why does considering the scanning pattern improve noise removal over methods like DSOR that just consider distance? 

4. What types of features does the proposed method use during the optimization process? Why were these simple features chosen over more complex geometric features?

5. How does the proposed method enable accurate calibration even when the LiDAR observations are primarily composed of the floor plane? What issues arise when floor plane observations dominate?

6. The experiments tested the method with different numbers of LiDARs (2 and 4). How does performance change as more LiDARs are added? What factors contribute to this performance change?  

7. What types of objects were used to test robustness in the simulation experiments (boxes, cylinders, capsules)? Why test on different geometric primitives?

8. How was error quantified in the real robot experiments since true extrinsic values were not known? What metrics were used to evaluate accuracy?

9. What scanning method was used by the Livox LiDARs? How does this scanning method impact point cloud density and necessity of the proposed noise removal technique?

10. The method is applied to ground robots, but could it work for aerial vehicles? What changes would need to be made to apply this calibration procedure to drones/UAVs?
