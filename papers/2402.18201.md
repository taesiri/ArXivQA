# [Learning Invariant Inter-pixel Correlations for Superpixel Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18201)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Learning Invariant Inter-pixel Correlations for Superpixel Generation":

Problem:
- Existing deep learning based superpixel algorithms rely on learnable features which makes them sensitive to the unique data distribution present in the training set. This leads to constrained discriminative capability of the features and unsatisfactory pixel grouping performance when applied to unseen test data.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new deep superpixel algorithm called Content Disentangle Superpixel (CDS) which selectively separates the invariant inter-pixel correlations from the statistical properties (style noise) of the training data. 

- During training, CDS constructs an auxiliary modality (e.g. gradient map) of the RGB image which has different stylistic information but preserves inter-pixel correlations. 

- A content selective gate is used to disentangle the content features and style noise from the embeddings of both modalities. 

- Local-grid correlation alignment is proposed to enforce that the content features from both modalities have similar pixel correlations.

- Mutual information minimization is used to further separate content and style by minimizing mutual information between modal-specific style vectors.

- A shared superpixel decoder then predicts superpixel associations using only the content features.

Main Contributions:

- CDS effectively reduces the influence of style noise from training data on deep superpixel algorithms through the use of auxiliary modalities and content disentangling during training.

- It achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets while preserving efficiency during inference.

- It improves generalization capability and boundary adherence of deep superpixel algorithms when applied to unseen test data.

- Experiments demonstrate benefits of using CDS for superpixel based downstream tasks like semantic segmentation.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage auxiliary modalities to separate invariant inter-pixel correlations and data style noise during training to make deep superpixels more robust for practical open-world application scenarios while retaining efficiency.
