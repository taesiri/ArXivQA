# [GreenLightningAI: An Efficient AI System with Decoupled Structural and   Quantitative Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09971)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training complex deep neural networks (DNNs) is very computationally expensive and energy intensive. This high cost creates barriers for adopting AI solutions in many domains.
- Retraining DNNs with new data is also costly as all samples need to be processed again. This asks for a new approach.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new AI system called GreenLightningAI (GLAI) that decouples the structural knowledge (ability to activate/deactivate paths) from the quantitative knowledge (numerical weights).

- GLAI consists of two components: 
   1) Path selector: Contains a neural network that determines activation patterns
   2) Estimator: A single linear layer that stores the path weights  

- For each sample, the path selector activates a subset of paths. The estimator then only uses the weights of active paths to make predictions.

- By preserving path selector and only retraining the estimator, GLAI enables more efficient retraining algorithms.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces concepts of structural vs quantitative knowledge in DNNs
- Shows through analysis that structural knowledge stabilizes faster than quantitative knowledge during DNN training

- Proposes proof-of-concept system and algorithm to decompose a DNN into path selector and estimator modules  

- Demonstrates with experiments on CNNs that retraining the estimator while keeping path selector fixed achieves accuracy comparable to full DNN retraining

- Presents the GLAI system that stores structural and quantitative knowledge separately, enabling faster retraining

- Discusses properties of GLAI for incremental learning without catastrophic forgetting and potential for federated learning

In summary, the paper makes a case for decoupled learning of structural and quantitative knowledge in DNNs and shows initial evidence that it can enable more efficient retraining. The proposed GLAI system implements these ideas for faster and greener AI.
