# [On the Global Convergence of Policy Gradient in Average Reward Markov   Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper focuses on analyzing the global convergence guarantees of policy gradient methods in infinite horizon average reward Markov decision processes (MDPs). 
- Prior work has extensively studied policy gradients for discounted reward MDPs, but analysis for average reward problems is lacking. 
- Extending existing discounted reward analysis to average reward MDPs is challenging due to the lack of discount factor as a source of contraction and the non-uniqueness of the value function.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel analysis technique to establish the smoothness of the average reward function, which is then utilized to prove the convergence of policy gradients.  
- This involves projecting the value function onto the subspace orthogonal to the all ones vector to obtain a unique representation. 
- Using this, the paper shows that the average reward is smooth and derives problem-dependent smoothness constants that capture the complexity of the MDP.

Main Contributions:
- First finite-time analysis showing policy gradient iterates converge at a sublinear rate of O(1/T) for average reward MDPs, implying an O(log T) regret.
- Introduces new MDP-specific constants that explicitly capture the role of the MDP complexity in the convergence rate.
- Shows that the analysis technique can be extended to discounted reward MDPs to improve dependence on MDP complexity compared to state-of-the-art bounds.
- Validates improved dependence on MDP complexity through simulations of policy gradient performance.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel analysis framework that not only proves convergence guarantees for policy gradients in the average reward setting, but also provides improved understanding of how the complexity of the underlying MDP affects the convergence rate.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key contribution of this paper:

This paper provides the first finite time global convergence analysis for policy gradient methods in infinite horizon average reward MDPs, proving a sublinear convergence rate of O(1/T) to the optimal policy which translates to an O(log(T)) regret bound.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It provides the first finite-time global convergence analysis of policy gradient methods for average reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) with finite state and action spaces. Specifically, it shows that the policy gradient iterates converge to the optimal policy at a sublinear rate of O(1/T), leading to an overall regret bound of O(log(T)). 

2) It introduces a novel analysis technique to prove the smoothness of the average reward function with respect to changes in the policy. This is a key technical challenge addressed in the paper since the average reward lacks the contraction properties that a discount factor provides.  

3) The paper shows how the convergence rate and performance bounds depend explicitly on underlying MDP parameters capturing the complexity or "hardness" of the problem. This is in contrast to prior work that only depends on the cardinality of state/action spaces.

4) The analysis is extended to the discounted reward setting to provide improved performance bounds compared to the state-of-the-art, especially for "easy" MDPs.

5) Empirical simulations are presented to demonstrate how the convergence rate changes as a function of MDP complexity, confirming the dependence captured by the new theoretical bounds.

In summary, the key novelty is in establishing the first global convergence guarantees for policy gradients in average reward MDPs along with an analysis that tightly captures the role of MDP complexity in determining the performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper establishes the smoothness of the average reward function by first proving the smoothness of the projected value function. Why is proving smoothness more challenging for the average reward setting compared to the discounted reward setting? What role does the projection onto the subspace orthogonal to the all ones vector play?

2. How exactly are the constants $C_m, C_p, C_r,$ and $\kappa_r$ defined? What is the intuition behind having convergence bounds depend on these MDP-specific constants rather than just the cardinalities of state and action spaces?

3. The paper claims the constants $C_m, C_p, C_r,$ and $\kappa_r$ capture the "complexity" of the MDP. What specific aspects of the MDP do each of these constants characterize? How could one design MDPs to minimize these constants and potentially achieve faster convergence? 

4. Walk through the key steps in the proof of showing the smoothness of the average reward. In particular, explain how the smoothness of the projected value function is leveraged to prove the smoothness of the average reward itself.

5. Explain why existing convergence rate bounds for discounted MDPs cannot be directly extended to the average reward setting. What causes these bounds to blow up as the discount factor approaches 1?  

6. The performance bounds have an explicit dependence on the constant $C_{PL}$. What is the interpretation of this constant? Do you think removing the dependence on this constant can lead to tighter bounds?

7. The paper shows the projected policy gradient method attains an $O(\log T)$ regret for average reward MDPs. Contrast this with the regret bounds shown in prior work. What implications does this have for the efficiency of the algorithm?

8. Explain how the analysis technique can be extended to attain improved convergence guarantees for discounted MDPs compared to prior work. What is the significance of constructing MDPs where complexity constants are small?

9. The simulations aim to validate how convergence scales with respect to different MDP complexity measures. What do these empirical results indicate about the tightness of the theoretical bounds? How could the simulations be extended to further illustrate key aspects of the analysis?

10. A main contribution of the paper is a novel smoothness analysis for the average reward objective. What are some other reinforcement learning algorithms or settings where a similar analysis technique could be beneficial?
