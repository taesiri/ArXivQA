# [Archer: A Human-Labeled Text-to-SQL Dataset with Arithmetic, Commonsense   and Hypothetical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12554)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text-to-SQL datasets have limitations in capturing complex reasoning, such as requiring mathematical calculations or commonsense knowledge. For example, the popular Spider dataset purposely excludes questions needing external knowledge.
- This limits the ability of current text-to-SQL models to handle real-world scenarios, which often involve deeper reasoning capabilities. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present Archer, an innovative text-to-SQL dataset designed to test three distinct types of reasoning - arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical. 
- Archer contains 1,042 English and 1,042 Chinese natural language questions over 20 databases across 20 domains. The questions map to 521 unique SQL queries.
- Compared to prior datasets, Archer has significantly higher complexity in terms of longer questions, longer SQL queries, more value predictions needed, usage of multiple tables, and complex SQL grammar.
- Experimental results show state-of-the-art models achieve very low execution accuracy on Archer (6.73% for a top Spider model), indicating ample room for improvement.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of Archer, the first text-to-SQL benchmark focused on arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical reasoning, available in both English and Chinese.
- Thorough experimental analysis demonstrating Archer's high complexity compared to prior datasets.
- Identification of reasoning-related challenges (e.g. incorporating external knowledge) for advancing text-to-SQL models.
- Establishing strong baselines using state-of-the-art models, and showing Archer leads to significant drops in their execution accuracy.

In summary, Archer contributes a valuable and more realistic text-to-SQL benchmark to drive advances in complex reasoning capabilities for text-to-SQL systems. Experiments confirm the dataset provides a considerable challenge for modern techniques.
