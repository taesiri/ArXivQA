# [Archer: A Human-Labeled Text-to-SQL Dataset with Arithmetic, Commonsense   and Hypothetical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12554)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text-to-SQL datasets have limitations in capturing complex reasoning, such as requiring mathematical calculations or commonsense knowledge. For example, the popular Spider dataset purposely excludes questions needing external knowledge.
- This limits the ability of current text-to-SQL models to handle real-world scenarios, which often involve deeper reasoning capabilities. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present Archer, an innovative text-to-SQL dataset designed to test three distinct types of reasoning - arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical. 
- Archer contains 1,042 English and 1,042 Chinese natural language questions over 20 databases across 20 domains. The questions map to 521 unique SQL queries.
- Compared to prior datasets, Archer has significantly higher complexity in terms of longer questions, longer SQL queries, more value predictions needed, usage of multiple tables, and complex SQL grammar.
- Experimental results show state-of-the-art models achieve very low execution accuracy on Archer (6.73% for a top Spider model), indicating ample room for improvement.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of Archer, the first text-to-SQL benchmark focused on arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical reasoning, available in both English and Chinese.
- Thorough experimental analysis demonstrating Archer's high complexity compared to prior datasets.
- Identification of reasoning-related challenges (e.g. incorporating external knowledge) for advancing text-to-SQL models.
- Establishing strong baselines using state-of-the-art models, and showing Archer leads to significant drops in their execution accuracy.

In summary, Archer contributes a valuable and more realistic text-to-SQL benchmark to drive advances in complex reasoning capabilities for text-to-SQL systems. Experiments confirm the dataset provides a considerable challenge for modern techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents Archer, a complex bilingual text-to-SQL dataset designed to test models' arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical reasoning abilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is presenting Archer, an innovative bilingual text-to-SQL dataset designed to incorporate three distinct types of reasoning: arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical reasoning. By including such varied reasoning skills, Archer seeks to challenge and expand the capabilities of text-to-SQL models, equipping them to manage more intricate and nuanced queries compared to existing datasets.

The key aspects of Archer that set it apart as a contribution are:

1) It focuses on complex reasoning questions involving arithmetic calculations, commonsense knowledge, and hypothetical scenarios. This sets it apart from previous text-to-SQL datasets. 

2) It provides high-quality human-annotated question-SQL pairs reviewed by professionals.

3) It offers questions in both English and Chinese paired with English databases. The bilingual nature enhances model evaluation.

4) Experiments using state-of-the-art models demonstrate significantly lower performance on Archer compared to simpler datasets. This highlights the challenge it presents to drive future research.

In summary, the main contribution is the creation and release of Archer as an innovative bilingual text-to-SQL benchmark to spur progress in this field, especially for complex reasoning abilities.

The paper introduces the Archer dataset for text-to-SQL, which focuses on complex reasoning types like arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical reasoning. It's a high-quality bilingual dataset with manual annotations. The paper analyzes model performance using metrics like execution accuracy, compares Archer to existing datasets, and does error analysis.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. Archer incorporates three distinct reasoning types - arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical reasoning. Can you explain in more depth why the inclusion of these reasoning skills presents new challenges for text-to-SQL models compared to previous datasets? What are some specific examples of challenges?

2. The paper mentions that incorporating external knowledge into text-to-SQL tasks presents significant challenges. Can you elaborate on what some of these key challenges are and why they make the task more difficult? 

3. One of the complexity factors analyzed is the higher average level of SQL statement nesting in Archer. In your view, why does a greater degree of nesting increase the reasoning complexity? Can you give some specific examples of complex nested queries from the dataset?

4. For the commonsense reasoning questions, explicitly stating the necessary knowledge alongside the question improved performance. In your opinion, what are some ways this external knowledge could be effectively incorporated in an end-to-end model rather than provided explicitly?

5. The bad case analysis revealed some common error types like incorrect logic on hypotheticals. What are some potential ways to improve comprehension of complex hypothetical logic in these cases?

6. The evaluation results using both LLMs and fine-tuned models show ample room for improvement on Archer. What are some potential ways performance could be improved in future work? 

7. The paper mentions Archer could serve as a resource for summarizing SQL templates and training generators. Can you explain in more detail how Archer could be used for these purposes? What would be the expected benefits?

8. Archer focuses specifically on questions with complex reasoning while having relatively small scale. Do you think the scale is currently sufficient or should be expanded, and why? What would be good ways to expand the scale?

9. The execution accuracy metric used may not fully capture semantic accuracy. For a more comprehensive assessment, what additional evaluation methods could complement this metric?

10. Beyond the current support for English and Chinese, how valuable would it be to incorporate additional languages into Archer? What challenges would supporting more languages present?
