# [Towards actionability for open medical imaging datasets: lessons from   community-contributed platforms for data management and stewardship](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06353)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Medical imaging datasets are increasingly being shared publicly on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle and HuggingFace. However, current practices on these platforms have issues related to vague licensing, lack of persistence, missing metadata, duplicates, and poor documentation.

- This is concerning because medical imaging data needs more careful treatment than general computer vision data to prevent potential harms. Key differences include needing de-identification, splits on a patient level, and metadata about demographics and origin.

- Concepts like FAIR data principles and datasheets for documenting datasets exist but have seen limited real-world adoption on CCPs.

Solution:
- The paper introduces the notion of "actionability" as a metric to reveal gaps between characteristics of available data and ideal data needed for developing accurate, robust and fair AI models. Actionability has 3 main concerns - predictable access, evaluation for real-world use, and complete documentation.

- To improve actionability, the authors propose a Wikipedia-inspired commons-based governance model for datasets on CCPs with two introduced roles:
    1) Data administrator: Ensures licensing, identifiers and metadata completeness
    2) Data steward: Responsible for maintenance, storage and documentation

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of licenses, persistence, duplicates and metadata issues with datasets on CCPs 
- Assessment of documentation practices revealing limited real-world adoption
- Concept of "actionability" to reveal data quality gaps
- Commons-based governance model with data administrator and steward roles to improve practices

The paper highlights an important issue around medical imaging datasets on platforms like Kaggle and HuggingFace, and provides both analysis of current problems as well as a conceptual solution direction to improve quality and enable more responsible AI development.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The paper investigates issues with medical imaging datasets on community-contributed platforms regarding vague licensing, lack of persistent storage, missing metadata and documentation, proposes "actionability" as a conceptual metric to reveal the gap between actual dataset characteristics and ideal ones for AI training, and suggests a Wikipedia-inspired commons-based governance model with data administrators and stewards to enforce proper licensing, documentation, sharing and maintenance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) An analysis of 20 popular datasets (10 medical imaging, 10 computer vision) hosted on community-contributed platforms like Kaggle and HuggingFace. The analysis reveals issues with vague licensing, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates, and missing metadata.

2) A discussion of the concept of "actionability" as a metric to reveal the gap between the actual characteristics of datasets on these platforms and the ideal characteristics needed for developing accurate, fair, and robust AI models for healthcare. 

3) A proposal for a commons-based stewardship model for medical imaging datasets on community-contributed platforms, introducing two key roles - a data administrator to ensure proper licensing, identifiers and metadata; and a data steward to ensure maintenance, storage and documentation.

In summary, the main contribution is an in-depth analysis of issues with medical imaging datasets on popular community platforms, a conceptual framework to evaluate the datasets, and a proposed governance model to improve documentation, sharing and maintenance practices.

The paper analyzes medical imaging datasets hosted on CCPs like Kaggle and HuggingFace. It examines issues related to vague licensing, lack of persistent identifiers, missing metadata, duplicates, and insufficient documentation practices. The authors introduce the concept of "actionability" to evaluate the fitness of these datasets for use in AI systems, covering aspects like access, quality, and documentation. They propose a commons-based stewardship model with data administrators and stewards to improve documentation, sharing, and maintenance of medical imaging datasets on CCPs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a "commons-based stewardship model" for governing medical imaging datasets on community-contributed platforms. Can you elaborate on what specific mechanisms this model would entail and how it would be implemented in practice? 

2. What additional infrastructure, policies, or community norms would need to be put in place to support the roles of "data administrator" and "data steward" that are proposed? How much effort would this require?

3. You mention being inspired by Wikipedia's governance model. What specific aspects of Wikipedia's model could be adapted for stewardship of medical imaging datasets, and what parts may not translate as well to this context? 

4. How much human labor and expertise is realistically needed to properly carry out the administrator and steward roles over time? Is this feasible given limited resources? If not, what alternatives could help ease the burden?

5. What processes could be put in place for ongoing monitoring and maintenance of datasets over time as part of the data steward role? What metrics or audits would be most meaningful?  

6. How can the interests and needs of the broader range of dataset stakeholders be represented under this model, not just core administrators and stewards? What community participation mechanisms should be in place?

7. What technological solutions like persistent identifiers, version control systems, or metadata standards could supplement and help automate some stewardship responsibilities? How far can technology take us?

8. How would this model align incentives for high quality dataset creation, sharing, and documentation in the first place? What motivations do researchers currently lack?  

9. Does this model fully address legal and ethical concerns around vague licensing, lack of access controls, or dataset changes over time? What issues may still fall through the cracks?

10. How could we measure the success of this model if implemented? What key outcomes or metrics would indicate it is enhancing dataset "actionability"? How could the model evolve over time as needs change?
