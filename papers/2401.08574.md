# [Deductive Closure Training of Language Models for Coherence, Accuracy,   and Updatability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08574)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Current language models (LMs) generate factually incorrect text, contradict themselves, and are difficult to update with new information. This is because standard training procedures do not explicitly optimize LMs to be logically coherent - assigning high probability to statements as well their logical consequences.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a method called Deductive Closure Training (DCT) to improve the coherence and accuracy of LMs. The key ideas are:

1) Use the LM itself to generate statements implied by or contradicting a set of seed statements. This results in a "neighborhood" of related statements around the seeds.

2) Identify the subset of statements in this neighborhood that are jointly most probable and logically coherent (contain no contradictions).

3) Fine-tune the LM only on the coherent statements identified in step 2.

If seeds come from a trusted source, DCT enables supervised fact-checking. If seeds are sampled from the LM, DCT enables fully unsupervised improvement.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes DCT - a novel LM fine-tuning method using self-supervision from the LM's own generations to optimize for logical coherence.

2) Shows DCT improves accuracy on fact verification by 3-26% and enables better model updating compared to baselines.

3) Provides formal analysis showing DCT is guaranteed to improve LM accuracy under certain assumptions about the model's ability to reason about statement correctness.

4) Demonstrates promising fully unsupervised accuracy improvements, suggesting supervised data may not be absolutely necessary for improving LM accuracy.

In summary, the key insight is that LMs can already reason about factual correctness of text, and DCT shows this capability can be leveraged to provide training signal even without access to ground truth labels. This enables unsupervised accuracy improvements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a method called Deductive Closure Training that uses language models to identify implications and contradictions in the text they generate in order to improve factual coherence, accuracy, and updatability through efficient self-supervised fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is presenting a method called Deductive Closure Training (DCT) that uses language models themselves to identify implications and contradictions in the text they generate. It then reasons about which portions of the generated text are most likely to be correct, and fine-tunes the language model on the inferred-correct text. This provides an efficient self-supervised procedure for improving the factual accuracy, coherence, and updatability of language models. Key benefits highlighted in the paper include:

- DCT can be used for unsupervised fine-tuning to improve model coherence, for supervised alignment with trusted data sources, and for model updating/editing. 

- Experiments across multiple datasets show DCT improves performance on tasks like fact verification and question answering. For example, unsupervised DCT improves fact verification accuracy by up to 12%, while supervised DCT leads to gains of 3-26%.

- DCT leverages language models' own reasoning and text generation capabilities to provide training signal, rather than relying purely on external supervision.

So in summary, the main contribution is presenting this self-supervised Deductive Closure Training methodology and demonstrating its ability to enhance language model accuracy and coherence by using the models' inference-time reasoning to generate training data.

The paper proposes a method called "Deductive Closure Training" (DCT) to improve the coherence, accuracy, and updatability of language models. It does this by using the language models themselves to identify implications and contradictions in the text they generate, reason about which portions are likely to be correct, and fine-tune the model on the inferred correct text. 

The key ideas involve using language models' reasoning capabilities during inference to generate training signal, optimizing models to assign high probability to logically coherent and complete sets of facts, and leveraging this approach for applications like fact verification, model updating, and unsupervised fine-tuning.

So in summary, deductive closure training, language models, coherence, accuracy, logical consistency, and self-supervised learning seem to be the core key terms. The applications like fact verification and model editing also feature prominently.
