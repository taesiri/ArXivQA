# [Seeing the World through Your Eyes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09348)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can we reconstruct a 3D scene of the world observed by a person, using only reflections from their eyes captured in a monocular image sequence?The key hypothesis is that by capturing multiple images of a person's eyes as they move their head naturally, the eye reflections will provide sufficient multi-view information to allow reconstructing the 3D scene beyond the camera's line of sight using a neural radiance field approach. The paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of this idea and introduces techniques like joint optimization of eye poses and iris texture decomposition to address the challenges unique to using eye reflections as input.In summary, the core goal is 3D scene reconstruction from eye reflections in monocular video, which requires addressing factors like noisy eye localization, intricate iris textures, and low-resolution reflections. The central hypothesis is that with proper handling of these challenges, the eye reflections can enable reasonable 3D scene reconstruction.
