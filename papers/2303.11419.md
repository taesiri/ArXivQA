# [EPiC: Ensemble of Partial Point Clouds for Robust Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11419)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we design a robust point cloud classification framework that is resilient to various types of corruption and out-of-distribution samples?

The key hypotheses behind their proposed approach seem to be:

1) Creating an ensemble of classifiers trained on different partial views of the point cloud data can lead to a highly diverse set of "weak learners" that together produce robust predictions. 

2) Different sampling strategies like random sampling, patch sampling, and curve sampling expose the individual classifiers to unique perspectives of the data, increasing ensemble diversity.

3) Aggregating the predictions from the ensemble can average away noise and errors from corruption, leading to more robust overall predictions.

4) Their approach can significantly improve robustness of existing classification networks on benchmark datasets containing point cloud corruptions.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design a robust point cloud classification framework, with a core hypothesis that training an ensemble of networks on different partial views of point clouds can improve robustness to corruptions and OOD samples. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on ModelNet-C.
