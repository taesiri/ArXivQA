# [EPiC: Ensemble of Partial Point Clouds for Robust Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11419)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we design a robust point cloud classification framework that is resilient to various types of corruption and out-of-distribution samples?

The key hypotheses behind their proposed approach seem to be:

1) Creating an ensemble of classifiers trained on different partial views of the point cloud data can lead to a highly diverse set of "weak learners" that together produce robust predictions. 

2) Different sampling strategies like random sampling, patch sampling, and curve sampling expose the individual classifiers to unique perspectives of the data, increasing ensemble diversity.

3) Aggregating the predictions from the ensemble can average away noise and errors from corruption, leading to more robust overall predictions.

4) Their approach can significantly improve robustness of existing classification networks on benchmark datasets containing point cloud corruptions.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design a robust point cloud classification framework, with a core hypothesis that training an ensemble of networks on different partial views of point clouds can improve robustness to corruptions and OOD samples. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on ModelNet-C.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a general ensemble framework (EPiC) for robust point cloud classification, which is based on training networks on partial point clouds generated using different sampling strategies (random, patches, curves). 

2. Demonstrating that the proposed ensemble approach significantly improves robustness of several state-of-the-art point cloud classification networks on the ModelNet-C corrupted point cloud benchmark. The main evaluation metric is the mean Corruption Error (mCE), and EPiC reduces mCE substantially compared to standalone networks.

3. Achieving state-of-the-art results on ModelNet-C benchmark, for both unaugmented data (mCE of 0.646 using PCT) and data augmented with WolfMix (mCE of 0.501 using RPC).

4. Providing diversity analysis to show that the partial point cloud sampling induces higher diversity compared to common ensemble techniques like using different architectures or weight initializations. This helps explain the improved robustness.

5. Showing the approach is generic and can work with different network architectures. Also analyzing the effect of network size/capacity on accuracy and robustness.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a simple yet effective ensemble technique to significantly improve robustness of point cloud classification networks to various corruptions, achieving state-of-the-art results on a benchmark. The core ideas are training on partial point clouds and aggregating predictions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an ensemble framework for robust point cloud classification based on sampling partial point clouds using different strategies (random, patches, curves) and aggregating their predictions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on corrupted point cloud data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper proposes a novel ensemble framework (EPiC) for robust point cloud classification, especially under corruptions. This is a relatively new and growing area of research, with papers like PointGuard, RPC, and the benchmark ModelNet-C being recently introduced. This paper offers a new approach to improving robustness.

- The key idea is to create an ensemble based on partial point clouds generated through different sampling strategies - random, patches, and curves. This provides more diversity compared to common ensemble techniques like using different network architectures or randomness in training. The partial clouds also provide robustness to non-uniform corruptions.

- They demonstrate state-of-the-art results on ModelNet-C for both unaugmented and augmented data, significantly outperforming prior methods. On unaugmented data they achieve an mCE of 0.646 compared to 0.863 for the previous best RPC.

- The framework is flexible and can work with different base network architectures. They show improved robustness across several networks like DGCNN, PCT, GDANet etc. This makes it widely applicable.

- The training overhead is low since only a single network per sampling method needs to be trained, unlike traditional ensembles that require multiple networks. This makes it efficient and scalable.

- They provide useful analysis on the diversity of the ensemble, the impact of different corruptions, tradeoffs with accuracy, and effects of network size. This provides insights into why the approach works.

Overall, the paper introduces a novel, flexible, and high-performing ensemble method for point cloud classification that pushes the state-of-the-art in robustness based on the key idea of partial point cloud sampling and diversity. The comprehensive experiments and analysis help understand the approach.
