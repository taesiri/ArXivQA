# [EPiC: Ensemble of Partial Point Clouds for Robust Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11419)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we design a robust point cloud classification framework that is resilient to various types of corruption and out-of-distribution samples?

The key hypotheses behind their proposed approach seem to be:

1) Creating an ensemble of classifiers trained on different partial views of the point cloud data can lead to a highly diverse set of "weak learners" that together produce robust predictions. 

2) Different sampling strategies like random sampling, patch sampling, and curve sampling expose the individual classifiers to unique perspectives of the data, increasing ensemble diversity.

3) Aggregating the predictions from the ensemble can average away noise and errors from corruption, leading to more robust overall predictions.

4) Their approach can significantly improve robustness of existing classification networks on benchmark datasets containing point cloud corruptions.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design a robust point cloud classification framework, with a core hypothesis that training an ensemble of networks on different partial views of point clouds can improve robustness to corruptions and OOD samples. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on ModelNet-C.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a general ensemble framework (EPiC) for robust point cloud classification, which is based on training networks on partial point clouds generated using different sampling strategies (random, patches, curves). 

2. Demonstrating that the proposed ensemble approach significantly improves robustness of several state-of-the-art point cloud classification networks on the ModelNet-C corrupted point cloud benchmark. The main evaluation metric is the mean Corruption Error (mCE), and EPiC reduces mCE substantially compared to standalone networks.

3. Achieving state-of-the-art results on ModelNet-C benchmark, for both unaugmented data (mCE of 0.646 using PCT) and data augmented with WolfMix (mCE of 0.501 using RPC).

4. Providing diversity analysis to show that the partial point cloud sampling induces higher diversity compared to common ensemble techniques like using different architectures or weight initializations. This helps explain the improved robustness.

5. Showing the approach is generic and can work with different network architectures. Also analyzing the effect of network size/capacity on accuracy and robustness.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a simple yet effective ensemble technique to significantly improve robustness of point cloud classification networks to various corruptions, achieving state-of-the-art results on a benchmark. The core ideas are training on partial point clouds and aggregating predictions.
