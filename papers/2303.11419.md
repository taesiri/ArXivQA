# [EPiC: Ensemble of Partial Point Clouds for Robust Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11419)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we design a robust point cloud classification framework that is resilient to various types of corruption and out-of-distribution samples?

The key hypotheses behind their proposed approach seem to be:

1) Creating an ensemble of classifiers trained on different partial views of the point cloud data can lead to a highly diverse set of "weak learners" that together produce robust predictions. 

2) Different sampling strategies like random sampling, patch sampling, and curve sampling expose the individual classifiers to unique perspectives of the data, increasing ensemble diversity.

3) Aggregating the predictions from the ensemble can average away noise and errors from corruption, leading to more robust overall predictions.

4) Their approach can significantly improve robustness of existing classification networks on benchmark datasets containing point cloud corruptions.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design a robust point cloud classification framework, with a core hypothesis that training an ensemble of networks on different partial views of point clouds can improve robustness to corruptions and OOD samples. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on ModelNet-C.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a general ensemble framework (EPiC) for robust point cloud classification, which is based on training networks on partial point clouds generated using different sampling strategies (random, patches, curves). 

2. Demonstrating that the proposed ensemble approach significantly improves robustness of several state-of-the-art point cloud classification networks on the ModelNet-C corrupted point cloud benchmark. The main evaluation metric is the mean Corruption Error (mCE), and EPiC reduces mCE substantially compared to standalone networks.

3. Achieving state-of-the-art results on ModelNet-C benchmark, for both unaugmented data (mCE of 0.646 using PCT) and data augmented with WolfMix (mCE of 0.501 using RPC).

4. Providing diversity analysis to show that the partial point cloud sampling induces higher diversity compared to common ensemble techniques like using different architectures or weight initializations. This helps explain the improved robustness.

5. Showing the approach is generic and can work with different network architectures. Also analyzing the effect of network size/capacity on accuracy and robustness.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a simple yet effective ensemble technique to significantly improve robustness of point cloud classification networks to various corruptions, achieving state-of-the-art results on a benchmark. The core ideas are training on partial point clouds and aggregating predictions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an ensemble framework for robust point cloud classification based on sampling partial point clouds using different strategies (random, patches, curves) and aggregating their predictions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on corrupted point cloud data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper proposes a novel ensemble framework (EPiC) for robust point cloud classification, especially under corruptions. This is a relatively new and growing area of research, with papers like PointGuard, RPC, and the benchmark ModelNet-C being recently introduced. This paper offers a new approach to improving robustness.

- The key idea is to create an ensemble based on partial point clouds generated through different sampling strategies - random, patches, and curves. This provides more diversity compared to common ensemble techniques like using different network architectures or randomness in training. The partial clouds also provide robustness to non-uniform corruptions.

- They demonstrate state-of-the-art results on ModelNet-C for both unaugmented and augmented data, significantly outperforming prior methods. On unaugmented data they achieve an mCE of 0.646 compared to 0.863 for the previous best RPC.

- The framework is flexible and can work with different base network architectures. They show improved robustness across several networks like DGCNN, PCT, GDANet etc. This makes it widely applicable.

- The training overhead is low since only a single network per sampling method needs to be trained, unlike traditional ensembles that require multiple networks. This makes it efficient and scalable.

- They provide useful analysis on the diversity of the ensemble, the impact of different corruptions, tradeoffs with accuracy, and effects of network size. This provides insights into why the approach works.

Overall, the paper introduces a novel, flexible, and high-performing ensemble method for point cloud classification that pushes the state-of-the-art in robustness based on the key idea of partial point cloud sampling and diversity. The comprehensive experiments and analysis help understand the approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Testing the proposed ensemble framework on additional point cloud classification tasks/datasets beyond ModelNet-C to further demonstrate its effectiveness and generalizability.

- Extending the framework to other 3D perception tasks like segmentation, object detection, etc. to show its applicability beyond just classification.

- Exploring different sampling strategies beyond the three proposed here (patches, curves, random) to potentially further increase diversity and robustness of the ensemble. 

- Using distillation techniques to compress the ensemble into a single model for better efficiency while retaining robustness benefits.

- Applying similar sampling ensemble principles to improve robustness in other domains like images, video, speech, etc. beyond just point clouds.

- Developing better uncertainty estimation techniques tailored for the proposed ensemble to improve robustness.

- Analyzing how factors like network architecture, sampling parameters, ensemble size, etc. impact the diversity and robustness tradeoffs.

- Comparing against or incorporating recent robust training techniques like adversarial training or specialized augmentations.

- Testing the approach on more complex real-world 3D sensor data with noise, outliers, missing points etc.

In summary, the main directions are around extending and evaluating the sampling ensemble idea more broadly, incorporating recent related techniques, and translating the approach to real-world 3D applications. The diversity analysis also provides opportunities to further optimize the ensemble configuration.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes EPiC, an ensemble framework for robust point cloud classification. EPiC is based on creating an ensemble of partial point clouds, obtained by different sampling strategies - random sampling, patches around anchor points, and curves originating from anchors. Using partial point clouds increases diversity compared to common ensemble techniques based on architecture or parameter randomness. The partial point clouds also provide robustness, as some may avoid corrupted regions of the complete point cloud. EPiC significantly improves robustness of several classification networks on the ModelNet-C benchmark, reaching state-of-the-art results. The framework is flexible and can work with any existing point cloud classifier. Analysis shows the diversity advantage compared to other ensembling strategies. Overall, EPiC provides a simple and effective approach to create a robust point cloud classification ensemble using partial inputs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called EPiC (Ensemble of Partial Point Clouds) for robust point cloud classification. The approach is based on generating an ensemble of classifiers that are each trained on partial point clouds obtained through different sampling techniques. Three sampling methods are used: random sampling, patch sampling (getting local neighborhoods), and curve sampling (exploratory walks from anchor points). The partial point clouds help improve robustness to various corruptions and outliers. 

The method is evaluated on the ModelNet-C dataset, which contains point clouds with various synthetic corruptions. Experiments with several network architectures show that the EPiC approach significantly improves robustness compared to using the network alone, reducing the mean Corruption Error (mCE) substantially. The best mCE achieved is 0.646 without data augmentation and 0.501 with augmentation, surpassing prior state-of-the-art. Analysis indicates the approach is particularly effective for non-uniform corruptions that do not affect the entire point cloud uniformly. The use of partial point clouds creates diversity in the ensemble and enables some members to be less impacted by corruptions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a general ensemble framework for robust point cloud classification, termed EPiC (Ensemble of Partial Point Clouds). The ensemble consists of classifiers trained on different partial point cloud samples obtained through three sampling strategies - random sampling, patch sampling, and curve sampling. Random sampling captures global information, patch sampling preserves local resolution, and curve sampling is more exploratory. Each classifier in the ensemble is only exposed to limited input data, making the ensemble highly diverse. During inference, partial point clouds are generated using the three sampling strategies, fed into the respective classifiers, and the predictions are aggregated by taking the mean. The diversity induced by the partial inputs leads to robustness against various corruptions. The framework is flexible and can work with different base classification networks. Experiments show significant improvement in robustness across multiple architectures on the ModelNet-C benchmark.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It addresses the problem of robust point cloud classification, especially when dealing with noisy and partial data from consumer-grade 3D sensors. The goal is to develop algorithms that are robust to various data artifacts and corruptions.

- The paper proposes a general ensemble framework called EPiC (Ensemble of Partial Point Clouds) to improve robustness. The key idea is to create an ensemble where each member only sees a partial point cloud, generated by different sampling strategies like random sampling, patches, and curves. 

- Using partial point clouds increases diversity among ensemble members. It also helps handle non-uniform/local corruptions since some members may not see the corrupted points. 

- Three sampling methods are used - random, patches, and curves, which provide global, local, and exploratory views of the data respectively. Only a few sampling networks need to be trained, unlike classical ensembles.

- Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C dataset show the approach significantly boosts robustness (lower corruption error) for several base classification networks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

- Diversity analysis is provided to understand why the partial point cloud ensemble works better than standard approaches like architecture diversity or input jittering.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel and effective technique to create diverse ensembles via partial inputs to improve robustness in point cloud classification. The core ideas could potentially generalize to other 3D tasks and data modalities as well.
