# [Speech-to-Text Adapter and Speech-to-Entity Retriever Augmented LLMs for   Speech Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07944)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we improve speech understanding with large language models by better aligning speech and text representations and handling rare entities?The key points are:- Large language models (LLMs) often underperform on speech tasks due to misalignment between speech and text representations. - The authors propose a joint speech and language model (SLM) using a Speech2Text adapter to map speech into the text token embedding space.- They also propose a Speech2Entity retriever to handle rare entities in speech by retrieving relevant entities using the speech input. - The combined retrieval-augmented SLM (ReSLM) model outperforms previous cascaded systems on dialog state tracking and ASR tasks.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that speech understanding with LLMs can be improved by 1) aligning speech and text better via an adapter and 2) handling rare entities through speech-based retrieval. The ReSLM model provides evidence to support this hypothesis.
