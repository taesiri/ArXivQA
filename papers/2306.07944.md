# [Speech-to-Text Adapter and Speech-to-Entity Retriever Augmented LLMs for   Speech Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07944)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we improve speech understanding with large language models by better aligning speech and text representations and handling rare entities?The key points are:- Large language models (LLMs) often underperform on speech tasks due to misalignment between speech and text representations. - The authors propose a joint speech and language model (SLM) using a Speech2Text adapter to map speech into the text token embedding space.- They also propose a Speech2Entity retriever to handle rare entities in speech by retrieving relevant entities using the speech input. - The combined retrieval-augmented SLM (ReSLM) model outperforms previous cascaded systems on dialog state tracking and ASR tasks.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that speech understanding with LLMs can be improved by 1) aligning speech and text better via an adapter and 2) handling rare entities through speech-based retrieval. The ReSLM model provides evidence to support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the abstract and conclusions, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:1. Proposing a Speech2Text adapter to map speech encodings into the text token embedding space of large language models (LLMs) without losing speech information. 2. Introducing a joint speech and language model (SLM) that takes both speech and text as inputs and leverages LLMs for speech tasks using the Speech2Text adapter.3. Presenting a Speech2Entity retriever that uses speech to retrieve relevant entities and augment the input to SLM.4. Demonstrating a novel retrieval-augmented SLM (ReSLM) that integrates the retriever and shows improved performance on automatic speech recognition (ASR) and dialog state tracking (DST) tasks. 5. Showing that the Speech2Text adapter brings the speech close to the text space, allowing leveraging frozen LLMs for speech tasks.6. Illustrating gains from integrating speech recognition and understanding objectives in a multi-task setup.In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing methods to effectively integrate speech with large pre-trained language models to improve speech recognition and understanding, as demonstrated on dialog tasks. The key ideas include the Speech2Text adapter, joint speech-text modeling, and retrieval augmentation.
