# [P$^2$OT: Progressive Partial Optimal Transport for Deep Imbalanced   Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09266)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing deep clustering methods focus on learning representations and clustering from balanced datasets. However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced class distributions, limiting their practical applicability. 
- Pseudo-labeling based methods are promising for deep clustering, but suffer from issues like confirmation bias and sensitivity to hyperparameters when dealing with imbalanced data.

Method:
- The paper proposes a progressive pseudo-labeling framework named P$^2$OT for deep imbalanced clustering. 
- It formulates the pseudo-label generation as a novel Progressive Partial Optimal Transport (P$^2$OT) problem. This jointly models the class imbalance and sample confidence in an optimization framework.
- Specifically, P$^2$OT has inequality constraints on sample weights, KL divergence constraints for avoiding degeneracy, and adjustable total mass constraints for progressive learning from easy to hard samples.
- To efficiently solve P$^2$OT, they reformulate it as an unbalanced optimal transport problem with extra constraints and virtual cluster. This transformed version can be optimized via an efficient scaling algorithm.

Contributions:
- Formalizes a new problem of deep imbalanced clustering to handle real-world long-tailed distributions.
- Proposes a progressive pseudo-labeling framework with a novel P$^2$OT formulation for joint optimization of class imbalance and sample confidence.
- Provides an equivalent transformation to unbalanced optimal transport that allows leveraging fast scaling solvers.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging imbalanced datasets including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R and iNaturalist subsets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel progressive pseudo-labeling-based learning framework for deep imbalanced clustering, which formulates pseudo-label generation as a Progressive Partial Optimal Transport problem to enable generating imbalance-aware pseudo-labels and learning from high-confident samples progressively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) They generalize the deep clustering problem to more realistic and challenging imbalance scenarios, and establish a new benchmark. 

2) They propose a novel progressive pseudo-labeling (PL)-based learning framework for deep imbalance clustering. Specifically, they formulate the pseudo label generation as a novel Progressive Partial Optimal Transport (P^2OT) problem. This enables them to consider class imbalance distribution and progressive learning concurrently when generating pseudo labels.

3) They reformulate the P^2OT problem as an unbalanced optimal transport problem with a theoretical guarantee, and solve it efficiently using a scaling algorithm that relies on light-speed matrix-vector multiplications. 

4) Their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most datasets compared to existing methods on the newly proposed challenging and large-scale benchmark. The benchmark includes a human-curated CIFAR100 dataset, the challenging ImageNet-R dataset, and large-scale subsets of the fine-grained iNaturalist2018 dataset.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new progressive pseudo-labeling-based deep clustering framework that can handle imbalanced data distributions, as well as extensive experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a diverse and challenging benchmark.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Deep imbalanced clustering - The paper introduces this as a more practical problem setting where the underlying classes in the data exhibit an imbalanced distribution. This poses challenges for standard deep clustering methods.

- Pseudo-labeling - The paper proposes a pseudo-labeling based learning framework to address deep imbalanced clustering. Pseudo-labeling is commonly used in semi-supervised learning and has been applied to deep clustering before, but faces challenges with imbalanced data.

- Progressive partial optimal transport (P^2OT) - This is the key algorithm proposed in the paper for generating pseudo-labels. It formulates pseudo-label generation as an optimal transport problem with constraints to enable handling class imbalance and sample confidence.

- Unbalanced optimal transport - The P^2OT algorithm is reformulated into an unbalanced optimal transport problem to enable efficient solving using a scaling algorithm. 

- Imbalance ratio - This metric (ratio of largest to smallest class) is used to quantify class imbalance in the datasets.

- Scaling algorithm - An efficient algorithm based on matrix scaling operations that is used to solve the optimal transport problem for pseudo-label generation.

- Long-tailed datasets - The paper evaluates the method extensively on long-tailed variants of CIFAR and iNaturalist datasets which exhibit a power law distribution of classes.

In summary, the key focus is on addressing deep clustering for imbalanced data using a progressive pseudo-labeling framework based on optimal transport.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a novel Progressive Partial Optimal Transport (P^2OT) algorithm for generating pseudo-labels. Can you explain in detail how P^2OT works and how it differs from prior optimal transport techniques for pseudo-label generation?

2) The P^2OT algorithm incorporates several constraints including an inequality constraint on sample weights, a KL divergence constraint, and a total mass constraint. What is the intuition behind each of these constraints and how do they enable the generation of high-quality, imbalance-aware pseudo-labels?  

3) The paper incorporates a virtual cluster and transforms the original P^2OT problem into an unbalanced optimal transport problem that can be efficiently solved. Walk through the mathematical details of this transformation. Why is the introduction of the virtual cluster necessary?

4) Explain the mathematical derivation behind the scaling algorithm used to solve the transformed unbalanced optimal transport problem for P^2OT. What are the key steps involved?  

5) The paper adopts a sigmoid ramp-up function for the total mass parameter rho in P^2OT. Analyze the impact of different design choices for varying rho over training iterations. What are the tradeoffs?  

6) Conduct an ablation study analyzing the contribution of individual algorithmic components of P^2OT. Assess the impact of constraints such as the KL divergence and the progressive total mass threshold. 

7) The paper evaluates performance on several imbalanced datasets. Analyze the results and discuss why P^2OT demonstrates superior performance compared to prior pseudo-labeling techniques.

8) What modifications would be required to apply the P^2OT algorithm to alternate deep clustering pipeline architectures besides the one introduced in the paper?

9) The paper focuses on image clustering. Discuss how you might adapt P^2OT to handle imbalance issues for other data modalities such as text or graphs. 

10) The paper leaves the adaptive adjustment of rho based on model learning progress as future work. Propose an approach to automatically control rho over training rather than relying on a predefined schedule.
