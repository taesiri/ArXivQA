# [Universal Manipulation Interface: In-The-Wild Robot Teaching Without   In-The-Wild Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10329)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Learning complex robot manipulation skills that involve dynamics, precision, bimanuality, and long horizons remains an open challenge. Prior methods either rely on teleoperated robot data, which is costly and limited in diversity, or passive human videos, which have a large embodiment gap. Recently introduced hand-held devices offer an alternative for portable and intuitive data collection, but still struggle to capture precise, dynamic and multi-modal actions.

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents the Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI), a framework for portable, low-cost and information-rich data collection and policy learning. UMI uses hand-held grippers with the following design:

- Wrist-mounted fisheye camera for sufficient visual context
- Side mirrors for implicit stereo observation  
- Built-in IMU for tracking fast motions
- Continuous gripper control for precision
- Kinematics-based data filtering for robot feasibility

To enable effective policy transfer, UMI employs:  

- Inference-time latency matching 
- Relative end-effector trajectory representation  
- Diffusion Policy model for multimodal actions

Main Contributions:

- Proposes UMI, a hand-held demonstration interface, that captures precise, dynamic and multimodal manipulation skills with just a wrist-mounted camera

- Careful policy interface design including latency handling, relative trajectory actions and diffusion policy to enable zero-shot transfer to robots

- Demonstrates UMI on complex bimanual, dynamic, precise and long-horizon tasks with up to 70% zero-shot success rate

- Policies generalize to novel environments and objects with 71.7% success when trained on diverse human data

In summary, UMI allows transferring diverse in-the-wild human demonstrations to effective robot policies for challenging manipulation skills. The system design focuses on capturing sufficient information from demonstrations while making the policy interface hardware-agnostic.
