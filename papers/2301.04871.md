# Learning to Memorize Entailment and Discourse Relations for   Persona-Consistent Dialogues

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How can we improve the consistency and coherence of dialog systems by learning to memorize entailment and discourse relations?The key hypothesis appears to be:By learning latent entailment relations from natural language inference data and discourse relations from dialog context-response pairs, and incorporating them into a seq2seq model, we can improve the consistency and coherence of dialog responses. Specifically, the paper proposes:1) Learning latent entailment relations between premise-hypothesis text pairs from NLI datasets, and storing them in an external memory module. This aims to help with persona consistency.2) Learning latent discourse relations between dialog context-response pairs and storing them in an internal memory module. This aims to help with response coherence. 3) Incorporating the entailment and discourse representations from the two memory modules into a seq2seq model to generate more consistent and coherent responses for dialog tasks.4) Imposing orthogonality constraints between the two latent memory spaces to ensure entailment relations remain dialog-independent.The key hypothesis is that by explicitly modeling these two types of relations in latent memory modules, the model can better capture consistency and coherence for dialog generation. Experiments on PersonaChat and DSTC7-AVSD datasets seem to confirm this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a method to improve persona consistency and discourse coherence in dialog systems by learning to memorize entailment and discourse relations. Specifically:- They introduce an external memory module called Entailment Relation Memory (ERM) which learns latent entailment relations from natural language inference data to help the model better understand persona consistency. - They also have an internal Dialogue Discourse Memory (DDM) module to learn discourse relations from the dialog history and improve discourse coherence.- The two memory modules work together during dialog generation to incorporate both entailment and discourse information, allowing the model to produce more persona-consistent and coherent responses. - They show improved performance on two dialog datasets - PersonaChat and DSTC7-AVSD - demonstrating the effectiveness of learning these latent relations to enhance persona consistency and discourse coherence.So in summary, the key innovation is using separate external and internal latent memory modules to capture entailment and discourse relations respectively, and leveraging both during generation to improve persona consistency and coherence in dialog systems.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review of the paper, here is how I see it comparing to other research in the field:- The paper tackles an important problem in dialogue systems - maintaining persona consistency and discourse coherence. This is an active area of research as existing dialogue systems struggle with consistency and coherence, especially over longer conversations. The paper nicely sets up the motivation and challenges in this space.- The proposed approach of learning latent entailment relations and discourse relations is novel. I haven't seen other papers take exactly this approach. Many papers have worked on better incorporating persona information, but utilizing external NLI datasets and imposing orthogonality constraints on latent spaces seems to be a new technique.- The paper compares against several strong baselines like Persona-Chat, LIC, P2Bot, etc. The experiments on two datasets - PersonaChat and DSTC7 - are thorough. The results demonstrate clear improvements in automatic metrics and human evaluations.- The ablation studies provide good insights into the contributions of the different components. The case studies also help illustrate the benefits.- The idea of disentangling dialogue-independent and dialogue-related latent spaces is interesting. I think this distinction and the use of external NLI data helps the model generalize better. This seems like a useful technique for other dialogue tasks too.Overall, I think the paper makes solid contributions to a challenging problem. The proposed approach is novel, intuitively appealing, and seems well-executed based on the empirical results. The paper compares favorably to related work in this niche area of building more consistent and coherent conversational agents. The results suggest this is a promising research direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method for learning to memorize entailment and discourse relations to improve persona consistency and coherence in dialogue systems. The method uses two types of memory - an external memory to store latent entailment relations learned from natural language inference data, and an internal memory to store latent discourse relations from the dialogue data. The entailment memory provides knowledge about logical relationships between concepts, while the discourse memory models continuity between dialogue turns. During training, an encoder-decoder model is first pre-trained on entailment data to populate the entailment memory, then trained on dialogue data while using both memories to inform response generation. Responses are generated conditioned on the persona, dialogue history, and information recalled from the memories. Experiments on the PersonaChat and DSTC7 datasets show improvements over baselines in terms of persona consistency and response coherence. The proposed architecture provides a way to inject external knowledge and discourse structure into dialogue systems to improve engagement.
