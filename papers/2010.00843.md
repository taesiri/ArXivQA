# [All You Need Is CONSTRUCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00843)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to define a uniform semantics for different forms of queries in a SPARQL-like language, specifically SELECT, CONSTRUCT, and nested queries. The key hypothesis is that treating query mappings algebraically as graph homomorphisms, rather than simple variable bindings, enables defining a unified semantics where the evaluation of any query is a set of mappings. The key contributions seem to be:- Defining mappings between query and data graphs as graph homomorphisms that preserve nodes and triples. This allows query graphs to contain isolated variables.- Providing a semantics where the evaluation of any query pattern over a data graph is a set of mappings. - Showing that SELECT queries can be encoded as a special case of CONSTRUCT queries under this semantics. This enables query composition and nesting regardless of the query form.- Illustrating the semantics on examples with different SPARQL query forms, including nested queries.In summary, the central research goal is to provide a uniform semantics for different SPARQL query forms to enable query composition, and the key idea is to treat mappings as graph homomorphisms rather than simple variable bindings. The main hypothesis is that this approach allows encoding SELECT queries as CONSTRUCT queries.
