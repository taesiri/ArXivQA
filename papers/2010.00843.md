# [All You Need Is CONSTRUCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00843)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to define a uniform semantics for different forms of queries in a SPARQL-like language, specifically SELECT, CONSTRUCT, and nested queries. The key hypothesis is that treating query mappings algebraically as graph homomorphisms, rather than simple variable bindings, enables defining a unified semantics where the evaluation of any query is a set of mappings. The key contributions seem to be:- Defining mappings between query and data graphs as graph homomorphisms that preserve nodes and triples. This allows query graphs to contain isolated variables.- Providing a semantics where the evaluation of any query pattern over a data graph is a set of mappings. - Showing that SELECT queries can be encoded as a special case of CONSTRUCT queries under this semantics. This enables query composition and nesting regardless of the query form.- Illustrating the semantics on examples with different SPARQL query forms, including nested queries.In summary, the central research goal is to provide a uniform semantics for different SPARQL query forms to enable query composition, and the key idea is to treat mappings as graph homomorphisms rather than simple variable bindings. The main hypothesis is that this approach allows encoding SELECT queries as CONSTRUCT queries.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a core query language GrAL that is close to SPARQL and allows flexible composition of different query forms like CONSTRUCT and SELECT. - It provides a uniform semantics for evaluating queries in GrAL, based on representing queries uniformly as mappings (graph homomorphisms). This allows nested queries with different forms to be composed easily.- It shows how to encode SELECT and SELECT DISTINCT queries as special cases of CONSTRUCT queries under the proposed semantics. This unifies the semantics of different SPARQL query forms.- It extends the notion of RDF graphs to include isolated nodes like variables, in order to enable the uniform representation of queries as mappings to generalized graphs. - It illustrates the language and proposed semantics through several examples of composing and evaluating different query forms over RDF graphs.In summary, the main contribution is a unified query semantics that enables flexible composition of different SPARQL query forms, primarily by representing all queries uniformly as sets of mappings and encoding SELECT queries as CONSTRUCT queries.
