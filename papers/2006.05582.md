# [Contrastive Multi-View Representation Learning on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05582)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we learn effective node and graph level representations in a self-supervised manner by maximizing the mutual information between different structural views of the graphs?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Contrasting node encodings from one structural view with graph encodings from a different structural view (and vice versa) is an effective approach for self-supervised representation learning on both node and graph classification tasks. 

2) Using a graph diffusion process to generate an additional global structural view, along with the local view from the adjacency matrix, provides useful congruent and incongruent signals for contrastive learning.

3) Increasing the number of views or contrasting multi-scale encodings, unlike in visual representation learning, does not improve performance on graph tasks. The best results come from contrasting the local view (adjacency matrix) and global view (graph diffusion).

4) Simple graph readout functions like sum pooling work better than hierarchical pooling methods like DiffPool for this self-supervised graph learning.

So in summary, the main focus is on developing and evaluating a self-supervised contrastive learning framework for graphs that relies on contrasting local and global structural views. The key hypotheses center around the design choices for effectively generating views and integrating mutual information maximization on graphs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a self-supervised approach for learning node and graph level representations by contrasting encodings from different structural views of graphs. The key points are:

- They introduce a method to generate different structural views of a graph, including using the original adjacency matrix and a diffusion matrix, to create correlated views of the same graph. 

- They use these views as input to two graph neural networks to encode node representations for each view. The node representations are then aggregated to obtain a graph representation for each view.

- They maximize the mutual information between the node representations from one view and the graph representation from the other view, and vice versa, as the training signal. This allows the model to learn rich node and graph representations without relying on label data.

- Through systematic experiments, they show that unlike visual representation learning, increasing the number of views or contrasting multi-scale encodings does not improve performance on graph tasks. The best results are obtained by contrasting node and graph encodings from two views.

- The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on several node and graph classification benchmarks under a linear evaluation protocol, outperforming previous unsupervised methods. It also matches or exceeds the performance of supervised baselines on some tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is a self-supervised approach for learning node and graph representations by contrasting local and global structural views, which achieves strong performance without relying on label data. The analysis provides insights into effective strategies for contrastive representation learning on graphs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised approach for learning node and graph representations by contrasting encodings from different structural views of graphs, and shows this achieves state-of-the-art results on node and graph classification benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in contrastive multi-view representation learning:

- The paper focuses specifically on learning representations for graph-structured data, whereas much prior work has focused on image, video, or text data. Applying contrastive learning to graphs presents unique challenges like defining views and augmentations on graph structures.

- The paper systematically studies the effect of different components like mutual information estimators, contrastive modes, number of views, etc. This kind of ablation study is less common in prior work, which usually proposes one end-to-end model. 

- For graph data, the paper shows that contrasting local node and global graph representations works better than contrasting global representations as is common in vision models. Also increasing views does not help much unlike in vision models.

- The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several graph node and graph classification benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of contrastive learning for self-supervised graph representation learning.

- The approach is unified for both node and graph-level tasks unlike some prior graph contrastive works like DGI and InfoGraph that require specialized encoders.

Overall, the paper provides useful insights on adapting contrastive learning specifically for graph data, conducting detailed ablations, and showing strong empirical performance. The comparisons highlight key differences like the importance of local structure and limited benefits of multiple views versus vision domains.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigate large pre-training and transfer learning capabilities of the proposed contrastive multi-view representation learning approach. The authors mention they are planning to explore this direction in future work.

- Apply the approach to larger graphs and datasets. The benchmarks used in the paper are relatively small citation networks and chemical/social networks. Testing the method on larger graphs and datasets from other domains could be an interesting direction.

- Explore different choices for the augmentation mechanism to generate views. The authors mainly experiment with adjacency matrix and diffusion matrices as two views. Other options like random walks or distortions could be explored as alternate views.

- Study the theoretical connections between the proposed contrastive learning approach and properties of the resulting representations such as ability to reconstruct input or invariance. 

- Compare performance with other recently proposed self-supervised graph representation learning methods. The approach could be benchmarked against other latest techniques.

- Explore effectiveness for other downstream tasks beyond node and graph classification tested in the paper. For example, try link prediction, recommendation, graph clustering etc.

- Investigate impact of different GNN architectures choice as the encoders. The method uses GCN, but graph attention networks, GIN, GraphSAGE etc. could be tried.

In summary, directions include scaling up the approach, trying more diverse views and encoders, evaluating on other tasks, and studying theoretical properties.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a self-supervised approach for learning node and graph level representations by contrasting encodings from different structural views of graphs. The authors show that using an adjacency matrix and a personalized PageRank diffusion matrix as two congruent views of a graph's structure allows the model to simultaneously encode rich local and global information about the graph. The model consists of graph convolutional encoders, projection heads, a readout function, and a discriminator. It is trained by maximizing the mutual information between node representations from one view and graph representations from the other view. 

The authors systematically study the components of their framework and show that unlike visual contrastive learning, increasing the number of views or contrasting multi-scale encodings does not improve performance on graph tasks. The best results come from contrasting node and graph encodings across two views. Using these findings, the model achieves state-of-the-art results on node and graph classification benchmarks under a linear evaluation protocol, outperforming previous self-supervised methods. It also matches or exceeds the performance of supervised baselines on some benchmarks. The unified approach works well on both node and graph tasks without requiring specialized architectures.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a self-supervised approach for learning node and graph level representations by contrasting encodings from two structural views of graphs. The method uses an augmentation mechanism to transform the graph structure into two views - one using the original adjacency matrix and one using a diffusion process to generate a more global view. Identical nodes are sampled from both views and fed into dedicated graph neural networks to encode node representations. These are fed to a readout layer to generate graph representations. A discriminator module contrasts the node encodings from one view with the graph encodings from the other view, and vice versa, scoring their agreement. This agreement is used as the training signal to learn useful node and graph representations in a self-supervised manner, without relying on label data. Experiments show the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on node and graph classification benchmarks compared to previous self-supervised and even supervised methods.
