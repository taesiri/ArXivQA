# [Vision-based Learning for Drones: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05019)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This comprehensive survey explores the rapidly advancing field of vision-based learning for drones and its pivotal role in enhancing drone autonomy and functionality. The paper discusses the core components of vision-based drones, emphasizing visual perception and machine learning techniques that significantly improve drones' operational capabilities. It provides a novel categorization of vision-based control methods into indirect, semi-direct and end-to-end approaches based on the perception-action cycle. Applications across single-agent, multi-agent and heterogeneous drone systems are also summarized, highlighting innovations and challenges in each domain. Moreover, the survey delves into open questions faced in real-world deployment, like safety, security and integration with embodied intelligence in open worlds. Potential solutions are also put forth to address these concerns. Overall, the paper underscores how the fusion of visual inputs and learning algorithms is transforming drones into intelligent, autonomous agents, while also laying the groundwork to propel future research focused on achieving artificial general intelligence with embodied drone systems.
