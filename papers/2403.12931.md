# [You Only Sample Once: Taming One-Step Text-To-Image Synthesis by   Self-Cooperative Diffusion GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12931)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the issue of slow and computationally expensive image generation in diffusion models (DMs). DMs require several iterative denoising steps to generate high-quality images, leading to sluggish generation speed. This hinders their practical application, especially for large-scale models. 

In contrast, GANs allow one-step generation with faster speed. However, training stable large-scale GANs remains challenging, often resulting in worse sample quality compared to DMs.

Proposed Solution - YOSO
The paper proposes a novel hybrid model called YOSO that integrates diffusion processes and GANs to enable high-fidelity one-step image generation with stability. 

The key idea is to smooth the distribution using the generator itself in a self-cooperative process rather than adding noise. Specifically, less corrupted samples produced by the model are used as the ground truth to train the generator to produce more corrupted samples. This allows directly optimizing the one-step generation distribution for stability.

Several techniques are introduced to enable fine-tuning large pre-trained text-to-image DMs like Stable Diffusion and PixArt-α for one-step generation, requiring only ~10 days of A800 GPU training.

Main Contributions
- Proposes YOSO, which can generate high-quality images in one-step both by training from scratch and by fine-tuning pre-trained models
- Introduces self-cooperative training process and adversarial divergence technique for stabilizing one-step generation learning
- Enables fine-tuning advanced text-to-image DMs for one-step generation with efficient training 
- Develops the first one-step diffusion transformer on 512 resolution and LoRA model capable of one-step generation
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art one-step results, compatibility with downstream applications like image editing

 This paper introduces YOSO, a novel generative model that enables high-quality one-step image generation by integrating diffusion models and GANs through a self-cooperative learning approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces YOSO, a novel generative model that can generate high-quality images with one-step inference. 

2. It proposes several principled and effective training techniques that enable fine-tuning of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for high-quality one-step text-to-image synthesis with minimal compute (around 10 A800 days).

3. It develops the first one-step diffusion transformer with PixArt-α and the first LoRA enabling one-step generation, which will be released.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel approach called "self-cooperative diffusion GAN" to enable stable and effective one-step image generation. Can you explain in more detail the key ideas behind this self-cooperative approach and why it is more effective for one-step generation compared to prior diffusion GAN methods?

2. When adapting the method to text-to-image generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained model, the paper proposes several techniques like latent perceptual loss, latent discriminator, and fixing the noise schedule. Can you elaborate on the motivation and implementation details of each of these techniques? 

3. The paper shows very strong one-step text-to-image results by fine-tuning PixArt-α and Stable Diffusion. What modifications need to be made to the method to make it applicable to other SOTA text-to-image models like DALL-E 2 or Imagen?

4. The zero-shot adaptation to 1024 resolution is an impressive result. Can you explain the equation used for this adaptation and discuss the potential issues of directly training a 1024 resolution model from scratch?

5. The results with LoRA fine-tuning are very promising. What are the main benefits of using LoRA fine-tuning compared to full fine-tuning? And what causes the minor distribution shift issue observed with LoRA fine-tuning?

6. The paper demonstrates compatibility with various downstream applications like image editing, control nets etc. What modifications would be required to support video generation or 3D generation applications?

7. The self-cooperative formulation relies on the assumption that less corrupted samples lead to better sample quality. Is there any theoretical or empirical justification provided for this assumption?

8. How does the training cost of the proposed method compare with recent consistency distillation approaches for few-step sampling from diffusion models?

9. The consistency loss and LPIPS loss are found to provide only minor improvements in the ablation studies. Is this expected and why might this be the case?

10. The samples for unconditional image generation look reasonably good but the FID scores are not SOTA. What improvements could be made to the model architecture or training methodology to improve the unconditional image generation performance?
