# [You Only Sample Once: Taming One-Step Text-To-Image Synthesis by   Self-Cooperative Diffusion GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12931)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the issue of slow and computationally expensive image generation in diffusion models (DMs). DMs require several iterative denoising steps to generate high-quality images, leading to sluggish generation speed. This hinders their practical application, especially for large-scale models. 

In contrast, GANs allow one-step generation with faster speed. However, training stable large-scale GANs remains challenging, often resulting in worse sample quality compared to DMs.

Proposed Solution - YOSO
The paper proposes a novel hybrid model called YOSO that integrates diffusion processes and GANs to enable high-fidelity one-step image generation with stability. 

The key idea is to smooth the distribution using the generator itself in a self-cooperative process rather than adding noise. Specifically, less corrupted samples produced by the model are used as the ground truth to train the generator to produce more corrupted samples. This allows directly optimizing the one-step generation distribution for stability.

Several techniques are introduced to enable fine-tuning large pre-trained text-to-image DMs like Stable Diffusion and PixArt-Î± for one-step generation, requiring only ~10 days of A800 GPU training.

Main Contributions
- Proposes YOSO, which can generate high-quality images in one-step both by training from scratch and by fine-tuning pre-trained models
- Introduces self-cooperative training process and adversarial divergence technique for stabilizing one-step generation learning
- Enables fine-tuning advanced text-to-image DMs for one-step generation with efficient training 
- Develops the first one-step diffusion transformer on 512 resolution and LoRA model capable of one-step generation
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art one-step results, compatibility with downstream applications like image editing
