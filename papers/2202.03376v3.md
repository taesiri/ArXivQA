# [Message Passing Neural PDE Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03376v3)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop an end-to-end neural partial differential equation (PDE) solver that offers flexibility to generalize across different PDE structural requirements such as resolution, topology, geometry, boundary conditions, discretization, dimensionality, etc?The key hypothesis seems to be that using a neural message passing architecture containing classical numerical schemes like finite differences and finite volumes as special cases will allow building a flexible PDE solver that can generalize across those structural requirements.Specifically, some of the key points I gathered about the research question and hypothesis:- Existing numerical PDE solvers are hand-crafted for specific equations and use heuristically designed components. The authors propose an end-to-end learned neural solver.- Prior neural PDE solvers are limited in their ability to generalize across properties like resolution, topology, boundary conditions, etc. The authors aim to build a solver that can satisfy these requirements. - The authors design their architecture using neural message passing, motivated by the insight that classical methods like finite differences and finite volumes can be posed as message passing. This is hypothesized to allow generalization.- The authors propose techniques like "temporal bundling" and the "pushforward trick" to encourage stability during training.- The model is designed to take PDE coefficients and attributes as input so it can generalize across PDEs within a class at test time.So in summary, the central research aim is developing a flexible and generalizable neural PDE solver using message passing, and the key hypothesis is that this architecture will allow generalizing across resolutions, topologies, equations, etc.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing an end-to-end, fully neural PDE solver based on neural message passing. This offers flexibility to handle different domain topologies, discretizations, equations, etc. The architecture is motivated by the insight that some classical numerical methods like finite differences and finite volumes can be viewed as special cases of message passing.2. Introducing two techniques - temporal bundling and the pushforward trick - to encourage stability when training the autoregressive neural solver models. Temporal bundling reduces error propagation by predicting multiple timesteps together. The pushforward trick poses stability as a domain adaptation problem and adds a stability loss term. 3. Demonstrating generalization capability of the proposed neural solver, where it can be trained on multiple PDEs and then solve new unseen PDEs at test time by taking the PDE coefficients as input.4. Validating the method on 1D and 2D fluid flow problems with different equations, domain topologies, discretizations etc. The model is shown to be fast, stable and accurate in various settings. It also successfully handles shocks and supports different boundary conditions.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a flexible neural message passing based framework for building end-to-end PDE solvers that can generalize across equations, domains, discretizations etc. The techniques for improving stability in training these autoregressive models are also an important contribution.
