# [Reflection Removal Using Recurrent Polarization-to-Polarization Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18178)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Reflection removal is the task of separating reflection components from a captured image to derive the transmission image without reflections. This is challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Existing methods either use single images or multi-view images as input, but have limitations. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a polarization-to-polarization approach for deep learning-based reflection removal. The key ideas are:

1) Use polarized images as input and output: Most prior polarization-based methods take polarized images as input but output non-polarized intensity images. This paper takes polarized images as both input and output to better utilize the interrelated polarization information between reflection and transmission.  

2) Two-stage recurrent network (RP2PN): A reflection estimation network (R-LSTM-Net) first predicts polarized reflection images. These are fed to a transmission estimation network (T-Net) to predict polarized transmission images. The transmission is then reused by R-LSTM-Net to refine the reflection. This recurrent process enhances the predictions.

3) Polarized difference images as input: The difference between polarized images at different angles contains useful cues dominated by the polarized reflection component. These difference images are used as additional input.

Main Contributions:

- Novel polarization-to-polarization approach to utilize interrelated polarization information for reflection removal

- Two-stage recurrent network (RP2PN) with LSTM units for iteratively refining estimates of polarized reflection and transmission

- Use of polarized difference images as inputs to provide useful cues 

- State-of-the-art performance on real-world polarization dataset, outperforming recent intensity-based and polarization-based methods

The ablation study validates the benefits of the polarized input/output, recurrence, and difference images. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
