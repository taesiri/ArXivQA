# [Pragmatic Communication in Multi-Agent Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12694)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Pragmatic Communication in Multi-Agent Collaborative Perception":

Problem:
Multi-agent collaborative perception systems allow agents to exchange information to enhance their individual perceptual capabilities. However, continuously sharing complete perceptual data consumes substantial communication bandwidth. This hinders the scalability of such systems. The key challenge is optimizing the trade-off between perception performance and communication cost. 

Solution:
The paper proposes a novel "pragmatic communication" strategy that crafts messages to specifically meet each agent's perceptual demands within the available communication budget. This is achieved in three key aspects:

1) Pragmatic message selection: Selectively retain only the sparse spatial-temporal regions containing task-critical object dynamics based on a spatial confidence map and a temporal dynamic map.

2) Pragmatic message representation: Approximate the dense feature vectors in the selected regions with indices of the most relevant entries in a learned task-adaptive codebook. This allows transmitting lightweight code indices rather than complete dense feature vectors.  

3) Pragmatic collaborator selection: Establish communication links only between agents that can provide complementary information useful for the receiver's task.

Based on this strategy, a multi-agent collaborative perception system "PragComm" is proposed. It uses neural networks to implement the above three aspects to craft efficient yet informative pragmatic messages. These messages are then utilized to enhance each agent's detection and tracking performance.

Contributions:

- Proposes a novel pragmatic communication strategy that retains only task-critical information to meet collaborators’ specific demands within communication constraints.

- Develops PragComm, an end-to-end neural collaborative perception system implementing this strategy via spatial, temporal and channel compression along with collaborator selection.

- Achieves superior detection and tracking performance under varying bandwidth constraints on multiple datasets, significantly outperforming prior arts. Saves over 32,700× communication cost with higher performance.

In summary, the paper makes key contributions in optimizing communication efficiency for multi-agent collaborative perception through a pragmatic task-driven communication approach. The proposed PragComm system demonstrates superior performance and scalability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a pragmatic communication strategy for multi-agent collaborative perception that selectively transmits only the task-critical data demanded by each agent, achieving superior perception performance under stringent communication constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel pragmatic communication strategy that only transmits task-critical data, reducing communication cost while retaining task utility. This is achieved by pragmatic message selection, representation, and collaborator selection.

2. It proposes PragComm, a pragmatic collaborative perception system that uses pragmatic messages to enhance the detection and tracking capabilities of multiple collaborative agents. PragComm includes single-agent detection/tracking and pragmatic collaboration components.

3. It validates PragComm with extensive experiments on collaborative 3D object detection and tracking tasks using real-world and simulation datasets. The results show PragComm achieves superior perception-communication trade-offs across varying bandwidth conditions and multiple perception tasks compared to previous methods.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of a new pragmatic communication strategy and collaborative perception system PragComm that achieves much better performance-bandwidth trade-offs by only transmitting task-critical data in pragmatic messages between agents. This allows efficient use of limited communication resources while maintaining high perception utility.
