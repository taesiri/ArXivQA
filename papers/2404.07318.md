# [Rethinking Perceptual Metrics for Medical Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07318)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Medical image translation involves converting images from one modality or scanner to another while preserving anatomical content. Commonly used metrics like FID may not capture anatomical realism well. More anatomy-focused metrics require segmentation labels. Thus better understanding is needed of downstream task-agnostic metrics like perceptual metrics.

Methods:
- Evaluated image translation between two tasks: subtle breast MRI transfer between scanners, and more complex MRI to CT spine image translation. Used multiple translation models: CycleGAN, MaskGAN, UNSB, and segmentation-conditional SPADE.
- Assessed segmentation performance via Dice score between translated images and ground truth. Tested perceptual metrics of FID, KID, IS, and SWD.

Key Findings:  
- Perceptual metrics do not reliably correlate with segmentation metrics, making them inconsistent for evaluating medical image translation. FID in particular is unsuitable.
- For subtle MRI translation, SWD pixel-level metric correlates better than learned feature metrics. But it fails for complex MRI-CT translation.
- Results show perceptual metrics may not fully extend to medical images. More research needed into universally useful metrics.

Overall, the paper demonstrates limitations around using common perceptual metrics like FID to evaluate medical image translation methods, urging caution and further research into better metric development. A key gap is the lack of translation-focused metrics that can capture anatomical realism.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates various evaluation metrics for medical image translation tasks, finding that commonly used perceptual metrics do not reliably correlate with segmentation performance, demonstrating the need for more suitable metrics in this domain.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, the main contribution of this paper is investigating the suitability and correlation of various task-agnostic, perceptual metrics for evaluating medical image translation methods, through experiments on two medical image translation tasks. Specifically, the paper examines how well common perceptual metrics like FID as well as segmentation performance correlate, finding that perceptual metrics do not reliably align with segmentation metrics which focus more on anatomical accuracy. The paper thus demonstrates issues with directly adopting perceptual metrics from natural image translation and calls for more research into universally applicable evaluation metrics for medical image translation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the keywords or key terms associated with this paper are:

image translation, evaluation metrics, breast MRI, MRI-to-CT

These keywords are listed in the \begin{keywords} environment in the LaTeX source code:

\begin{keywords}
image translation, evaluation metrics, breast MRI, MRI-to-CT
\end{keywords}

The paper investigates evaluation metrics for medical image translation, specifically for two tasks: (1) breast MRI translation between different manufacturers (GE to Siemens) and (2) MRI to CT translation for lumbar spine images. So the key terms relate to image translation, evaluation metrics, breast MRI, and MRI-to-CT translation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper evaluates both an intra-modality (breast MRI Siemens to GE) and inter-modality (lumbar spine MRI to CT) image translation task. Why did the authors choose to evaluate both types of image translation and what unique insights does this provide into metric performance?

2. The authors test several commonly used perceptual metrics like FID and KID. Why might these metrics, which were developed mainly for natural images, fail to capture global anatomical consistency and realism in medical images? 

3. The authors find that no single perceptual metric reliably correlates with segmentation performance across both tasks. What anatomical constraints might cause perceptual metrics to perform inconsistently for medical images compared to natural images?

4. The pixel-level SWD metric correlates better with segmentation performance than learned feature metrics for breast MRI translation. Why might focusing on textural/pattern similarity be more relevant for subtle intra-modality translation?

5. Why does SWD fail to correlate with segmentation metrics for the more complex MRI-to-CT translation task? What visual differences between modalities might it fail to capture?

6. Segmentation metrics require target domain labels which may not always be available. What are some real-world scenarios where unlabeled target domain images would be available but annotated ones would not?

7. The authors advise caution in using FID for medical image translation. Besides inconsistency, what other potential pitfalls arise from using FID for small datasets, as noted in the paper?

8. The authors conclude research into new metrics is needed. What properties should a new medical translation metric have? Should it focus on semantics/anatomy, realism, or both?

9. The authors use both public and private datasets in this study. How might performance of both the translation methods and metrics differ when applied to entirely proprietary clinical data?

10. The paper translates 2D slices. How might the constraints and suitable metrics change when translating full 3D volumes instead of 2D slices?
