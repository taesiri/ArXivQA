# [URS-NeRF: Unordered Rolling Shutter Bundle Adjustment for Neural   Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10119)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural radiance fields (NeRF) has emerged as a powerful representation for novel view synthesis. However, it relies on high-quality images and accurate camera poses as input. 
- Images captured by rolling shutter (RS) cameras suffer from distortions due to inter-row exposure time differences. This makes it challenging to obtain accurate poses and high-quality images as input to NeRF.
- Existing RS-NeRF methods have limitations - they either require strictly sequential input or cannot handle unordered images.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel rolling shutter bundle adjustment method for NeRF using unordered images - URS-NeRF.
- It incorporates a RS camera model into Tri-Mip NeRF to estimate camera pose, linear velocity, angular velocity and implicit 3D scene representation.
- A coarse-to-fine optimization strategy is used to prevent getting trapped in local minima. 
- Rolling shutter epipolar constraints are used to detect and correct erroneous poses.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes URS-NeRF - the first unordered RS bundle adjustment method for NeRF using a RS camera model.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in RS effect removal, novel view synthesis and camera motion estimation on synthetic and real datasets.
- Generalizes to unordered images unlike prior RS-NeRF methods.
- Can synthesize images with varying RS effects using estimated velocity and angular velocity.

In summary, the paper presents a novel unordered RS bundle adjustment framework for NeRF which outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It removes restrictions on sequential input making the method more practical.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel rolling shutter bundle adjustment method for neural radiance fields that can learn implicit 3D representations and recover camera poses from unordered rolling shutter images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors propose URS-NeRF, which combines the rolling shutter camera model with bundle adjustment and Tri-MipRF for rolling shutter effect removal, novel view image synthesis, and estimation of RS camera poses and velocities from unordered rolling shutter images. 

2. They introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy to prevent the rolling shutter bundle adjustment from getting trapped in local minima. They also suggest a strategy using rolling shutter epipolar constraints to detect and correct erroneous poses in the bundle adjustment.

3. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real datasets to evaluate the performance. The results demonstrate superior performance of their method over state-of-the-art methods in terms of rolling shutter effect removal, novel view synthesis, and camera motion estimation when using unordered input images.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of URS-NeRF, which can effectively process unordered rolling shutter images for novel view synthesis and camera motion estimation, through the combination of a rolling shutter model, bundle adjustment, and other strategies/techniques. The effectiveness is validated through experiments.
