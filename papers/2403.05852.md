# [SSF-Net: Spatial-Spectral Fusion Network with Spectral Angle Awareness   for Hyperspectral Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05852)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing RGB trackers rely on visual features like color and texture, making them susceptible to background clutter. Hyperspectral (HS) images provide both visual and spectral information about object materials, allowing objects to be distinguished from clutter.  
- However, most HS trackers just regroup HS bands into RGB images and apply RGB trackers, lacking joint modeling of spatial and spectral features. They also do not fully leverage spectral information during tracking.

Proposed Solution:
- A spatial-spectral fusion network (SSF-Net) is proposed for HS object tracking.
- A spatial-spectral feature backbone ($S^2$FB) extracts joint spatial-spectral features from HS images, outperforming RGB backbones. 
- A spectral attention fusion module (SAFM) fuses RGB and HS features using intra- and inter-modality correlations for a robust HS representation.
- A spectral angle awareness module (SAAM) computes region-level spectral similarity between template and search images to precisely localize objects. A spectral angle awareness loss (SAAL) trains the SAAM.
- Weighted predictions from RGB and HS branches are ensembled for robust results.

Main Contributions:
- $S^2$FB that jointly models spatial and spectral HS image context, outperforming RGB backbones for HS tracking.
- SAFM that captures cross-modal interactions for effective HS+RGB fusion with spectral attention.
- SAAM and SAAL that exploit spectral angles for precise localization, mitigating background confusion.
- Extensive experiments show SSF-Net outperforms state-of-the-art HS and RGB trackers on a public benchmark.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel HS tracking pipeline with joint spatial-spectral modeling, spectral-attentive cross-modal fusion, and spectral similarity-based localization. Experiments validate the superior performance over existing approaches.
