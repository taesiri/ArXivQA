# [SDiT: Spiking Diffusion Model with Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11588)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are an emerging generation of neural networks with greater biological interpretability, event-driven properties, and lower power consumption compared to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, the application of SNNs for image generation tasks has been very limited. Existing SNN-based generative models like Spiking-GAN and FSVAE have not achieved results on par with ANNs. A unified and effective architecture for SNN-based generative models needs to be explored.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Spiking Diffusion Transformer (SDiT), a novel SNN diffusion model architecture that utilizes transformer to replace the commonly used U-net structure in mainstream diffusion models. The key components of SDiT include:

- Efficient self-attention mechanism called RWKV that has lower computational complexity compared to standard self-attention
- Reconstruction Module specially designed to supplement information lost after firing of spiking neurons, enhancing image reconstruction quality
- Skip connections between input blocks and output blocks similar to U-ViT architecture

The model takes an image through patch embedding and position embedding. The denoising timestep goes through time embedding. Multiple spiking transformer blocks with skip connections are used to process this input. Finally linear and convolutional layers output the predicted noise.

Main Contributions:

- First work to introduce transformer as the backbone for an SNN diffusion model, advancing SNN-based generative model research
- Achieves state-of-the-art results among existing SNN generative models on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and competitive results on CIFAR-10
- Proposes efficient Reconstruction Module to compensate for information loss when complex self-attention is applied to sparse SNN representations 
- Empirically demonstrates the potential of SNNs for complex image generation tasks through a unified and effective model architecture

The proposed SDiT model sets a new baseline for SNN-based generative model research by demonstrating superior image generation capabilities compared to prior SNN methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes SDiT, a novel spiking neural network architecture for image generation that combines a transformer backbone with techniques like RWKV attention and a Reconstruction Module to achieve state-of-the-art image quality for SNN-based generative models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing SDiT, a novel generative spiking neural network architecture that combines a transformer backbone with diffusion models in the spiking neural network (SNN) domain. Specifically:

- SDiT introduces transformer as the backbone into diffusion models for SNN-based image generation, which is a new effort and advance over prior SNN generative models. 

- To compensate for information loss when integrating complex transformer self-attention with sparse SNN representations, the paper designs a Reconstruction Module to align both and encode the intrinsic dynamics of SNN neurons.

- Experiments across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate SDiT's strong generative performance and advancement over previous SNN generative models in terms of image quality.

- Compared to standard transformer, SDiT utilizes a more efficient self-attention mechanism RWKV that better integrates with SNNs, resulting in reduced parameters and computations, fully demonstrating the low-power advantage of SNNs.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing SDiT, a novel and effective SNN generative model architecture incorporating transformer that pushes the state-of-the-art in this field.
