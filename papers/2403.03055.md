# [Distributed Policy Gradient for Linear Quadratic Networked Control with   Limited Communication Range](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03055)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of distributed control for networked linear quadratic (LQ) systems. Specifically, it considers a multi-agent system where each agent only has access to local state information from its neighbors within a communication range. The goal is to design a distributed controller to minimize a global LQ cost function. However, existing methods either rely on centralized computation which lacks scalability, or only find suboptimal solutions. Therefore, the key open questions are: (1) how to design a scalable distributed algorithm that can find near-globally optimal controllers; (2) how to provide stability guarantee during the optimization process; (3) quantify the optimality gap theoretically.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a distributed policy gradient method. Each agent runs policy gradient updates locally using only neighbor information. To enable this, the paper shows an "Exponential Decay Property" that allows approximating the global gradient accurately using local data. This property requires weak agent interactions and low network connectivity. Under mild assumptions, the distributed algorithm is shown to approach near-global optimality, with optimality gap decreasing exponentially in the communication/control range. 

Main Contributions:
- Provides conditions for accurate gradient approximation using local communication
- Analyzes stability during the distributed policy gradient process 
- Proves near-optimal performance guarantee: optimality gap is exponentially small in communication and control range
- Demonstrates the exponential decay property on representative graph structures
- Simulations verify theoretical findings on convergence and optimality gap w.r.t. communication range

Overall, this paper makes important progress towards distributed, scalable, and near-optimal control of networked LQ systems. The distributed policy gradient method along with the exponential decay property for gradient approximation are the main innovations.
