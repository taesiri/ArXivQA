# Transferable Persona-Grounded Dialogues via Grounded Minimal Edits

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions addressed are:1) Is the proposed GME model effective for grounded minimal editing of dialog responses to incorporate specified personas, as evaluated on a new PersonaMinEdit dataset?2) Does the grounded minimal editing framework address the transferability challenges of grounded dialogue modeling, specifically the distributional gap and grounding gap between training and test datasets/concepts?The key hypothesis appears to be that minimizing the edits made to existing responses can help improve the transferability of persona-grounded dialogue models to new datasets and conversational contexts. The GME model is proposed to edit responses by disentangling and recombining persona-related and persona-agnostic content. This is evaluated on the new PersonaMinEdit dataset through automatic metrics and human evaluation. Transferability is then tested by editing Blender model responses on the BlendedSkillTalk dataset, showing GME can improve persona consistency while preserving knowledge and empathy grounding. Overall, the goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of minimal editing for improving model transferability across different grounded dialogue datasets and concepts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called "grounded minimal editing" to address the transferability challenges of grounded dialogue modeling. Specifically, the paper:- Proposes the grounded minimal editing framework, which aims to minimally edit existing responses to be grounded on a given concept, rather than generating grounded responses from scratch. This helps address the distributional gap and grounding gap faced by existing grounded dialogue models.- Presents a model called Grounded Minimal Editor (GME) which implements the framework for persona-grounded minimal editing. GME disentangles and recombines persona-related and persona-agnostic expressions to achieve minimal editing. - Introduces a new dataset called PersonaMinEdit to evaluate persona-grounded minimal editing. This dataset contains dialogue contexts, original responses, editing personas, and multiple human references for the edited responses.- Demonstrates through experiments that GME outperforms competitive baselines on PersonaMinEdit by a large margin in both automatic and human evaluations.- Shows through additional experiments that GME can improve the persona consistency of responses from other dialogue models like Blender while preserving their use of knowledge and empathy. This demonstrates the transferability of the grounded minimal editing framework.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the grounded minimal editing framework and the GME model to address key challenges in grounded dialogue modeling regarding transferability across different data distributions and grounding concepts. The new dataset and experimental results validate the effectiveness of this approach.
