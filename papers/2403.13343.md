# [TiBiX: Leveraging Temporal Information for Bidirectional X-ray and   Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13343)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for chest X-ray (CXR) image and radiology report generation often overlook the temporal aspect of patient data. This can lead to missing important medical information and negatively impacting generation quality. 
- Most prior work focuses on either CXR or report generation, but not bidirectional generation. Those that do bidirectional generation don't incorporate temporal data.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose TiBiX, a framework to leverage temporal information for bidirectional CXR and report generation. 
- The key ideas are:
   - Consider previous CXR scans along with current scan and report to enhance both image and text generation tasks.
   - Design a transformer model with causal attention to efficiently learn from temporal data.
   - Introduce a classification token to capture overall patient diagnosis.
   - Include a temporal token to represent time interval between scans.

Main Contributions:
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on report generation and comparable results to recent methods on CXR generation.
- Show benefits of incorporating prior scans through extensive experiments - improved metrics and generations more aligned with ground truth.
- Release MIMIC-T dataset containing longitudinal CXR data derived from MIMIC-CXR.
- Establish strong baseline for future work on longitudinal bidirectional CXR and report generation.

In summary, this paper makes notable research contributions regarding leveraging temporal information from patient history for enhancing radiology report and medical image generation. The proposed TiBiX framework sets a new state-of-the-art and provides several promising future research directions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel bidirectional framework, TiBiX, that leverages temporal information from previous chest x-ray scans to enhance both image and report generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in report generation and comparable results to recent methods in image generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel approach to integrate temporal data from previous chest X-ray (CXR) scans for bidirectional CXR and report generation. This includes designing a transformer-based model with causal attention to learn temporal information while reducing computational complexity.

2. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark dataset for the report generation task and comparable performance to state-of-the-art on the image generation task. Also achieving promising results on the classification metrics of images and reports.

3. Conducting extensive experiments and ablation studies to explore the merits of incorporating prior CXRs and supporting the inclusion of temporal scans.

4. Extracting and releasing the MIMIC-T dataset, a curated temporal dataset derived from the MIMIC-CXR dataset focused on longitudinal patient data.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new method to leverage temporal information from previous patient scans to enhance bidirectional chest X-ray and radiology report generation, and showing strong quantitative and qualitative results to demonstrate its effectiveness. Releasing the longitudinal MIMIC-T benchmark dataset is also a significant contribution.
