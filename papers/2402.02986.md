# [A Safety-Adapted Loss for Pedestrian Detection in Automated Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02986)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
In safety-critical domains like automated driving (AD), errors by the object detector can endanger pedestrians and other vulnerable road users (VRU). Common evaluation metrics for object detectors do not adequately capture safety, as they treat all misdetections equally rather than considering their criticality. Recent works have proposed identifying safety-critical VRU and back-annotating risk to the detector, but do not consider safety in the training process itself.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel safety-aware loss function called the "safety-adapted focal loss" that uses the estimated per-pedestrian criticality scores during training. It exploits the reachability set-based time-to-collision (TTC_RSB) metric from the motion planning domain along with distance information to account for the worst-case threat in quantifying pedestrian criticality. The criticality scores are used to dynamically adjust the loss contribution of each pedestrian detection to focus the model on detecting critical pedestrians.

Key Contributions:
- Derives a per-pedestrian criticality score from the motion domain based on TTC_RSB and distance information that captures worst-case collision risk
- Incorporates the pedestrian criticality into a variant of the focal loss to amplify the loss contribution for critical pedestrian detections
- Evaluates the method using RetinaNet and FCOS detectors on the nuScenes dataset, showing decreased misdetections in the safety-critical zone without sacrificing overall performance
- Ablation studies analyze impact of different criticality formulations and relation to detection difficulty

In summary, the key idea is to inject pedestrian safety criticality information from the motion planning domain into a adapted focal loss to improve detection of hazardous pedestrians important for safe automated driving. Experiments demonstrate clear improvements in critical pedestrian detection without losing overall performance.
