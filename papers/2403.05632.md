# [Can Large Language Models Play Games? A Case Study of A Self-Play   Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05632)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 store extensive knowledge from the internet but have reliability issues like limited reasoning, hallucination, etc. This makes developing a dependable LLM-based agent challenging. 
- Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) provides reliable solutions through recursive rollouts and self-play. But its effectiveness depends heavily on heuristic pruning and external value functions, limiting its efficiency in complex scenarios.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper introduces an innovative approach that augments LLMs with MCTS self-play to efficiently solve deterministic turn-based zero-sum games without additional training. 
- Specifically, LLMs are utilized in two ways:
    1. As action pruners to accelerate the self-play process by reducing the number of possible rollouts.  
    2. As proxies for value functions to evaluate potential outcomes when rollouts reach maximum depth.
- This combines the advantages of both methodologies - MCTS provides strategic planning while LLMs contribute knowledge and evaluation capabilities.

Main Contributions:
1. A novel methodology synergizing LLMs and MCTS for turn-based zero-sum games where LLMs serve as action space pruners and value function proxies.
2. Theoretical analysis proving the suboptimality of the estimated value scales as Õ(|A~|/√N + εpruner + εcritic) where N is # simulations, |A~| is size of pruned action space, and εquantify errors from LLMs. 
3. Experiments in chess puzzles, MiniGo and chess demonstrating superior performance over standalone LLMs and MCTS, highlighting the method's ability to tackle complex challenges.

In summary, this pioneering approach of integrating LLMs with MCTS via self-play holds considerable promise for advancing game theory and AI. The method leverages the complementary strengths of both techniques to effectively solve intricate decision-making problems.
