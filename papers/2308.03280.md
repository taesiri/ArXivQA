# [Mirror-NeRF: Learning Neural Radiance Fields for Mirrors with   Whitted-Style Ray Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03280)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve high-fidelity novel view synthesis of scenes with mirrors and reconstruct accurate geometry and reflection of the mirrors using neural rendering techniques. The key hypothesis is that by incorporating physical ray tracing similar to Whitted Ray Tracing into the neural rendering pipeline, the method can model the reflections in mirrors more accurately and enable new view synthesis and scene manipulation applications not possible with prior neural rendering techniques like NeRF.Some key aspects of the paper's approach:- Proposes a unified radiance field model with a reflection probability to determine if a ray should be reflected. Traces camera rays and reflected rays based on the radiance field. - Uses a surface normal MLP to predict a smooth normal distribution instead of using the density gradient which has noise.- Applies plane consistency and forward-facing normal constraints to regularize the geometry of the mirror surface.- Uses a progressive training strategy to stabilize optimization of the mirror geometry.So in summary, the central research question is novel view synthesis for mirror scenes using neural rendering, addressed through a physically-inspired ray tracing approach and specialized techniques for optimizing the mirror geometry. The hypothesis is that this will enable more accurate rendering compared to prior neural rendering methods.
