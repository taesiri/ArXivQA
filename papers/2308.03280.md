# [Mirror-NeRF: Learning Neural Radiance Fields for Mirrors with   Whitted-Style Ray Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03280)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve high-fidelity novel view synthesis of scenes with mirrors and reconstruct accurate geometry and reflection of the mirrors using neural rendering techniques. The key hypothesis is that by incorporating physical ray tracing similar to Whitted Ray Tracing into the neural rendering pipeline, the method can model the reflections in mirrors more accurately and enable new view synthesis and scene manipulation applications not possible with prior neural rendering techniques like NeRF.Some key aspects of the paper's approach:- Proposes a unified radiance field model with a reflection probability to determine if a ray should be reflected. Traces camera rays and reflected rays based on the radiance field. - Uses a surface normal MLP to predict a smooth normal distribution instead of using the density gradient which has noise.- Applies plane consistency and forward-facing normal constraints to regularize the geometry of the mirror surface.- Uses a progressive training strategy to stabilize optimization of the mirror geometry.So in summary, the central research question is novel view synthesis for mirror scenes using neural rendering, addressed through a physically-inspired ray tracing approach and specialized techniques for optimizing the mirror geometry. The hypothesis is that this will enable more accurate rendering compared to prior neural rendering methods.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points about how this paper compares to other research in neural rendering for scenes with reflections:- Most prior work like NeRF and its variants struggle to handle specular reflections and reflections in mirrors. They tend to treat reflections as separate virtual scenes, leading to inaccurate reconstruction. This paper proposes a novel approach to model reflections in a unified radiance field using ray tracing.- Some recent methods like Ref-NeRF and NeRFReN have tried to improve handling of reflections by using separate radiance fields for reflected and non-reflected parts. However, they are limited in rendering novel reflections not seen in training data. The ray tracing approach in this paper can synthesize new reflections from novel views.- Modeling accurate mirror geometry is difficult due to ambiguity and lack of constraints. This paper uses several techniques like parametric surface normals, plane consistency loss, and progressive training to improve mirror geometry reconstruction.- The unified ray tracing framework enables applications like placing new objects/mirrors and controlling mirror roughness, which are difficult for methods without an underlying physical model.- Comparisons to NeRF, Ref-NeRF and NeRFReN show superior novel view synthesis and mirror reconstruction quantitatively and visually. The method also outperforms others in rendering challenging reflections not observed during training.In summary, this paper makes significant advances over prior work by incorporating physics-based ray tracing into a neural radiance field, leading to improved rendering quality, mirror reconstruction, and expanded functionality like scene editing applications. The comparisons validate the advantages of the proposed approach.
