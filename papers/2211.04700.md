# [NoiSER: Noise is All You Need for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04700)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether it is possible to perform low-light image enhancement using deep learning without any task-related training data. The authors propose that by simply training a convolutional neural network on random noise images using a self-regression approach, they can learn an effective model for enhancing low-light images. The key hypothesis is that the noise self-regression allows the model to reconstruct image contrast and texture while satisfying a gray-world hypothesis to map the image to normal lighting levels.In summary, the main research question is:Can effective low-light image enhancement be achieved via deep learning without using any task-related training data, by simply training on noise images alone?


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes an embarrassingly simple yet effective solution for low-light image enhancement without using any task-related training data. - It introduces a new learning paradigm of directly learning a "generalization" from task-irrelevant data, instead of the common "fit -> generalize" procedure requiring task-related data.- It proposes Noise Self-Regression (NoiSER), which simply learns a CNN with instance normalization by taking random noise as input/output. NoiSER achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods that use task-related data.- NoiSER has very low computational requirements, with only ~1K parameters, ~1 minute training time, and ~1.2ms inference time. It also has automated over-exposure suppression ability.- The paper provides an intuitive explanation and empirical analysis of why such a simple noise self-regression approach works for low-light enhancement through properties like image texture reconstruction and convergence to gray-world hypothesis.In summary, the main contribution is an extremely simple yet effective noise self-regression method for low-light image enhancement without needing any task-related training data. It challenges common deep learning paradigms and matches state-of-the-art approaches.
