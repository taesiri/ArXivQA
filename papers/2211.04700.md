# [NoiSER: Noise is All You Need for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04700)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether it is possible to perform low-light image enhancement using deep learning without any task-related training data. The authors propose that by simply training a convolutional neural network on random noise images using a self-regression approach, they can learn an effective model for enhancing low-light images. The key hypothesis is that the noise self-regression allows the model to reconstruct image contrast and texture while satisfying a gray-world hypothesis to map the image to normal lighting levels.In summary, the main research question is:Can effective low-light image enhancement be achieved via deep learning without using any task-related training data, by simply training on noise images alone?
