# [Personalised Distillation: Empowering Open-Sourced LLMs with Adaptive   Learning for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18628)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes personalised distillation, an approach to distill capabilities of closed-source large language models into smaller open-source models by having the teacher provide adaptive refinements to the student's attempts on tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach called personalised distillation for empowering open-source language models with the capabilities of large closed-source models like ChatGPT. The key idea is to collect labeled data in an interactive, student-adaptive manner. Specifically, the student model first attempts a task, then the teacher provides personalized refinements to the student's incorrect solution. This avoids feeding the student with the teacher's prior, and enables more efficient learning from mistakes. The authors apply this method to code generation, constructing personalized refinements from ChatGPT to boost open-source code generation models. Experiments demonstrate that with only 2.5-3K personalised examples costing 4-6\$, their approach achieves significant gains over standard distillation, increasing CodeGen-mono-16B by 7% and StarCoder by 12.2% in pass@1 accuracy on HumanEval. The results validate the benefits of adaptive, student-centered learning for model distillation.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called Personalised Distillation for transferring knowledge from powerful closed-source large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to smaller open-source LLMs. Unlike standard distillation which queries the teacher LLM for label data and trains the student LLM on it directly, personalised distillation makes the learning interactive and adaptive. Specifically, it first lets the student model generate a solution to a task. If the solution is incorrect, it provides the student's attempt and error feedback to the teacher LLM to generate a personalised refinement. Thus the student only learns from its own mistakes through tailored corrections from the teacher. Experiments on code generation tasks show personalised distillation boosts student models significantly more than standard distillation, even with 3x less data. Key results include boosting CodeGen-mono-16B by 7% and StarCoder by 12.2% in accuracy on HumanEval, using only 2.5-3K personalised examples costing 4-6\$. Ablations verify benefits of multi-round distillation and leveraging execution feedback. So in summary, the key ideas are interactive and adaptive learning tailored to the student model's mistakes, not blindly learning from teacher's solutions. And results validate personalised distillation trains open-source LLMs more efficiently and effectively.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a method called personalised distillation for transferring knowledge from large closed-source language models like ChatGPT to smaller open-source models. The key idea is to let the student model try solving tasks first, and then have the teacher provide personalised refinements to the student's incorrect solutions. This interactive and adaptive approach is shown to be more effective for knowledge transfer than standard distillation methods.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes and evaluates a method called "personalized distillation" for distilling the capabilities of closed-source large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT into smaller open-source LLMs. 

The central hypothesis is that personalizing the distillation process to adapt to the student model's specific strengths and weaknesses will enable more effective and efficient learning compared to standard distillation methods that do not account for the student model's conditions.

Specifically, the key research questions explored are:

- Is personalized labeled data more effective for student model training than standard non-personalized data?

- Can personalized distillation outperform standard distillation with less data? 

- Does adding interactivity and execution feedback in the distillation process improve student model performance?

- Can the student model effectively leverage execution feedback at inference time to refine its outputs?

- Does multi-round personalized distillation lead to further improvements?

So in summary, the core hypothesis is around the benefits of personalization in model distillation, and the key questions aim to validate whether a personalized and interactive distillation approach tailored to the student model is superior to standard distillation methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a personalised distillation approach for effectively transferring knowledge from large closed-sourced language models (like ChatGPT) to smaller open-sourced models. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

1) Personalised distillation: Instead of using the teacher's (e.g. ChatGPT) direct solutions as training labels for the student model, personalised distillation first lets the student model generate an attempt for a task. Then it only asks the teacher to provide an adaptive refinement tailored to the student's attempt and execution errors. 

2) The refined solutions focus on fixing the student's mistakes and are semantically closer to the student's attempt compared to teacher's direct solutions. This makes the learning more efficient and aligned for the student model.

3) Extensive experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate personalised distillation leads to significant gains over standard distillation, especially with very limited data (2.5K-3K examples). The method also outperforms prior feedback-based code generation models.

4) Personalised distillation is able to boost the performance of CodeGen-mono-16B by 5.9 points and StarCoder by 12.2 points on HumanEval benchmark.

In summary, the key contribution is a simple yet effective personalised distillation approach to transfer capabilities from closed-sourced LLMs to open-sourced models in a more sample-efficient manner tailored to the student model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in distillation and code generation:

- Personalization: This paper introduces the idea of "personalized distillation", adapting the teaching data to the specific student model rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach. Most prior distillation methods like Alpaca, Vicuna, etc. use the same standard distillation data. Lion does input personalization but doesn't personalize the labels. 

- Interactive Learning: The proposed approach interacts with the student model, letting it attempt problems first before providing refinements. Many prior methods are non-interactive.

- Utilizing Feedback: This method trains the model to leverage execution feedback for refinement during inference. Some prior works like Self-Debug and Self-Correct also use feedback but rely on close-sourced LLMs or separate trainable components.

- Efficiency: The personalization aspect makes the learning more efficient - it achieves better results than standard distillation using 3x less data. Approaches like ILF require human annotation making it expensive to scale up.

- Single Model: The same model is used for both initial generation and refinement after feedback. Many previous works like Self-Edit and Self-Correct require separate generator and refiner components.

- Code Tailoring: The method is specialized for code generation tasks, tailoring the distillation process to leverage code execution feedback. Prior general distillation methods may be less optimized for this domain.

In summary, this paper introduces an interactive, personalized distillation approach customized for code generation that appears to be more efficient, scalable and integrated compared to related prior art. The results demonstrate the benefits of adaptation and personalization for distillation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigate how well personalized distillation scales with larger amounts of data. The authors suggest it would be interesting to collect much larger personalized distillation datasets (e.g. 50K examples) and evaluate if PERsD methods can achieve even greater improvements compared to standard distillation.

- Explore an online/active version of personalized distillation, where model training and data collection happen simultaneously in a fully interactive manner. This could further improve the customization and sample efficiency of the labeled data.  

- Apply personalized distillation to other challenging tasks beyond code generation, such as mathematics, to evaluate its effectiveness more broadly.

- Integrate personalized distillation with orthogonal methods like WizardCoder that also aim to improve task instructions/prompts. The authors suggest combining these approaches could lead to further gains.

- Conduct user studies to evaluate the helpfulness of personalized refinements compared to teacher's direct solutions from a human perspective. This could provide insight into the strengths/weaknesses of the refinements.

- Analyze the personalized distillation process in more depth to understand what types of mistakes by the student model lead to more effective refinements from the teacher.

Overall, the authors highlight scaling up personalized distillation and making it more interactive/online as interesting future work directions with potential for further improvements in sample efficiency and task performance.
