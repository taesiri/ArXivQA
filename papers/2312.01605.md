# [TextAug: Test time Text Augmentation for Multimodal Person   Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01605)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel text augmentation approach called TextAug to improve multimodal person re-identification performance. TextAug combines computer vision techniques like cutout and cutmix to generate augmented versions of textual queries at inference time. Specifically, it randomly removes words or phrases from the text (cutout) or blends parts of multiple text descriptions (cutmix). The augmented texts are encoded to get multiple text embeddings, which are aggregated and concatenated with the image embedding. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate TextAug's ability to enhance model generalization without retraining, outperforming prior text augmentation methods. When combined with images, TextAug achieved the best re-id accuracy - significantly higher than using only images or test. Analyses also revealed TextAug's augmented text and image embeddings better cluster identities compared to using either modality alone. Overall, TextAug provides a simple yet effective approach to improving multimodal person re-identification through inference-time text augmentations.
