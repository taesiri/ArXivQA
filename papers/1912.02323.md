# [15 Keypoints Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02323)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be how to develop an efficient multi-person pose tracking method that relies primarily on keypoint information, without using RGB or optical flow data, in order to achieve real-time performance. The key hypotheses appear to be:- Pose tracking can be effectively modeled as a "pose entailment" task, where a model learns to predict if one pose temporally follows another, using only sparse keypoint information encoded into tokens.- A transformer-based network can learn these temporal relationships between poses better than convolution-based methods, especially at low resolutions, allowing efficient and accurate real-time tracking.- Keypoint detections can be improved by aggregating estimates over time with a parameter-free temporal OKS method, rather than standard bounding box propagation approaches. - By combining these methods into a pipeline, real-time multi-person pose tracking can be achieved without reliance on computationally expensive RGB or optical flow data, setting a new state-of-the-art in terms of speed and accuracy.In summary, the central research focus is on developing a lightweight pose tracking pipeline centered around a novel pose entailment framework and keypoint refinement approach to achieve fast yet accurate tracking using only sparse keypoint information. The key hypotheses relate to the potential for transformers and temporal aggregation to model this task effectively and efficiently.
