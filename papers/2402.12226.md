# [AnyGPT: Unified Multimodal LLM with Discrete Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12226)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal models are limited to text generation or require significant architecture modifications to enable multimodal understanding and generation. Integrating multiple modalities (3+), like speech, text, images, music, poses challenges in alignment and stable training.  
- There is a lack of multimodal conversational datasets with interleaved modalities beyond text+image or text+speech. This limits developing models that can handle any-to-any multimodal dialogs.

Proposed Solution - AnyGPT:
- Proposes a token-based approach to transform various modalities into discrete tokens that are processed by a language model, enabling multimodal understanding and generation in an autoregressive manner.
- Relies only on data-level preprocessing, allowing seamless integration of modalities without architecture changes.
- Constructs a text-centric multimodal dataset spanning images, speech, music and text for pretraining alignment.
- Uses generative models to synthesize AnyInstruct-108k, the first large-scale (108k samples) multimodal multi-turn conversational dataset with intricate interleaving of modalities.  

Main Contributions:  
- Demonstrates discrete representations can effectively unify multiple modalities within a language model for any-to-any multimodal dialog
- AnyGPT multimodal model achieves strong performance across modalities, comparable to specialized models
- Provides the first large-scale any-to-any multimodal dialog dataset for future research

In summary, AnyGPT introduces a token-based approach to unify diverse modalities within a language model to achieve any-to-any multimodal dialog abilities. The model is pretrained on a novel synthesized dataset and shows promising cross-modal performance.
