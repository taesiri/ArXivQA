# [Physical Perception Network and an All-weather Multi-modality Benchmark   for Adverse Weather Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02090)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) methods lack robustness to different weather interferences (rain, snow, haze) in real-world scenarios like autonomous driving. This is a critical research gap.  
- Most deep learning MMIF methods have black box designs lacking interpretability. This makes identifying appropriate architectures time-consuming.   
- No large datasets exist for MMIF research under adverse weather conditions to train models.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose an all-weather MMIF algorithm (AWFusion) that integrates both deweathering and fusion within one framework to provide robust fusion under adverse weather.

- Deweathering module uses distillation learning to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher networks trained on different weathers to one student network. This avoids needing separate models for each weather type.  

- Propose a physically-aware clear feature prediction block based on an atmospheric scattering model to predict clear image features from illumination, depth and transmission features. This interpretable design avoids empirical network tuning.

- Fusion module uses a learned low-rank representation to decompose images into global low-rank and local sparse components. Fuse them separately with tailored rules to extract shared and unique multi-modality features.

- Propose an anti-interference perceptual learning strategy to enable network to eliminate interfering pixels itself during fusion.

Main Contributions:

- First work to simultaneously address MMIF and adverse weather removal, defining a new challenging task

- Interpretable and physically-aware deweathering module to comprehensively restore clear features

- Feature separation based fusion module to reconstruct local and global features from sparse and low-rank components 

- Collected and combined datasets to build a 100k image MMIF benchmark (AWMM-100k) under adverse weather for various vision tasks

- State-of-the-art performance demonstrated across metrics for image fusion under rain, snow and haze conditions


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end all-weather multi-modality image fusion framework called AWFusion, which effectively fuses and recovers perturbed multi-modality visual information under various adverse weather conditions like rain, haze and snow in a unified architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It proposes an end-to-end all-weather multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) framework that can effectively fuse and recover perturbed multi-modality information under adverse weather conditions like rain, haze, and snow. This is the first work to simultaneously address MMIF and adverse weather removal, defining a new challenging task.

2) It proposes a physically-aware clear feature prediction block (PFB) that comprehensively accounts for the restoration of clear features based on an atmospheric scattering model, avoiding time-consuming empirical network design. It also evaluates recovered images using depth information recovery and semantic loss. 

3) It proposes a feature separation-based fusion module that considers reconstruction of local and global features from sparse and low-rank components. It also develops an anti-interference interactive perceptual learning strategy (APLS) to enhance the network's capability to effectively remove interfering pixels.

4) It builds a large-scale dataset AWMM-100k dedicated to MMIF research under adverse weather containing 100,000 aligned infrared and visible image pairs with object detection labels. This establishes a versatile benchmark for various vision tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is an end-to-end framework for simultaneous image fusion and adverse weather removal, enabled by physically-aware building blocks and robust learning strategies. The large dedicated dataset is also an important contribution.
