# [Language Resources for Dutch Large Language Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12852)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces language resources for Dutch language modeling, including two finetuned Llama 2 models, four translated instructional datasets, a leaderboard for generative model benchmarks, and results for several state-of-the-art models, while discussing limitations of current evaluation methods for fluency and user experience.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1) The introduction of two fine-tuned variants of the Llama 2 13B model for Dutch - one trained on Dutch web data and one further fine-tuned on synthetic instruction/chat datasets. The datasets and model weights are made publicly available.

2) The release of translated Dutch variants of several popular instruction datasets (Dolly, Quora, Stack Overflow, Alpaca) to help train Dutch language models. Code is provided to easily translate more datasets. 

3) The creation of a leaderboard to benchmark and track the performance of Dutch language models on a variety of generation tasks. Results are provided for several state-of-the-art models.

4) A discussion of the current state of Dutch language models and what is still needed to advance the field, including more transparent and high-quality training data, Dutch-specific evaluations, and a focus on natural language generation capabilities.

In summary, the paper aims to provide resources (datasets, models, benchmarks) to help accelerate Dutch language model research, while also identifying areas needing further work.
