# [Syn-QA2: Evaluating False Assumptions in Long-tail Questions with   Synthetic QA Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12145)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Syn-(QA)$^2$,  synthetic question answering (QA) datasets for evaluating the effect of false assumptions in question answering across both single-hop factual questions and multi-hop questions.

The key motivation is that false assumptions or premises in questions pose substantial challenges for QA systems. However, recent work has mostly studied naturally occurring questions. So there is a gap in analyzing how models perform with the long tail of possible questions and there are only modest dataset sizes available (only hundreds of test examples in some cases).

To address this, the authors generate two synthetic datasets using minimal perturbation of Wikidata triples and the HotpotQA dataset:

(1) The single-hop questions are created by sampling Wikidata relation triples, perturbing one entity to create false triples and then generating questions that assume those triples are true. 

(2) The multi-hop questions are created by swapping entity mentions in the HotpotQA dataset with similar entity mentions from distractor documents, leading to false assumptions.

This process results in 1812 question pairs where each pair contains a question with and without a false assumption.

Experiments evaluate several state-of-the-art language models on false assumption detection and on generative QA.

The key findings are:

(1) False assumptions remain challenging, confirming previous work. 

(2) Detection is surprisingly more challenging than generative QA, possibly due to complex linguistic structure.  

(3) Detection is harder on synthetic long-tail examples than natural examples, showing the value of the datasets.

Overall, this work makes available new resources for analyzing robustness and provides analysis highlighting remaining challenges in avoiding false assumptions. The generation methodology enables minimal pair analysis and studies of the long tail of possible questions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Syn-(QA)2, two synthetic QA datasets with single-hop and multi-hop questions containing false assumptions, generated by perturbing entities in Wikidata and HotpotQA, to evaluate the ability of language models to handle false assumptions, especially in long-tail questions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of Syn-(QA)$^2$, a collection of two synthetic English QA datasets generated using entity perturbation on Wikidata and HotpotQA. These datasets are intended to evaluate the effect of false assumptions in both single-hop and multi-hop QA. Specifically, the paper states:

"To this end, we introduce Syn-(QA)$^2$ (synthetic questions with questionable assumptions, inspired by (QA)$^2$ of \citealt{kim-etal-2023-qa}),\footnote{The dataset is available at \url{https://github.com/ashwindaswanibu/QAQA-Synthetic-Dataset}.} a collection of two synthetic English QA datasets generated using entity perturbation on \href{https://www.wikidata.org}{Wikidata} and HotpotQA \citep{yang-etal-2018-hotpotqa}, to evaluate the effect of false assumptions in both single-hop and multi-hop QA."

So in summary, the main contribution is the introduction and analysis of the new Syn-(QA)$^2$ synthetic QA datasets for evaluating the effect of false assumptions.

The paper introduces two new synthetically generated QA datasets called Syn-(QA)$^2$ that contain minimal pairs of questions with and without false assumptions. The goal is to evaluate the ability of QA systems and large language models to handle false assumptions, especially in long-tail, less frequent types of questions. The datasets are constructed by perturbing entities in Wikidata and HotpotQA through an entity replacement approach. Experiments demonstrate that false assumptions continue to challenge current LLMs and that detection is more difficult for synthetic long-tail questions versus naturally occurring ones. Overall, the paper is focused on evaluating the robustness of QA systems to questionable assumptions using targeted synthetic data generation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces two synthetic QA datasets - one generated from Wikidata and one from HotpotQA. What was the motivation behind creating two datasets from different sources rather than just one? How do the datasets complement each other?

2. The paper uses entity replacement to introduce false assumptions. What other methods could be used to synthetically generate questions with false assumptions? What are the tradeoffs of the different approaches? 

3. The similarity threshold hyperparameter θ is used to control entity replacement. What effect would changing this threshold have? How should the value for θ be set optimally?

4. The paper finds that detection is more challenging for synthetic long-tail questions compared to natural questions. Why might this be the case? Does the distribution shift between natural and synthetic questions fully explain this gap?

5. The authors hypothesize nested linguistic structure makes detection harder than QA itself. What experiments could be done to further analyze this? Are there question formulation variations that could change the difficulty?

6. The paper uses accuracy for automatic evaluation and human judgment for generative QA. What other metrics could complement the analysis? What are the tradeoffs?

7. The dataset contains minimal pairs that differ by one entity. Does this simplify the task versus more complex perturbations? How could the generation approach introduce more complex false assumptions?  

8. What potential negative societal impacts need to be considered if false synthetic assumptions become widespread? How can the risks be mitigated?

9. The paper focuses on English QA. How could the methodology be adapted to generate synthetic false assumption data for other languages? What would need to change?

10. The datasets are generated from structured data sources. Could a similar perturbation approach work for unstructured text data? What methods would need to change to enable application to raw text?
