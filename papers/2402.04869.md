# [Learning by Doing: An Online Causal Reinforcement Learning Framework   with Causal-Aware Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04869)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents lack interpretability and sample efficiency in decision-making. Incorporating causal knowledge can help reduce the searching space and improve interpretability. However, existing methods either rely on fixed prior causal knowledge or learn causal structures separately from policy learning, lacking efficiency. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an online causal reinforcement learning framework that alternates between causal structure learning and policy learning:

1) Causal structure learning: 
- Models state transitions as a causal graph
- Formulates causal structure updates into the RL interaction process with active intervention 
- Estimates treatment effects between state variables to identify causal relationships
- Refines the causal graph using a score-based approach  

2) Causal-aware policy learning:
- Constructs a causal mask from learned causal graph to reduce action space 
- Optimizes a masked policy guided by causal knowledge to improve sample efficiency

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a framework to iteratively learn causal graph and optimize causal policy 
- Devises causal structure learning method using interventions and treatment effects
- Provides theoretical guarantees on identifiability of causal graph and performance bounds relating causal graph and policy values
- Demonstrates improved sample efficiency, lower exploration risk, faster convergence over SOTA RL algorithms in a simulated fault alarm environment

The key innovation is the virtuous cycle enabled between causal structure learning and policy optimization. By alternating the two steps, the framework is able to construct interpretable causal knowledge for better policy learning, while policy explorations generate useful interventions for more accurate causal discovery.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an online causal reinforcement learning framework that alternates between using interventions to learn a causal structure to guide policy exploration and using the learned causal structure to mask irrelevant actions and accelerate policy convergence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes an online causal reinforcement learning framework, including causal structure and policy learning. It interactively constructs compact and interpretable causal knowledge via intervention (doing), in order to facilitate policy optimization (learning).

2. It proposes a causal structure learning method that automatically updates local causal structures by evaluating the treatment effects of interventions during agent-environment interactions. Based on the learned causal model, it also develops a causal-aware policy optimization method triggered by a causal mask. 

3. It derives theoretical guarantees from aspects of both causality and RL: identifiability of the causal structure and performance guarantee of the iterative optimization on the convergence of policy that can be bounded by the causal structure.

4. It experimentally demonstrates that introducing causal structure during policy training can greatly reduce the action space, decrease exploration risk, and accelerate policy convergence.

In summary, the main contribution is an online causal reinforcement learning framework that alternates between causal structure learning through interventions and causal-aware policy optimization to achieve improved performance. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation on a simulated fault alarm environment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The paper proposes an online causal reinforcement learning framework that alternates between causal structure learning through interventions and causal-aware policy learning. Key aspects include modeling the causal relationships between states, formulating causal structure learning into the RL interaction process using treatment effects, constructing a causal mask to guide policy learning, and providing theoretical guarantees on identifiability of the causal structure and performance of the framework. The interaction between performing interventions, updating the causal graph, and improving the policy highlights the online, causal learning by doing nature of the proposed approach.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the paper formulate the causal structure updating into the reinforcement learning interaction process with active intervention learning of the environment? What assumptions does this formulation make?

7. What are the key differences between the implicit and explicit modeling approaches for incorporating causality into reinforcement learning discussed in the related work? What limitations does the paper highlight?

8. What modifications would need to be made to apply the proposed framework to a continuous control task instead of the discrete action space fault alarm environment?

9. How sensitive is the performance of the proposed method to errors or inaccuracies in the learned causal structure over time? Is there any analysis exploring this?
