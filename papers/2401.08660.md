# [Gemini Pro Defeated by GPT-4V: Evidence from Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08660)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Comparing the capabilities of two leading vision-language models (VLMs), GPT-4V and Gemini Pro, for educational applications is valuable but lacking in research. Specifically, their performance on automatic scoring of student-drawn models using the Notation-Enhanced Rubrics for Image Feedback (NERIF) method is unknown.  

Methods:
- The study analyzed 600 student-drawn models across 6 science assessment tasks using NERIF prompting for both GPT-4V and Gemini Pro. Quantitative scoring performance metrics and qualitative analysis of model responses were conducted.

- An additional analysis adapted NERIF for Gemini Pro by reducing image complexity to improve its weaker performance.

Results:
- GPT-4V significantly outperformed Gemini Pro in scoring accuracy (0.48 vs 0.30 on one task) and other metrics. GPT-4V successfully scored all tasks while Gemini Pro only managed scoring for 1 task.

- Qualitative analysis revealed Gemini Pro's limitations in handling fine-grained text, misclassifying images, and using few-shot examples compared to GPT-4V.

- Adapting NERIF for Gemini Pro showed some improvement but not enough to match GPT-4V's level of performance.

Contributions:
- First study comparing GPT-4V and Gemini Pro on an educational assessment task, setting benchmarks.

- Showcases GPT-4V's advanced multimodal capabilities for automatic scoring.

- Uncovers specific limitations of Gemini Pro in educational contexts.

- Highlights challenges of adapting AI frameworks (NERIF) to improve existing models. 

- Provides directions for developing more sophisticated, context-aware AI tools for complex educational assessments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:

In comparing the performance of the AI models GPT-4V and Gemini Pro on scoring student-drawn scientific models, GPT-4V significantly outperformed Gemini Pro in terms of scoring accuracy and other metrics due to its superior ability to process fine-grained text and images in the assessment materials.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a comprehensive comparison between two state-of-the-art vision-language models, Gemini Pro and GPT-4V, in terms of their performance on an educational task - scoring student-drawn models using the NERIF (Notation-Enhanced Rubrics for Image Feedback) method. 

2. It highlights GPT-4V's superior accuracy and capabilities in image classification and processing detailed text in images compared to Gemini Pro. Through both quantitative scoring metrics and qualitative analysis, the paper shows that GPT-4V significantly outperforms Gemini Pro on the educational scoring task.

3. It uncovers specific limitations in Gemini Pro's scoring performance, including failing to recognize fine-grained text in images, misclassifying images as scientific posters, and failing to retrieve few-shot examples. This provides insights into why Gemini Pro underperformed compared to GPT-4V.

4. It shows that even after adapting the NERIF prompting approach to cater to Gemini Pro's capabilities, there was limited improvement in its performance. This highlights the complexity of adapting AI frameworks for different models.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive empirical comparison of two state-of-the-art AI models on a multimodal educational assessment task, providing insights into their capabilities, limitations, and performance differences. The findings have implications for the development and use of AI in education going forward.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using the NERIF (Notation-Enhanced Rubrics for Image Feedback) method for constructing prompts to elicit better performance from AI models on scoring student-drawn models. What are the key components of a NERIF prompt and how might they improve an AI model's understanding of the scoring task?

2. The authors tested two AI models â€“ GPT-4V and Gemini Pro. What are the key architectural and training differences between these models that might account for differences in performance on the educational scoring task examined in this study?

3. The results show that GPT-4V significantly outperformed Gemini Pro on scoring accuracy for student drawings. What qualitative analysis did the authors conduct to try to uncover reasons behind Gemini Pro's poorer performance? What limitations did they uncover?

4. Even after adapting the NERIF prompting approach for Gemini Pro, why was the authors' attempt to improve its scoring performance unsuccessful? What does this suggest about the complexity of adapting AI frameworks for specific educational tasks?  

5. This study focuses specifically on having AI models score student-drawn scientific models representing conceptual understanding. How might the nature of this visual assessment task, versus a textual short answer task, introduce complexities in AI scoring capability? What additional multimodal reasoning capabilities are required?

6. The authors calculate a Quadratic Weighted Kappa score to account for severity of AI-human rating disagreements. Why is this preferable to a simple accuracy score for this type of AI scoring evaluation? How does the QWK further demonstrate GPT-4V's superior performance over Gemini Pro?

7. The authors note that GPT-4V seems adept at processing detailed text embedded within student drawings. Could the models' different handling of textual elements provide additional explanation behind performance differences? Might their training on different datasets be a factor?

8. What role might the few-shot examples play in enabling successful AI scoring capability, as suggested in prior work and hinted at in the qualitative analysis for GPT-4V? Does the ability to effectively leverage few-shot examples seem to differ between the models?  

9. The findings contribute specifically to the literature on AI in educational assessment by demonstrating and comparing practical applications. What other domains might these visual scoring capabilities transfer or extend to? Where else might multimodal scoring be beneficial?

10. In the conclusion, the authors highlight the intricacy in adapting AI systems for nuanced educational tasks. What open questions remain regarding how to tailor AI tools for robust performance across varied content areas and assessment types? What directions should future research take?
