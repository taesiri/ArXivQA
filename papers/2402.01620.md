# [MAGDi: Structured Distillation of Multi-Agent Interaction Graphs   Improves Reasoning in Smaller Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01620)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning capabilities, but running multiple LLMs to allow them to interact (e.g. in discussions/debates) is very expensive. 
- Existing multi-LLM interaction frameworks are inefficient as they require invoking all models at test time, rather than producing a single efficient model.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MAGDi, a method to distill the reasoning knowledge from multi-LLM interactions into a smaller, more efficient student LLM.
- Interactions between teachers are represented as Multi-Agent Interaction Graphs (MAGs), directed acyclic graphs with nodes as model responses and edges denoting interaction structure.
- MAGDi augments a student model with a graph neural network to learn structure-aware representations of reasoning chains in MAGs. 
- The student model is trained with three objectives aligned to learning from: (1) correct reasoning chains, (2) contrasting correct/incorrect chains, (3) graph structure and interactions.

Key Contributions:
- MAGDi outperforms single-teacher distillation baselines by 4.6% on average across 7 reasoning benchmarks.
- MAGDi reduces inference cost (based on output tokens) by up to 9x compared to the expensive multi-LLM framework it distills knowledge from.
- Analysis shows MAGDi's effectiveness scales positively across base student models, enables better generalization via multi-task training, and boosts inference-time algorithms like self-consistency.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in distilling knowledge from complex multi-agent LLM interactions into efficient standalone student models without losing reasoning performance. The proposed MAGDi method is shown to be widely effective, scalable and generalizable.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to distill reasoning knowledge from the interactions between multiple teacher language models into a smaller, more efficient student model using graph-based representations and objectives.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a new method called MAGDi for structured distillation of multi-agent interaction graphs. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes representing the interactions between multiple teacher language models as graphs (called multi-agent interaction graphs or MAGs). These graphs encode the conversation structure between teachers as they collaboratively solve reasoning problems over multiple rounds.

2) The paper develops a structured distillation method that enables student models to learn from these MAGs. MAGDi trains student models by augmenting them with graph neural networks and using objectives that teach them to model positive reasoning chains, contrast correct and incorrect reasoning, and capture the graph structure. 

3) Experiments on 7 reasoning benchmarks show MAGDi outperforms single-teacher and multi-teacher baselines, improving student accuracy while maintaining efficiency. Additional analyses demonstrate MAGDi's generalizability, scalability w.r.t. student model size, and benefits for ensemble diversity.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel graph-based approach for structured knowledge distillation from collaborative teacher interactions that enhances reasoning in smaller student models.

The paper introduces "Multi-Agent Interaction Graphs (MAGs)", which are graph-based representations of the interactions between multiple teacher language models as they collaboratively solve reasoning tasks through discussion. The paper then proposes a structured distillation method called "MAGDi" that distills the knowledge in these interaction graphs into a smaller, more efficient student language model. Key aspects of MAGDi include using objectives like next-token prediction, contrastive loss, and graph-based node classification to teach the student from the correct reasoning, incorrect reasoning, and conversational structure present in the MAGs. The method is evaluated on commonsense and math reasoning tasks, demonstrating improvements in student reasoning capabilities and inference efficiency compared to single-teacher baselines.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes representing multi-agent interactions as graphs (MAGs). What are the key advantages of using a graph-based representation over other possible representations of multi-agent interactions?

2. The paper describes a 4-level framework for structured distillation from MAGs. Can you explain the motivation and intuition behind each of these levels? How do they build on top of each other?  

3. The method uses three loss functions - next token prediction, contrastive, and graph-based losses. Why is each of these losses important? What unique aspect of knowledge transfer do they capture?

4. How does the proposed method balance performance gains with efficiency compared to prior methods like ReConcile? What specifically leads to the efficiency gains?

5. The paper shows that the method generalizes well to out-of-domain datasets. What properties of multi-teacher distillation might explain these generalizability improvements?  

6. Self-consistency relies on diversity between model outputs. Why does distillation from multiple teachers boost improvements from self-consistency compared to a single teacher baseline?

7. The paper analyzes how performance scales with different base student models. Why might a better base model lead to larger gains from structured distillation? Are there any limits to these scaling trends?

8. What types of multi-agent interactions and conversational structures can MAGs flexibly represent? What assumptions does it make regarding agent outputs?

9. The paper focuses on reasoning tasks. For what other tasks could you foresee multi-agent interactions and structured distillation being useful?

10. The paper uses specific LM architectures and benchmarks. How could the structured distillation framework be extended to other model families (e.g. vision models) and tasks (e.g. VQA)? What components would need to change?
