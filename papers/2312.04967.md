# [Control of a pendulum system: From simulation to reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04967)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper explores using simulation to model the dynamics and control of a physical pendulum system. Through experiments, the parameters defining the dynamics of the hardware pendulum system are determined, including the inertial, damping, and gravitational force coefficients. Using these parameters, a simulation environment is created to emulate the hardware system. A linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller is designed and tested under noise disturbance in both the simulation and on the physical hardware. The system responses from the simulation and hardware are compared, with the hardware data interpolated to match the simulation timestep. Statistical analysis shows strong agreement between the simulation and hardware - the mean and standard deviation of the differences in position and velocity are nearly zero. This validates that an approximated simulation model can effectively capture the dynamics and closed-loop control response of the real system, enabling testing and refinement of control algorithms in simulation before hardware implementation. Overall, this methodology provides a pathway to safely and rapidly prototype robotic systems.
