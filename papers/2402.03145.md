# [SafEDMD: A certified learning architecture tailored to data-driven   control of nonlinear dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03145)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of controlling unknown nonlinear dynamical systems in a safe and reliable way using only sampled state data. Specifically, it focuses on developing a framework that can learn an accurate model from data, design a controller based on that model, and provide guarantees that the closed-loop system will operate safely. 

Proposed Solution - SafEDMD Learning Architecture:
The core contribution is a new data-driven learning framework called "SafEDMD" that has the following key features:

1) It learns a bilinear surrogate model of the unknown system based on the Koopman operator theory. This leads to a model that is linear in lifted state observables and bilinear in the control input.

2) The learning relies solely on sampled state data, avoiding the need for noisy derivative measurements. 

3) It comes with rigorous proportional error bounds between the true Koopman operator dynamics and learned model. Notably, these error bounds vanish at zero input/state.

4) It enables reliable controller design, e.g. for stabilization, using robust control techniques by explicitly accounting for the guaranteed model uncertainty.


Main Contributions:

1) New SafEDMD learning architecture specifically tailored for reliable data-driven control of nonlinear systems, with certificates.

2) Novel proportional error bounds for the surrogate model that depend on the data length and sampling rate.

3) Controller design procedure leveraging SafEDMD to stabilize unknown nonlinear systems by robustly stabilizing the learned model. Stability certificates provided.  

4) Demonstrated successful control of nonlinear benchmark examples using SafEDMD where existing methods fail due to lack of appropriate model uncertainty characterization.

In summary, the paper develops the theory and algorithms to enable safe data-driven control for complex nonlinear systems by properly addressing model uncertainty. The results highlight the power of blending machine learning based on Koopman operator theory with robust control methods.
