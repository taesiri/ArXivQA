# [Multi-rotor Aerial Vehicles in Physical Interactions: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02635)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

In this survey paper, the authors conduct a comprehensive categorization and analysis of the research literature on multi-rotor aerial vehicles (MAVs) involved in physical interactions. They define physical interactions for MAVs as the process by which external forces influence and change the states of the MAV and any entities it contacts, while the MAV acts to control these interactions. The interactions are categorized based on the rigidity of models into rigid, soft, contactless, hybrid, with detailed case studies provided of different methods and mechanisms that enable MAVs to initiate controlled physical interactions in each category. The authors evaluate control strategies commonly applied for MAVs in these interactions and discuss their complexity tradeoffs. They conclude that collaborative behaviors using modular and reconfigurable MAV platforms will drive progress in more complex, capable and generalizable aerial physical interactions and manipulations in unstructured real-world environments. Insightful discussions are provided on abstracting MAV capabilities around actuation and disturbance forces and on model complexity versus control constraints.
