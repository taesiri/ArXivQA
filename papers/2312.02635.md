# [Multi-rotor Aerial Vehicles in Physical Interactions: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02635)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

In this survey paper, the authors conduct a comprehensive categorization and analysis of the research literature on multi-rotor aerial vehicles (MAVs) involved in physical interactions. They define physical interactions for MAVs as the process by which external forces influence and change the states of the MAV and any entities it contacts, while the MAV acts to control these interactions. The interactions are categorized based on the rigidity of models into rigid, soft, contactless, hybrid, with detailed case studies provided of different methods and mechanisms that enable MAVs to initiate controlled physical interactions in each category. The authors evaluate control strategies commonly applied for MAVs in these interactions and discuss their complexity tradeoffs. They conclude that collaborative behaviors using modular and reconfigurable MAV platforms will drive progress in more complex, capable and generalizable aerial physical interactions and manipulations in unstructured real-world environments. Insightful discussions are provided on abstracting MAV capabilities around actuation and disturbance forces and on model complexity versus control constraints.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on multi-rotor aerial vehicles (MAVs) involved in physical interactions. The key research question explored is: What tasks are MAVs most suitable for and what are their advantageous characteristics and mechanisms compared to other robots when performing these tasks? 

The paper first defines physical interaction as the process where external forces/torques (referred to as "influence") change the states of entities (i.e. MAV and objects it interacts with) and the MAV acts to control the interaction to accomplish a task. Four types of physical interactions are categorized based on model rigidity:

1) Rigid interaction: All entities are rigid, with at least one fixed connection point between them. This includes rigid manipulator attachments to MAVs, direct rigid attachment between MAVs and objects, and direct contact grasps using the MAV body.

2) Soft interaction: Entities deform to a considerable degree. Enablement mechanisms involve ropes, bendables like beams, and elastics like springs. MAVs interact with these to transport, manipulate or stabilize them.

3) No contact interaction: MAVs interact with environment using equipment like thermometers, wireless chargers etc. without physical contact.

4) Hybrid interaction: Interactions with phase shifts, like grippers that transition from soft contact to rigid grasp.

Case studies are analyzed using the proposed physical interaction terminology. Unique capabilities of MAVs stemming from distributed actuation, agility and flexibility are highlighted as reasons for their effectiveness. For instance, adding rotors straightforwardly increases strength unlike in manipulator arms. Modular designs also help tackle different interactions without much change. 

Four control strategies are evaluated: PID, adaptive control, optimal control and learning-based control. A quantitative complexity analysis is performed by comparing controller versus system dimensionality. Key insights include the ability of approaches to simplify interaction modeling and avoid over-constraining MAV actuation.

The paper concludes that future MAV physical interaction research should focus on collaborative tasks performed by modular MAVs. It provides a principled understanding of interaction types, mechanisms, modeling and control to illuminate this direction.
