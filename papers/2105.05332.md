# The DEVIL is in the Details: A Diagnostic Evaluation Benchmark for Video   Inpainting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we develop a more comprehensive, diagnostic benchmark for evaluating video inpainting methods that provides insight into their failure modes?The key points are:- Existing video inpainting benchmarks focus on reconstruction error and don't sufficiently account for the impact of video and mask content on task difficulty. - Attributes like camera motion, background scene motion, and mask size/motion affect how easily appearance information can be borrowed across frames, but aren't controlled for in current benchmarks.- The authors propose the DEVIL benchmark comprising a novel dataset and evaluation scheme to enable more insightful analysis into video inpainting methods. - The DEVIL dataset contains videos and masks annotated with content attributes that characterize key failure modes. - The DEVIL evaluation measures performance on dataset slices where one attribute is fixed, across metrics like reconstruction, realism, and consistency.- Analyzing performance on these slices reveals systematic weaknesses of different methods attributable to the input data.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that more diagnostic evaluation of video inpainting methods, enabled by their DEVIL benchmark, can provide greater insight into the strengths/weaknesses of different techniques. The paper presents DEVIL and demonstrates its utility for method analysis.
