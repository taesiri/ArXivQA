# [Stack More Layers Differently: High-Rank Training Through Low-Rank   Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05695)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

Can we train neural networks efficiently through low-rank updates rather than full-rank training?

Specifically, the authors propose a method called ReLoRA that utilizes low-rank matrix decompositions to train neural networks. The key ideas and hypotheses explored in this paper are:

- Simple low-rank training like LoRA struggles to train high-performing transformers. 

- Multiple independent low-rank updates can accumulate to a high-rank change in weights based on the rank of sum property.

- ReLoRA enables high-rank training through multiple restarted low-rank updates. It also uses other techniques like warm starts, jagged learning rates, and optimizer resets.

- ReLoRA can achieve comparable performance to full-rank training, especially for large transformer models.

- The efficiency and advantages of ReLoRA increase for larger model sizes.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that repeatedly composing low-rank updates through restarts and other training techniques can enable efficient high-rank training that matches or exceeds standard full-rank training, especially for large models. ReLoRA is proposed and evaluated as a method to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel low-rank training method called ReLoRA (Reinitialized Low-Rank Training) for efficiently training large transformer language models. The key ideas are:

- Leveraging the property that a sum of low-rank matrices can result in a high-rank update to train a high-rank network through multiple low-rank parameter updates. 

- Using full-rank warm-up training initially to initialize the network, similar to lottery ticket hypothesis.

- Introducing periodic restarts where the low-rank factors are merged into the original weights, reinitialized and training continues. 

- Using a jagged learning rate schedule and partial optimizer resets to stabilize training across restarts.

The proposed ReLoRA method is evaluated by training transformer language models up to 350M parameters. The results show that ReLoRA can match the performance of full-rank training and outperforms naive low-rank training. The efficiency benefits are more significant for larger models, making ReLoRA promising for training giant multi-billion parameter models.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and demonstrating a practical low-rank training method that can efficiently train large neural networks to match the performance of standard full-rank training.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called ReLoRA for efficient training of large neural networks, which uses low-rank updates through restarts and other techniques to approximate full-rank training dynamics and achieve comparable performance to regular training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related work:

- The paper focuses on low-rank training techniques for large neural networks, particularly transformer language models. This is an active area of research, but most prior work has focused on other network architectures like CNNs or smaller Transformers. This paper demonstrates low-rank training on larger transformer LMs.

- The paper proposes a new method called ReLoRA that performs high-rank updates through multiple low-rank updates during training. This approach is novel compared to prior low-rank training methods that are restricted to low-rank updates throughout. 

- ReLoRA incorporates techniques like restarts, jagged learning rate schedules, and partial optimizer resets to stabilize training. These modifications are crucial for good performance, as shown through ablation studies. Other papers on low-rank training do not include similar enhancements.

- The paper evaluates ReLoRA on transformer LMs up to 350M parameters. Most prior work on low-rank training uses smaller CNNs or Transformer models. Showing competitiveness on larger LMs is an important contribution.

- A key result is that ReLoRA's efficiency improves with model size. This suggests its potential for very large, billion+ parameter models where efficiency is critical. Other low-rank methods have not demonstrated clear scaling advantages.

- Theoretical motivation draws connections to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis and intrinsic dimensionality. This helps situate ReLoRA in the context of other theories about neural network training dynamics.

Overall, the proposed ReLoRA method and its evaluation on larger transformer LMs advances low-rank training research specifically for large neural networks where efficiency is most needed. The results demonstrate promising scaling behavior not shown in prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Scaling ReLoRA to even larger models beyond 350M parameters. The authors believe the true potential of ReLoRA will be realized at 1B+ scale, where they expect to see larger improvements in efficiency over full-rank training.

- Comparing ReLoRA to other low-rank training methods like SpArSe Training and ELRT. The authors suggest exploring potential synergies between these approaches.

- Further improving the efficiency of the ReLoRA implementation, for example through gradient checkpointing, custom backward functions, and quantizing the frozen model weights.

- Applying ReLoRA to other modalities beyond language modeling, such as computer vision. The authors briefly mention they tried it for an image classification task but do not report detailed results.

- Gaining more theoretical understanding of why ReLoRA works and relating it to concepts like the lottery ticket hypothesis and neural network trainability. The authors suggest low-rank training could provide insights into these open questions. 

- Exploring whether the performance gap between ReLoRA and full training can be further reduced, especially for smaller models where a gap remained. This may require optimizing hyperparameters like the learning rate schedule.

In summary, the main suggested directions are 1) scaling ReLoRA up, 2) comparing it to related techniques, 3) improving its efficiency further, 4) applying it to new tasks/modalities, and 5) gaining theoretical understanding of why it works. The authors position ReLoRA as a promising approach for efficient large-scale model training that merits further research along these dimensions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel method called ReLoRa for training large neural networks. ReLoRa utilizes low-rank matrix decomposition (similar to LoRA for fine-tuning) to perform low-rank updates during training. However, unlike standard low-rank training methods, ReLoRa is able to achieve high-rank updates cumulatively through restarting the low-rank decomposition multiple times. This allows ReLoRa to train models that achieve similar performance to full-rank training. The method also utilizes other techniques like partial optimizer resets, jagged learning rate scheduling, and full-rank warm starts to stabilize training. The authors evaluate ReLoRa on transformer language models up to 350M parameters and show it matches or exceeds the performance of baseline methods, with increasing benefits as model size grows. They argue ReLoRa makes training very large models more efficient and can also provide insights into the trainability and generalization of overparametrized models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called ReLoRA (Restarted Low-Rank Training with Resets) for training large neural networks more efficiently. The key idea is to perform high-rank weight updates through a sequence of low-rank updates. This is based on the mathematical property that the sum of multiple low-rank matrices can result in a high-rank matrix. 

ReLoRA initializes the network with full-rank training and then switches to low-rank training using the LoRA method. It introduces several techniques like restarts, jagged learning rate scheduling, and partial optimizer resets to stabilize training. Experiments on transformer language models up to 350M parameters show that ReLoRA achieves comparable perplexity to full-rank training and significantly outperforms vanilla low-rank training. The efficiency benefits of ReLoRA also increase with model size. Overall, ReLoRA offers a promising approach to train large neural networks efficiently by accumulating high-rank updates from low-rank approximations during training. The authors believe ReLoRA can help democratize training of multi-billion parameter models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel low-rank training method called ReLoRA for efficiently training large transformer language models. ReLoRA builds on the idea of LoRA, a low-rank matrix factorization technique, but addresses its limitations in effectively training high-performing models. The key idea is to perform multiple low-rank updates to achieve a high-rank overall change to the network weights. ReLoRA utilizes an initial full-rank warm start, followed by cyclic merge-and-reinit of the low-rank factors, partial optimizer resets, and a jagged learning rate schedule. Together, these enable ReLoRA to train networks that perform similarly to full-rank baselines, with improved efficiency that grows with model size. Experiments demonstrate ReLoRA's effectiveness on transformer LMs with up to 350M parameters.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper introduces a new method called ReLoRA for training large neural networks more efficiently. The key problems and questions it is trying to address are:

- Overparametrized models with billions of parameters require huge amounts of computation and memory to train, making them inaccessible to most researchers. Can we develop more efficient training methods?
