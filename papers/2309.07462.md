# [Are Large Language Model-based Evaluators the Solution to Scaling Up   Multilingual Evaluation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07462)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether large language model (LLM)-based evaluators can help scale up multilingual evaluation. Specifically, the authors investigate whether LLMs can serve as substitutes or supplements for human native speakers in delivering useful and accurate insights regarding LLM outputs in non-English languages. The key aspects explored are whether LLM-based evaluators can provide evaluations comparable to human judgments across diverse tasks, metrics, and languages.

The authors frame this as an important research direction due to the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLMs across many languages to identify performance disparities. However, obtaining human evaluations across languages is challenging, making LLM-based evaluators a potentially attractive solution. The paper aims to assess whether this is a viable path forward by calibrating LLM-based evaluators against human judgments across multiple dimensions.

In summary, the central research question is whether LLM-based evaluation can reliably substitute for human evaluation in the multilingual setting, helping scale up assessments of LLMs across diverse languages. The authors investigate this through systematic comparisons to human annotator judgments across tasks, metrics, and languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is investigating whether large language model (LLM)-based evaluators can help scale up multilingual evaluation. Specifically, the authors:

- Present the first evaluation of LLMs as multilingual evaluators to examine whether LLMs can be used to scale up multilingual evaluation. 

- Calibrate LLM judgments across three tasks (open prompt text generation, text continuation, and summarization), eight languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Czech), and five dimensions (linguistic acceptability, content quality, task completion, problematic content, hallucinations) by comparing them to over 20K human judgments.

- Evaluate a variety of prompting strategies for LLM-based evaluation in the multilingual setting.

- Provide a framework for evaluating LLM-evaluators in the multilingual setting that can generalize across tasks, metrics, and languages. 

- Suggest best practices and recommendations for future work on using LLMs as evaluators for non-English languages.

The key findings are that LLM-based evaluators may exhibit biases towards higher scores compared to human judgments, especially for non-Latin script and lower-resource languages. The authors advocate for a cautious approach in using LLM evaluators for non-English languages and suggest calibrating them with human judgments. Overall, this is the first comprehensive study investigating if LLM-based evaluators can help scale multilingual evaluation, providing insights into their capabilities and limitations in this context.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates whether large language model-based evaluators can help scale up multilingual evaluation and finds they exhibit bias towards higher scores, especially for under-resourced and non-Latin script languages, indicating they should be used cautiously and calibrated with human judgments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of using large language models (LLMs) as evaluators:

- This is the first work I'm aware of that focuses specifically on evaluating LLMs as multilingual evaluators. Most prior work has focused on English only. Looking at the capabilities and limitations of LLMs as evaluators across diverse languages is an important contribution.

- The approach of calibrating LLM evaluations against thousands of human judgments across metrics, tasks, and languages provides useful insights. Many prior studies compare to much smaller human annotated datasets. 

- The analysis of different prompting strategies like single vs compound prompts and zero-shot vs few-shot is also novel, especially in the multilingual setting. This provides guidance on best practices.

- The study is limited to a single LLM model (GPT-4) and a text generation application. Expanding the variety of models and tasks evaluated would strengthen the conclusions.

- The comparison of high resource and non-Latin script languages provides useful indicators of where LLMs struggle as evaluators. Testing on truly low-resource languages could further illuminate challenges.

- The findings align with other recent studies showing issues like score bias when using LLMs for evaluation. The recommendations around careful use and calibration reinforce conclusions from related work.

- The multilingual perspective and focus on scaling up evaluation in under-studied languages is an important addition. Most prior work centers English and high-resource languages.

Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution in systematically evaluating LLMs as multilingual evaluators across dimensions like languages, tasks, and metrics. The insights on limitations and need for caution provide a balanced perspective that advances the understanding of this emerging application of LLMs. The focus on multilinguality addresses an important gap in prior literature as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Create high-quality multilingual datasets with good language coverage, multiple annotators per data point, and clear annotation instructions to calibrate LLM-based evaluators. This can help identify biases and inconsistencies in LLM evaluators.

- Explore the development of diverse evaluator personas to represent different human perspectives and achieve consensus. This can make LLM evaluators more robust. 

- Investigate better prompting approaches including automatically tuning prompts using a held-out dataset. This can improve the performance of LLM-based evaluators.

- Evaluate smaller models or models trained with more non-English data for multilingual evaluation. This can potentially reduce bias.

- Replicate the study using a dataset with a more balanced distribution of human judgments to better analyze LLM evaluator biases.

- Explore hybrid solutions with LLM-based evaluators and native speakers in-the-loop to combine the benefits of both.

- Extend the study to more low-resource languages beyond the 8 studied to understand how LLM evaluators perform.

- Analyze the ethical implications of using LLM-based evaluators, especially in multilingual contexts, to avoid unintended consequences.

In summary, the main directions are: creating better multilingual datasets, developing more robust prompting strategies, evaluating different models, validating on more balanced data, implementing hybrid human-LLM solutions, expanding language coverage (especially low-resource languages), and analyzing ethical concerns.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores whether large language model (LLM) based evaluators can help scale up multilingual evaluation of other LLMs. The authors evaluate GPT-4 as an LLM evaluator on three text generation tasks in eight languages, comparing its judgments to over 20,000 human judgments across five metrics - linguistic acceptability, output content quality, task quality, problematic content, and hallucinations. They experiment with different prompting strategies for the LLM evaluator. Their key findings are that while LLM evaluators show high agreement with humans when there is consensus, they exhibit bias towards higher scores when humans disagree, especially for non-English and lower resourced languages. The authors recommend calibrating LLM evaluators with human judgments, using caution in adopting them for multilingual evaluation, and developing better prompting approaches to reduce bias. They advocate for creating more diverse multilingual datasets to further analyze LLM evaluators. Overall, the work provides insights into the promise and limitations of using LLMs to supplement human evaluation across languages.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as evaluators to help scale up multilingual evaluation of other language models. The authors conduct experiments evaluating LLM-based evaluators on three text generation tasks in eight languages. They collect over 20,000 human judgments across five evaluation metrics to compare against the LLM evaluator judgments. 

The results indicate that LLM-based evaluators exhibit high consistency but display a bias towards higher scores compared to human annotators, particularly for non-Latin script and lower resource languages.

They provide a framework and dataset for future work on evaluating and improving multilingual LLM-based evaluators. Overall, the paper highlights the need for caution in using LLMs for multilingual evaluation and provides suggestions for developing hybrid human-LLM solutions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper investigates whether large language model (LLM)-based evaluators can help scale up multilingual evaluation. The authors compare LLM-based evaluation judgments to over 20,000 human judgments across three text generation tasks (open prompt, continue writing, summarize), eight languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese), and five metrics (linguistic acceptability, output content quality, task quality, problematic content, hallucinations). They experiment with different prompting strategies for the LLM-based evaluators, including single vs compound prompts and zero-shot vs few-shot prompting. They analyze the calibration of the LLM-based evaluators to the human judgments by examining the percentage agreement and class distribution of scores. They also conduct ablation studies on consistency, sensitivity, temperature variation, and detailed instructions. The key findings are that LLM-based evaluators exhibit high consistency but also a bias towards higher scores compared to human judgments, especially for non-Latin script languages. The authors conclude that LLM-based evaluators should be used cautiously for multilingual evaluation and need to be calibrated with human judgments.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the question of whether large language model (LLM)-based evaluators can help scale up multilingual evaluation. 

Specifically, the authors investigate whether LLMs can serve as substitutes or supplements for human native speakers in evaluating LLM outputs in non-English languages, considering aspects like linguistic acceptability, task accomplishment, and safety.

The motivation is that while LLMs can handle many languages, most languages beyond the top 20 lack systematic evaluation. This creates an urgent need to scale up multilingual evaluation to ensure LLMs work well across diverse languages. LLM-based evaluators seem like a potential solution since they don't require human annotators, references, or benchmarks. 

However, since LLMs have shown inferior performance even in some high-resource languages, using them as evaluators needs caution, or it could worsen the digital divide. So the key question is whether LLM-based evaluators can help scale up multilingual evaluation in a fair and accurate manner.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using large language model (LLM)-based evaluators as a solution for scaling up multilingual evaluation. However, the results show the LLM-based evaluators may exhibit biases and need to be calibrated with human judgments. Why do you think the LLM-based evaluators exhibit these biases, especially for lower-resource and non-Latin script languages? How can this issue be addressed?

2. The paper experiments with different prompting strategies like single vs compound prompts and zero-shot vs few-shot prompting. However, adding few-shot examples does not seem to improve performance based on the results. Why do you think few-shot prompting does not help in this multilingual evaluation setting? What other prompting strategies could be explored?

3. The results indicate the LLM-based evaluators show lower sensitivity to perturbations for languages like Chinese and Japanese. Do you think this is an artifact of the evaluation setup and metrics or an actual limitation of the LLM-based evaluators? How can the sensitivity be improved for these languages?

4. The paper advocates using native speaker judgments to calibrate LLM-based evaluators. However, obtaining native speaker judgments can be challenging and costly. What are some ways the calibration dataset could be constructed more efficiently while ensuring diversity?

5. The LLM-based evaluators seem to perform worse on subjective metrics like output content quality compared to more objective metrics like problematic content detection. Why do you think this is the case? How can LLM-based evaluation of subjective aspects be improved?

6. The paper focuses only on generative LLM-based evaluators like GPT-4. Do you think other architectures like T5 or BLOOM may be more suitable as multilingual evaluators? Why or why not?

7. The study is limited to 8 languages. How do you think the results might generalize to lower-resource languages not covered in the paper? What additional challenges might come up?

8. The paper suggests using detailed instructions to mitigate bias in LLM-based evaluators. However, this does not eliminate the bias. What other prompting strategies could help address this issue? Can this bias be inherently addressed during model training?

9. The paper suggests a hybrid approach with both LLM-based evaluation and native speaker evaluation. What are some ways this hybrid approach could be implemented to balance benefits and limitations of both?

10. The paper focuses only on evaluating generated text outputs. Do you think LLM-based evaluators can be similarly applied to other modalities like speech or vision? What challenges might arise in those settings?
