# [VoiceCraft: Zero-Shot Speech Editing and Text-to-Speech in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16973)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles two speech processing tasks - speech editing and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS). Speech editing involves modifying parts of a recorded speech to match a target transcript while keeping the rest unchanged. Zero-shot TTS synthesizes speech in a new voice given just a few seconds of reference audio and target text, without retraining/finetuning. Doing these tasks well, especially on real-world noisy data, remains challenging.

Method: 
The paper proposes VoiceCraft, a Transformer-based neural codec language model (NCLM) that tokenizes speech audio into discrete units using an encoder (Encodec) and then models the sequence of tokens autoregressively using a decoder. The key novelty is the token rearrangement procedure involving causal masking and delayed stacking that enables the model to leverage bidirectional context when generating new tokens. This allows VoiceCraft to perform sequence infilling for editing and continuation for TTS.

For evaluation, the paper introduces a realistic speech editing dataset RealEdit with audiobook, YouTube and podcast clips. They also construct a 250 example zero-shot TTS dataset. Extensive human subjective tests are conducted in addition to standard objective metrics.

Results:
On speech editing, VoiceCraft generates audio that sounds more natural than prior work as per human ratings. Impressively, humans prefer VoiceCraft 48% of the time over original unedited audio in side-by-side preference tests. For zero-shot TTS, VoiceCraft outperforms prior state-of-the-art like VALL-E and commercial systems in terms of naturalness and similarity to the few seconds of target speakerâ€™s voice.

Contributions:
1) Proposes VoiceCraft, an NCLM for state-of-the-art speech editing and zero-shot TTS by introducing a novel token rearrangement scheme.
2) Constructs and releases RealEdit, a first-of-its-kind challenging speech editing benchmark with audiobooks, podcasts and YouTube clips.
3) Demonstrates through extensive human evaluation that VoiceCraft produces significantly better and more natural edited speech and zero-shot synthesis compared to previous models.
