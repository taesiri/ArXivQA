# [VoiceCraft: Zero-Shot Speech Editing and Text-to-Speech in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16973)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles two speech processing tasks - speech editing and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS). Speech editing involves modifying parts of a recorded speech to match a target transcript while keeping the rest unchanged. Zero-shot TTS synthesizes speech in a new voice given just a few seconds of reference audio and target text, without retraining/finetuning. Doing these tasks well, especially on real-world noisy data, remains challenging.

Method: 
The paper proposes VoiceCraft, a Transformer-based neural codec language model (NCLM) that tokenizes speech audio into discrete units using an encoder (Encodec) and then models the sequence of tokens autoregressively using a decoder. The key novelty is the token rearrangement procedure involving causal masking and delayed stacking that enables the model to leverage bidirectional context when generating new tokens. This allows VoiceCraft to perform sequence infilling for editing and continuation for TTS.

For evaluation, the paper introduces a realistic speech editing dataset RealEdit with audiobook, YouTube and podcast clips. They also construct a 250 example zero-shot TTS dataset. Extensive human subjective tests are conducted in addition to standard objective metrics.

Results:
On speech editing, VoiceCraft generates audio that sounds more natural than prior work as per human ratings. Impressively, humans prefer VoiceCraft 48% of the time over original unedited audio in side-by-side preference tests. For zero-shot TTS, VoiceCraft outperforms prior state-of-the-art like VALL-E and commercial systems in terms of naturalness and similarity to the few seconds of target speakerâ€™s voice.

Contributions:
1) Proposes VoiceCraft, an NCLM for state-of-the-art speech editing and zero-shot TTS by introducing a novel token rearrangement scheme.
2) Constructs and releases RealEdit, a first-of-its-kind challenging speech editing benchmark with audiobooks, podcasts and YouTube clips.
3) Demonstrates through extensive human evaluation that VoiceCraft produces significantly better and more natural edited speech and zero-shot synthesis compared to previous models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces VoiceCraft, a neural codec language model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on speech editing and zero-shot text-to-speech on diverse, real-world speech datasets, with edited speech nearly indistinguishable from original recordings according to human evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introduction of \modelname, a neural codec language model for speech editing that generates synthesized speech that is nearly indistinguishable from in-the-wild recordings according to human listeners. The code and model weights for \modelname are also released.

2. Demonstration that \modelname generalizes well to zero-shot text-to-speech without finetuning. 

3. Release of a high quality, challenging, and realistic speech editing evaluation dataset called \dataname.

So in summary, the main contributions are: (1) a new high-quality speech editing model, (2) showing this model also works very well for zero-shot TTS, and (3) a new dataset to evaluate speech editing models that is more realistic and challenging than previous datasets.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Neural codec language model (NCLM): The paper proposes a new NCLM named VoiceCraft for speech editing and zero-shot text-to-speech.

- Speech editing: One of the main tasks that VoiceCraft is evaluated on. This involves altering parts of a speech recording to match a modified transcript.

- Zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS): The other main task that VoiceCraft is shown to generalize well to without any finetuning. This synthesizes speech in a new voice given just a short example, rather than training on that speaker. 

- Token rearrangement: A key technique introduced in VoiceCraft, involving causal masking and delayed stacking of the neural codec tokens to enable efficient autoregressive generation. 

- RealEdit: A realistic and challenging speech editing dataset constructed and released as part of this work.

- Side-by-side evaluation: Human listening tests are conducted comparing VoiceCraft to original recordings and other models. VoiceCraft is preferred for naturalness 48% of the time over original recordings.

- State-of-the-art: VoiceCraft achieves top performance on speech editing and zero-shot TTS compared to previous models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a token rearrangement procedure involving causal masking and delayed stacking. Can you explain in detail how this procedure works and why it is beneficial for enabling efficient autoregressive generation with bidirectional context?

2. The paper introduces a new speech editing dataset named RealEdit. What makes this dataset more challenging and realistic compared to commonly used speech synthesis datasets? What implications does this have for evaluating speech editing systems?  

3. The paper shows that the proposed model, VoiceCraft, achieves state-of-the-art performance on speech editing based on both objective metrics and subjective human evaluations. Can you analyze the results and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of VoiceCraft compared to prior methods?

4. The paper demonstrates that VoiceCraft also generalizes well to zero-shot text-to-speech without any finetuning. Why is framing zero-shot TTS as transcript-conditioned speech continuation a natural fit for neural codec language models? What modifications were made to adapt VoiceCraft for this task?

5. The paper highlights an interesting observation that lower word error rates from ASR models do not necessarily correlate with better intelligibility scores from human listeners. What might explain this discrepancy? What are the implications for using automated metrics to evaluate speech synthesis systems?

6. One of the key components of VoiceCraft is the Transformer decoder architecture. Analyze the model configuration choices such as number of layers, hidden dimensions, attention heads, etc. How were these hyperparameters selected and what is their impact on model performance?  

7. The training procedure utilizes techniques like ScaledAdam optimization and the Eden learning rate scheduling. Explain how these methods work and why they were chosen over more standard approaches like AdamW optimization.

8. During inference, the paper applies techniques like nucleus sampling for smoother generation and selecting shorter outputs to avoid repetitive artifacts. Analyze these heuristics and propose other techniques that could be used to further improve inference.  

9. While VoiceCraft achieves strong performance, the paper notes some lingering limitations around occasional long silences and repetitive sounds. Diagnose the potential reasons for these issues and suggest methods to address them. 

10. The paper only evaluates VoiceCraft on speech editing and zero-shot TTS tasks. Discuss how you might extend VoiceCraft to other speech generation applications and what modifications would need to be made.
