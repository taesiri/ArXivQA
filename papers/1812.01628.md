# [Playing Text-Adventure Games with Graph-Based Deep Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01628)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning architecture called Knowledge Graph DQN (KG-DQN) for playing text-based adventure games. These games involve interacting with textual descriptions of an environment using natural language actions. The key challenges are the combinatorially large action space and partial observability of the underlying world state. 

The proposed KG-DQN uses a knowledge graph representation to store information about the state of the world in the form of relationships between entities. This graph is updated continuously based on textual observations and provides persistent memory to guide action selection. The paper introduces techniques for pruning the action space by scoring candidate actions using the presence of relevant entities and relationships in the knowledge graph.

The model architecture computes vector embeddings for the state (from the knowledge graph and encoded textual observation) and candidate actions. These are used by a deep Q-network to estimate Q-values for state-action pairs. The training process utilizes experience replay, a modified Îµ-greedy exploration, and prioritized sampling of transitions.

Additionally, the authors frame action selection as a question answering task, allowing parts of the model to be pre-trained on different games. This transfer learning approach further improves performance.

Experiments in the TextWorld framework demonstrate faster convergence compared to strong baselines, while preserving the quality of final solutions. Ablation studies confirm the individual benefits of the knowledge graph, action pruning, and pre-training components. Together they enable more sample-efficient learning for playing text adventure games with large state and action spaces.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning architecture called Knowledge Graph DQN (KG-DQN) that uses a knowledge graph state representation and question-answering based pre-training to deal with the challenges of partial observability, large combinatorial action spaces, and long-term context for agents playing text-based adventure games.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning architecture called Knowledge Graph DQN (KG-DQN) for playing text-adventure games. The key idea is to represent the game state as a knowledge graph, which captures relationships between entities and provides persistent memory to help with partial observability. This knowledge graph is used to prune the combinatorially large action space to enable more efficient exploration. The model computes state and action representations to estimate Q-values. It is trained using prioritized experience replay. The authors also frame action selection as a question answering problem, allowing part of the model to be pre-trained on separate question-answering data to enable transfer learning. Experiments in the TextWorld framework show KG-DQN converges over 40% faster than LSTM baselines without losing quest solution quality. The knowledge graph representation and pre-training are key to faster convergence and better final performance. This architecture addresses key challenges of partial observability and large action spaces for reinforcement learning with language.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a deep reinforcement learning architecture for playing text-adventure games that uses a knowledge graph for state representation to enable more efficient exploration of the action space and leverages question-answering pre-training for faster convergence without loss of quest solution quality.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be:

Representing the game state as a knowledge graph and using that graph to prune the action space will enable more efficient exploration and faster learning of a good control policy in text-based adventure games.

The key points that support this being the central hypothesis:

1) Text-based games have very large state and action spaces that make exploration difficult. 

2) The paper proposes using a knowledge graph to represent the state. This graph can then be used to prune less promising actions, thereby enabling more efficient exploration.

3) The paper introduces a reinforcement learning architecture called Knowledge Graph DQN (KG-DQN) which implements this idea of using a knowledge graph state representation and associated action pruning.

4) Experiments compare convergence time and quality of final control policies for KG-DQN versus strong baselines. The key result is that KG-DQN converges over 40% faster, supporting the central hypothesis.

In summary, the paper proposes and tests the hypothesis that a knowledge graph state representation coupled with graph-based action pruning will enable faster learning of good policies in text adventure games. The experimental results support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A knowledge graph representation to capture relationships between entities and provide persistent memory of the world to help agents playing text-adventure games. This representation helps prune the action space.

2) A deep reinforcement learning architecture called Knowledge Graph DQN (KG-DQN) that uses graph embedding and attention to estimate Q-values for state-action pairs. This architecture effectively leverages the knowledge graph representation.

3) Framing the problem as question answering, where the agent is asking "what is the right action to take?" and using pre-training with question answering data to improve performance. This transfer learning approach through question answering allows knowledge to transfer across games.

In experiments, KG-DQN converges over 40% faster than baselines while achieving high quality quest solutions. The knowledge graph provides persistent memory to enable faster convergence, while question answering pre-training helps ensure good performance on completing quests. Together, these methods address key challenges of partial observability and large action spaces in text adventure games.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several contributions to the field of reinforcement learning for text-based games:

1. It proposes representing the game state as a knowledge graph, which provides persistent memory to help with the partial observability of text games. This graph representation is used to prune the action space and enable more efficient exploration.

2. It introduces a deep reinforcement learning architecture called Knowledge Graph DQN (KG-DQN) that uses graph attention and embedding techniques to estimate Q-values for state-action pairs. 

3. It frames the problem as a question answering task ("what is the best action to take?") and shows that pre-training parts of the KG-DQN network using an existing QA method improves performance and allows for transfer learning between games.

Compared to prior work, this paper demonstrates faster convergence during training thanks to the knowledge graph representation. The full KG-DQN model also achieves better game completion quality (fewer steps to finish quests) compared to LSTM-DQN baselines. The results suggest that incorporating external knowledge and framing the problem as QA can benefit reinforcement learning on text games with large action spaces. The knowledge graph allows efficient pruning while the QA pre-training provides a general understanding of good actions to take.

Overall, this paper moves beyond existing approaches by addressing two key challenges - partial observability and combinatorial action spaces - in an innovative way. The faster convergence and ability to transfer learned knowledge are notable improvements over prior state-of-the-art methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions in the conclusions section:

1) Apply the knowledge graph and question-answering based approach to more complex text adventure games like Zork, which have remained challenging for AI agents. The techniques presented here address issues like partial observability and large action spaces, which should help with more complex games.

2) Explore the applicability of these techniques to other language-based reinforcement learning tasks beyond text games, where agents must communicate to understand the world state and affect change through language actions. The authors position text games as a stepping stone toward more real-world tasks that have these properties.

3) Investigate other ways to incorporate external knowledge into the agent's decision making process, beyond the knowledge graphs explored here. Integrating additional knowledge sources could further improve the agent's ability to explore and solve text-based games efficiently.

In summary, the main future directions are applying the techniques to more complex games, real-world language-based RL tasks, and integrating additional structured knowledge. The key ideas are leveraging knowledge representations to address challenges like partial observability and action spaces as a pathway toward more practical language-based agents.
