# [Conformal Intent Classification and Clarification for Fast and Accurate   Intent Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18973)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Conformal Intent Classification and Clarification for Fast and Accurate Intent Recognition":

Problem:
- Intent classification (IC) is a key step in task-oriented dialogue systems to map user inputs to predefined intents. However, user utterances can be ambiguous due to incompleteness, errors, or linguistic ambiguity.
- Asking clarification questions (CQs) can help resolve ambiguity and improve user experience, but deciding when and how to ask CQs is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents Conformal Intent Classification and Clarification (CICC), a framework to determine when to ask a CQ, what information it should contain, and how to formulate it. 
- CICC uses conformal prediction to turn a model's predictive uncertainty into prediction sets that contain the true intent at a predefined confidence level. This allows interpreting model uncertainty and balancing it with CQ size.
- If the prediction set is small, the dialogue proceeds as usual. If large, the input is too ambiguous. If of reasonable size, a CQ is asked based on the likely intents.

Main Contributions:
- A framework to generate CQs that contain true intent with statistical guarantees, allow rejecting overly ambiguous inputs, have interpretable hyperparameters, and generate small, specific CQs.
- Comparative evaluation using 7 IC datasets and 3 models shows CICC outperforms heuristics, especially for ambiguous inputs.
- Proposal to augment CICC for out-of-scope detection, which also shows strong performance.  
- Overall, CICC helps improve user experience of dialogue agents with tailored CQs based on model uncertainty.
