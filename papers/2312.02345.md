# [CLIPDrawX: Primitive-based Explanations for Text Guided Sketch Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02345)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text-to-sketch synthesis methods lack explainability, making it hard to understand the rationale behind the generated sketches. They also use complex strokes like Bezier curves that can evolve into a large set of arbitrary shapes during optimization.

Solution - CLIPDrawX:
- Proposes the concept of "explainable sketch synthesis", where sketches are clearly derived from simple geometric primitives like lines, circles etc. This enhances interpretability.  

- Introduces a strategic canvas initialization approach that identifies important regions using cross-attention maps from a diffusion model. It then populates these regions with primitive shapes.

- Uses primitive-level dropout during optimization to remove unnecessary primitives and reduce noise. Also initializes primitives with low opacity, incrementally increasing opacity of semantics-capturing strokes.

- Leverages CLIP image-text similarity to guide sketch optimization, without needing extra training.

Main Contributions:
- Notion of explainable sketch synthesis using simple primitives that transform into final strokes. Enables tracking and understanding of sketch evolution.

- Strategic canvas initialization using diffusion cross-attention maps and primitive shapes in important regions. Prevents clutter.

- Innovative techniques like primitive-level dropout and initializing primitives with low opacity that enhance optimization and deliver high-quality sketches.

- Extensive experiments including comparisons with existing methods and ablations that demonstrate superiority of the proposed techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces critical ideas and methods around explainability in text-to-sketch synthesis using primitive transformations, strategic initialization, and specialized optimization techniques.
