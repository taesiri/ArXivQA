# [Assessing the Reasoning Abilities of ChatGPT in the Context of Claim   Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10735)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- There is ongoing debate about the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This paper examines the issue from the perspective of claim/rumour verification, an important real-world task.

- Verifying claims requires breaking them down into atomic reasoning steps paired with evidence. However, no existing framework can perform this breakdown systematically. 

- It is important to understand where LLMs succeed and struggle at reasoning to clarify their capabilities and prevent misuse.

Proposed Solution  
- The paper proposes the first logical reasoning framework to decompose claims/rumours into reasoning steps required for verification.

- Two small diverse datasets are created - one from Wikipedia claims and one from Twitter rumours. Both are manually annotated using the framework.

- Multiple versions of ChatGPT are evaluated on classifying and explaining the veracity of claims/rumours in these datasets under different prompting paradigms.

Key Contributions
- Logical reasoning framework to break down claim/rumour verification into atomic steps

- Manually annotated datasets of Wikipedia claims and Twitter rumours 

- In-depth analysis showing ChatGPT struggles with abductive reasoning and verifying real-world rumours 

- Evidence that ChatGPT likely does not possess human-like reasoning abilities

- Demonstration that the Zero Shot Chain of Thought paradigm elicits better quality explanations compared to others

In summary, the paper systematically evaluates and provides evidence for limitations in ChatGPT's reasoning abilities for an important real-world task, whilst also proposing the first framework to decompose this task into elemental reasoning steps.
