# [FindingEmo: An Image Dataset for Emotion Recognition in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01355)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Emotion recognition in images is a complex task with applications in psychology, human-computer interaction, and robotics. 
- Existing datasets focus on facial expressions or single individuals rather than complex social scenes.
- There is a lack of datasets targeting higher-order social cognition that requires interpreting relations between multiple people.

Proposed Solution
- The authors introduce a new dataset called FindingEmo containing 25,869 images depicting multiple people in social settings.
- Images are annotated for overall emotional content rather than individuals' emotions.
- Annotations include valence, arousal, one of 24 emotions from Plutchik's wheel of emotions, age groups, factors deciding emotion, and ambiguity.
- Images were gathered using an automated scraper and filtered to keep useful images. Annotations were gathered via crowdsourcing.

Main Contributions
- FindingEmo is the first dataset targeting social cognition and reasoning about relations between multiple people.
- Detailed statistics show the distribution and diversity of annotations. Inter-annotator agreement analysis confirms reliability.
- Authors establish baseline classification results using popular CNN architectures and make dataset public to enable further research.
- Additional experiments showcase techniques to improve over the baseline like late fusion of facial emotion recognition.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel emotion recognition dataset for images depicting social scenes and multiple people. Thorough analysis and strong baselines provide a solid foundation for future work on this complex problem at the intersection of computer vision and social cognition.
