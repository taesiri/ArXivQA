# [Renovating Names in Open-Vocabulary Segmentation Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09593)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Renovating Names in Open-Vocabulary Segmentation Benchmarks":

Problem:
- Open-vocabulary segmentation models utilize class names as text prompts to generalize to novel categories. However, name quality is often overlooked and lacks precision in existing benchmarks. 
- Problems with names in current benchmarks: inaccurate, too general, lack contextual information. This causes discrepancies between model outputs and actual visual segments.
- A systematic study is lacking on how to rename benchmarks in a scalable and principled manner.

Proposed Solution: RENOVATE
- Aims to rename segmentation benchmarks with more accurate and descriptive names. 
- Two steps: (1) Narrow down name search space by generating candidate names using original names, context names from images, and GPT-4. (2) Train a renaming model to select the best matching name from candidates for each segment.

Key Contributions:
- Identify name problems in segmentation benchmarks and propose a scalable renaming framework. 
- Demonstrate renovated names are higher quality through human studies. Names expand dataset classes 4-5 times.
- Show upgraded benchmarks with renovated names are more challenging and realistic. 
- Use renovated names to train better open-vocabulary models with up to 16% relative gain.
- Propose to leverage models for automated name quality evaluation.
- Provide renamed datasets and code to the research community.

In summary, this paper tackles the overlooked problem of imprecise names in segmentation datasets. It develops the RENOVATE framework to systematically rename benchmarks with more accurate and descriptive names. Both human studies and model evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed renovated names.
