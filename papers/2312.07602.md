# [Sense, Predict, Adapt, Repeat: A Blueprint for Design of New Adaptive   AI-Centric Sensing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07602)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- High-resolution sensors are generating enormous volumes of data that exceed human consumption capacity. Sending all this raw data to the cloud for processing demands exponential growth in computation and communication infrastructure. 
- On-device deployment of large AI models for processing is impractical due to resource constraints of edge devices.  
- Conventional sensing system designs treat sensors and AI models independently as black boxes, leading to sub-optimal overall system efficiency and performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new approach called "end-to-end closed-loop active inference" for efficient sensing on resource-constrained edge devices. 
- Core ideas:
   - Co-design AI algorithms and sensing systems for dynamic perception
   - Enable model-to-sensor feedback during inference to dynamically adapt sensors
   - Optimize for end-to-end efficiency and performance rather than individual components

Key Contributions:
- Analysis of limitations of current static and dynamic resource-aware approaches
- Conceptual framework for closed-loop AI-centric sensing with adaptive sensors, tunable perception models, data bottlenecks and feedback control
- Detailed discussion of considerations in designing dynamic datasets, benchmarks, training policy networks and inference for such systems
- Highlighting open challenges like positive feedback, stability, and inherent costs of adaptation

In summary, the paper makes a case for a paradigm shift from conventional sensing system design to an integrated approach that co-designs AI and sensors for efficient dynamic perception through closed-loop feedback.
