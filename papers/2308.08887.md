# [Identity-Seeking Self-Supervised Representation Learning for   Generalizable Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08887)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we learn a domain-generalizable person re-identification representation from large-scale unlabeled videos without any human annotation? The key points are:- The paper aims to learn a person re-identification (ReID) representation that can generalize well to unseen target domains, i.e. a domain-generalizable representation. - Unlike prior work, the paper proposes to learn this representation from large-scale unlabeled video data, without requiring any human annotation (labels).- This is challenging because conventional self-supervised representation learning methods like MoCo learn instance discrimination, while ReID requires identity discrimination. - To address this, the paper proposes an Identity-seeking Self-supervised Representation learning (ISR) method. The key idea is to construct positive pairs from inter-frame images of the same identity for contrastive learning.- A reliability-guided contrastive loss is further introduced to suppress the impact of noisy positive pairs.- Experiments show the learned representation achieves state-of-the-art domain generalization results on ReID datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.In summary, the central hypothesis is that an identity-discriminative and domain-generalizable representation can be learned from large-scale unlabeled videos in a purely self-supervised manner, which is validated through extensive experiments in the paper. The key innovation is the design of the contrastive learning framework tailored for the ReID task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes an Identity-seeking Self-supervised Representation learning (ISR) method to learn a domain-generalizable person re-identification (ReID) representation from large-scale unlabeled videos without any annotation. 2. It introduces a novel reliability-guided contrastive loss to effectively mitigate the adverse impact of noisy positive pairs during the unsupervised learning process. This ensures that reliable positive pairs dominate the representation learning.3) Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, without human annotation and fine-tuning, ISR achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, outperforming previous supervised methods. For example, it achieves 87.0% Rank-1 on Market-1501 and 56.4% Rank-1 on MSMT17.4) The training cost of ISR scales approximately linearly with the amount of training data. This makes it feasible to leverage large-scale unlabeled data for learning a robust and generalizable representation.In summary, the key contribution is an unsupervised learning framework that can exploit large amounts of unlabeled video data to learn a domain-generalizable representation for person re-identification. The proposed reliability-guided contrastive loss is crucial in ensuring the learning of identity-discriminative features.
