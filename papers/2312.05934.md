# [Fine-Tuning or Retrieval? Comparing Knowledge Injection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05934)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 contain a lot of factual knowledge, but this knowledge has limitations: it is static, non-specific, and relies heavily on the pre-training data characteristics. 
- There is a need to enhance LLMs' knowledge in specialized domains and keep it updated. This poses a challenge on how to best inject new factual information into pretrained models.

Proposed Solutions Compared
- The paper compares two main approaches for knowledge injection:
   1) Fine-tuning (FT): further train the LLM on a domain-specific dataset
   2) Retrieval augmented generation (RAG): retrieve relevant contexts from a knowledge source and add them to the LLM's input at inference time

Key Contributions 
- Created tasks and datasets covering both previously seen (anatomy, astronomy) and entirely new (recent events) factual knowledge to test injection capabilities
- Showed RAG outperforms fine-tuning consistently, for both existing and new knowledge
- Fine-tuning struggles to learn new factual information; exposing models to numerous variations of the same fact during training helps mitigate this
- Analysis of factors impacting performance of both methods
- Formulation of knowledge in LLMs based on accuracy of factual question answering

In summary, this paper demonstrates retrieval augmented generation as a superior approach over fine-tuning for knowledge injection in large language models, through extensive empirical evaluation on diverse factual tasks. The findings also reveal some core challenges LLMs face in acquiring new knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper compares fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation for injecting knowledge into large language models, finding that retrieval-augmented generation consistently outperforms fine-tuning for incorporating both existing and entirely new knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is a comparison of two common approaches for injecting knowledge into large language models (LLMs): fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Specifically:

- The paper evaluates both fine-tuning and RAG on a variety of knowledge-intensive question answering tasks across different topics. This allows for a direct comparison of the two methods' ability to enhance LLMs' factual knowledge.

- The tasks involve both knowledge the models have likely seen before during pre-training as well as entirely new knowledge about recent events. This tests both "refreshing" existing knowledge and teaching new facts.

- The paper finds that RAG consistently and significantly outperforms fine-tuning at improving performance on the knowledge tasks, for both existing and new knowledge. 

- The paper also surfaces a key challenge LLMs have with learning new factual knowledge through fine-tuning, and proposes that exposing models to many variations of the same fact during training could help address this.

In summary, the main contribution is a rigorous evaluation of two popular knowledge injection techniques across a range of factual tasks, revealing strengths and weaknesses of each approach, with RAG demonstrating a consistent advantage. The paper also provides insights into how LLMs learn and memorize new factual knowledge.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Knowledge injection - The process of enhancing a language model's knowledge using external information. The main focus of the paper.

- Fine-tuning - One method for knowledge injection where a pre-trained model is further trained on a domain-specific dataset.

- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) - Another knowledge injection method where relevant documents are retrieved from a knowledge source and incorporated into the model's context. 

- Knowledge evaluation - Assessing a model's factual knowledge using question answering and other metrics.

- Knowledge bases - External corpora containing domain-specific information used to inject knowledge.

- Current events - A custom task created to evaluate learning of new knowledge not seen during pre-training.  

- Catastrophic forgetting - The phenomenon where models lose previously learned knowledge after further training.

- Paraphrasing - Data augmentation technique that creates variations of the training data to enhance learning.

- MMLU benchmark - Standardized set of tasks used for evaluation.

So in summary, the key themes are knowledge injection methods, knowledge evaluation, and techniques to improve the learning of new factual information in language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. This paper compares fine-tuning and RAG for knowledge injection. What are some of the main strengths and weaknesses of each approach based on the results? How might the two methods complement each other? 

2. The paper hypothesizes that repetition of factual information is key for teaching new knowledge to LLMs. What evidence supports this? How might this relate to human learning? What future work could further test this theory?

3. The authors use unsupervised training for fine-tuning. How might incorporating supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning affect the results? What are some of the challenges associated with supervised approaches?

4. How robust and generalizable are the findings? The experiments rely heavily on Wikipedia and multiple choice QA formats - how might performance differ on free-form generative tasks or using other knowledge sources? 

5. RAG requires identifying relevant documents to augment the context. How does performance vary based on document relevance and length? What role does the embedding model play in document retrieval?

6. The paper emphasizes evaluating factual knowledge over reasoning. However, can these capabilities truly be decoupled? What role might reasoning play in answering novel out-of-domain factual questions? 

7. What other model-centric issues like outdated information or forgetting might impact knowledge injection? How can prompt-based approaches help mitigate some of these challenges?

8. The paper examines specialized domain knowledge and completely new information. Are the knowledge injection findings consistent across these two categories? What unique challenges does each one present?

9. How sensitive are the results to hyperparameters like learning rate, RAG context length, and number of fine-tuning epochs? What best practices help increase stability and reproducibility?  

10. The paper focuses on question answering. How well might these knowledge injection techniques transfer to open-ended generative tasks like summarization or dialog? What additional evaluation challenges might arise?
