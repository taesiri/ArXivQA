# [A Two Dimensional Feature Engineering Method for Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04959)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify relations between entities in text. Current neural network models for RE have limitations in fully utilizing prior knowledge and distinguishing overlapped relation instances in sentences. 

- Two-dimensional (2D) sentence representations like table-filling can resolve overlapped instances but they directly transform raw inputs, lacking incorporation of useful prior knowledge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a two-dimensional feature engineering method to inject combined features into a 2D sentence representation for RE. 

- It first generates combined features using feature engineering based on atomic features like entity types. The combined features encode prior knowledge.

- A semantic plane is formed by passing the sentence through a conditional layer normalization. Combined features are injected at specific points in the plane based on their relevance to entities.  

- A feature-aware attention mechanism establishes associations between entities and combined features.

- Convolution operations on the semantic plane finally capture semantic dependencies for relation classification.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the first technique to integrate feature engineering with 2D sentence representations for RE, allowing incorporation of prior knowledge.

- Designs a strategy to inject combined features at relevant points in a 2D sentence representation.

- Introduces a feature-aware attention to build implicit connections between entities and combined features.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on ACE05 Chinese, ACE05 English and SanWen datasets, demonstrating effectiveness.

- Analysis shows contributions of different components and reveals how feature injection guides semantic plane's context learning.
