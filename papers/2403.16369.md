# [Learning Action-based Representations Using Invariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16369)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents operating on high-dimensional observations like images struggle to identify relevant state features amidst many distracting elements. Representations that capture controllability can help identify state elements affecting control, but existing methods only capture short-term controllability. For example, inverse dynamics models are myopic and fail to capture control-relevance of elements like walls that will affect the agent several steps in the future.

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces "action-bisimulation encoding", inspired by bisimulation metrics, to extend single-step controllability representations to multi-step. It does this by enforcing an invariance constraint on top of the short-term model. Specifically, it trains a single-step inverse dynamics model to capture basic controllability. Then it trains a multi-step encoder to match the single-step encoder distance on observed states, as well as the expected distance under the learned forward dynamics model. This recursive formulation causes the multi-step encoder to smoothly discount temporally distant but control-relevant state elements.

Contributions:
1) Proposes the action-bisimulation encoding method to capture multi-step controllability
2) Shows improved sample efficiency with action-bisimulation pretraining across domains like navigation and manipulation
3) Demonstrates robustness of learned representations to task-irrelevant distractions 
4) Provides analysis and experiments analyzing information captured by the representation

The key insight is extending myopic controllability metrics through an invariance constraint inspired by bisimulation metrics. This allows the incorporation of multi-step controllability without supervised demonstration data or specifying a fixed temporal horizon. The method is flexible and performs well across a range of environments.
