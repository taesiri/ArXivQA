# [Towards Generalist Biomedical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14334)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Can a single multimodal generalist AI system be developed that can interpret diverse types of biomedical data and competently perform a wide range of medical tasks using the same set of model weights, without any task-specific customization?The key hypothesis is that by training a large language model on a diverse corpus of multimodal biomedical data, it may be possible to develop a flexible "generalist" AI system that can encode, manipulate, and reason about different types of medical data to handle many downstream biomedical applications. The authors propose that such generalist biomedical AI systems could enable impactful new applications ranging from scientific discovery to improved healthcare delivery. However, a key challenge is the lack of comprehensive multimodal medical benchmarks to facilitate the training and evaluation of such models.To test their hypothesis, the authors introduce MultiMedBench, a new multimodal medical benchmark spanning tasks involving text, images and genomics. They use MultiMedBench to develop Med-PaLM M, a proof of concept generalist biomedical AI system. The paper presents results demonstrating that Med-PaLM M can perform competently across all tasks in MultiMedBench using the same model weights, often matching or exceeding prior state-of-the-art results from specialized models.In summary, the central research question is whether a single generalist multimodal model can flexibly perform well on diverse medical tasks, which the authors aim to demonstrate through the development and evaluation of Med-PaLM M.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the main contributions are:1. Introduction of MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark spanning multiple modalities (text, medical imaging, genomics) and diverse tasks (question answering, visual question answering, medical image classification, radiology report generation, etc). In total, MultiMedBench contains over 1 million data samples across 14 tasks.2. Development of Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), a proof of concept generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M uses the same model weights to handle multiple input modalities and tasks in MultiMedBench, without any task-specific customization. 3. Demonstration that Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding prior state-of-the-art across all 14 tasks in MultiMedBench. This is achieved by a single model, compared to specialized models that were each optimized for a single task.4. Analysis of model capabilities including evidence of emergent reasoning skills like zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts, positive transfer across tasks, and zero-shot medical reasoning.5. Radiologist evaluation showing encouraging performance of Med-PaLM M generated radiology reports, with preference for the AI over radiologist reports in up to 40% of cases in a blinded side-by-side ranking.In summary, the main contributions seem to be 1) the curation of a new comprehensive multimodal biomedical benchmark, and 2) the development and evaluation of Med-PaLM M as a proof of concept generalist biomedical AI system, including both automated and human evaluations. The results demonstrate the potential of developing unified multimodal models for medicine.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my review, the main takeaway from this paper is that the authors introduce MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark for training and evaluating generalist AI systems. They also present Med-PaLM M, a proof of concept generalist biomedical AI model that achieves strong performance across the diverse tasks in MultiMedBench using the same set of weights, suggesting promising capabilities of such systems. The key limitation is that further research is required to validate these models for real world use.In summary: The paper introduces MultiMedBench and Med-PaLM M, a new benchmark and proof of concept model demonstrating the potential for generalist biomedical AI systems, though further research is needed to validate real world applicability.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of generalist biomedical AI systems:- The curation of MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark spanning various data types and tasks, is a novel contribution. Most prior work has focused on individual datasets or tasks, so this provides a more comprehensive benchmark for training and evaluating generalist AI models. - The development and evaluation of Med-PaLM M, a unified model reaching strong performance across this diverse benchmark without task-specific customization, is a first demonstration of a generalist biomedical AI system. Other recent work has proposed the need for such systems conceptually but not provided empirical evidence.- The paper provides initial results suggesting emergent capabilities like generalization to novel medical concepts, task transfer, and reasoning. This probes the possibilities of flexible language-model based generalist systems versus more rigid single-task models. However, more analysis is needed to fully characterize these capabilities.- The radiologist evaluation of model-generated reports, with Med-PaLM preferred over radiologist reports in many cases, provides valuable human assessment. Though still early, this suggests potential for clinical utility if rigorously validated.- Overall, while promising, this work is still early-stage compared to near-human performance of specialized models on some well-studied tasks. Significant future work is outlined around model development, evaluation, and real-world testing before such generalist systems could be clinically applicable. But it represents an important milestone in working towards more flexible biomedical AI.In summary, the paper introduces valuable new resources and provides initial evidence for the possibilities of generalist biomedical AI systems. But substantial future research is still needed to realize the full potential of such models in real-world use. The work compares favorably with the state-of-the-art in flexibility, but specialized models likely still surpass it in narrowly defined applications.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few key directions for future research:- Curating larger and more diverse multimodal biomedical benchmarks with more modalities (e.g. omics data), tasks, and data samples. This can catalyze further progress in generalist biomedical AI.- Developing better techniques for effectively scaling both the language models and modality-specific encoders with sufficient amounts of biomedical data. Scaling is key to unlocking the full potential of these models. - Validating the safety, efficacy and ethics of such models in real clinical settings through careful human-centered research beforethese systems are ready for any deployment in care delivery.- Developing alternative approaches like task-specific agents that can collaborate with generalist foundation models rather than trying to embed all capabilities within a single model.- Understanding the sociotechnical context for how these technologies may be used downstream and conduct research to align the capabilities of the technology with human needs and values.In summary, the key future directions are: 1) curating larger multimodal biomedical benchmarks 2) techniques to scale language and modality-specific model components 3) safety and human-centered validation 4) exploring collaborative multi-agent systems 5) responsible development aligned with human values.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes Med-PaLM M, a generalist biomedical AI system that can handle a diverse range of biomedical data modalities and tasks using the same model weights, without any task-specific customization. To enable training and evaluation of such models, the authors first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark spanning 14 tasks across modalities including clinical text, medical imaging, and genomics. Med-PaLM M is then developed by finetuning a pretrained multimodal foundation model (PaLM-E) on this benchmark using a mixture of distinct task prompts and exemplars to train the model simultaneously on all tasks in a unified framework. The pretrained PaLM-E model combines a large language model (PaLM) with a visual encoder (ViT), enabling Med-PaLM M to flexibly encode and interpret multimodal inputs through a language modeling objective. Experiments show Med-PaLM M achieves strong performance on MultiMedBench, exceeding prior state-of-the-art across several tasks, suggesting promise as a generalist biomedical AI system.
