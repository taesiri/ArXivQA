# Hi Sheldon! Creating Deep Personalized Characters from TV Shows

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is on developing a novel task called Deep Personalized Character Creation (DPCC) and a dataset called Deep Personalized Character Dataset (DPCD) to support this task. The key ideas are:- DPCC aims to create personalized digital characters that can generate multimodal (text, audio, video) responses that reflect the personality and traits of specific TV/movie characters. - To support DPCC, the authors collect a new multimodal dataset DPCD from the TV show The Big Bang Theory. This contains aligned conversation data (text, audio, video) for 5 main characters. - DPCD has ~10x more conversation data per character compared to prior datasets, allowing better modeling of persona.- The authors provide a baseline method for DPCC using DPCD, and generate 5 DeepCharacters.- Experiments show these DeepCharacters can generate personalized and high quality multimodal responses reflecting the original characters' personality based on DPCD.So in summary, the main research focus is introducing this new DPCC task and DPCD dataset to generate personalized multimodal conversational agents grounded in specific fictional characters. The key hypothesis is that the collected DPCD enables training DeepCharacters that exhibit personalized behaviors similar to the original TV characters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel task called Deep Personalized Character Creation (DPCC) for generating personalized, multimodal responses that reflect the personality of specific TV show characters. 2. It introduces a new dataset called Deep Personalized Character Dataset (DPCD) containing aligned text, audio, and video dialog data for 5 main characters from The Big Bang Theory. This dataset has around 10 times more data per character compared to previous datasets.3. It provides a baseline method for the DPCC task that involves personalized textual response generation, personalized text-to-speech, and acoustic-visual synchronization models. 4. It evaluates the created "DeepCharacters" both subjectively and objectively in terms of characterization and quality of the generated multimodal responses.In summary, the paper introduces a new challenging task, provides a dataset to support it, proposes a baseline method, and conducts experiments to show the potential of creating personalized characters from multimodal conversational data in a data-driven manner. The main contribution is in defining this novel task, collecting a dataset for it, and showing initial results on the dataset with a baseline method.
