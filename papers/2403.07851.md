# [12 mJ per Class On-Device Online Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07851)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Classical machine learning solutions often rely on large labeled datasets to train complex but fixed models that cannot adapt to changing environments. However, for on-device learning at the extreme edge, labeled data is scarce and models need to be able to incrementally learn new concepts without forgetting previously learned ones. This is known as few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL). Existing FSCIL solutions rely on computationally expensive backpropagation algorithms and large ResNet backbones, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces Online FSCIL (O-FSCIL), a lightweight FSCIL methodology tailored for microcontrollers. It consists of three main components: (1) a MobileNetV2 feature extractor pretrained with orthogonal regularization and data augmentation, (2) a Fully Connected Reductor (FCR), and (3) an Explicit Memory (EM) storing class prototypes. During the metalearning phase, a multi-margin loss improves clustering and generalization. For learning novel classes, O-FSCIL freezes the backbone and FCR, computes new class prototypes and stores them in the EM, enabling single-pass, online updates.   

Main Contributions:
1) O-FSCIL achieves new SOTA accuracy of 68.62% on CIFAR100 using just 2.5M parameters and 149M MACs with a MobileNetV2 backbone.
2) Compression techniques reduce the memory for 100 classes to just 9.6kB.
3) Deployment on an ultra-low power 50mW GAP8 microcontroller enables online learning of novel classes with only 12mJ per class.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient FSCIL approach tailored for resource-constrained edge devices, enabling online on-device learning with state-of-the-art accuracy and minimal energy requirements. The compact backbone and memory footprint make it suitable for microcontrollers at the extreme edge.
