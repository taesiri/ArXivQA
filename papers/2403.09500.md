# [Faceptor: A Generalist Model for Face Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09500)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Faceptor: A Generalist Model for Face Perception":

Problem:
- Existing methods for face analysis mainly focus on developing specialized models for each individual task like facial landmark localization, face parsing, age estimation etc. This is inefficient in terms of data collection, model training, inference speed and storage overhead. 
- Prior works on unified face perception have focused only on unified representation learning or multi-task learning. They lack in task extensibility or application efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes two face generalist models - Naive Faceptor and Faceptor that can handle multiple face analysis tasks in a unified framework.

- Naive Faceptor categorizes tasks into 3 types - dense prediction, attribute prediction and identity prediction. It uses a shared backbone and 3 standardized heads, one for each task type. This provides improved task extensibility.

- Faceptor further enhances unification using a single-encoder dual-decoder architecture. The encoder extracts shared features. Task-specific queries are used to represent semantics of different tasks, minimizing use of non-shared parameters. 

- A Layer-Attention mechanism is introduced to enable adaptive selection of optimal features from different layers for each task.

Main Contributions:
- First work to propose face generalist models with unified representation, training and model structure for face perception. Main focus is on unified model structure.

- Naive Faceptor offers increased efficiency. Faceptor further improves efficiency and unification via standardized heads and task-specific queries respectively.

- Faceptor shows exceptional performance on facial landmark localization, parsing, age estimation etc. Beats specialized methods in most tasks.

- Two-stage training process introduced to ensure effectiveness of Layer-Attention mechanism in modeling layer preferences of tasks.

- Training framework leverages auxiliary tasks to improve main task performance when data is insufficient. Significantly boosts age estimation and expression recognition.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Faceptor, a unified face perception model with a single-encoder dual-decoder architecture and task-specific queries that achieves state-of-the-art performance across facial landmark localization, face parsing, age estimation, expression recognition, attribute classification, and face recognition through multi-task learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. This is the first work that explores face generalist models, with unified representation, training, and model structure. The main focus is on the development of unified model structures.

2. The Naive Faceptor consists of one shared backbone and 3 types of standardized output heads, achieving improved task extensibility and increased application efficiency.

3. The Faceptor further enhances the unification of model structure and employs significantly fewer parameters than Naive Faceptor, with a single-encoder dual-decoder architecture and task-specific queries to deal with new-coming semantics.

4. The proposed Faceptor demonstrates outstanding performance under both multi-task learning and auxiliary supervised learning settings across a diverse set of tasks including facial landmark localization, face parsing, age estimation, expression recognition, binary attribute classification, and face recognition.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating two face generalist models (Naive Faceptor and Faceptor) with a focus on unified model structure to achieve a unified approach for face perception.
