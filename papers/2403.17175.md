# [Engagement Measurement Based on Facial Landmarks and Spatial-Temporal   Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17175)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Measuring student engagement in virtual learning is important but challenging. Video-based engagement measurement methods typically rely on extracting multi-modal features or end-to-end analysis, which can be computationally complex. 
- Facial landmarks encapsulate useful geometric information for engagement measurement but have not been explored for this purpose.

Proposed Solution:
- Extract 3D facial landmarks from video frames using MediaPipe. Construct spatiotemporal graphs from landmark sequences.
- Analyze graphs with Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCNs) to classify engagement levels. 
- Introduce novel ordinal learning framework with transfer learning to integrate engagement ordinality into model training.

Contributions:
- First use of only facial landmarks and ST-GCNs for video-based engagement measurement.
- Novel ordinal learning method for ST-GCNs using transfer learning.  
- Experiments on two datasets show state-of-the-art performance. Proposed lightweight method capable of real-time engagement measurement.
- Privacy-preserving since raw video not required. Only facial landmarks used as input.

In summary, this paper proposes a facial landmark analysis method using ST-GCNs for video-based student engagement measurement. A new ordinal learning approach is introduced to integrate the ordinal nature of engagement. Evaluations demonstrate improved accuracy over previous methods, showing promise for practical deployment.
