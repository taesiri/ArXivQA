# [Robust Model-based Face Reconstruction through Weakly-Supervised Outlier   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09614)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to enhance model-based face reconstruction by avoiding fitting the model to outliers like occlusions and mismatches. The key hypothesis is that jointly training a face autoencoder and an outlier segmentation network in an EM-like manner can improve both face reconstruction and outlier segmentation, without requiring any supervision for the outliers.Specifically, the outliers cannot be fitted well by the face model. This provides a weak supervision signal to train the outlier segmentation network. The estimated outlier masks can then be used to prevent the face autoencoder from fitting to the outliers, improving reconstruction. The improved reconstruction quality in turn provides better guidance for the outlier segmentation network.So in summary, the key hypothesis is that the joint face autoencoder and outlier segmentation approach can enable robust face reconstruction and accurate outlier segmentation in a synergistic manner, without direct supervision for the outliers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a proposed method called FOCUS for robust model-based face reconstruction through weakly-supervised outlier segmentation. The key ideas are:- Jointly train a face autoencoder and an outlier segmentation network in an EM-like manner to enable robust face reconstruction without needing outlier/occlusion labels. The segmentation helps the autoencoder avoid fitting to outliers, while the improved reconstruction provides better guidance for segmenting outliers.- Use perceptual losses to supervise the segmentation network, exploiting similarities between input, reconstructed, and masked images rather than requiring ground truth segmentation.- Build a statistical misfit prior from synthetic data to measure and adjust for systematic bias in model fitting on real images. - Achieve state-of-the-art 3D face reconstruction accuracy among unsupervised methods on the NoW dataset. The segmentation network also provides accurate occlusion masks without direct supervision.In summary, the main contribution is a weakly-supervised joint face reconstruction and outlier segmentation framework that achieves robust performance without costly occlusion/skin annotations. The key ideas are the EM-like synergistic training, perceptual losses for segmentation, and misfit prior to address systematic model errors.
