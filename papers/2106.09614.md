# [Robust Model-based Face Reconstruction through Weakly-Supervised Outlier   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09614)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to enhance model-based face reconstruction by avoiding fitting the model to outliers like occlusions and mismatches. 

The key hypothesis is that jointly training a face autoencoder and an outlier segmentation network in an EM-like manner can improve both face reconstruction and outlier segmentation, without requiring any supervision for the outliers.

Specifically, the outliers cannot be fitted well by the face model. This provides a weak supervision signal to train the outlier segmentation network. The estimated outlier masks can then be used to prevent the face autoencoder from fitting to the outliers, improving reconstruction. The improved reconstruction quality in turn provides better guidance for the outlier segmentation network.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that the joint face autoencoder and outlier segmentation approach can enable robust face reconstruction and accurate outlier segmentation in a synergistic manner, without direct supervision for the outliers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a proposed method called FOCUS for robust model-based face reconstruction through weakly-supervised outlier segmentation. The key ideas are:

- Jointly train a face autoencoder and an outlier segmentation network in an EM-like manner to enable robust face reconstruction without needing outlier/occlusion labels. The segmentation helps the autoencoder avoid fitting to outliers, while the improved reconstruction provides better guidance for segmenting outliers.

- Use perceptual losses to supervise the segmentation network, exploiting similarities between input, reconstructed, and masked images rather than requiring ground truth segmentation.

- Build a statistical misfit prior from synthetic data to measure and adjust for systematic bias in model fitting on real images. 

- Achieve state-of-the-art 3D face reconstruction accuracy among unsupervised methods on the NoW dataset. The segmentation network also provides accurate occlusion masks without direct supervision.

In summary, the main contribution is a weakly-supervised joint face reconstruction and outlier segmentation framework that achieves robust performance without costly occlusion/skin annotations. The key ideas are the EM-like synergistic training, perceptual losses for segmentation, and misfit prior to address systematic model errors.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a weakly-supervised approach called FOCUS that jointly trains a face autoencoder for 3D face reconstruction and an outlier segmentation network to improve robustness to occlusions and mismatches, using an EM-type training strategy and a statistical prior to handle misfits.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a novel approach for robust 3D face reconstruction from monocular images in unconstrained settings. Here are some key ways it compares to other recent research in this field:

- It focuses on handling outliers like occlusions and mismatches during model fitting. Many previous works have tried to address this using multi-view consistency, symmetry priors or segmentation networks trained with supervision. This work handles outliers in a weakly supervised manner without needing occlusion/skin annotations.

- It jointly trains a face autoencoder for reconstruction and a segmentation network with an EM-type strategy. This allows the two networks to synergize - the segmentation guides better reconstruction, and better reconstruction enables more accurate segmentation. Previous joint model fitting and segmentation works required extra supervision.

- It proposes a novel statistical misfit prior to account for systematic errors in regions the model can fit but constantly misfits. This is a simple yet effective way to adjust for deficiencies in the fitting pipeline without needing further supervision or model/landmark improvements.

- It achieves state-of-the-art 3D face reconstruction accuracy among unsupervised methods on the NoW benchmark. It also produces accurate occlusion segmentation masks without any annotation.

- The core ideas of joint training, misfit prior, and exploiting model limitation for outlier segmentation could apply more broadly to reconstruction tasks beyond faces.

Overall, this work makes significant contributions in enhancing the robustness and generalization of model-based face reconstruction to in-the-wild conditions. The weakly supervised joint training framework and misfit prior are innovative techniques for this long-standing challenge. It advances the state-of-the-art for unsupervised monocular 3D face reconstruction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

1. Integrating their FOCUS approach with existing face autoencoders and/or non-linear parametric face models to further improve performance. The concepts of their joint training and use of a misfit prior could be applied to other model-based face reconstruction methods. 

2. Extending their approach beyond faces to human body or general object reconstruction. The core ideas of their method are not specific to faces, so they could be applied to reconstruct other objects that have a parametric model available.

3. Using the predicted occlusion masks for other applications like image completion, recognition, etc. The masks provide useful information about which regions are outliers/occlusions, which could benefit other tasks.

4. Using a more expressive 3D face model capable of capturing more facial details, makeup, and facial hair. This could allow the outlier segmentation to be even more accurate.

5. Exploring better loss functions and network architectures to further improve reconstruction quality and outlier segmentation performance.

6. Validating their approach on more diverse and challenging in-the-wild datasets to test its robustness.

In summary, the main future directions are: applying their concepts to other models and tasks, using more expressive face models, and improving the technical details of the approach like the loss functions and networks. The overarching goal is to enhance the generalization of their method to real-world conditions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a method called FOCUS for robust 3D face reconstruction from a single image. The key idea is to jointly train a face autoencoder model for reconstruction along with an outlier segmentation model to detect non-facial regions like occlusions and makeup. The two models are trained in an alternating manner inspired by Expectation-Maximization, so the face model avoids fitting to outliers detected by the segmentation model, while the improved reconstruction in turn helps refine the segmentation. To handle ambiguity between outliers and inherent model mismatches like eyebrows, a statistical misfit prior is built to adjust for systematic errors. Experiments on NoW, CelebA-HQ and AR datasets show state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy among self-supervised methods. Notably, the segmentation model can accurately detect occlusions without any explicit occlusion supervision during training. Overall, FOCUS achieves highly robust face reconstruction and segmentation without requiring occlusion, skin or 3D annotations.

This paper introduces a method called FOCUS for robust model-based 3D face reconstruction from a single image. The key innovation is jointly training a face autoencoder for reconstruction along with an outlier segmentation network to detect non-face regions like occlusions. The two networks are trained in an alternating manner inspired by EM to create a synergistic effect - the segmentation guides the autoencoder to avoid fitting outliers, improving reconstruction, while the improved reconstruction provides better guidance for the segmentation network. 

Several other novel components are introduced as well. The segmentation network is trained with a combination of pixel and perceptual losses to detect outliers without requiring occlusion labels. A statistical prior is built to compensate for systematic in-domain misfits like around the eyebrows that are hard to fit well. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy on NoW among unsupervised methods, and accurate occlusion segmentation on CelebA-HQ and AR despite no supervision. The joint training approach is highly effective for making model-based face reconstruction more robust to outliers.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called FOCUS (Face-autOenCoder and oUtlier Segmentation) for model-based 3D face reconstruction that is robust to outliers like occlusions and mismatches. The key idea is to jointly train a face autoencoder network for reconstruction and a segmentation network for outlier detection in an alternating manner without supervision. This creates a synergistic effect where the segmentation helps prevent the autoencoder from fitting to outliers, improving reconstruction, while the improved reconstruction provides better guidance for segmentation. The training uses a strategy similar to EM, initializing the model in an unsupervised way and then alternating between optimizing the autoencoder and segmentation network. To handle in-domain misfits, a statistical prior is built from synthetic data to measure and compensate for systematic errors. Experiments show state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy among unsupervised methods on NoW and accurate occlusion segmentation on CelebA-HQ and AR despite no occlusion labels during training.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces a model-based 3D face reconstruction method called FOCUS that is highly robust to outliers such as occlusions or make-up, without needing any annotations for skin, occlusion, or landmarks during training. The key idea is to jointly train a face autoencoder for reconstruction along with an outlier segmentation network in an alternating EM-like manner. The face autoencoder fits a 3D morphable face model to the image while avoiding outliers identified by the segmentation network. Meanwhile, the segmentation network exploits the discrepancy between target and reconstructed images to refine the outlier estimation. This creates a synergistic effect where improved reconstruction aids segmentation, and vice versa. To handle in-domain misfits arising from model limitations, a statistical bias prior is learned from synthetic data to adjust errors in problematic face regions like eyebrows or lips. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art self-supervised reconstruction accuracy on the NoW dataset. Though trained without segmentation labels, the network accurately locates facial occlusions, outperforming baselines. The unsupervised outlier handling approach enhances robustness and could generalize to related reconstruction tasks.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a method for robust 3D face reconstruction from single images, even in the presence of occlusions or other outliers. The key idea is to jointly train a model-based face autoencoder for reconstruction along with an outlier segmentation network in an alternating manner inspired by Expectation-Maximization. The face autoencoder fits a 3D Morphable Model to the image to reconstruct the 3D face shape, texture, pose etc. The segmentation network predicts a mask indicating outliers that cannot be explained well by the face model, like occlusions. Using the predicted mask, outliers can be excluded during autoencoder training to avoid distortions. The improved face reconstruction in turn helps refine the segmentation mask. This alternating training creates a synergy without requiring occlusion annotations. Additionally, a misfit prior based on synthetic data is used to account for systematic errors. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy on benchmark datasets among unsupervised methods, and accurate occlusion segmentation despite no supervision. The method does not need any manual occlusion/skin labeling and shows high robustness.
