# [Statistical Rejection Sampling Improves Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06657)

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Studying RSO on larger language models, with larger-scale decoding samples, and on other language generation tasks beyond the three tested in this work. The authors suggest RSO is a promising approach but more extensive experimentation is needed.- Exploring the use of RSO with different reward functions and non-human feedback. The current work focuses on human preference feedback but the authors propose trying other reward signals.- Doing more analysis into the hyperparameter choices like β and γ. The authors treat them as hyperparameters in this work but suggest further study on how to set them optimally.- Comparing RSO to other emerging methods beyond just SLiC and DPO. As new techniques arise for optimizing language models on human preferences, the authors suggest benchmarking against RSO.- Applying RSO in few-shot settings by generating preferences conditioned on prompt instructions. The authors currently use an unconditional model but propose conditioning the sampling.- Scaling RSO to even larger models and datasets through approximate rejection sampling. The authors discuss computational challenges of scaling up the approach.In summary, the main suggestions are around scaling up RSO to larger settings, testing on more tasks, integrating with other techniques like few-shot learning, and better understanding the algorithm's hyperparameters. The core RSO approach seems promising but requires more extensive evaluation and analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces Statistical Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO), a novel approach for improving the alignment of language models with human preferences. It builds on recent offline methods like Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that avoid complexities of online RL while optimizing for preferences. SLiC is limited to sampling from the supervised fine-tuned (SFT) policy while DPO lacks a reward model to sample optimal pairs. RSO addresses these limitations by using rejection sampling to source preference data from the target optimal policy, enabling more accurate estimation. The authors propose a unified framework enhancing SLiC and DPO loss functions from a preference modeling view. Through experiments on three text generation tasks, they demonstrate RSO consistently outperforms SLiC and DPO on evaluations from both LLMs and human raters. The key ideas are using a pairwise reward model, statistical rejection sampling for optimal policy data, and losses for density estimation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new approach called Statistical Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO) to improve alignment of language models with human preferences. RSO aims to source preference data from the target optimal policy using rejection sampling, enabling more accurate estimation compared to prior methods like Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The key ideas are: 1) RSO first trains a pairwise reward-ranking model on human preference data, then uses rejection sampling to generate new preference pairs from an approximated optimal policy. This allows estimating the optimal policy density more accurately. 2) The paper shows SLiC and DPO losses correspond to SVM and logistic regression on preference data. 3) Experiments on summarization and dialog tasks demonstrate RSO outperforms SLiC and DPO on both model and human evaluations. Theoretical analysis is also provided on the statistical properties of the proposed rejection sampling algorithm. Overall, RSO offers a principled recipe to optimize language models using human preference data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel approach called Statistical Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO) to better align language models with human preferences. RSO first trains a pairwise reward-ranking model on observed human preference data between model responses. It then uses this model along with statistical rejection sampling to generate new preference pairs, where the responses are sampled from an approximation of the optimal target policy rather than the baseline supervised policy. These synthesized preference pairs are then used to train the language model to maximize the likelihood of the preferred response. Compared to prior methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC) which use the human preference data less optimally, RSO demonstrates superior performance across diverse text generation tasks based on both automatic and human evaluations. The key novelty of RSO is the use of rejection sampling to source preference pairs from the target policy to enable more accurate density estimation.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop an effective and scalable approach to optimize large language models based on human preference data?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Fitting preference models directly on human preference data (like DPO) may not be optimal, since the pairs are not sampled from the target optimal policy.2) Sampling preference pairs from the supervised fine-tuned (SFT) policy (like SLiC-sample-rank) is better but still not ideal.3) Using statistical rejection sampling to generate preference pairs close to the target optimal policy enables more accurate density estimation of the optimal policy.4) Unifying the loss functions in DPO and SLiC and generating preference pairs via rejection sampling leads to improved performance in aligning language models with human preferences.So in summary, the core research question is how to effectively optimize language models on human preference data, with the key hypothesis being that statistical rejection sampling to source pairs close to the optimal policy combined with a unified loss function enables better optimization.

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Statistical Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO) to improve alignment of language models with human preferences.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper proposes a novel approach for language model optimization based on human preferences called Statistical Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO). Here is a high-level comparison to related work in this field:- It builds on recent work like Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that aim to optimize language models based on human preferences without needing complex reinforcement learning like in RLHF. The key difference is RSO better approximates sampling preference pairs from the optimal policy using rejection sampling.- Compared to SLiC, RSO improves the sampling strategy to better approximate the maximum likelihood estimation. SLiC is limited to sampling from the supervised fine-tuned (SFT) policy while RSO samples closer to the optimal policy.- Compared to DPO, RSO provides a more rigorous maximum likelihood framework and sampling strategy. DPO directly fits the model on arbitrary human preference data while RSO fits on rejection sampled pairs that approximate optimal policy sampling.- The paper also provides useful analysis unifying loss functions in DPO and SLiC, proposing improved losses. Experiments demonstrate clear gains from RSO over both methods.- The rejection sampling framework connects to related techniques like top-k sampling while providing probabilistic sampling interpretation and theoretical guarantees.Overall, RSO makes key contributions of a principled sampling strategy and unified preference modeling view. The gains over SLiC and DPO demonstrate the benefits of approximating optimal policy sampling with rejection sampling during preference optimization.
