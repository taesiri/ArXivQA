# [Communication-efficient Federated Learning with Single-Step Synthetic   Features Compressor for Faster Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13562)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- The paper proposes a new method called Single-Step Synthetic Features Compressor (3SFC) for communication-efficient federated learning. - The goal is to reduce communication overhead in federated learning while maintaining model accuracy and convergence rate.- 3SFC constructs a small synthetic dataset to represent the raw gradients, allowing extremely low compression rates. - A similarity-based objective function is used to optimize the synthetic dataset in just one step, improving performance and robustness.- Error feedback is incorporated to further minimize the overall compression error.- The main hypothesis seems to be that 3SFC can achieve significantly better convergence rates compared to existing methods under the same or even lower communication budgets. Experiments aim to validate this.In summary, the key research question is how to achieve communication-efficient federated learning without compromising accuracy or convergence rate. The proposed 3SFC method and experiments aim to demonstrate its effectiveness for this goal compared to other state-of-the-art techniques.
