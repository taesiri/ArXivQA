# [Communication-efficient Federated Learning with Single-Step Synthetic   Features Compressor for Faster Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13562)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a new method called Single-Step Synthetic Features Compressor (3SFC) for communication-efficient federated learning. 

- The goal is to reduce communication overhead in federated learning while maintaining model accuracy and convergence rate.

- 3SFC constructs a small synthetic dataset to represent the raw gradients, allowing extremely low compression rates. 

- A similarity-based objective function is used to optimize the synthetic dataset in just one step, improving performance and robustness.

- Error feedback is incorporated to further minimize the overall compression error.

- The main hypothesis seems to be that 3SFC can achieve significantly better convergence rates compared to existing methods under the same or even lower communication budgets. Experiments aim to validate this.

In summary, the key research question is how to achieve communication-efficient federated learning without compromising accuracy or convergence rate. The proposed 3SFC method and experiments aim to demonstrate its effectiveness for this goal compared to other state-of-the-art techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a novel method called Single-Step Synthetic Features Compressor (3SFC) to achieve communication-efficient federated learning by directly constructing a tiny synthetic dataset containing synthetic features based on raw gradients. This allows extremely low compression rates. 

2. It uses a similarity-based objective function for constructing the synthetic inputs and labels, which reduces the time and space complexity and improves performance and robustness compared to prior approaches. The synthetic dataset can be optimized in just one step.

3. It incorporates error feedback into 3SFC to further minimize the overall compressing error and boost convergence rate. This is the first use of error feedback for data distillation methods in federated learning.

4. Experiments on multiple datasets and models show 3SFC achieves significantly better convergence rates compared to competing methods at lower compression rates (up to 0.02%). Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the efficiency of 3SFC.

In summary, the key innovation is the single-step synthetic features compression method with similarity-based optimization and error feedback, which enables extremely low compression rates for communication-efficient federated learning without compromising convergence rate.
