# [Outlier Robust Multivariate Polynomial Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09465)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of robust multivariate polynomial regression. Given a set of random input-output sample pairs, where an unknown multivariate polynomial function maps inputs to outputs, the goal is to estimate the unknown polynomial even though some fraction of the samples may be adversarially corrupted (outliers). The paper focuses on the challenging setting where up to a constant fraction (<1/2) of samples can be outliers. 

Prior Work: 
For the univariate (single variable) case, Kane, Karmalkar and Price (KKP 2017) gave an optimal algorithm. This paper aims to generalize their approach to handle multiple variables. A naive generalization runs into challenges handling the numerous boundary/peripheral cells and relating the supremum and L1 norms.

Key Contributions:

1. The paper gives the first computationally efficient algorithm for constant-factor robust multivariate polynomial regression that uses a near-optimal number of samples. For n-variate degree-d polynomials over the cube [-1,1]^n, the sample complexity is O(d^n log d) under the Chebyshev distribution over inputs, nearly matching the proved lower bound of Ω(d^n).

2. A core technical contribution is a new tool relating the L∞ and L1 norms of multivariate polynomials, allowing translation of approximation guarantees. The paper shows that the L∞ norm is lower bounded by the L1 norm divided by (2d)^{2n}, and this tradeoff is tight.

3. The algorithm and analysis generalize the univariate techniques in KKP (2017) using a tensorization of the Chebyshev partition combined with a multivariate L∞ approximation tool for piecewise constant functions. A novel median-based recovery method gives the guarantee.

4. For applications where samples have limited precision, the paper gives a refined analysis showing how to retain optimality. For N-bit precision, the complexity remains near-linear in N.

To summarize, the paper proposes the first efficient and near sample-optimal robust multivariate polynomial regression algorithm together with tight analysis. The technical tools related to multivariate function approximation could find wider applications.
