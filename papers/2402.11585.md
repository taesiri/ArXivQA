# [PolypNextLSTM: A lightweight and fast polyp video segmentation network   using ConvNext and ConvLSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11585)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy videos can help with early detection of colorectal cancer. 
- Existing methods are mostly image-based and don't utilize temporal information from videos.
- Video-based methods have limited research due to lack of densely annotated video datasets.
- Efficiency in terms of model size and speed is also an issue.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose PolypNextLSTM, a lightweight video segmentation model.
- It uses a pruned ConvNext-Tiny backbone integrated with a bidirectional ConvLSTM module.
- The ConvLSTM captures temporal information across frames efficiently.

Main Contributions:
- PolypNextLSTM outperforms state-of-the-art image and video based models on the SUN-SEG benchmark.
- It has the least parameters (21.95M) among compared models and highest speed (108 FPS).
- Analysis is done to determine optimal sequence length (5 frames) to process.
- Different backbones and temporal fusion techniques are explored and evaluated.
- Detailed experiments justify the choices like ConvNext backbone and bidirectional ConvLSTM.
- The model shows strength in handling various visual attributes like ghosting, occlusion etc.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient video segmentation model for polyp detection that outperforms existing approaches. It provides extensive analysis to justify the design choices and demonstrates superior performance especially with challenging video attributes.
