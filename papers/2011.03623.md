# [Feature Removal Is a Unifying Principle for Model Explanation Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03623)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper does not appear to have a single focused research question or hypothesis. Instead, it proposes a broad framework for unifying and understanding a wide variety of model explanation methods. The key ideas are:

- Many existing model explanation methods can be viewed through the lens of "removal-based explanations", where features are removed from the model in order to measure their influence. 

- Removal-based explanations can be characterized along three dimensions: how features are removed, what model behavior is analyzed, and how each feature's influence is summarized.

- The authors propose a mathematical framework to formally define removal-based explanations using these three dimensions. The framework provides a way to precisely specify different methods and reveal their similarities.

- Using this framework, the authors are able to unify and systematize 26 existing explanation methods from across the literature. They identify important groups and neighbors within this space of methods.

- The framework provides a basis for better understanding trade-offs between methods and can inform the development of new techniques. It also connects methods to ideas from cooperative game theory and information theory.

In summary, this paper does not test a specific hypothesis, but rather proposes a unifying perspective and mathematical framework to better understand the diverse landscape of model explanation methods developed in recent years. The key insight is the widespread use of feature removal as an explanation strategy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a unified framework for understanding and comparing a large class of model explanation methods called "removal-based explanations." The key contributions are:

1. The paper proposes a framework that characterizes removal-based explanation methods along three dimensions: how they remove features, what model behavior they explain, and how they summarize each feature's influence. 

2. The framework unifies 26 existing explanation methods from diverse areas like computer vision, game theory, and feature selection. By disentangling their choices, it reveals the fundamental similarities between methods that were often viewed as distinct approaches. 

3. The paper generalizes numerous explanation methods to express them within the unified framework, exposing connections between methods that were not apparent from the original works.

4. The framework provides mathematical tools like subset functions to formalize different techniques for removing features from models. This enables precise reasoning about the relationships between methods.

5. Visualizing the framework as a grid reveals crowded areas and sparse areas, shedding light on the maturity of certain approaches and opportunities for new methods.

6. The framework empowers users to make more informed choices between explanation methods by explicating their trade-offs. It also suggests promising theoretical directions for future research.

In summary, the key insight is that many diverse explanation methods rely on the same general principle of removing features, and can be understood through three precise mathematical choices. Formally characterizing methods this way enables systematic reasoning about the growing landscape of model explanation techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper develops a unified framework for model explanation methods that characterizes approaches based on the principle of simulating feature removal, showing they can be specified using three precise mathematical choices: a subset function to remove features, a set function to represent model behavior on feature subsets, and a summarization technique to explain each feature's influence.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a unifying framework for model explanation methods based on the idea of "explaining by removing" features. It compares this framework to prior work on unifying explanation methods, such as the additive feature attribution methods framework of Lundberg & Lee and the modified backpropagation frameworks of Ancona et al. 

The key differences are:

- Scope: This framework is broader than prior unifying theories, encompassing 26 existing methods across areas like computer vision, game theory, and feature selection. 

- Formalization: The framework formalizes the idea of "explaining by removing" using mathematical tools like subset functions. This provides a precise way to characterize and compare methods.

- Choices: The framework breaks down explanations into three distinct choices - how features are removed, what model behavior is analyzed, and how influence is summarized. This modular view facilitates reasoning about trade-offs.

- Relationships: Visualizing methods in the framework exposes similarities between supposedly disparate methods. Many "neighbors" exist that differ in only one choice.

Overall, this framework provides a novel perspective that is more comprehensive than prior theories. It offers new tools for systematizing and relating methods based on precise mathematical choices. This enables clearer reasoning about the trade-offs among different explanation techniques.

In summary, this work expands the scope of unification, increases mathematical formalization, exposes new relationships between methods, and structures reasoning through distinct choices - advancing understanding of the explanation literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest several promising directions for future research based on their framework for removal-based explanations:

1. Several of the methods they characterize can be interpreted using ideas from information theory. They suspect that other methods could also be understood through an information-theoretic lens, which may reveal theoretically justified choices for each dimension of their framework.

2. They showed that every removal-based explanation relies on an underlying set function representing the model's behavior. These set functions can be viewed as cooperative games, and the authors suspect that techniques from cooperative game theory beyond just Shapley values could provide insight into additional methods.

3. They find it remarkable that so many researchers independently developed explanation methods relying on feature removal. They speculate that cognitive psychology research may reveal why this is a natural approach to explaining complex decision processes. Connecting with psychology could be impactful since current methods are disconnected from social science.

4. Their framework provides an opportunity to develop new methods by exploring the space of possible choices, such as currently unoccupied positions in their visualization of the methods (Figure 5).

5. The framework also enables explicitly reasoning about trade-offs between existing methods along each dimension. This could reveal advantages of different choices.

In summary, the authors propose that their framework can serve as a foundation for future research by enabling new methods to be developed, facilitating analysis of trade-offs between design choices, and encouraging connections with social science research on explanation and understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for explainable machine learning called Removal-Based Explanations. The key idea is that many popular explanation methods work by essentially removing features from a model in order to measure each feature's impact. The paper develops a unified framework that characterizes explanation methods along three dimensions: 1) how they remove features, 2) what model behavior they explain, and 3) how they summarize each feature's influence. The authors show that their framework encompasses 26 existing methods, including widely used approaches like SHAP, LIME, and permutation tests. By formalizing the shared principles behind these methods, their framework helps reveal the relationships between different techniques and provides guidance on choosing an appropriate explanation method. The authors also suggest their perspective reveals promising directions for future explainability research. Overall, the paper provides a useful conceptual framing and synthesis of the model explanation literature.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a novel framework for model explanation methods based on the idea of simulating feature removal. The authors observe that many popular methods for explaining machine learning models work by removing features from the model in order to determine the impact on the model's output. Based on this key insight, the authors develop a unifying framework that characterizes explanation methods along three dimensions: 1) how features are removed from the model, 2) what model behavior is analyzed after removing features, and 3) how the impact of removing features is summarized to generate an explanation. The authors show that their framework encompasses 26 existing methods, including widely used techniques like SHAP, LIME, and permutation feature importance. By breaking down these methods into their fundamental components, the framework enables clearer reasoning about the relationships between different techniques and reveals opportunities for developing new methods. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive perspective on a major branch of the interpretability literature and offers new theoretical tools for understanding and advancing research on model explanations.

The key insight enabling the authors' unifying framework is the recognition that many diverse methods are based on essentially the same principle of removing features to determine their effect. By formalizing different techniques for removing features, model behaviors to analyze, and strategies for explanation summarization, the authors are able to precisely characterize and relate methods that previously seemed disconnected. Their framework disentangles the choices made by each method and supports reasoning about the trade-offs among techniques. This thesis opens up many new research directions, such as exploring connections to information theory and game theory, and studying the degree to which removal-based explanations match human explanation processes. By exposing the fundamental unity underlying major model explanation approaches, this work provides an important step towards a more systematic understanding of interpretability techniques.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "Feature Removal Is A Unifying Principle For Model Explanation Methods":

The paper develops a unified framework that characterizes a significant portion of the model explanation literature. The key insight is that many explanation methods can be understood as simulating feature removal in order to quantify each feature's influence on a model. The paper shows that these "removal-based" explanation methods vary along three dimensions: 1) how they remove features from the model (e.g., by setting features to default values or marginalizing over a distribution of values), 2) what model behavior they explain (e.g., an individual prediction or the model's loss function), and 3) how they summarize each feature's influence (e.g., by removing features individually or calculating Shapley values). By systematizing methods along these three choices, the paper reveals the fundamental similarity of approaches that were previously viewed as distinct. The framework encompasses 26 existing methods, including widely used techniques like SHAP, LIME, and permutation tests. Overall, the paper provides a unifying perspective that helps characterize trade-offs in the model explanation literature.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the challenge of interpreting and explaining complex machine learning models. Specifically, it focuses on developing a unified framework for a class of methods called "removal-based explanations". These are methods that explain a model's behavior by quantifying the impact of removing sets of features from the model. 

The key question the paper is trying to address is: how are the wide variety of removal-based explanation methods related, and when is one method preferable to another? The paper finds that while many diverse methods have been proposed, they can be systematized and unified under a common framework based on three key choices:

1) How the method removes features from the model
2) What model behavior the method explains 
3) How the method summarizes each feature's influence

By characterizing methods along these dimensions, the paper provides a way to reason about the relationships and trade-offs between different removal-based explanation techniques. The goal is to empower users to make more informed choices between methods and provide guidance for developing improved explanation techniques. Overall, the paper aims to bring clarity and unification to this active area of research.
