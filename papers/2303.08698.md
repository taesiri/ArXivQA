# [Bi-directional Distribution Alignment for Transductive Zero-Shot   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08698)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes in transductive zero-shot learning (TZSL) using generative models. Specifically, it proposes a novel framework called Bi-VAEGAN that aligns the distributions between visual and semantic/attribute spaces bidirectionally for unseen classes to enable better knowledge transfer. The key hypotheses are:- Adding a transductive regressor that maps visual features back to the attribute space will provide additional supervision to guide the alignment and generation of visual features for unseen classes. - Alignment can be improved by normalizing features using L2 norm instead of min-max and adding noise to attributes during training.- Estimating the unseen class prior distribution is important for alignment, especially for highly imbalanced datasets. A simple but effective cluster prior estimation method is proposed.By incorporating these elements into a VAE-GAN model, Bi-VAEGAN aims to achieve state-of-the-art performance on TZSL by reducing the distribution mismatch between seen and unseen classes. The experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed bidirectional alignment framework and the design choices.
