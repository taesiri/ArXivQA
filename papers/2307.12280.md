# [Downstream-agnostic Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12280)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the main research question this paper tries to address is: How to construct effective adversarial examples against pre-trained encoders in self-supervised learning when the attacker has no knowledge of the pre-training datasets or downstream tasks?The key points are:- Pre-trained encoders are becoming popular in industry for transfer learning. However, their security risks, especially vulnerability to adversarial examples, are not well studied. - Constructing adversarial examples against pre-trained encoders is challenging, as the attacker does not know the pre-training data or downstream tasks. Existing attacks on supervised models cannot be directly applied.- The paper proposes a novel attack framework called AdvEncoder to generate downstream-agnostic universal adversarial perturbations and patches by altering the texture information of images.- A frequency-based generative network is designed to improve attack success rate and transferability by learning distributions.- Experiments on 14 self-supervised training methods and 4 datasets demonstrate high attack performance of AdvEncoder, highlighting the need for defenses tailored for pre-trained encoders.In summary, the paper focuses on the open problem of adversarial attack on pre-trained encoders in self-supervised learning, and proposes a practical and effective attack framework to construct universal adversarial examples without needing knowledge of pre-training or downstream data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes AdvEncoder, the first attack framework to construct downstream-agnostic universal adversarial examples in self-supervised learning. The paper reveals that pre-trained encoders used in self-supervised learning incur severe security risks for downstream tasks that utilize them. 2. It designs a frequency-based generative network to generate universal adversarial examples. The key idea is to directly alter the texture features of images to fool the models. The framework is flexible and can generate both adversarial perturbations and patches.3. The paper conducts extensive experiments on 14 self-supervised training methods and 4 image datasets. The results demonstrate that AdvEncoder can achieve high attack success rates and transferability against different downstream tasks, without knowing the pre-training or downstream datasets.4. The paper examines four popular defense methods against AdvEncoder. The results further prove the attack ability of AdvEncoder and highlight the need for new defense mechanisms tailored for pre-trained encoders.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel and effective attack framework AdvEncoder to generate universal adversarial examples for pre-trained encoders used in self-supervised learning. The attack does not require knowing the pre-training or downstream data. The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the attack performance and transferability.
