# [Global Games with Negative Feedback for Autonomous Colony Maintenance   using Robot Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15621)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the colony maintenance problem where a team of robots must continuously maintain the energy supply of an autonomous colony. The robots achieve this by foraging for food items scattered in the environment. The current energy level of the colony is measured by a real-valued signal s(t). The paper also considers the presence of a human who can recruit some of the robots for external tasks, requiring the system to be resilient to removal of robots. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper models the problem as a global game, where each robot measures the signal s(t) and uses it to determine whether to forage based on a utility function. The utility function is designed using a mechanism design approach to incentivize the desired system behavior. It includes:
- Cost for foraging to avoid all robots foraging 
- Constant reward and signal value to incentivize foraging
- Negative exponential term that decreases with more robots foraging 

This creates negative feedback, unlike typical global games. The marginal utility π(n, θ) of foraging is proven to be decreasing in n, the number of robots foraging. This stabilizes the number of foraging robots at a non-trivial Nash equilibrium. Robots use a hysteresis-based switching behavior between foraging and being idle. A mixed strategy is used to determine the probability of a robot beginning to forage based on the current Nash equilibrium.

Main Contributions:
1) A global game framework for robot foraging without communication
2) Analysis showing how positive feedback leads to unstable equilibria where all/no robots forage 
3) Introduction of negative feedback to stabilize the equilibrium and make the system resilient to removal of robots
4) Demonstration via simulation of the performance and resilience of the proposed approach
