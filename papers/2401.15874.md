# [Rethinking Personalized Federated Learning with Clustering-based Dynamic   Graph Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15874)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing personalized federated learning (PFL) approaches have some limitations: 1) Parameter decoupling-based methods are complex to implement and have challenges in dividing parameters. 2) Clustering-based methods overlook relations between clusters and may require additional intricate designs. 

Solution - FedCedar:
The paper proposes a simple yet effective PFL framework called FedCedar that addresses data heterogeneity while capturing hidden relations across clients. The key components are:

1. Client Model Clustering: Clients are clustered on the server based on uploaded model parameters to group similar clients.  

2. Dynamic Graph Construction: Cluster centers are treated as nodes in a graph connected by weighted edges based on similarity. This reveals relations between clusters.

3. Knowledge Propagation: Node representations are updated across the graph to propagate knowledge between clusters. 

4. Precise Model Distribution: Personalized models are sent back to clients based on whether they were active in the previous round. This maintains iterative training benefits.

Main Contributions:
1) Captures hidden relations between clients through dynamic graph learning. First work to utilize clustering and graphs jointly for PFL.

2) Propagates knowledge between clusters via graph to further enhance model updates.

3) Designs precise personalized model distribution to maintain iterative training benefits.

Experiments:
Evaluated on MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR datasets under IID and non-IID settings. Outperforms baselines like FedAvg, pFedMe, SFL, etc. Ablation studies validate contributions of key components. Case study on structured datasets shows captured topologies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a personalized federated learning framework called FedCedar that groups clients into clusters, constructs a dynamic weighted graph connecting the cluster centers, propagates information across the graph to update the models at each node, and precisely distributes personalized models back to the clients to address data heterogeneity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple yet effective personalized federated learning framework called FedCedar. The key ideas include:

1) Performing client model clustering on the server to group similar clients.

2) Constructing a dynamic weighted graph to connect the cluster centers and capture hidden relationships between clusters.
