# [Deep Learning-Based Auto-Segmentation of Planning Target Volume for   Total Marrow and Lymph Node Irradiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06494)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate contouring of the Planning Target Volume (PTV) is critical for complex radiotherapy treatments like Total Marrow and Lymph Node Irradiation (TMLI). However, manual contouring is time-consuming and error-prone.
- There is limited prior work on using deep learning for auto-contouring the PTV in TMLI due to lack of datasets and the heterogeneity of the target volume components.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop deep learning models to automate segmentation of the PTV for TMLI patients.
- Compare a 2D U-Net, 2D nnU-Net, and 3D nnU-Net model trained on a dataset of 94 TMLI patients.
- Assess performance on full PTV and PTV with bones excluded to evaluate accuracy on the more challenging lymph nodes.

Main Contributions:
- nnU-Net models significantly outperform vanilla U-Net, increasing median Dice score from 85.4% to 88.6%. 
- Performance does not degrade much with bones excluded, suggesting models can accurately contour challenging lymph nodes.  
- No significant difference between 2D and 3D nnU-Net, indicating limited dataset size restricted 3D model improvements.
- Demonstrates feasibility and scalability of using deep learning for PTV contouring in complex TMLI radiotherapy.
- Allows more patients to potentially benefit from TMLI treatment.

In summary, the paper makes important progress towards automating contouring for TMLI via deep learning, showing robust performance even without the easier-to-segment bones. The models could effectively assist clinicians, reducing time and errors in planning this complex treatment.
