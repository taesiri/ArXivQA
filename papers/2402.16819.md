# [Nemotron-4 15B Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16819)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent language models have focused only on scaling up model size, leading to high latency and compute costs during inference. 
- There is a need for smaller yet performant language models that can fit on a single GPU for efficient deployment.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces Nemotron-4 15B, a 15 billion parameter multilingual language model trained on 8 trillion tokens.
- It follows the Chinchilla scaling laws which argue for scaling data with model size given a fixed compute budget, instead of only scaling up model size. 
- The model uses a standard Transformer architecture and was trained on English, multilingual and code data using 384 DGX H100 nodes over 13 days.

Main Contributions:
- Nemotron-4 15B achieves state-of-the-art results amongst open models of similar size on a diverse set of English, multilingual and code benchmarks.
- It outperforms larger models like LLaMA-2 34B and shows the best multilingual performance over other specialized multilingual models.
- With strong performance across tasks, it demonstrates being an efficient and effective general purpose 15B parameter model that can fit on a single GPU.
- The results showcase the benefit of scaling data over model size, and using a mixture of English, multilingual and code data.

In summary, the paper presents Nemotron-4 15B, an efficient 15 billion parameter model trained on an 8 trillion token blended dataset that achieves excellent performance across English, multilingual and code tasks compared to other similarly sized models.
