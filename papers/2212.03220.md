# [Visual Query Tuning: Towards Effective Usage of Intermediate   Representations for Parameter and Memory Efficient Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03220)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively utilize intermediate features of pre-trained Vision Transformer models for parameter and memory efficient transfer learning to downstream tasks. Specifically, the key hypothesis is that introducing additional learnable "query" tokens to each Transformer layer allows summarizing the rich intermediate features in a way that keeps them intact, avoids expensive backpropagation, and enables effective transfer via linear probing.

The paper proposes Visual Query Tuning (VQT) as a simple yet effective approach to leverage frozen intermediate features of Transformers for transfer learning. The key ideas are:

1. Intermediate features of pre-trained models are informative for transfer but directly using them is challenging due to their huge number. 

2. Introducing learnable "query" tokens to each Transformer layer allows leveraging the self-attention mechanism to summarize intermediate features across tokens.

3. This keeps intermediate features intact, avoids expensive backpropagation, and enables memory-efficient training.

4. The summarized features can then be used for effective transfer learning via linear probing.

5. VQT is complementary to methods that adapt intermediate features, and combining them can further improve transfer learning performance.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that VQT provides an effective and lightweight way to leverage rich intermediate features for parameter and memory efficient transfer learning. Experiments validate this approach and show advantages over prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes visual query tuning (VQT), a simple yet effective approach to aggregate intermediate features of Vision Transformers for transferring pre-trained models to downstream tasks. The key contributions are:

1. VQT introduces learnable "query" tokens to each layer of a Vision Transformer. These tokens leverage the model's self-attention mechanism to summarize the rich intermediate features in each layer. This allows efficient transfer learning through linear probing, without changing the backbone model. 

2. VQT is complementary to other parameter-efficient transfer learning methods like visual prompt tuning (VPT) that adapt intermediate features. Experiments show VQT and VPT can be combined for improved performance. 

3. Compared to methods like VPT, VQT is more memory-efficient during training as it does not require backpropagation through the large backbone model. Experiments validate this advantage.

4. VQT shows robust performance across different pre-training methods like supervised, self-supervised, and image-text pre-training. It consistently outperforms prior work in leveraging intermediate features across various datasets.

In summary, VQT provides an effective and lightweight approach to make use of rich intermediate features in Vision Transformers for transfer learning, with advantages in accuracy, compatibility, and memory efficiency.
