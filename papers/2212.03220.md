# [Visual Query Tuning: Towards Effective Usage of Intermediate   Representations for Parameter and Memory Efficient Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03220)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively utilize intermediate features of pre-trained Vision Transformer models for parameter and memory efficient transfer learning to downstream tasks. Specifically, the key hypothesis is that introducing additional learnable "query" tokens to each Transformer layer allows summarizing the rich intermediate features in a way that keeps them intact, avoids expensive backpropagation, and enables effective transfer via linear probing.

The paper proposes Visual Query Tuning (VQT) as a simple yet effective approach to leverage frozen intermediate features of Transformers for transfer learning. The key ideas are:

1. Intermediate features of pre-trained models are informative for transfer but directly using them is challenging due to their huge number. 

2. Introducing learnable "query" tokens to each Transformer layer allows leveraging the self-attention mechanism to summarize intermediate features across tokens.

3. This keeps intermediate features intact, avoids expensive backpropagation, and enables memory-efficient training.

4. The summarized features can then be used for effective transfer learning via linear probing.

5. VQT is complementary to methods that adapt intermediate features, and combining them can further improve transfer learning performance.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that VQT provides an effective and lightweight way to leverage rich intermediate features for parameter and memory efficient transfer learning. Experiments validate this approach and show advantages over prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes visual query tuning (VQT), a simple yet effective approach to aggregate intermediate features of Vision Transformers for transferring pre-trained models to downstream tasks. The key contributions are:

1. VQT introduces learnable "query" tokens to each layer of a Vision Transformer. These tokens leverage the model's self-attention mechanism to summarize the rich intermediate features in each layer. This allows efficient transfer learning through linear probing, without changing the backbone model. 

2. VQT is complementary to other parameter-efficient transfer learning methods like visual prompt tuning (VPT) that adapt intermediate features. Experiments show VQT and VPT can be combined for improved performance. 

3. Compared to methods like VPT, VQT is more memory-efficient during training as it does not require backpropagation through the large backbone model. Experiments validate this advantage.

4. VQT shows robust performance across different pre-training methods like supervised, self-supervised, and image-text pre-training. It consistently outperforms prior work in leveraging intermediate features across various datasets.

In summary, VQT provides an effective and lightweight approach to make use of rich intermediate features in Vision Transformers for transfer learning, with advantages in accuracy, compatibility, and memory efficiency.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes visual query tuning (VQT), a simple yet effective approach to adapt pre-trained Vision Transformer models to downstream tasks while keeping the backbone model frozen. VQT introduces additional learnable "query" tokens at the input of each Transformer layer. Through the self-attention mechanism, these query tokens are able to summarize the rich intermediate features of each layer, without modifying the original intermediate features. The summarized features from the query tokens can then be used to train task-specific prediction heads. Compared to methods like visual prompt tuning (VPT) which modify the intermediate features, VQT keeps them intact, allowing more efficient training without needing to backpropagate through the full backbone model. Experiments on various datasets and model architectures demonstrate that VQT consistently improves accuracy over baseline methods, and is complementary to other parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like VPT and AdaptFormer. Key advantages of VQT are its simplicity, efficiency, and robustness across diverse model architectures and pre-training methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Visual Query Tuning (VQT) for adapting pre-trained Transformer models like Vision Transformers (ViT) to downstream tasks. VQT keeps the backbone model frozen and introduces additional learnable "query tokens" to each layer that summarize the intermediate features produced by that layer. This allows VQT to leverage the existing intermediate features of the frozen backbone model rather than changing the features like other methods. 

VQT is shown to be compatible with and complementary to other parameter-efficient transfer learning methods that do update the backbone features. Experiments demonstrate that VQT consistently improves over the prior state-of-the-art in utilizing intermediate features and also outperforms full fine-tuning on several tasks. VQT is particularly effective when using self-supervised or weakly supervised backbones where relevant features may be buried in intermediate layers. Finally, VQT is much more memory efficient during training compared to methods that adapt the backbone. The paper demonstrates that VQT provides an effective and lightweight way to enhance transfer learning performance.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes visual query tuning (VQT), a simple yet effective approach to adapt pre-trained Vision Transformer models to downstream tasks while keeping the backbone model frozen. VQT introduces a small set of learnable "query tokens" to the input of each Transformer layer in the backbone model. These query tokens are only used to generate query vectors in the self-attention mechanism, allowing them to summarize the intermediate features from each layer without changing the original features. The outputs of these query tokens after each layer are then concatenated and used along with the final CLS token from the last layer to train a linear classifier for the downstream task. By keeping the intermediate features intact and only learning to combine them through the query tokens, VQT enjoys memory efficiency compared to methods that fine-tune the backbone model. Experiments show VQT outperforms both a standard linear classifier baseline and the state-of-the-art intermediate feature utilization method Head2Toe, while also demonstrating compatibility with common parameter-efficient tuning methods like AdaptFormer and VPT.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of how to effectively adapt large pre-trained Vision Transformer models to downstream tasks in a parameter and memory efficient way. More specifically, the key questions it aims to tackle are:

1) How to effectively leverage the rich intermediate features of Vision Transformers for transfer learning, given the huge amount of them in each layer? 

2) How to achieve parameter-efficient transfer learning without sacrificing much accuracy compared to full fine-tuning?

3) How to reduce the memory footprint during training for parameter-efficient methods?

To address these questions, the paper proposes Visual Query Tuning (VQT), which introduces a small set of learnable "query" tokens to each Transformer layer. These query tokens can summarize the intermediate features of each layer through the self-attention mechanism, and their outputs can then be used for training the prediction heads of downstream tasks. 

Compared to prior works, VQT has the following advantages:

- It keeps all the original intermediate features intact and only learns to combine them, making it very memory efficient without needing to backpropagate through the entire backbone.

- It is complementary to methods that adapt intermediate features (e.g. VPT, AdaptFormer), and combining them leads to further performance boost. 

- It is robust to different pre-training methods like supervised, self-supervised, and image-text pre-training.

- It achieves much higher accuracy than other methods under constrained memory, suggesting it is more memory-efficient.

In summary, VQT proposes an effective and lightweight approach to leverage intermediate features of Vision Transformers for parameter and memory efficient transfer learning. The simplicity and compatibility of VQT make it an appealing add-on technique.
