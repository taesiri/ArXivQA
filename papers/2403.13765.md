# [Towards Principled Representation Learning from Videos for Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13765)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) from offline data is an important capability. However, naturally occurring RL data containing actions and reward labels is scarce. In contrast, video data containing only observations is abundant in many domains. 
- Prior work has developed video representation learning methods such as autoencoders, forward modeling, and temporal contrastive learning, but lacks theoretical understanding of when they work.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1) Theoretical Analysis in Absence of Exogenous Noise:
- Prove upper bounds showing forward modeling and temporal contrastive learning provably recover latent state from videos in Block MDPs, leading to sample efficient downstream RL.
- Show theoretically that forward modeling has higher margin while temporal contrastive learning has lower complexity function class.

2) Theoretical Lower Bound with Exogenous Noise:  
- Establish sample complexity lower bound showing video representation learning can be exponentially worse than learning with trajectory data in hard instances with exogenous noise.

3) Analysis of Susceptibility to Exogenous Noise:
- Prove instance showing temporal contrastive fails with any amount of exogenous noise while forward modeling succeeds with limited noise.
- Empirically show forward modeling degrades gradually with more exogenous noise.  

4) Experiments in 3 Visual Domains:
- Evaluate on GridWorld, VizDoom Basic & VizDoom Defend the Center environments.
- Results validate theory - forward/contrastive work without noise but contrastive fails completely with exogenous noise while forward degrades. Trajectory-based ACRO consistently works showing video is worse.

In summary, this paper provides theoretical and empirical understanding of when video representation learning works, its limitations compared to trajectory-based learning, and why it struggles with exogenous noise.
