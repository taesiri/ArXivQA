# [Generic Attention-model Explainability for Interpreting Bi-Modal and   Encoder-Decoder Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15679)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus seems to be developing a generic attention model explainability method that can be applied to interpret different types of Transformer architectures, including bi-modal Transformers and Transformers with encoder-decoder attention. 

The key hypotheses/goals appear to be:

- Existing Transformer explainability methods rely too heavily on self-attention and don't generalize well to other attention mechanisms like co-attention. 

- A more comprehensive approach is needed that can track the evolution and mixing of different types of attention maps across layers.

- They propose a generic framework that can handle self-attention, co-attention, and encoder-decoder attention through carefully designed propagation rules. 

- Their method will produce better explanations compared to adapting existing self-attention focused methods to multi-modal and encoder-decoder Transformers.

In summary, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a generic attention model explainability method that works well across diverse Transformer architectures beyond just self-attention? The key hypothesis is that their proposed comprehensive tracking of different attention interactions will achieve superior performance compared to more narrowly focused existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

- Proposing a new method to explain predictions from Transformer-based architectures, including bi-modal Transformers and Transformers with encoder-decoder attention. 

- The proposed method tracks the evolution and mixing of attention maps across layers to produce relevance maps that highlight important input tokens for a given prediction.

- The method provides a generic framework that can be applied to different Transformer architectures like self-attention, self-attention + co-attention, and encoder-decoder models. 

- Empirically evaluating the method on representative models from each architecture (VisualBERT, LXMERT, DETR) and showing it outperforms existing Transformer explanation methods, especially for co-attention and encoder-decoder models.

- Demonstrating the method's effectiveness on multi-modal tasks like VQA where both text and image are important for prediction, as well as for generating segmentation masks from object detection models.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for explaining predictions from Transformer-based models that handle multiple modalities or have encoder-decoder architectures, demonstrating its effectiveness on vision-language models and object detection models compared to existing explainability techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of neural network explainability:

- It focuses specifically on explaining Transformers, which have become very popular in recent years but lack extensive explainability research compared to CNNs. Many existing explainability methods are designed for CNNs.

- The paper proposes a novel method that is able to handle different types of attention mechanisms used in Transformers, including self-attention, cross-attention, and encoder-decoder attention. Most prior work has focused only on self-attention. 

- The method is evaluated on a range of Transformer architectures for different tasks, including image classification, visual question answering, and object detection. Many existing Transformer explainability papers focus on a single architecture or task.

- Both visual and textual explanations are provided. Some prior work focuses only on visual explanations for vision Transformers, while others look only at textual explanations for language Transformers.

- Both qualitative examples and quantitative evaluations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For the quantitative evaluation, the paper uses perturbation-based tests which directly measure the impact on the model's predictions, going beyond just analyzing the attention maps.

- Comparisons are made systematically to adapted versions of prior Transformer explainability methods, as well as other explainability techniques like Grad-CAM and LRP. This provides a more rigorous assessment of the performance of the proposed approach.

Overall, a key contribution of this paper is providing a more unified explanation framework that works across different Transformer architectures and modalities, while also demonstrating its effectiveness more thoroughly through visual, textual, qualitative and perturbation-based evaluations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying the proposed explainability method to other Transformer-based architectures beyond the ones explored in this work, such as architectures used for other modalities like video and audio. The authors state their method can be generalized to address more than two modalities.

- Extending the method to provide pixel-level or region-level explanations instead of token-level explanations. The authors note their method currently produces explanations at the level of input tokens. Providing more spatially fine-grained explanations could be useful.

- Evaluating the explanations produced by their method via human studies. The authors mainly use quantitative evaluations in this work, but suggest evaluating the quality, faithfulness, and utility of the explanations via user studies. 

- Applying their method to study if and how the different Transformer attention modules learn to focus on specific input modalities. The authors suggest their method could provide insights into the roles of different attention modules.

- Extending their method to other Transformer applications beyond vision and language, such as Transformers for chemical molecule property prediction. The authors state their method is generic and could be applied to many domains.

- Comparing their method to perturbation-based methods and gradient methods adapted for Transformer architectures. The authors note they mainly compare to attention and relevance-based methods in this work.

So in summary, the main directions are applying the method to new architectures and modalities, providing finer-grained explanations, evaluating via human studies, analyzing what is learned, extending to new domains, and comparing to a wider range of explanation methods.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for explaining predictions made by Transformer-based architectures, including bi-modal Transformers and Transformers with encoder-decoder attention. The key contribution is developing generic propagation rules that track the evolution of attention maps across layers to produce relevancy scores. This allows explaining any Transformer architecture, whereas prior work focused only on self-attention. The proposed rules handle self-attention, co-attention between modalities, and encoder-decoder attention. The method is evaluated on three Transformer architectures: VisualBERT for self-attention, LXMERT for self+co-attention, and DETR for encoder-decoder attention. It outperforms adapted baseline methods, especially on LXMERT and DETR where co-attention is critical. The improved relevancy maps enable better visualization and downstream tasks like weakly supervised segmentation. A key advantage is the simplicity of the approach, only requiring hooks into attention modules rather than custom implementations. Overall, this provides the first comprehensive solution for explaining all Transformer architectures by carefully tracking information flow through different attention mechanisms.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for explaining predictions from Transformer-based architectures, including bi-modal Transformers and Transformers with encoder-decoder attention. The method produces attention maps that highlight the relevant connections between input tokens for a given prediction. 

The key contribution is forming attention relevancy matrices that track the evolution of attention across Transformer layers. The relevancy matrices are initialized based on the type of attention (self-attention versus cross-attention). Then specific propagation rules are applied to update the relevancy matrices after each layer's attention computation. This provides a complete picture of how attention distributes information across modalities and layers in the Transformer. Experiments on three Transformer architectures demonstrate the proposed method provides superior explanations compared to existing methods that focus solely on self-attention. The results highlight the importance of tracking cross-attention for explaining bi-modal Transformers and encoder-decoder Transformers.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for explaining predictions made by Transformer-based architectures, including bi-modal Transformers and Transformer encoder-decoders. The key idea is to track the evolution and mixing of attention maps across layers to produce relevance scores for each input token. The method initializes relevance matrices for self-attention and cross-attention. As it propagates through attention layers, it updates these matrices based on the attention weights and gradients. This results in relevance scores that reflect which input tokens are most important for the model's predictions. A main contribution is providing generic update rules that can handle different attention mechanisms like self-attention, cross-attention, and encoder-decoder attention. The method is evaluated on image-text tasks using VisualBERT, LXMERT, and object detection using DETR, demonstrating superior explanation performance compared to existing methods that rely solely on self-attention.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

The paper proposes the first method to explain predictions made by Transformer-based architectures that incorporate bi-modal inputs and encoder-decoders. Existing Transformer explainability methods rely heavily on self-attention and do not provide adaptations for other attention mechanisms commonly used in multi-modal Transformers. The authors provide generic solutions that can be applied to the three most commonly used Transformer architectures: pure self-attention, self-attention combined with co-attention, and encoder-decoder attention. They show their method is superior to adapting existing single-modality explainability methods to these architectures. The key ideas are propagating relevance through all Transformer components by tracking the evolution of attention maps, initializing relevance based on the input domains, and updating relevance according to the type of attention. Experiments on visual question answering, image recognition, and object detection models demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach over strong baselines. The method is easy to implement and readily extended to any attention-based architecture.
