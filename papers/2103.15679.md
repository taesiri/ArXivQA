# Generic Attention-model Explainability for Interpreting Bi-Modal and   Encoder-Decoder Transformers

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus seems to be developing a generic attention model explainability method that can be applied to interpret different types of Transformer architectures, including bi-modal Transformers and Transformers with encoder-decoder attention. The key hypotheses/goals appear to be:- Existing Transformer explainability methods rely too heavily on self-attention and don't generalize well to other attention mechanisms like co-attention. - A more comprehensive approach is needed that can track the evolution and mixing of different types of attention maps across layers.- They propose a generic framework that can handle self-attention, co-attention, and encoder-decoder attention through carefully designed propagation rules. - Their method will produce better explanations compared to adapting existing self-attention focused methods to multi-modal and encoder-decoder Transformers.In summary, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a generic attention model explainability method that works well across diverse Transformer architectures beyond just self-attention? The key hypothesis is that their proposed comprehensive tracking of different attention interactions will achieve superior performance compared to more narrowly focused existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:- Proposing a new method to explain predictions from Transformer-based architectures, including bi-modal Transformers and Transformers with encoder-decoder attention. - The proposed method tracks the evolution and mixing of attention maps across layers to produce relevance maps that highlight important input tokens for a given prediction.- The method provides a generic framework that can be applied to different Transformer architectures like self-attention, self-attention + co-attention, and encoder-decoder models. - Empirically evaluating the method on representative models from each architecture (VisualBERT, LXMERT, DETR) and showing it outperforms existing Transformer explanation methods, especially for co-attention and encoder-decoder models.- Demonstrating the method's effectiveness on multi-modal tasks like VQA where both text and image are important for prediction, as well as for generating segmentation masks from object detection models.- The proposed method is model-agnostic, simpler to implement than methods relying on LRP, and provides a complete solution for explaining all Transformer architectures.In summary, the key contribution is a new model-agnostic explanation method for Transformers that can handle different attention mechanisms and provides superior results compared to adapting existing methods. The effectiveness is shown for bi-modal and encoder-decoder Transformers which previous work did not address.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method for explaining predictions from Transformer-based models that handle multiple modalities or have encoder-decoder architectures, demonstrating its effectiveness on vision-language models and object detection models compared to existing explainability techniques.
