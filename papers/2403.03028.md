# [Word Importance Explains How Prompts Affect Language Model Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03028)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are revolutionizing many applications, but their opaque nature makes it hard to understand how they arrive at specific outputs. This lack of transparency is concerning for reliability, bias, and ethical issues. 
- Existing methods like attention weights have limitations for explaining LLM decisions and are not available for many popular proprietary models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a "word importance" method to quantify how individual words in the system prompt statistically impact LLM outputs, inspired by permutation importance from machine learning.
- The approach systematically masks words in the prompt and compares how scores of interest (like verbosity, readability, topic relevance) change for the model outputs. The score differences indicate the word's importance.
- This method can work with any proprietary LLM and custom text scores, providing model insights even when attention weights are unavailable.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates the word importance method can accurately reflect the influence of chosen suffixes appended to prompts. Importances positively correlate with suffix impact.
- Shows the approach is flexible to different models (GPT-3.5 Turbo and Llama2-13B tested), datasets and scoring functions. Can likely extend to other metrics like bias.
- Discusses how explaining model decisions words-by-word promotes trust and accountability in LLM applications across sectors like finance and healthcare.
- Suggests the methodology could aid optimization of prompts and model understanding. Establishes a pathway for improving transparency in proprietary LLMs.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative yet simple way to interpret LLM outputs at the word level, serving both scientific and ethical goals of demystifying these models. The proposed word importance technique has wide applicability and helps pave the way for more reliable and transparent AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents a method to improve the explainability of large language models by systematically masking words in prompts and measuring the impact on model outputs using arbitrary scoring functions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method to improve the explainability of large language models (LLMs) by varying individual words in prompts to uncover their statistical impact on the model outputs. Specifically:

- The paper proposes a word importance method inspired by permutation importance from machine learning. This involves systematically masking words in the system prompt and measuring the change in arbitrary user-defined text scores to determine each word's effect on the LLM's outputs.

- The word importance method is shown to be text score agnostic, meaning it can work with any scoring function to evaluate the LLM outputs. This enables decomposing the importance of words into specific measures of interest like bias, reading level, etc.

- Experiments demonstrate that word importance scores correlate well with the expected importance of suffix words when appended to prompts. This helps validate the approach and show it can illuminate the behavior of LLMs.

- The method is model-agnostic, simple to implement, and provides a way to interpret decisions of LLMs, even proprietary ones, to improve transparency and trust. Potential applications include identifying biased prompt words and prompt optimization.

In summary, the main contribution is an explainable word importance technique to uncover how individual words in prompts statistically influence LLMs' outputs, using any arbitrary text scoring function. This helps "open the black box" of LLMs to improve understandability and ethical usage.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the word importance method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using multiple scoring functions like readability, word count, and topic similarity. How could this method be extended to other types of scoring functions relevant for industry applications? What other scoring functions would be useful to analyze?

2. The paper evaluates the method on two language models - GPT-3.5 Turbo and Llama2-13B. How would the results differ across other large language models both in terms of model architecture and scale? Would the method work as effectively on models besides autoregressive transformers?

3. The choice of $N$, the number of completions per prompt, involves a tradeoff between cost and reliability. What strategies could be used to optimize this choice rather than using a fixed small $N$? For example basing it on an accuracy requirement.  

4. Could this word importance method be integrated into an active learning approach to efficiently explore large prompt spaces? How would the word importance scores guide further prompt exploration?

5. The paper mentions the possibility of using substitute words rather than just masking. How could methods like masked language modeling be used to generate useful substitute words and evaluate their impact?

6. How could the method be extended to multi-word phrases rather than just individual words? What changes would need to be made to handle variable phrase lengths?

7. What other visualization methods beyond the scatter plots shown could help users interpret the word importance results and correlations? How can the insights be presented optimally?

8. How does the user input query impact the word importance results? Could the method be adapted to analyze impact conditional on ranges of user queries?

9. The paper focuses on system prompt optimization, but how could the methodology analyze impact of words in user prompts? Would simply swapping user/system prompt provide useful insights?

10. The paper mentions a hierarchical masking approach to scale up analysis for long prompts. What heuristic criteria could guide which sections to prioritize masking first? When would it be suitable to transition to word-level masking?
