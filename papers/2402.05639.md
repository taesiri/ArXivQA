# [Nonparametric Instrumental Variable Regression through Stochastic   Approximate Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05639)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Instrumental variable (IV) methods are important for estimating causal effects from observational data when there are unobserved confounding variables. Nonparametric IV (NPIV) models provide more flexibility than traditional parametric models.
- However, NPIV is an ill-posed inverse problem, posing challenges for estimation. Most recent NPIV methods focus on continuous outcomes and have not addressed binary outcomes.

Proposed Method: 
- The authors propose a novel NPIV regression framework called Stochastic Approximate Gradient Descent IV (SAGD-IV) based on directly minimizing the population risk using stochastic approximate gradients.
- The gradient has two main components estimated from data: (1) the ratio of joint and marginal densities of the endogenous regressor and instrument and (2) the partial derivative of the loss function.  
- The method works for both continuous and binary outcomes by using appropriate loss functions. It can flexibly incorporate machine learning models like kernels and neural networks for estimation.

Main Contributions:
- Provided finite sample excess risk bounds under minimal assumptions for both continuous and binary response NPIV. Bounds explicitly account for estimation errors.
- Proposed method adapts to continuous and binary outcomes and can leverage both kernel and deep learning estimators.
- Empirically showed strong performance on par with or exceeding state-of-the-art NPIV methods on both synthetic and real datasets with continuous outcomes.
- Demonstrated promising performance on simulated binary outcome data, for which there are no existing benchmark nonparametric methods.

In summary, the paper introduces a flexible NPIV regression approach with theoretical justification and strong empirical performance on both continuous and binary response problems.
