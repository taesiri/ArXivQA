# [VRPTEST: Evaluating Visual Referring Prompting in Large Multimodal   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04087)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces VRPTest, a new benchmark for evaluating visual referring prompting (VRP) in large multimodal models (LMMs). VRP is a novel prompting method that uses visual pointers and scene texts to guide LMMs to focus on specific locations in images. The authors collect and annotate a dataset of 2,275 image-question pairs across 3 visual tasks, and use metamorphic testing to systematically generate VRP variants. They evaluate 8 major open-source and proprietary LMMs on VRPTest, including early GPT-4V versions, finding commercial models outperform open-source ones by 22.7% on average. However, performance varies greatly based on VRP strategy, with accuracy changing up to ±17.5\%, indicating the importance of prompt design. Case studies provide further insights into VRP's impact. Overall, this is the first comprehensive analysis of VRP's effect on LMMs. The benchmark and automated test framework developed enable continued research to understand and improve multimodal interaction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces VRPTEST, a benchmark dataset and framework to evaluate the performance of large multimodal models on visual referring prompting across different strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors introduce and release a benchmark dataset called VRPTest to enable evaluation of visual referring prompting (VRP) strategies in large multimodal models (LMMs). This includes both manually curated image-question pairs across 3 visual tasks, as well as systematically generated variants using metamorphic testing relations.

2) They provide a quantitative analysis of different VRP strategies and their impacts on LMM performance. The results show choice of strategy can significantly affect accuracy, with variations ranging from -17.5% to +7.3% depending on the model and dataset.

3) Case studies on GPT-4V offer further insights into how VRP can both improve and negatively impact LMMs. The authors provide guidance on prompt design to maximize benefits and minimize drawbacks of VRP. 

4) Through benchmarking 8 prominent open-source and proprietary LMMs, they reveal ample room for improvement in current models. Proprietary models like GPT-4V outperform open-source counterparts by an average 22.7% margin.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) a new benchmark for evaluating VRP, (2) quantitative analysis of VRP impacts, (3) case studies and insights on VRP in LMMs, and (4) performance benchmarking of current LMMs using the proposed benchmark. The work aims to catalyze research into visual context interactions in LMMs.
