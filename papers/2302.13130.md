# [Point Cloud Forecasting as a Proxy for 4D Occupancy Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13130)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to formulate point cloud forecasting as spacetime (4D) occupancy forecasting in order to focus algorithms on predicting the underlying scene geometry and motion rather than sensor-specific effects. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. Point cloud forecasting requires algorithms to implicitly capture sensor extrinsics, sensor intrinsics, and scene motion/geometry. It would be better to disentangle sensor effects from scene effects.

2. By reformulating point cloud forecasting as 4D occupancy forecasting, one can focus algorithms on predicting the central quantity of interest - the evolution of occupancy in spacetime. 

3. Since 4D occupancy ground truth is expensive, point clouds can be rendered from predicted 4D occupancy to enable training and evaluation. This allows comparing point cloud methods and 4D occupancy methods.

4. Learning 4D occupancy is more effective than directly predicting point clouds, since it disentangles sensor motion and focuses on scene geometry. This will lead to improved performance in point cloud forecasting benchmarks.

5. Disentangling sensor effects will enable better generalization across sensors and datasets.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that reformulating point cloud forecasting as 4D occupancy forecasting will improve performance and generalization by disentangling sensor effects from the underlying scene geometry and motion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing to reformulate point cloud forecasting as 4D spacetime occupancy forecasting. This disentangles sensor extrinsics and intrinsics from scene motion.

2. Developing a method for 4D occupancy forecasting that takes as input past point clouds and sensor poses, and predicts a 4D occupancy grid representing the evolution of the scene over time. 

3. Proposing metrics to evaluate point cloud and 4D occupancy forecasts based on raycasting into the predicted occupancy, factoring out sensor details.

4. Demonstrating that the proposed 4D occupancy forecasting method outperforms prior art in point cloud forecasting, achieves sensor generalization, and supports applications like novel view synthesis.

In summary, the key ideas are to disentangle sensor motion from scene motion by forecasting a generic 4D occupancy representation of the world, develop an approach to learn this in a self-supervised manner from raw LiDAR sequences, and propose evaluation metrics that focus on predicted geometry while factoring out sensor details. This allows the method to outperform prior point cloud forecasting techniques and generalize across sensors.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes reformulating point cloud forecasting as 4D occupancy forecasting to disentangle sensor motion from scene motion, allowing for improved performance and cross-sensor generalization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on point cloud forecasting:

- It takes a different approach by reformulating point cloud forecasting as 4D occupancy forecasting. Most prior work has directly forecasted future point clouds. This paper argues that predicting 4D occupancy allows separating sensor motion from scene motion. 

- It proposes evaluating point cloud forecasting methods by rendering point clouds from predicted 4D occupancy, instead of directly evaluating predicted point clouds. This allows comparing methods more fairly by factoring out differences in sensor configurations.

- It shows strong performance on point cloud forecasting benchmarks by training on the proposed 4D occupancy forecasting task. The method outperforms prior state-of-the-art point cloud forecasting techniques on several datasets.

- It demonstrates some benefits of the 4D occupancy approach like being able to render point clouds for novel sensor configurations and viewpoints. This enables things like sensor generalization and view synthesis.

- The proposed occupancy forecasting approach builds on recent work on forecasting 2D occupancy for autonomous driving, extending it to 3D space. So it connects occupancy forecasting research to point cloud forecasting.

Overall, this paper makes a compelling case for reformulating point cloud forecasting as an occupancy forecasting problem. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and several advantages of the proposed approach over direct point cloud forecasting. It opens up some new research directions at the intersection of occupancy and point cloud forecasting.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing methods for forecasting 4D semantic occupancy instead of just geometric occupancy. The authors note that predicting semantic information like object classes would be more useful for downstream tasks like motion planning.

- Exploring alternative approaches for evaluating 4D occupancy forecasting beyond rendering point clouds. The authors note limitations of point cloud rendering as an evaluation proxy and suggest looking into more direct evaluation methods.

- Improving performance on forecasting dynamic foreground elements like pedestrians and vehicles. The authors' analysis shows current methods perform worse on foreground objects compared to static background regions.

- Exploring applications like sensor generalization and novel view synthesis enabled by disentangling sensor motion and scene motion. The authors demonstrate initial results but suggest more work can be done here.

- Incorporating HD map priors and other domain knowledge to aid occupancy forecasting. The current self-supervised formulation does not leverage such additional information.

- Extending the formulation to forecast further than short time horizons of 1-3 seconds. The authors note most current work focuses on short horizons relevant for planning.

- Evaluating the impact of occupancy forecasting on downstream planning and decision making systems. More analysis is needed to validate the usefulness of these predictions.

In summary, the authors point to many promising research avenues, including improving semantics, evaluation, foreground motion modeling, applications, incorporation of priors, longer horizons, and downstream task impact. Their work provides a strong foundation and direction for advancing occupancy forecasting research.
