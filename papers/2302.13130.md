# [Point Cloud Forecasting as a Proxy for 4D Occupancy Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13130)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to formulate point cloud forecasting as spacetime (4D) occupancy forecasting in order to focus algorithms on predicting the underlying scene geometry and motion rather than sensor-specific effects. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. Point cloud forecasting requires algorithms to implicitly capture sensor extrinsics, sensor intrinsics, and scene motion/geometry. It would be better to disentangle sensor effects from scene effects.

2. By reformulating point cloud forecasting as 4D occupancy forecasting, one can focus algorithms on predicting the central quantity of interest - the evolution of occupancy in spacetime. 

3. Since 4D occupancy ground truth is expensive, point clouds can be rendered from predicted 4D occupancy to enable training and evaluation. This allows comparing point cloud methods and 4D occupancy methods.

4. Learning 4D occupancy is more effective than directly predicting point clouds, since it disentangles sensor motion and focuses on scene geometry. This will lead to improved performance in point cloud forecasting benchmarks.

5. Disentangling sensor effects will enable better generalization across sensors and datasets.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that reformulating point cloud forecasting as 4D occupancy forecasting will improve performance and generalization by disentangling sensor effects from the underlying scene geometry and motion.
