# PanGu-$α$: Large-scale Autoregressive Pretrained Chinese Language   Models with Auto-parallel Computation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be:How effective are large-scale autoregressive pretrained Chinese language models with hundreds of billions of parameters at natural language understanding and generation tasks in Chinese?The authors present their work on developing and training large autoregressive language models called PanGu-α with up to 200 billion parameters. The key hypothesis seems to be that by pretraining very large models on a massive Chinese dataset across diverse domains, the resulting models will achieve strong performance on a wide range of Chinese NLP tasks under few-shot or zero-shot settings. The paper details the model architecture, training methodology, dataset collection, and experimental results evaluating PanGu-α on tasks like text summarization, question answering, dialogue generation, and assessing the impact of model scale. The core goal is to demonstrate the capabilities of these huge pretrained models on various Chinese language tasks with minimal fine-tuning.
