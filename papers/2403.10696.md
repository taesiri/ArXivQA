# [On the low-shot transferability of [V]-Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10696)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper investigates the low-shot transfer capabilities of Visual Mamba ([V]-Mamba) models compared to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, it examines the performance differences when using two efficient transfer learning methods - linear probing (LP) and visual prompting (VP). The goal is to understand how well [V]-Mamba models can adapt to new tasks with limited data compared to ViTs.

Proposed Solution:
The paper conducts extensive experiments using 3 ViT models - DeiT-Small, DeiT3-Small, MoCov3-Small and 2 [V]-Mamba models - VSSM-Tiny, Vim-Small on 7 image classification datasets under low-data constraints. The datasets span near and far transfer scenarios. LP and VP are used to adapt the pretrained models and their performance is evaluated systematically. Additional ablation studies are performed with larger VSSM and Vim variants.

Key Findings:
1) [V]-Mamba models demonstrate superior or comparable few-shot performance to ViTs when using LP for transfer. 
2) With VP, [V]-Mamba models exhibit weaker or equivalent performance than ViTs.
3) There is a weak positive correlation between the LP vs VP performance gap and model capacity for [V]-Mamba variants.  

In summary, the paper provides the first empirical evaluation of low-shot transfer capabilities of [V]-Mamba models in comparison to ViTs. The analysis reveals their strengths with LP and relative weaknesses with VP. It also hints at the potential impact of model scaling on this performance gap. The findings lay the foundation for more in-depth studies on understanding transfer learning behaviors of [V]-Mamba models.
