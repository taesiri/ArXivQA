# [Provably Safe Neural Network Controllers via Differential Dynamic Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10998)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks (NNs) have potential as controllers for cyber-physical systems (CPS), but verifying their safety is challenging due to the complexity of NNs and hybrid systems. 
- Existing NN verification techniques either ignore the CPS dynamics (open-loop) or only analyze for a bounded time horizon (closed-loop). Neither approach can provide safety guarantees over an unbounded time horizon.

Proposed Solution - VERSAILLE:
- Combines differential dynamic logic (dL) with open-loop NN verification. 
- Reflects the NN controller in a dL model using a "nondeterministic mirror" program that behaves identically to the NN.
- Uses dL to prove safety of a high-level control strategy envelope.
- Automatically generates a "controller monitor" formula describing allowable behaviors.
- Verifies that the NN satisfies this formula over relevant states.
- If satisfied, the safety proof for the envelope carries over to the NN controller.

Proposed Solution - MOSAIC:
- First procedure to verify nonlinear, non-normalized properties on piecewise linear NNs.
- Soundly over- and under-approximates nonlinear constraints.
- Decomposes property into conjunctions (azulejos) over inputs.
- Checks each azulejo for violations using off-the-shelf NN verification tools. 
- Generalizes counterexamples to regions and filters for concreteness.

Main Contributions:
- First approach to prove infinite-time safety of NN-based control systems.
- Formal verification result carries over from high-level dL model to concrete NN implementation.
- First sound and complete technique to verify nonlinear properties on piecewise linear NNs.
- Enables automated safety analysis for complex CPS models and industrial applications.
- Demonstrated on adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance, and other case studies.

The key insight is to link the rigorous safety proofs from dL with efficient NN verification tools, overcoming limitations of each approach on its own. Together, VERSAILLE and MOSAIC provide practically useful safety guarantees for neural network controllers over an unbounded time horizon.
