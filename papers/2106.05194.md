# [DIGRAC: Digraph Clustering Based on Flow Imbalance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05194)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question this paper aims to address is: How can we effectively perform node clustering on directed graphs by directly maximizing flow imbalance between clusters, instead of relying on density differences?The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- Proposes a new graph neural network framework called DIGRAC for self-supervised node clustering on directed graphs. The main novelty is explicitly optimizing for directed flow imbalance between clusters as the objective.- Introduces new probabilistic imbalance loss functions based on normalized cut flows, which aim to maximize imbalance and serve as the training objective.- Can incorporate node features and does not require node labels, unlike many prior graph neural network methods. Complementary to existing methods by detecting alternative clustering structures.- Experiments on synthetic and real-world directed graphs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to 10 other methods across various settings. Able to uncover non-trivial migration patterns for example.- First method to directly maximize flow imbalance for node clustering on digraphs using graph neural networks. Novel application of imbalance as a self-supervised training signal.In summary, the key hypothesis is that explicitly optimizing for flow imbalance can be an effective clustering objective for directed graphs, even without density differences or supervision. The experiments seem to validate this hypothesis and highlight the benefits of the proposed DIGRAC framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing DIGRAC, a graph neural network framework to obtain node embeddings for directed graph clustering. The key aspects are:- Proposes a novel probabilistic imbalance loss to maximize flow imbalance between clusters, which serves as a self-supervised objective for clustering. This is the first GNN method to directly maximize flow imbalance.- Introduces directed flow imbalance measures that focus on directionality as the main clustering signal, as opposed to traditional density-based criteria.- Can incorporate node features and does not require node labels, unlike prior graph neural network methods for directed graph clustering.- Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in recovering imbalanced clusters across various contexts.In summary, the paper presents a novel self-supervised graph neural network approach for directed graph clustering that explicitly accounts for directionality and flow imbalance between clusters. This complements existing methods by enabling the detection of cluster structures defined by imbalance as opposed to density.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, introduction and conclusions, here is a one sentence summary:This paper introduces DIGRAC, a graph neural network framework for clustering directed graphs by maximizing flow imbalance between clusters, without requiring known cluster labels.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on the short abstract, here are a few key points of comparison to other research in digraph clustering:- The key novelty of this paper seems to be using direction-based flow imbalance as the main criterion for clustering, rather than density or modularity which are more commonly used. The authors argue that directionality contains important clustering information even when density differences are not present.- The proposed method DIGRAC uses a graph neural network approach to learn node embeddings that maximize a probabilistic imbalance loss function. This allows it to perform end-to-end self-supervised clustering without requiring ground truth labels.- Most prior digraph clustering methods either use spectral techniques, which cannot easily incorporate node features, or graph neural networks that require supervision. DIGRAC complements both by using a GNN in a self-supervised manner.- Compared to prior flow-based methods like InfoMap, DIGRAC does not rely on density and is optimized explicitly for imbalance, rather than randomness or description length.- The proposed framework can incorporate both node features and partial labels if available, building on recent semi-supervised GNN techniques.- The method is evaluated extensively on synthetic graphs and several real-world datasets. It appears to achieve state-of-the-art performance by directly optimizing for flow imbalance.In summary, this paper introduces a novel perspective and method for directed graph clustering using flow imbalance. The GNN approach allows flexible semi-supervised learning while outperforming unsupervised methods. If the claims hold up, this could become a new state-of-the-art technique for detecting clusters based on asymmetry rather than density.
