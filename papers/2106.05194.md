# [DIGRAC: Digraph Clustering Based on Flow Imbalance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05194)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question this paper aims to address is: How can we effectively perform node clustering on directed graphs by directly maximizing flow imbalance between clusters, instead of relying on density differences?The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- Proposes a new graph neural network framework called DIGRAC for self-supervised node clustering on directed graphs. The main novelty is explicitly optimizing for directed flow imbalance between clusters as the objective.- Introduces new probabilistic imbalance loss functions based on normalized cut flows, which aim to maximize imbalance and serve as the training objective.- Can incorporate node features and does not require node labels, unlike many prior graph neural network methods. Complementary to existing methods by detecting alternative clustering structures.- Experiments on synthetic and real-world directed graphs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to 10 other methods across various settings. Able to uncover non-trivial migration patterns for example.- First method to directly maximize flow imbalance for node clustering on digraphs using graph neural networks. Novel application of imbalance as a self-supervised training signal.In summary, the key hypothesis is that explicitly optimizing for flow imbalance can be an effective clustering objective for directed graphs, even without density differences or supervision. The experiments seem to validate this hypothesis and highlight the benefits of the proposed DIGRAC framework.
