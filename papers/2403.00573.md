# [IDTrust: Deep Identity Document Quality Detection with Bandpass   Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00573)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Identity document (ID) fraud is a major challenge. Effective automated systems are needed to verify ID authenticity and quality. 
- Existing methods have limitations in relying on specific document patterns, requiring alignment pre-processing, limited dataset applicability.

Proposed Solution:  
- Presents IDTrust - a deep learning framework to assess ID quality and detect forgeries.
- Introduces two models:
   1) DeepQD: Uses EfficientNet for feature extraction and comparison between original and scanned IDs.
   2) GuidedDeepQD: Enhances DeepQD by adding a bandpass filtering pre-processing stage to improve discrimination.

Main Contributions:
- Eliminates need for original document patterns and alignment pre-processing, improving dataset applicability.
- Comprehensive experiments on MIDV-2020 & L3i-ID datasets show GuidedDeepQD outperforms DeepQD in accuracy and AUC for detecting quality differences.
- Both models achieve near perfect accuracy in distinguishing original vs. scanned passports.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art CheckScan method for ID forgery detection, while being more generalizable and simpler.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective deep learning approach for identity document verification that eliminates certain limitations of prior arts. Rigorous experiments demonstrate its ability to reliably distinguish between original and forged identities across different datasets. The simplicity and generalizability of the models are also key strengths.
