# [Image Inpainting via Tractable Steering of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03349)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Diffusion models like DDPMs have achieved state-of-the-art results in generating high-quality and photorealistic images. However, controlling and constraining them for tasks like image inpainting remains challenging as computing the exact posterior distribution under constraints is intractable for diffusion models. Existing methods use approximations for the constrained posterior, but this introduces high bias and diminishes the benefit of using expressive diffusion models. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes to use Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) like Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) that can efficiently compute arbitrary marginal probabilities to guide the sampling process of diffusion models. A PC trained on unconditional image data can compute the exact posterior distribution under constraints like inpainting. This signal is then used to steer the denoising process of the diffusion model to generate high-quality and coherent inpainted images.

The key insight is that the PC provides images reflecting the constraint while the diffusion model generates high-fidelity details. Combining both signals leads to semantically consistent and realistic images. This framework works for any constraint that can be written as factored "soft evidence" functions.

For high-res images, a PC is trained on the latent space of a VQ-GAN autoencoder. The PC guidance in latent space is projected back to the pixel space for steering the diffusion model.

Main Contributions:

- A new scheme for controlled image generation using TPMs to guide diffusion models

- Achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance on image inpainting across CelebA-HQ, ImageNet and LSUN datasets

- Introduces only 10% additional overhead compared to only using the diffusion model 

- Demonstrates potential for more complex constrained generation tasks like "semantic fusion"

- Highlights benefit of using more tractable models in modern deep generative models

In summary, this paper shows that leveraging the tractability and flexibility of PCs to constrain complex diffusion models leads to an effective framework for controlled high-quality image generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using tractable probabilistic models to steer diffusion models toward generating high-quality and semantically coherent inpainted images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes three main contributions:

1. It proposes a new scheme for controlled image generation using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) to guide diffusion models. Specifically, it shows that probabilistic circuits (PCs), a class of expressive TPMs, can efficiently compute the posterior distribution under image inpainting constraints and use this signal to steer the denoising process of diffusion models. This demonstrates the potential of using TPMs for controlling high-resolution and photorealistic image generation.

2. It achieves competitive sample quality and runtime on high-resolution image datasets. Experiments on CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, and LSUN show that the proposed method (Tiramisu) consistently improves inpainting quality over state-of-the-art diffusion models, while introducing only ~10% additional computational overhead.

3. It highlights the potential application to more complex controlled generation tasks. Beyond image inpainting, Tiramisu can handle arbitrary independent soft-evidence constraints. As an example, the paper demonstrates semantic fusion of image patches from multiple reference images into a single coherent image. This shows the promise for applying this framework to other challenging controlled generation problems.

In summary, the key contribution is using TPMs, specifically probabilistic circuits, to guide diffusion models for controlled high-resolution image generation. The experiments demonstrate improved sample quality at low computational overhead, and potential for extension to more complex constraints.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Diffusion models: The current state-of-the-art technique for generating high-quality, photorealistic images. The paper aims to improve diffusion models for constrained image generation tasks.

- Image inpainting: A key constrained image generation task, where the goal is to fill in missing or corrupted parts of an image. The paper focuses on using tractable probabilistic models to steer diffusion models for better image inpainting. 

- Tractable probabilistic models (TPMs): A class of probabilistic models that support efficient exact inference, even for queries involving conditioning or constraints. Specifically, the paper uses probabilistic circuits, an expressive type of TPM.

- Probabilistic circuits: The specific TPM used to provide efficient computation of constrained posteriors to help guide/steer the diffusion model sampling process towards meeting the image constraints.

- Independent soft-evidence constraints: The type of constraints that probabilistic circuits can handle efficiently. The inpainting constraints are formulated this way.

- Latent-space modeling: Since probabilistic circuits still struggle to model complex full-resolution images, the paper uses vector quantized autoencoders to map images to lower-dimensional latent representations that the circuits can model more effectively.

So in summary, key terms revolve around using tractable probabilistic circuits over latent representations to steer diffusion models for tasks like constrained image generation and inpainting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the proposed method leverage Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) to effectively steer the denoising process of diffusion models? What specific computations do the PCs enable?

2) The paper mentions that the proposed method can handle arbitrary constraints that can be written as independent soft evidence. What is the significance of this in terms of extending the method to more complex controlled image generation tasks?

3) What modifications or additions were made to scale up Probabilistic Circuits to achieve competitive likelihoods on the latent image spaces used in this work? How do these contributions compare to prior art?

4) What is the intuition behind using the weighted geometric mean of the distributions from the diffusion model and the PC? How does this allow leveraging the strengths of both models? 

5) How does the use of a variational autoencoder to transform images to a lower-dimensional latent space balance retaining semantic information and fine-grained details? What is the tradeoff?

6) What hypotheses does the paper make regarding the benefits of using more tractable models? How does the empirical analysis support or refute these hypotheses?

7) What conclusions can be drawn from the comparison of results on different datasets and mask types? When does the proposed method demonstrate larger gains?

8) Could the proposed framework be extended to other conditional generation tasks such as text-to-image generation? What challenges would need to be addressed?

9) How does the computational overhead introduced by the PC scale with respect to image size and other parameters? Could optimizations be made to improve efficiency?

10) The method trains the PC only on noise-free samples. How would additionally training on noisy samples impact the guidance and overall performance? What are the tradeoffs?
