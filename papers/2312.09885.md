# [Simple Weak Coresets for Non-Decomposable Classification Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09885)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Non-decomposable classification measures like F1 score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) are useful for handling class imbalance and capturing precision-recall tradeoffs. However, optimizing them is challenging as they are non-differentiable and do not decompose over data points. 

- For decomposable losses, coresets (small weighted subsets) have helped scale optimization by allowing optimization over just the coreset. But coreset constructions rely on decomposability. No coreset methods exist for non-decomposable classification measures.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper studies coresets for F1 score and MCC. It first shows lower bounds - no strong coresets possible smaller than the whole dataset. 

- It then shows stratified uniform sampling gives a weak coreset for F1 score for queries with high F1 score. It preserves F1 score up to small multiplicative error for those queries.

- For MCC, it shows stratified uniform sampling gives a weak coreset with additive error guarantees for queries predicting sufficiently many positives and negatives.

Main Contributions:
- First coreset analysis for non-decomposable classification measures
- Lower bounds against strong coresets
- Weak coreset for F1 score using uniform sampling
- Weak coreset with additive error for MCC using uniform sampling
- Experiments on multiple datasets validating uniform sampling does as well or better than other sophisticated coreset techniques

The key insight is that despite lack of decomposability, uniform sampling works provably well and also empirically for these non-decomposable measures.
