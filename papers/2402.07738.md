## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper aims to develop a universal link predictor (UniLP) model that can be readily applied to predict missing or future links on any new, unseen graph without requiring model training or finetuning. Traditional heuristic methods like Common Neighbors and Resource Allocation offer broad applicability but rely on predefined rules crafted by human experts. In contrast, graph neural networks can automatically learn connectivity patterns from data but require extensive training and hyperparameter tuning when applied to new graphs. The key challenge is that connectivity patterns which determine link formation likelihoods can differ significantly across graphs, leading to negative transfer when knowledge is directly transferred.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes employing in-context learning (ICL) to allow the UniLP model to dynamically adapt to varying graph datasets. Specifically, during inference on a new graph, a set of "in-context" links sampled from that graph are provided as contextual examples to condition the model. An attention mechanism is used to score in-context links based on their similarity to the query link and compute an aggregated representation. By learning to adjust representations based on graph context, UniLP can capture unique connectivity patterns. UniLP is pretrained on a diverse collection of graphs to learn generalizable link prediction capabilities.

Contributions:
- Empirically and theoretically highlights the presence of conflicting connectivity patterns across graphs that hinder direct transfer of link predictors
- Pioneers the concept of in-context learning for graph representation models to facilitate dynamic adaptation to new graphs without training  
- Proposes concrete instantiation in UniLP model using attention over graph context
- Extensive experiments demonstrate UniLP's ability to match or exceed performance of models finetuned on target graphs

The proposed UniLP framework sets a new standard for versatile and adaptive link prediction without requiring per-graph training or tuning. The concept of graph in-context learning also opens up new research directions.
