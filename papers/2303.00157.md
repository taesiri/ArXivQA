# [Semi-supervised Parametric Real-world Image Harmonization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00157)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the generalization of image harmonization methods to real-world composites. 

The key points are:

- Existing image harmonization methods are typically trained on synthetic data, where global color transforms are applied to the foreground object. This fails to model many appearance mismatches in real composites.

- To address this, the authors propose a new semi-supervised dual-stream training strategy. It alternates between 1) supervised training on artist-retouched image pairs, and 2) unsupervised adversarial training on real composites. 

- They also introduce a parametric harmonization model that predicts global RGB curves and a local shading map. This enables efficient application to high-res images and provides intuitive controls.

- Experiments show their method outperforms previous techniques on established benchmarks and real composites. A user study also demonstrates superior real-world performance.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a new training strategy and parametric model to improve generalization of image harmonization to complex real-world cases, through the use of artist-retouched and real composite training data.
