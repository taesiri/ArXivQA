# [Semi-supervised Parametric Real-world Image Harmonization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00157)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the generalization of image harmonization methods to real-world composites. 

The key points are:

- Existing image harmonization methods are typically trained on synthetic data, where global color transforms are applied to the foreground object. This fails to model many appearance mismatches in real composites.

- To address this, the authors propose a new semi-supervised dual-stream training strategy. It alternates between 1) supervised training on artist-retouched image pairs, and 2) unsupervised adversarial training on real composites. 

- They also introduce a parametric harmonization model that predicts global RGB curves and a local shading map. This enables efficient application to high-res images and provides intuitive controls.

- Experiments show their method outperforms previous techniques on established benchmarks and real composites. A user study also demonstrates superior real-world performance.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a new training strategy and parametric model to improve generalization of image harmonization to complex real-world cases, through the use of artist-retouched and real composite training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A novel dual-stream semi-supervised training strategy that enables training on real composites for the first time. This allows the model to learn more complex local appearance harmonization effects beyond just global color changes.

2. A parametric harmonization model that uses global RGB curves and a local shading map. This allows the model to make both global color adjustments as well as local tonal adjustments.

3. State-of-the-art results on established benchmarks like iHarmony as well as real composites, demonstrated quantitatively and via a user study. The model outperforms previous methods, especially on real-world data.

4. The parametric model allows high-resolution inference and provides intuitive controls to artists.

In summary, the key innovation is the semi-supervised training on real composites, which previous methods lacked. This, together with the parametric network design, allows the model to learn complex local edits like shading adjustments and better generalize to real-world use cases. The quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.
