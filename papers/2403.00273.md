# [ARED: Argentina Real Estate Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00273)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The Argentinian real estate market has experienced economic instability and crises over recent decades. Prices are typically quoted in USD rather than the local currency due to high inflation.
- There is a lack of multi-modal datasets focused specifically on analyzing and predicting real estate prices in Argentina over time.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors introduce the first edition of the Argentina Real Estate Dataset (ARED), focused on the Argentinian property market.

Dataset Details:
- Captures real estate listings from mid-January 2024 over a 44 day period.
- Each listing includes variable-length image sets, latitude/longitude, text descriptions, as well as over 20 numerical and categorical features like price, property type, number of rooms/bathrooms etc.

Observations:
- Despite the short time range, the market moves in a cohesive whole - relative prices between property types have remained stable over the downturn. 
- This indicates the snapshot dataset can still provide useful insights into value determinants.

Main Contributions:
- Release of first specialist image+text dataset for the Argentinian property market with rich metadata.
- Analysis showing cohesive market-wide pricing behavior, indicating usefulness of dataset despite short time range.
- Commitment to release updated datasets quarterly, with plans to expand historical data coverage.

The paper introduces a valuable new resource to support analysis of the unstable Argentinian real estate market over time. The initial dataset analysis also reveals interesting pricing dynamics.
