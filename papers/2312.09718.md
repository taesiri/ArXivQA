# [Discovering Highly Influential Shortcut Reasoning: An Automated   Template-Free Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09718)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Shortcut reasoning refers to the irrational inference process of AI models derived from spurious correlations in training data. It makes models brittle on out-of-distribution (OOD) data.  
- Prior work on detecting shortcut reasoning has limitations: (i) lacks quantifying severity on model robustness (ii) assumes genuine tokens useful for prediction cannot cause shortcut reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose automated template-free method to identify shortcut reasoning and quantify its severity. 
- Uses input reduction algorithm to extract concise abstract patterns that characterize model's inference process, called inference patterns.
- Quantifies severity of shortcut reasoning by:
   - Calculating generality of patterns on OOD data 
   - Comparing model performance on OOD vs IID data with pattern
- Shortcut reasoning is identified as patterns with:
   - High generality 
   - Good IID performance
   - Poor OOD performance

Main Contributions:
- Automated identification of shortcut reasoning without assumptions on type of tokens
- Quantification of severity of identified shortcut reasoning using OOD data
- Demonstrated success in discovering known and previously unknown shortcut reasoning in NLI and Sentiment Analysis models

The key advantage is the method does not require predefined templates or human evaluation to identify harmful shortcut reasoning. By leveraging OOD data, it automatically discovers patterns that make models brittle, and quantifies their severity. Overall, it provides an effective approach to understand model behaviors and improve robustness.
