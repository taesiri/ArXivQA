# [MirrorAttack: Backdoor Attack on 3D Point Cloud with a Distorting Mirror](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05847)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to deep neural networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud processing. Existing attacks either struggle to resist basic defenses like statistical outlier removal, or rely on delicate manual design of triggers. There is still a lack of simple yet effective, imperceptible, and difficult-to-defend backdoor triggers for 3D point clouds.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes MirrorAttack, a novel backdoor attack method that automatically generates sample-specific and imperceptible triggers through a customized autoencoder-based reconstruction network. The trigger emerges from the inherent bias of the reconstruction network and manifests as subtle perturbations when the clean point cloud is reconstructed. 

A trigger smoothing module is also introduced to enable precise control over the attack intensity. It establishes a smooth transition between the clean and attacked point clouds in the spherical harmonic domain.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes MirrorAttack that automatically crafts effective and stealthy backdoor triggers using a data-driven reconstruction network, avoiding complex manual design.

- Develops a trigger smoothing technique based on spherical harmonic transformation to modulate the attack intensity and imperceptibility.  

- Achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates across diverse victim models like PointNet++, DGCNN, PointCNN etc. while maintaining high stealth.

- Demonstrates strong resilience against various data augmentation and defense methods compared to prior arts.

In summary, MirrorAttack sets a new benchmark for 3D point cloud backdoor attacks with its simplicity, efficacy and resilience while ensuring negligible impact on clean samples. The data-driven trigger generation paradigm could inspire more advanced attacks.
