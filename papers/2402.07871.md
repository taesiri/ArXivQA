# [Scaling Laws for Fine-Grained Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07871)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, requiring millions of GPU hours. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a way to reduce this cost, but some recent work has questioned whether MoE models remain efficient at very large scale. 

- Prior work studied MoE scaling while keeping training duration and expert size constant. This may underestimate MoE efficiency since longer training and adjusting expert size could further improve performance.

Methods & Contributions:

1) Introduce "granularity" hyperparameter G to control expert size in MoE models, with higher G meaning smaller experts. Show both theoretically and empirically that higher G improves efficiency.

2) Derive new scaling laws for fine-grained MoE incorporating variable training duration, number of parameters, and granularity G. Allows calculating optimal settings for a given compute budget.

3) Demonstrate with optimal hyperparameters, MoE models always outperform traditional Transformers in terms of efficiency, with compute savings exceeding 40x at scale. Contradicts prior claims that MoE efficiency drops at large scale.

4) Find that setting expert size equal to feedforward size (standard practice) is almost never optimal. Recommend using higher granularity G for better efficiency.

5) Provide practical guidance for configuring optimally efficient MoE architectures for a given model size and computational budget.

Implications:
- With proper configuration, MoE models consistently surpass dense Transformers in efficiency across all model sizes considered. Fine-grained MoE is an effective strategy for training giant yet efficient language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper derives new scaling laws for Mixture-of-Experts Transformer models incorporating granularity, a novel hyperparameter controlling expert size, and shows that with optimal configuration, MoE consistently outperforms dense Transformers across model sizes and compute budgets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing a new hyperparameter - granularity (G) - that allows precise control over the size of experts in MoE models. Adjusting granularity translates into increased efficiency of MoE models.

2. Deriving new scaling laws for MoE models that incorporate variable training duration, number of parameters, and granularity. These laws allow calculating optimal training hyperparameters for MoE models given a compute budget. 

3. Demonstrating that with optimal hyperparameters, MoE models can consistently outperform traditional Transformers at any compute budget. This challenges previous claims that MoE models lose their efficiency advantage at very large scale.

The key insight is that by optimizing granularity and training duration, MoE models can achieve superior efficiency over dense Transformers regardless of model size or compute budget. The paper provides both theoretical analysis through scaling laws and empirical validation of these conclusions.

The paper introduces the concept of "granularity" as a way to precisely control the size of experts in MoE models. It derives new scaling laws that incorporate granularity and uses these to calculate optimal settings like number of parameters, training tokens, and granularity for a given compute budget. The key claims are that adjusting granularity allows MoE models to consistently outperform dense Transformers, and that setting expert size to match feedforward dimensions is rarely optimal. The results aim to provide guidance on efficiently training large language models using MoE.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I have formulated about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "granularity" to control the size of experts in MoE models. How does adjusting granularity enable optimizing the efficiency and performance of MoE models? What are the key trade-offs?

2. The paper derives new scaling laws that relate model perplexity to number of parameters, training tokens and granularity. What is the mathematical form of these scaling laws and how do they extend prior work? What new insights do they provide?

3. What are the limitations of previously proposed scaling laws for MoE models? How does considering variable training duration and granularity overcome these limitations? What assumptions need to be made?

4. What is the impact of granularity on routing cost and computational efficiency of MoE models? How is this modeled in the scaling laws and compute optimal configurations derived in the paper?

5. The paper argues MoE models are always more efficient than transformers given optimal configurations. What drives this result and why does it contradict prior work? What key factors need to be considered?  

6. What do the scaling laws tell us about how MoE models and dense transformers differ in their scaling properties and sensitivity to undertraining? What are the implications?

7. The standard practice has been to set expert size equal to feedforward dimension in Transformers. What does this paper demonstrate about the (sub)optimality of this configuration under different budgets?

8. What are some potential downsides or limitations of using very high granularity values? When might performance degrade? How could expert initialization or routing modifications help address such scenarios?

9. How reliable and stable are the compute optimal configurations predicted by the scaling laws derived in this paper? What validation analyses were performed to assess uncertainty levels?

10. How could the analysis be extended to optimize over expansion rate simultaneously? What additional tradeoffs would need to be modeled and why is this hard to do based solely on FLOPs?
