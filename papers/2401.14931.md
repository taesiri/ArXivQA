# [Do LLMs Dream of Ontologies?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14931)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates whether and to what extent general-purpose pre-trained large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Pythia have memorized information from known ontologies. Specifically, it looks at whether these models have learned to associate ontology concept IDs (e.g. GO:0001822) with their corresponding natural language labels (e.g. "kidney development"). 

Approach:
The authors evaluate the models' ability to predict ontology concept IDs from labels in a zero-shot setting, without any fine-tuning on domain data. The ontologies used are Gene Ontology (GO) and Uberon ontology. The accuracy of ID prediction is measured across concepts in these ontologies. 

The paper then correlates concept memorization accuracy with the concept's prevalence on the web to test if concepts more frequently seen during pre-training are better memorized. It also analyzes common error patterns.

Additionally, the authors propose "prediction invariance" metrics to quantify memorization by measuring consistency of predictions across different prompt repetitions, languages, and temperature settings.

Key Findings:
- Accuracy of ID prediction from labels is low overall but better for GPT-4 (12.7% on GO) than GPT-3.5 and Pythia.
- Accuracy strongly correlates with a concept's prevalence on the web, suggesting concepts are memorized from the pre-training data rather than the ontology itself.  
- Prediction mistakes tend to be more syntactically similar to correct ones for popular web concepts.
- Consistency of predictions to perturbations correlates with popularity, providing a metric for memorization.

In summary, the paper shows LLMs have partially memorized ontology concepts from their web-scale pre-training data, with memorization proportional to concept prevalence. The prediction invariance metrics are proposed to quantify memorization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates whether large language models have memorized basic concept-identifier associations from ontologies, finding partial memorization correlated with concept popularity on the web and proposing metrics to quantify memorization degree based on output consistency across prompt perturbations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Investigating whether and to what extent general-purpose pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have memorized information from known ontologies, specifically the association between concept identifiers and their corresponding natural language labels.

2) Showing experimentally that LLMs partially know ontologies - they can memorize concepts mentioned in the text but the level of memorization seems to vary with the popularity of concepts on the Web. More popular concepts are better memorized.

3) Proposing new metrics to estimate the degree of memorization of ontological information in LLMs by measuring the consistency of the output produced across different prompt repetitions, query languages, and degrees of determinism. 

In summary, the paper studies the memorization of basic ontological information in LLMs and correlates it to concept popularity. It also proposes methods to quantify the degree of memorization.

The paper investigates whether general-purpose pre-trained LLMs have memorized information from known ontologies, specifically the association between concept identifiers and their corresponding natural language labels. It introduces metrics to estimate the degree of memorization in LLMs and examines the relationship between memorization and concept popularity on the Web. The analysis also looks at common error patterns through measures like Jaccard similarity and Levenshtein distance. Overall, the key focus areas are LLMs, memorization, ontologies, prompt engineering, and quantitative evaluation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using prediction invariance metrics to assess the degree of memorization of ontological information in large language models (LLMs). Could you explain in more detail how these metrics work and what strategies were tested (e.g. prompt repetition, temperature variation, language variation)? 

2. One of the prediction invariance strategies was repeating the prompt multiple times while varying the temperature. What is temperature in LLMs and how does it allow generating more creative vs more deterministic responses? How was varying it useful to assess memorization?

3. The results show that invariance to temperature and language changes correlates with popularity of concepts on the web/training data. Could you expand on why this correlation makes sense? Does it relate to models memorizing more popular concepts better?

4. When proposing the prediction tasks, the authors explicitly chose ontologies where concepts had IDs unrelated to the labels. What was the motivation behind this? How did it allow better assessment of memorization?  

5. The error analysis reveals common patterns in wrong predictions, like predicting IDs of concepts with similar labels. What mechanisms in LLM training could lead to such syntactic similarities in errors? 

6. What implications do the results showing partial memorization of ontology concepts have for LLM performance on ontology-related tasks like mapping and alignment? How could the uneven memorization impact such applications?

7. The analysis focuses on assessing memorization of terminology (concept-label associations). Do you think the approach could be extended to validate how well models have memorized more complex ontology information like hierarchies and relations?

8. The study chose two specific, domain ontologies for the analysis. What are some challenges in adapting the methodology to analyze memorization from general-purpose, cross-domain ontologies? Would any modifications be needed?

9. The proposed prediction invariance metrics evaluate memorization based on consistency of model responses. What are some other ways consistency measures could be used to probe for stored knowledge in large language models? 

10. How can building LLM training datasets with better coverage of domain ontologies like Uberon help with the goal of an LLM that has more complete, consistent memorization of ontological information?
