# [3D Neural Field Generation using Triplane Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16677)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we leverage powerful 2D diffusion models for high-quality 3D shape generation?

The key ideas and contributions to address this question appear to be:

- Proposing a framework to represent 3D shapes as 2D triplane features that can serve as targets for training a 2D diffusion model.

- Developing a regularization strategy to learn smooth and well-behaved triplane features from 3D training data.

- Demonstrating that an off-the-shelf 2D diffusion model trained on the proposed triplane features can generate high-fidelity and diverse 3D shapes, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main hypothesis seems to be that by properly representing 3D shapes as 2D triplane features compatible with diffusion models, existing 2D diffusion techniques can be effectively adapted for high-quality 3D shape generation. The paper introduces techniques to enable this approach and shows results surpassing other methods.
