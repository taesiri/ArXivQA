# [3D Neural Field Generation using Triplane Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16677)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we leverage powerful 2D diffusion models for high-quality 3D shape generation?

The key ideas and contributions to address this question appear to be:

- Proposing a framework to represent 3D shapes as 2D triplane features that can serve as targets for training a 2D diffusion model.

- Developing a regularization strategy to learn smooth and well-behaved triplane features from 3D training data.

- Demonstrating that an off-the-shelf 2D diffusion model trained on the proposed triplane features can generate high-fidelity and diverse 3D shapes, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main hypothesis seems to be that by properly representing 3D shapes as 2D triplane features compatible with diffusion models, existing 2D diffusion techniques can be effectively adapted for high-quality 3D shape generation. The paper introduces techniques to enable this approach and shows results surpassing other methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It introduces a generative framework for 3D diffusion models that leverages 2D diffusion model backbones and has a built-in 3D inductive bias. 

- It proposes to represent 3D shapes as triplanes (2D representations) which are used as training data for a 2D diffusion model. The paper describes modifications to existing triplane factorization methods to make them suitable for learning by diffusion models.

- It demonstrates state-of-the-art results on generating high-quality and diverse 3D shapes on ShapeNet datasets, outperforming alternative 3D generative models including GANs.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage powerful 2D diffusion models for 3D shape generation by representing 3D shapes as triplanes. The paper shows this is an effective approach and outperforms other 3D generative models. The main contribution is developing a 3D-aware diffusion framework that can utilize advances in 2D image diffusion models.
