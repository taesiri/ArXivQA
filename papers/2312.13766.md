# [Exploiting Contextual Target Attributes for Target Sentiment   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13766)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- In target sentiment classification (TSC), existing models can be divided into two groups: fine-tuning-based models that adopt pre-trained language models (PTLMs) as the context encoder, and prompting-based models that transfer the task to text generation. However, fine-tuning-based models cannot sufficiently leverage the language modeling ability of PTLMs, while prompting-based models have difficulty in explicitly modeling target-context interactions.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes exploiting PTLMs' ability for both masked language modeling and modeling explicit interactions, via generating "contextual target attributes".
- It designs a "domain- and target-constrained cloze test" to leverage PTLMs to generate words that convey target attributes and background information. 
- A "heterogeneous information graph" (HIG) is constructed to integrate (1) target attribute nodes, (2) syntax graph, (3) semantic graph of context.
- A "heterogeneous information gated graph convolutional network" (HIG2CN) is proposed to capture interactions between attribute information, syntax, semantics on the HIG.

Main Contributions:
- Novel perspective to simultaneously leverage merits of both masked language modeling and explicit modeling of target-context interactions for TSC.  
- Proposal of domain- and target-constrained cloze test to obtain contextual target attributes from PTLMs.
- Construction of HIG to integrate heterogeneous information sources - target attributes, syntax, semantics.
- Design of HIG2CN to model interactions between different information sources on HIG to benefit TSC.
- Superior experimental results, outperforming state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets.

In summary, the key novelty is exploiting PTLMs to generate contextual target attributes, and using graph networks to integrate this with syntax and semantics for better target sentiment classification. The proposed techniques achieve new state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks.
