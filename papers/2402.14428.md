# [KoCoSa: Korean Context-aware Sarcasm Detection Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14428)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Sarcasm detection is challenging and relies heavily on context, yet most existing datasets for sarcasm detection lack sufficient contextual information.
- Existing sarcasm detection datasets are predominantly English-based and derived from online communities like Twitter and Reddit, which diverge from daily dialogues. 
- There is a need for a monolingual Korean sarcasm detection dataset derived from daily dialogues and enriched with context.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a comprehensive pipeline to construct a new Korean context-aware sarcasm detection dataset (KoCoSa) using large language models (LLMs) and human revision.  
- The pipeline involves: (1) Extracting situations from source dialogues using GPT-3.5 (2) Generating new sarcastic dialogues from situations using GPT-4  (3) Automatic filtering of offensive/abnormal content (4) Human annotation of dialogues.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of KoCoSa - a new large-scale (12.8k dialogues) Korean context-aware sarcasm detection dataset constructed through the proposed efficient pipeline. 
- KoCoSa incorporates rich context, explanations for sarcasm, and draws its source from daily online messenger dialogues.
- Analysis of the dataset and sarcasm detection task, including benchmarking the performance of baseline systems like GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and KLUE-RoBERTa models.
- Demonstration of the significance of contextual information for sarcasm detection through experiments.

The paper makes valuable contributions by releasing a pioneering Korean sarcasm detection dataset, proposing an effective pipeline for generating such datasets, and analyzing context-aware sarcasm detection.
