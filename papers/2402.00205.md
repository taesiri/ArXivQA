# [Decentralised, Collaborative, and Privacy-preserving Machine Learning   for Multi-Hospital Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00205)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: Sharing healthcare data across different institutions can improve machine learning models but faces challenges due to privacy concerns and regulations. The paper identifies three key requirements - no direct sharing of private datasets, theoretical guarantees to bound privacy leakage when sharing derived information, and no reliance on a centralized server.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes DeCaPH, a decentralized, collaborative, and privacy-preserving machine learning framework for multi-hospital data. Key aspects:

- Decentralized: No central server, participants take turns acting as leader to facilitate training. Provides flexibility, avoids single point of failure.

- Collaborative: Enables participants to jointly train a model on aggregate data without sharing private datasets. Uses secure aggregation to merge model updates.

- Privacy-Preserving: Provides differential privacy guarantees by subsampleing data, clipping gradients per example, and adding noise before sharing updates. Limits potential privacy leakage.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes DeCaPH, a decentralized framework for collaborative, privacy-preserving machine learning among hospitals

- Evaluates DeCaPH on three distinct healthcare tasks: predicting mortality from EHR data, classifying cell types from gene expressions, identifying pathologies from chest x-rays

- Models trained with DeCaPH perform nearly as well as non-private federated learning, outperform models trained on single hospital's data alone

- Empirically demonstrates improved robustness to membership inference attacks compared to non-private federated learning

- Provides a flexible solution to enable hospitals to collaboratively train machine learning models while provably protecting patient privacy

In summary, the paper addresses key challenges around privacy and decentralization to enable collaborative machine learning on distributed hospital data through the proposed DeCaPH framework.
