# [Deep Annotation of Therapeutic Working Alliance in Psychotherapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05522)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The therapeutic working alliance between a therapist and patient is an important predictor of psychotherapy treatment outcomes. However, current methods of quantifying this alliance rely on time-consuming questionnaires and do not utilize the nuances of natural language in therapy dialogues.  

- There is a need for computational methods that can quantify the degree of patient-therapist alliance directly from psychotherapy session transcripts in a granular, turn-by-turn manner. This could provide timely feedback to therapists on the quality of conversations.

Proposed Solution: 
- Develop an analytical framework to infer the strength of the therapeutic working alliance directly from the natural language in psychotherapy sessions using deep embedding models like Doc2Vec and SentenceBERT.

- Compare the distributed vector representations of patient and therapist dialogue turns to vector representations of statements from established working alliance questionnaires like the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI). 

- This enables scoring each dialogue turn on dimensions of therapeutic alliance like task, bond and goal scales from the WAI in an unsupervised manner.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate this computational linguistics approach effectively maps therapeutic alliance trajectories over 950+ anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and suicidal patient psychotherapy sessions.  

- Identify insightful patterns related to patient-therapist alignment, with significant misalignment detected for suicidal patients. 

- Show convergence of bond/task scales over time for anxiety/depression, unlike schizophrenia/suicidality.

- Propose potential applications like an AI assistant to provide therapists timely feedback on session quality and opportunities to sharpen expertise by analyzing alliance patterns.
