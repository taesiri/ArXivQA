# [Low-light Image Enhancement via CLIP-Fourier Guided Wavelet Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03788)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Low-light Image Enhancement via CLIP-Fourier Guided Wavelet Diffusion":

Problem:
- Low-light image enhancement is an ill-posed problem and remains challenging. Existing methods suffer from unstable image quality, unsatisfactory visual perception, color distortion, noise amplification and artifacts. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel low-light image enhancement method called CFWD (CLIP-Fourier Guided Wavelet Diffusion) that utilizes the generative capabilities of diffusion models, the semantic features of CLIP models and the perception abilities of Fourier transform.

- It designs a wavelet diffusion framework to decompose images and perform diffusion inference on the global information. 

- A multiscale visual language guidance network is introduced to guide the diffusion process using CLIP embeddings and prompt pairs at multiple scales. This prevents generalization of chaotic information during enhancement.

- A hybrid frequency domain perception module (HFDPM) is proposed by combining wavelet and Fourier transforms. This effectively recovers high-frequency details and enhances image structure similarity with normal images.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of multimodal visual-language information into diffusion modeling for robust low-light image enhancement
- A CLIP-Fourier guided wavelet diffusion model with significantly improved visual perception
- A hybrid frequency domain perception module for effective detail and structure recovery
- A multiscale visual language guidance network to constrain the diffusion process at multiple levels

- Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, with better stability, visual quality and generalization ability. The method produces enhanced images closer to normal ones.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel low-light image enhancement method called CLIP-Fourier Guided Wavelet Diffusion (CFWD) which utilizes a wavelet diffusion model supervised by CLIP and Fourier transforms to effectively recover visually pleasing low-light images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It successfully introduces multimodal visual-language information from CLIP into a diffusion model for low-light image enhancement. It proposes a CLIP-Fourier guided Wavelet Diffusion (CFWD) model to recover low-light images with more realistic visual perception.

2. It proposes a novel hybrid frequency domain perception module that fuses wavelet and Fourier transforms to construct a hybrid frequency domain space with strong perceptual capabilities. This allows effective recovery of high-frequency detail information in images. 

3. It designs a multiscale visual-language guidance network to progressively guide the enhancement through multiple frequency domain representations obtained via wavelets. This provides multilevel constraints on the enhancement process to prevent generalization of chaotic information and improve results.

4. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with both improved quantitative metrics and better visual quality closer to normal images compared to previous methods. The approach also shows good generalization ability.

In summary, the key innovation is in introducing guidance from both natural language and frequency domain perceptions to stabilize and enhance the wavelet diffusion process for low-light image enhancement.
