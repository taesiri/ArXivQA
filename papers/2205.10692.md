# [All You Need Is Logs: Improving Code Completion by Learning from   Anonymous IDE Usage Logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10692)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question this paper addresses is: How can anonymous IDE usage logs be leveraged to improve code completion via machine learning, while adhering to privacy requirements?Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates an approach for:- Collecting anonymous usage logs from IDE users related to code completion sessions.- Using these logs to train a machine learning model to rank code completion suggestions. - Continuously improving the model by gathering new data and evaluating new models in live A/B tests.The key goals are to improve code completion quality while meeting constraints around user privacy, model performance, and integration into a real-world IDE. The paper presents the approach, offline and online evaluation results, and insights into deploying such a system in practice.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. An approach for enhancing code completion in IDEs by training machine learning models on anonymous usage logs. The key aspects of the approach are:- Formulating code completion as a ranking problem.- Using a feature-based CatBoost model trained on real but anonymized user behavior logs collected without violating privacy. - Being language-agnostic and meeting requirements like small model size and low inference latency.- Allowing continuous improvement via cycles of data collection and model evaluation.2. Evaluation of the approach in two settings:- Offline on held-out user data, showing improved ranking performance over heuristics. - Online A/B testing in the IDE, showing reductions in user typing actions.3. Insights into deploying such an approach in a real-world industrial IDE, including dealing with constraints like privacy regulations and resource limitations.In summary, the main contribution is an end-to-end pipeline for improving code completion via machine learning on anonymous usage logs, along with evaluations showing its benefits and discussion of its real-world deployment.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes an approach for improving code completion in IDEs by collecting anonymous usage logs from users, extracting features from them, and training a machine learning model to rank code completion suggestions. The key ideas are collecting data anonymously, training lightweight tree-based models, and evaluating them via A/B testing in the IDE's Early Access Program.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on using machine learning to improve code completion in integrated development environments (IDEs):- It focuses on using real-world anonymous usage logs from IDE users to train the model, rather than synthetic data. As the paper discusses, previous work has shown that models trained on synthetic data do not perform as well on real user data. Using real logs allows the model to better reflect actual developer behavior.- The paper proposes an approach to collecting anonymous usage logs that protects user privacy by only extracting features on the client side rather than collecting code or other sensitive information. Many previous works do not discuss privacy protections in detail.- The research implements the approach in a widely-used commercial IDE (IntelliJ) and evaluates it through both offline analysis and online A/B testing with real users. Much prior work evaluates on offline benchmarks or small user studies rather than at scale in a production environment.- The paper emphasizes the importance of model inference speed and size for practical integration into an IDE, in addition to accuracy. Some other works focus solely on maximizing accuracy.- The approach supports continuous retraining and A/B testing of new models on anonymized logs. This allows models to improve over time as more usage data is collected. Other works typically propose a one-time model.Overall, this paper makes contributions around real-world data, privacy protection, large-scale evaluation, and continuous improvement that differentiate it from much of the related work in improving code completion via machine learning. The practical production setting provides useful insights compared to purely academic research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Continue experiments with code completion models and develop new features to further improve performance. Specifically, they mention improving code completion for API calls by using information about similar API usage contexts from other projects.- Broaden the scope beyond just code completion and apply similar machine learning models to other aspects of software development in IDEs, such as suggesting refactorings, fixing bugs, etc.- Collect structured usage logs and employ them for improving various parts of the IDE. The authors suggest the pipeline they proposed could be useful for tasks beyond just code completion.- Conduct more research relating to structured usage log collection and analysis. The authors hope to see more work in this area, especially research that evaluates approaches in real-world environments with constraints like model speed and size.- Apply the proposed pipeline to other programming languages beyond just Python. The approach is intended to be language-agnostic so it could be extended.- Investigate different strategies for selecting positive and negative examples during log analysis. The paper discusses some limitations of their current approach.- Look into improving code completion for infrequent tokens that currently get poor recommendations. The paper indicates this is an area for improvement.- Incorporate information from corpus of open source code to improve API recommendations. The paper suggests this could help with cases where local context is insufficient.So in summary, the main directions are: applying the pipeline to new tasks and languages, collecting more usage logs, developing better models, and addressing limitations like improving rare token completion.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes an approach for improving code completion in integrated development environments (IDEs) by training machine learning models on anonymized usage logs. The key ideas are: 1) Designing a set of features calculated locally on the user's machine that describe the completion context and candidates without revealing personal information or code. 2) Collecting these anonymized features from logs of IDE users who agree to provide data. 3) Training machine learning models such as CatBoost on this data to rank completion candidates. 4) Evaluating the models both offline on held-out data and online via A/B testing in the IDE's Early Access Program. The results demonstrate increased relevance of suggestions and fewer typing actions required by users. The pipeline allows continuous improvement by gathering more data and evaluating new models. Overall, the paper shows how anonymized structured logs can be leveraged to enhance IDE tools like code completion while respecting user privacy.
