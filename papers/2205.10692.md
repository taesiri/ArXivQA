# [All You Need Is Logs: Improving Code Completion by Learning from   Anonymous IDE Usage Logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10692)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question this paper addresses is: How can anonymous IDE usage logs be leveraged to improve code completion via machine learning, while adhering to privacy requirements?Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates an approach for:- Collecting anonymous usage logs from IDE users related to code completion sessions.- Using these logs to train a machine learning model to rank code completion suggestions. - Continuously improving the model by gathering new data and evaluating new models in live A/B tests.The key goals are to improve code completion quality while meeting constraints around user privacy, model performance, and integration into a real-world IDE. The paper presents the approach, offline and online evaluation results, and insights into deploying such a system in practice.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. An approach for enhancing code completion in IDEs by training machine learning models on anonymous usage logs. The key aspects of the approach are:- Formulating code completion as a ranking problem.- Using a feature-based CatBoost model trained on real but anonymized user behavior logs collected without violating privacy. - Being language-agnostic and meeting requirements like small model size and low inference latency.- Allowing continuous improvement via cycles of data collection and model evaluation.2. Evaluation of the approach in two settings:- Offline on held-out user data, showing improved ranking performance over heuristics. - Online A/B testing in the IDE, showing reductions in user typing actions.3. Insights into deploying such an approach in a real-world industrial IDE, including dealing with constraints like privacy regulations and resource limitations.In summary, the main contribution is an end-to-end pipeline for improving code completion via machine learning on anonymous usage logs, along with evaluations showing its benefits and discussion of its real-world deployment.
