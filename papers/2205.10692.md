# [All You Need Is Logs: Improving Code Completion by Learning from   Anonymous IDE Usage Logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10692)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question this paper addresses is: How can anonymous IDE usage logs be leveraged to improve code completion via machine learning, while adhering to privacy requirements?Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates an approach for:- Collecting anonymous usage logs from IDE users related to code completion sessions.- Using these logs to train a machine learning model to rank code completion suggestions. - Continuously improving the model by gathering new data and evaluating new models in live A/B tests.The key goals are to improve code completion quality while meeting constraints around user privacy, model performance, and integration into a real-world IDE. The paper presents the approach, offline and online evaluation results, and insights into deploying such a system in practice.
