# [SAMBA: A Trainable Segmentation Web-App with Smart Labelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04197)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

SAMBA is a new web-based trainable segmentation tool that leverages Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) for efficient 'smart labelling' suggestions to users during the training process. It allows for multi-phase segmentation across length scales in materials science images. The smart suggestions from SAM enable quicker training label collection, while the traditional polygon and brush tools allow refinement. Once labels are complete, a random forest model handles the final semantic segmentation mapping image features to labels. Key benefits are the web accessibility without local software requirements, ability to publish segmentations to a community gallery, and potential to accelerate analysis workflows. SAMBA was designed for usability by non-experts. Future work may include uncertainty estimates to highlight areas needing more labels. The open-source code allows local hosting options for sensitive data or leveraging GPUs. Overall SAMBA aims to provide an easy yet powerful platform for generating shareable multi-phase segmentations.
