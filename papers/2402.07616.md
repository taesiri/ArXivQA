# [Anchor-based Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07616)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) require substantial GPU memory, which increases with longer input text lengths. This limits their practical usage in scenarios with constrained computational resources. 

- Caching the keys/values of historical tokens avoids redundant computation but takes up GPU memory during inference. As sequence length grows in tasks like question answering, more memory is needed to cache the increasing number of tokens.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Anchor-based LLMs (AnLLMs) with an anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) and inference strategy to compress sequence information into an "anchor token".

- AnSAN uses specialized attention masks to force models to aggregate information into the last token during training. This token serves as the anchor encapsulating the overall meaning.

- During inference, only anchor token keys/values are cached while non-anchor tokens are discarded after each sub-sequence. This significantly reduces the memory overhead.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate an effective method to reduce GPU memory consumption during LLM inference by over 90% with minimal accuracy loss.

- Achieve up to 3.5x faster inference compared to non-caching approaches by reusing anchor token caches instead of recomputing for all tokens.

- Introduce the novel concepts of anchor tokens and AnSAN for continually pre-training models to automatically learn sequence compression abilities. 

- Show promising results across various question answering datasets and analysis revealing the compatibility of anchor-based attention with full attention.

In summary, the paper makes significant strides in optimizing large language models for efficiency gains without substantially sacrificing performance, enabled by the new idea of anchor tokens. The feasibility of deploying LLMs on resource-limited devices seems closer than before.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary:

The paper proposes anchor-based large language models (AnLLMs) with an anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) technique to compress sequence information into designated anchor tokens, enabling up to 99% reduction in keys/values caches and up to 3.5 times faster inference while maintaining comparable accuracy to the original model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing anchor-based large language models (AnLLMs) equipped with an anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) and an anchor-based inference strategy. Specifically:

1) The AnSAN technique compels the model to compress sequence information into designated "anchor tokens" during training. This is achieved using specially designed anchor-based attention masks.

2) During inference, AnLLMs retain only the keys/values caches of anchor tokens and discard those of non-anchor tokens. This significantly reduces the memory footprint and accelerates the inference process.

3) Experiments on question answering benchmarks demonstrate that AnLLMs can achieve up to 99% reduction in keys/values cache size and up to 3.5x faster inference speed, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to baseline models.

4) Case studies on machine translation tasks further showcase the compatibility, flexibility and optimization capability of AnLLMs for practical applications.

In summary, the core innovation lies in the introduction of anchor tokens and associated techniques to enhance the memory efficiency and computational efficiency of large language models, making their deployment more practical. The paper demonstrates promising results on multiple benchmarks while retaining model accuracy.

The main focus of the paper is introducing a novel approach called "Anchor-based Large Language Models" (AnLLMs) to improve the memory efficiency and inference speed of large language models. A key component is the "Anchor-based self-attention network" (AnSAN) which guides the model to compress sequence information into designated "anchor tokens" during training. By caching only the keys/values of anchor tokens instead of all tokens, AnLLMs can greatly reduce GPU memory requirements and accelerate inference. 

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of AnLLMs using continual pre-training and evaluations on question answering and machine translation tasks. Metrics reported include accuracy, keys/values cache reduction, and inference acceleration ratio. Results show AnLLMs maintain accuracy while achieving substantial gains in memory efficiency and faster inference compared to baseline models.

Overall, the key novelty is using anchor tokens and associated techniques to unlock practical gains in deploying large language models under resource constraints - making them viable for real-world applications.
