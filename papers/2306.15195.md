# [Shikra: Unleashing Multimodal LLM's Referential Dialogue Magic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15195)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to engage in referential dialogue by handling spatial coordinate inputs and outputs in natural language?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By designing a simple and unified multimodal architecture that can process numerical coordinate representations in natural language without needing extra vocabularies or modules, MLLMs can achieve strong performance on referential dialogue tasks while remaining capable on conventional vision-language tasks.

The paper introduces "Shikra", an MLLM aimed at referential dialogue. Shikra is able to comprehend and generate spatial coordinates expressed naturally in language during a dialogue. This allows the model to engage in conversations where users can point to and reference precise regions of an image.

The main goal seems to be advancing MLLMs to close the gap in referential dialogue abilities compared to humans, who can fluidly indicate and discuss specific visual regions. Shikra represents a straightforward architecture that enables this without complex additions to the model.

The paper shows Shikra achieving promising results on referential dialogue and other vision-language tasks. It also analyzes model design choices like numerical vs tokenized coordinate representations. Overall, the central hypothesis appears to be that a simple and unified model can unlock stronger referential dialogue abilities for MLLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Introducing the task of Referential Dialogue (RD) for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), where models can comprehend and output spatial coordinates in natural language. RD is argued to be an essential aspect of human communication that is currently missing in MLLMs.

2. Proposing a new MLLM called Shikra that is designed for RD. Key aspects of Shikra include:

- It uses a simple and unified architecture with a vision encoder, alignment layer, and large language model, without needing extra vocabularies, position encoders, or external plugins. 

- Spatial coordinates are handled through natural language numerals rather than specialized representations.

- It achieves strong performance on conventional vision-language tasks like REC, PointQA, VQA, and image captioning without finetuning.

- It enables new applications like comparing user-provided regions, counting objects and providing positions, etc.

3. Providing analysis experiments that examine representing positions, spatial reasoning, and the capabilities of previous MLLMs for spatial inputs.

4. Releasing code, models, and generated data to facilitate future research into MLLMs for referential dialogue and spatial handling.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the task, model, and analyses to advance multimodal LLMs to comprehend spatial reference in dialogue - an important aspect of human communication previously lacking in MLLMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces Shikra, a multimodal large language model capable of referential dialogue by handling spatial coordinate inputs and outputs in natural language, enabling exciting applications like aiding AI assistants and facilitating precise communication for online shopping.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key comparisons between this paper and other related research:

- This paper focuses on Referential Dialogue (RD) in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which enables pointing to regions of interest and referencing specific spatial locations in images. This ability for precise spatial reference is novel compared to most prior MLLM research. 

- Many recent MLLMs like Flamingo, BLIP, mPlug, Mini-GPT4 have demonstrated strong image-text understanding, but cannot handle spatial coordinate inputs/outputs. This paper introduces Shikra, which can process numerical coordinate representations in natural language without extra vocabularies.

- Referential Dialogue is framed as a general superset task encapsulating many existing vision-language tasks like VQA, image captioning, REC, etc. Shikra achieves strong performance on these tasks by virtue of its RD abilities.

- Shikra uses a simple and unified architecture - vision encoder, alignment layer, language model. It does not require specialized external detection modules, position encoders, etc. This contrasts with some prior works relying on complex model architectures and data processing pipelines.

- Visual Chatbot GPT builds conversational agents but does not focus on spatial reference in images. It cannot take in or produce numerical coordinate representations. Shikra specifically targets the referential abilities lacking in chatbots.

- Overall, this paper uniquely targets Referential Dialogue as an important missing capability in MLLMs. The introduction of Shikra represents a simple yet effective approach to enabling spatial reference, without compromising performance on established vision-language tasks. The analyses also provide valuable insights into spatial reasoning in MLLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few future research directions:

1. Improving the coordinate representation for dense object detection and segmentation tasks. The current numerical coordinate representation used in Shikra has drawbacks for dense tasks, so exploring better representations would be valuable.

2. Making Shikra multilingual, as it currently only supports English. Expanding it to be user-friendly for non-English speakers is an important direction.

3. Further exploring grounded chains of thought (GCoT), where reasoning is provided along with spatial annotations. The preliminary experiments on CLEVR showed promise for reducing visual hallucination, so this could be an interesting area to pursue. 

4. Applying Shikra to more applications like MR headsets, robotics, online shopping, etc. The paper demonstrates it has exciting potential for precise communication and comprehension of spatial references.

5. Improving safety and avoiding harmful responses, a general challenge for large language models.

6. Comparing Shikra to visual dialogue models like Visual ChatGPT to better understand the capabilities and limitations. Referential dialogue has overlap but also key differences to explore.

In summary, the main future work revolves around improving Shikra's capabilities, safety, and applicability for referential dialogue across languages, tasks, and modalities. Exploring better coordinate representations and reasoning are two key technical directions suggested.
