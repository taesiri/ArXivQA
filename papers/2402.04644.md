# [LEVI: Generalizable Fine-tuning via Layer-wise Ensemble of Different   Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04644)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent works have shown that fine-tuned large pre-trained models often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e. data from different distributions than what the model was fine-tuned on. This paper contends that previous approaches for improving fine-tuning generalization have two key limitations:
1) They assume pre-trained features are free of flaws and contain all necessary information to support new tasks, which may not hold true. 
2) They focus only on avoiding overfitting to problematic fine-tuning data by preserving pre-trained features, while ignoring potential issues with pre-trained features themselves.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a new fine-tuning method called LEVI (Layer-wise Ensemble of Different Views) to address limitations of both pre-trained and fine-tuning data/models. Key ideas:

1) Ensemble pre-trained model with a smaller task-specific trained-from-scratch model to leverage complementary information and suppress problematic features from both.

2) Perform layer-wise ensembling by concatenating intermediate outputs of pre-trained model with final output of trained-from-scratch model. This tight integration provides different views to improve ID-OOD tradeoff.

3) Use a specialized model architecture for trained-from-scratch model to effectively learn task-specific representations missed by pre-trained model.

Contributions:
1) Show both pre-trained and fine-tuning data can jointly hurt OOD generalization of fine-tuned models.

2) Propose LEVI, a novel layer-wise ensemble method to leverage multiple complementary views from pre-trained and specialized trained-from-scratch models.

3) Demonstrate value of incorporating trained-from-scratch models to mitigate limitations of pre-trained models for fine-tuning generalization.

4) Extensive experiments on large language and vision models show LEVI substantially improves OOD performance across various shifts while maintaining efficiency. Also shows compatibility with efficient training methods like LoRA.

In summary, this paper makes important progress in improving fine-tuning generalization by addressing flaws in both pre-trained and fine-tuning data/models via a flexible and efficient layer-wise ensemble approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

To improve the out-of-distribution generalization ability of fine-tuned large pre-trained models, this paper proposes a novel layer-wise ensemble method called LEVI that combines the complementary information from a pre-trained model and a small task-specific model trained from scratch.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new fine-tuning method called LEVI (Layer-wise Ensemble for generalizable fine-tuning via different Views) to improve the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization ability of fine-tuned models. 

The key contributions are:

1) Identifying that inherent problems in both pre-trained models and fine-tuning data can jointly hurt the OOD generalization of fine-tuned models.

2) Proposing the LEVI framework, which ensembles a pre-trained model with a small task-specific model in a layer-wise manner. This allows combining complementary information from the two models to suppress problematic features while preserving useful ones.

3) Showing the value of using trained-from-scratch models together with pre-trained models to mitigate limitations of pre-trained features.

4) Demonstrating improved OOD generalization with LEVI on large language and vision models, while maintaining training and inference efficiency.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the LEVI fine-tuning framework to improve OOD generalization by emphasizing different views from pre-training and fine-tuning through an efficient layer-wise ensemble.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Fine-tuning pre-trained models: The paper focuses on improving the out-of-distribution generalization ability when fine-tuning large pre-trained models like BERT on downstream tasks.

- Out-of-distribution generalization: A key goal is enhancing performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that comes from a different distribution than the fine-tuning data. 

- Spurious correlations: The paper discusses issues like spurious correlations in both the pre-trained models and fine-tuning data that can hurt OOD generalization.

- Complementary information: A core idea is using complementary information from a pre-trained model and a small trained-from-scratch model to mitigate limitations on both sides.

- Layer-wise ensembling: The proposed method, LEVI, does layer-wise ensembling to integrate intermediate layers from the pre-trained model with a task-specific model.

- Training efficiency: Maintaining training and inference efficiency is an important consideration for scaling to large models. Compatibility with efficient training methods is discussed.

- Language and vision models: Experiments showing improved OOD generalization are demonstrated on both language (e.g., T5) and vision (e.g., ViT) foundation models.
