# [Probabilistic Implicit Scene Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01264v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop a scalable method for probabilistic shape completion of 3D scenes that can generate diverse, plausible completions from incomplete 3D point cloud data?The key points are:- The paper focuses on 3D scene completion, which involves completing multiple objects and their contextual relationships from partial 3D scans. This is more challenging than single object completion.- The authors aim to develop a probabilistic method that can generate multiple plausible shape completions rather than just a single completion. This accounts for inherent ambiguity when the input scan data is very incomplete. - The method needs to be scalable to handle large 3D scenes with many objects at high resolutions.- The proposed approach called continuous Generative Cellular Automata (cGCA) extends prior work on Generative Cellular Automata for voxel-based shape generation. cGCA generates a sparse voxel representation associated with latent codes that capture local shape information. This allows generating high quality continuous surfaces.- The training procedure is designed to maximize a variational lower bound on the data log-likelihood, ensuring cGCA models the distribution of complete shapes.- Experiments demonstrate cGCA can generate diverse, plausible scene completions even from very sparse/incomplete input point clouds, outperforming prior deterministic and non-scalable probabilistic methods.In summary, the key hypothesis is that modeling shape completion as a probabilistic, scalable generative process will produce higher quality and more plausible results compared to prior deterministic and non-scalable approaches. The cGCA method is proposed to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. The authors propose continuous Generative Cellular Automata (cGCA), a generative model for probabilistic shape completion that can produce diverse continuous surfaces from a partial 3D point cloud observation. 2. cGCA is the first method capable of probabilistic scene completion, generating multiple plausible completions for large-scale scenes with multiple objects while capturing their context. This is a challenging task due to the multi-modality and scalability required.3. The training objective of cGCA is proved to maximize the variational lower bound of the complete shape distribution. This theoretically justifies cGCA's formulation as a valid generative model.4. Experiments demonstrate that cGCA can generate high-quality and diverse scene completions even when the input point cloud is highly incomplete. It outperforms deterministic methods which produce blurry outputs, highlighting the importance of a probabilistic formulation.5. cGCA is shown to be more scalable compared to dense convolutional networks for scene completion. The sparse voxel representation makes it efficient for capturing context in large-scale scenes.In summary, the main contribution is proposing cGCA, the first scalable generative model for probabilistic and continuous scene completion from partial observations, with theoretical justification and strong experimental results. The method handles inputs with varying completeness robustly.
