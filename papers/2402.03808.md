# [SDEMG: Score-based Diffusion Model for Surface Electromyographic Signal   Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals used for applications like prosthesis control can get contaminated by electrocardiogram (ECG) interference when recorded near the heart. Existing methods like high-pass filters and template subtraction have limitations in effectively removing ECG artifacts from sEMG under challenging conditions. Recently proposed neural network methods can also introduce distortion. Therefore, more effective sEMG denoising methods are needed.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes SDEMG, a novel score-based diffusion model to eliminate ECG interference and reconstruct high-quality sEMG signals. SDEMG leverages a diffusion process to add Gaussian noise to clean sEMG and a reverse sampling process to remove the noise using the ECG-contaminated sEMG and noise scale as conditions. This allows SDEMG to model the underlying data distribution and generate less distorted sEMG samples.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes first score-based diffusion model, SDEMG, for sEMG denoising using contaminated sEMG and noise scale as conditions
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing ECG artifacts across various SNRs and evaluation metrics 
- Generates higher quality sEMG signals with less distortion compared to prior neural network and traditional methods
- Demonstrates SDEMG's effectiveness and robustness in eliminating ECG contamination from sEMG under challenging mismatch conditions between training and testing
- Highlights potential of score-based diffusion models for sEMG signal enhancement tasks beyond ECG removal

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in sEMG denoising by developing SDEMG, a novel and highly effective score-based diffusion model leveraging the contaminated sEMG itself to eliminate ECG interference. Experiments demonstrate SDEMG's superior performance over previous methods.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution is proposing SDEMG, a novel approach for removing ECG interference from surface EMG (sEMG) signals using a score-based diffusion model. Specifically:

- SDEMG is the first study to develop a diffusion model for sEMG denoising. It leverages the capability of diffusion models to generate high-quality and accurate samples from noisy input data. 

- SDEMG takes the ECG-contaminated sEMG waveform and noise scale as conditions to guide the model in recovering the clean sEMG signal. It outperforms comparative methods like high-pass filters, template subtraction, and neural network-based denoising across a range of SNRs.

- Experiments under training-testing mismatch conditions demonstrate SDEMG's superior effectiveness and robustness in removing ECG artifacts from sEMG signals. It also introduces less distortion compared to other methods.

- The paper shows the potential of score-based diffusion models for high-fidelity sEMG signal reconstruction, which can benefit various clinical EMG applications.
