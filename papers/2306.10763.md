# [Guiding Language Models of Code with Global Context using Monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10763)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is:

How can we guide language models to generate code that is consistent with global context from the code repository, without requiring architectural changes or additional training?

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposing the notion of "monitors" as an interface between language models and static analysis tools. The monitor watches the code generated by the LM and invokes static analysis to get suggestions from global context. 

- Instantiating this approach for the task of generating type-consistent identifier names after a dereference operation, using a type-based static analysis.

- Introducing a new dataset called PragmaticCode of Java projects with dependencies for evaluating approaches that leverage global context.

- Empirically demonstrating that monitor-guided decoding consistently improves metrics like compilation rate, next-token accuracy, and match with ground truth across models of varying scale.

- Showing that smaller LMs combined with monitor-guided decoding can outperform larger LMs, opening up possibilities like using smaller on-device models.

- Analyzing the effect of identifier complexity, prompt augmentation techniques, and decoding strategies like FIM when combined with monitor-guided decoding.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that monitor-guided decoding can effectively leverage global context from static analysis to guide language models to generate more accurate, compilable code, without any architectural changes or retraining. The results on multiple models and setups validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing the idea of using monitors as an interface between language models (LMs) and static analysis to guide code generation. The monitor watches the LM generating code, invokes static analysis in the background when certain triggers occur, and uses the information from static analysis to reshape the logits/probabilities produced by the LM to guide it towards more semantically valid code. 

2. Introducing a new dataset called PragmaticCode of real-world Java projects with complete build environments and dependencies. This allows evaluating code generation approaches like the proposed monitor-guided decoding that rely on global context from the whole codebase/dependencies.

3. Instantiating monitor-guided decoding for generating type-consistent identifiers in Java code by triggering the monitor on object dereferences and using a type-based static analysis to provide suggestions.

4. Evaluating various scale LMs with and without monitor-guided decoding and showing it improves metrics like compilation rate, match with ground truth identifiers, etc. The key findings are:

- Monitor-guided decoding consistently improves all scale LMs compared to their base versions without monitors.

- Smaller LMs with monitors can outperform larger base LMs on metrics like compilation rate.

- Monitor-guided decoding combines well with other techniques like prompt engineering and decoding strategies.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing monitors as an interface to integrate static analysis with language models to guide code generation, along with an instantiation for type-consistent identifier generation and an evaluation showing its benefits. The PragmaticCode dataset and analyses are also an important contribution to facilitate research in pragmatic code generation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares and contributes to related work:

- The key idea of using monitors and static analysis to provide global context and guide language models of code is novel. Most prior work has focused on augmenting the prompt or modifying the model architecture and training objectives. This paper introduces a complementary technique of applying output constraints during inference.

- The paper makes excellent use of mature static analysis tools like those found in IDEs to assist language models. Leveraging decades of tooling designed to help human developers is an impactful insight.

- The proposed approach does not require retraining or finetuning the language model. Many related techniques require additional training which can be expensive and time-consuming. This makes the monitor-guided decoding more practical.

- The paper contributes two new datasets for evaluating code generation models in a realistic setting - \dataset and \evaldataset. Many benchmarks use standalone functions, whereas these datasets are based on real repositories with dependencies.

- The results demonstrate consistent and sizable improvements in compilation rates and match with ground truth across models and scale. An interesting finding is that smaller models with monitor guidance can outperform much larger models without it.

- Monitor-guided decoding is shown to combine well with other techniques like prompt augmentation and fill-in-the-middle decoding. The gains are complementary showing the approach is broadly applicable.

Overall, I feel this paper makes a significant contribution over related work by introducing a practical and effective technique for improving language models of code using mature static analysis tools. The gains are achieved with minimal changes to existing models. The datasets and empirical methodology are also impactful for future research on code generation in realistic settings.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring the efficacy of monitor-guided decoding (MGD) for code written in other widely used programming languages besides Java, such as C/C++, Python, JavaScript, and Rust. The authors note that since their implementation is based on the language-agnostic Language Server Protocol (LSP), applying MGD to other languages would not require significant changes.

- Expanding the scope of static analysis used with MGD beyond type-based analysis. The authors suggest using MGD with deeper semantic analyses like typestate analysis and combining multiple complementary static analyses through joint monitoring. 

- Optimizing the implementation of MGD to reduce the inference overhead introduced by invoking the monitor. The authors note opportunities like tuning the configuration of the underlying language server to only support features needed for MGD's specific use case.

- Evaluating the complementary benefits of combining MGD with other techniques like prompt engineering and architecture modifications. The authors frame MGD as orthogonal to techniques that condition on the input, whereas MGD applies output constraints.

- Exploring the use of smaller models coupled with MGD as an alternative to large remote models for code completion in IDEs. The authors suggest this could improve privacy and cost.

In summary, the main future work revolves around expanding MGD along multiple dimensions like languages, analyses, efficiency, and combining it with other techniques, as well as exploring its use to enable small on-device models. The core idea of interfacing static analysis with language models through stateful monitors seems like a fruitful direction for further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called monitor-guided decoding (MGD) to improve the quality of code generated by language models (LMs) by using static analysis to provide global context. MGD uses a monitor as a stateful interface between the LM and a static analysis tool. The monitor watches the code generated by the LM and invokes static analysis at predefined trigger points to get suggestions, which are converted to masks that reshape the LM's next token probabilities during decoding. This allows bringing in global context from the full code repository and dependencies. The authors demonstrate MGD for enforcing type-consistency of identifiers after a dereference operation in Java code. They contribute two new datasets - PragmaticCode of Java projects with dependencies for evaluation, and DotPrompts of method completion prompts derived from it. Experiments show MGD consistently improves identifier match, compilation rates and match with ground truth across models, and allows smaller models guided by MGD to outperform larger standalone models. The method is complementary to prompt augmentation techniques.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method called monitor-guided decoding (MGD) to improve code generation by language models. MGD uses static analysis from integrated development environments to provide global context and guide the language model during decoding. A monitor watches the language model generate code and invokes static analysis at predefined trigger points, such as when an object is dereferenced. The suggestions from static analysis are used to reshape the next token probabilities produced by the language model so that they are consistent with the global context. 

The authors evaluate MGD for generating type-consistent identifiers in Java code by using a type-based static analysis. Experiments across multiple model sizes and architectures show MGD consistently improves metrics like compilation rates, next token match, and agreement with ground truth. The results indicate even smaller models with MGD can outperform larger unaugmented models. MGD is shown to complement other techniques like prompt engineering and fill-in-the-middle decoding. The authors contribute two new datasets for pragmatic code generation evaluation. Overall, the work demonstrates the potential for lightweight integration of expert software tools with language models to improve code generation quality.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called monitor-guided decoding (MGD) to improve code generation by language models (LMs). The key idea is to use static analysis tools from integrated development environments (IDEs) to guide the LM during decoding. 

Specifically, they define a monitor as an interface between the LM and a static analysis tool. The monitor watches the code generated by the LM and invokes the static analysis tool at predefined trigger points. The suggestions from the static analysis are used to reshape the logits produced by the LM to guide it towards more semantically valid code. 

Unlike retrieving global information a priori, the monitor invokes static analysis on demand throughout the decoding process to provide contextual guidance. The authors instantiate this framework for enforcing type consistency of identifiers generated following an object dereference, using a type-based static analysis. Experiments on various LMs like CodeGen, SantaCoder and GPT-3 show that MGD consistently improves metrics like compilation rates, ground truth match, and use of correct identifiers. Interestingly, smaller LMs with MGD can outperform much larger LMs without it.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- Language models (LMs) for code generation work well when there is sufficient context in the surrounding code. However, they struggle when having to use types or functions defined in other files/modules, especially those not seen during training.

- LMs tend to "hallucinate" in such cases, using undefined types/identifiers incorrectly since they lack awareness of the global context.

- Integrated development environments (IDEs) help developers by providing global context through static analysis. This paper explores extending this to help guide LMs using global context.

- The paper proposes "monitor-guided decoding" (MGD) where monitors invoke static analysis iteratively during LM decoding to provide relevant suggestions. This guides the LM to generate identifiers consistent with types defined globally. 

- A dataset called PragmaticCode of Java projects with dependencies is created to evaluate approaches needing global context. 

- A method-level completion dataset DotPrompts is created using PragmaticCode for evaluation.

- Experiments show MGD consistently improves identifier match, compilation rates, and ground truth agreement across models. Smaller LMs with MGD can outperform larger unaugmented LMs.

- MGD is complementary to other techniques like prompt augmentation. Combining MGD with prompt augmentation gives further improvements.

So in summary, the key contribution is using static analysis via monitors to provide global context and guide LMs to generate compilable, type-consistent code, without needing extra training or changing model architecture.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Language models (LMs) of code
- Monitor-guided decoding (MGD) 
- Static analysis
- Type consistency 
- Identifier generation
- Repository-level context
- Prompt engineering
- Fill-in-the-middle (FIM)

The paper proposes using monitors based on static analysis to guide language models to generate type-consistent identifiers in code. The monitors invoke static analysis on-demand during decoding to retrieve suggestions from the global repository context. This allows smaller LMs, when guided by monitors, to outperform larger LMs without monitors. The paper introduces monitor-guided decoding as a general framework to interface static analysis with language models. 

The paper evaluates the approach on a new curated dataset of Java projects called PragmaticCode. Experiments show gains in metrics like compilation rate, next identifier match, prefix match etc. when using MGD. The approach combines well with prompt engineering techniques like fill-in-the-middle prompting. The paper makes the case that tools from IDEs like static analysis can help improve quality of code generation from language models.
