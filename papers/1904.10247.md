# [Free-form Video Inpainting with 3D Gated Convolution and Temporal   PatchGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10247)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop an effective deep learning based model for free-form video inpainting that can generate high-quality and temporally consistent results? 

The key challenges for free-form video inpainting that the paper aims to address are:

- Existing patch-based methods fail on complex non-repetitive structures and do not scale well. 

- Applying image inpainting models naively results in temporal inconsistency between frames.

- There is a lack of suitable datasets and mask generation methods to train video inpainting models.

To tackle these issues, the main contributions of the paper are:

- A novel deep network architecture using 3D gated convolutions to handle irregular masks and enhance temporal consistency.

- A Temporal PatchGAN discriminator with combined losses to further improve video quality.

- An algorithm to procedurally generate diverse free-form mask videos for training.

- Introduction of a new challenging free-form video inpainting dataset.

Through experiments, they demonstrate state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance compared to existing patch-based and learning-based methods. The main hypothesis appears to be that their proposed model with 3D gated convolutions and Temporal PatchGAN can effectively address the challenges of free-form video inpainting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes the first learning-based model for free-form video inpainting. Previous methods were either patch-based or image inpainting models applied per frame. This model is designed specifically for video inpainting.

2. It introduces 3D gated convolutions in the generator network to handle the uncertainty of irregular video masks. The 3D convolutions utilize temporal information while the gated convolutions learn to attend on valid features.

3. It proposes a novel Temporal PatchGAN discriminator with combined losses to enhance temporal consistency, which is crucial for video quality.

4. It designs an algorithm to procedurally generate diverse free-form video masks for training data.

5. It collects and provides the first dataset for free-form video inpainting, containing videos from YouTube-VOS and YouTube-BoundingBoxes datasets.

6. It achieves state-of-the-art results on FaceForensics and their proposed dataset, outperforming patch-based and other learning-based methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

In summary, this paper introduces the first specialized deep learning model for free-form video inpainting and makes contributions in network architecture, loss functions, training data and benchmark datasets. Both the qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed model.

- The paper introduces a new algorithm for generating diverse free-form mask videos to create a dataset for training and evaluation. Prior datasets for video inpainting were more limited.

- Extensive experiments compare the proposed method to state-of-the-art patch-based and learning-based baselines, demonstrating superior quantitative and qualitative performance on complex free-form mask videos.

- The model achieves the new state-of-the-art in free-form video inpainting. It also shows strong generalizability by extending to tasks like video object removal and super-resolution.

- The paper provides both theoretical contributions in its model design, as well as practical contributions in creating datasets and evaluation benchmarks for further research.

In summary, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in free-form video inpainting through innovative model architecture and training strategies. It also provides key datasets and analysis to advance research in applying learning-based techniques to this challenging problem. The strong empirical results and generalizability demonstrate its effectiveness.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions in the Discussion and Future Work section:

1. Testing the model on more diverse videos that are different from the training data. The current model fails when the testing video is very different from the training data, which is a common issue for learning-based methods.

2. Improving results for thick/large masked areas. Currently the model struggles when the masked area is too large.

3. Reducing model parameters and redundancy from 3D convolutions. They suggest exploring the Temporal Shift Module to enable 2D convolutions to capture temporal information while reducing parameters. 

4. Further analysis on gated convolutions for video inpainting. They found similar performance could be reached just by increasing channel numbers, implying gated convolutions may have less impact for video vs image inpainting.

5. Integrating user guided inputs by training the model on edge images. This would allow users to manipulate the output by drawing edges during inference.

6. Applying the model to related tasks like video interpolation, prediction, and potentially integrating optical flow estimation.

In summary, the main future directions are improving model generalization, handling large masks, reducing model complexity, better understanding model components like gated convolutions, and extending the model to related video generation tasks with user guidance.
