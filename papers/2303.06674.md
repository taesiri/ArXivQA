# [Universal Instance Perception as Object Discovery and Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06674)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a unified model that can solve diverse instance perception tasks using a single network with the same model parameters. 

The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:

- Proposes a unified prompt-guided formulation to reformulate 10 instance perception tasks (object detection, instance segmentation, MOT, MOTS, VIS, REC, RES, R-VOS, SOT, VOS) into a unified paradigm of object discovery and retrieval. 

- Develops a universal model architecture termed UNINEXT that implements this unified formulation. It can flexibly perceive different types of objects by simply changing the input prompts.

- The unified formulation brings benefits like enabling joint training on data from different tasks/domains for learning universal representations, being parameter-efficient by sharing computation across tasks, and overcoming limitations of fixed classifiers.

- UNINEXT achieves superior performance on 20 challenging benchmarks spanning the 10 tasks using a single model. It outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods.

- The key novelty is the prompt-guided formulation to unify diverse instance perception tasks and the unified model architecture. This is the first work to solve such a diverse set of instance-level vision tasks with a single model.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards unified vision models by proposing a novel formulation and model to jointly address 10 important instance perception tasks, demonstrating superior performance over task-specific models. The unified paradigm and architecture offer greater flexibility, efficiency, and generalization ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes a unified prompt-guided formulation to reformulate diverse instance perception tasks into a unified object discovery and retrieval paradigm. This unified formulation brings multiple benefits:

- Enormous data from different tasks and label vocabularies can be exploited for jointly training general instance-level representations. 

- The unified model is parameter-efficient and can handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

2. It presents UNINEXT, a universal instance perception model based on the unified formulation. UNINEXT can flexibly perceive different types of objects by simply changing the input prompts. 

3. Extensive experiments show that UNINEXT achieves superior performance on 20 challenging benchmarks across 10 instance perception tasks using a single model with the same parameters.

In summary, this paper makes significant progress towards universal instance perception by proposing a unified formulation and model architecture. The unified paradigm enables exploiting synergies between different tasks and learning universal representations. The single UNINEXT model obtains new state-of-the-art results on diverse instance perception tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes UNINEXT, a unified model for diverse instance-level visual perception tasks like object detection, segmentation, tracking, and referring expression comprehension, which reformulates these tasks into a prompt-guided object discovery and retrieval paradigm to enable training a single model on data from different tasks and flexible perception of objects by changing input prompts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in universal instance perception:

- Overall Approach: This paper proposes a unified prompt-guided formulation to tackle diverse instance perception tasks using a single model. Other works have focused more on unified architectures or learning paradigms for a group of related tasks. This prompt-based approach allows flexible perception based on the input.

- Tasks Covered: The paper demonstrates results on 10 major instance perception tasks including object detection, segmentation, tracking, referring expression tasks, etc. This is one of the most extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks using a single model. Most prior works have focused on a smaller subset of 2-4 tasks.

- Performance: The proposed UNINEXT model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance across all 10 tasks on 20 datasets. The consistent strong results across many tasks highlight the effectiveness of the unified approach.

- Efficiency: By unifying multiple tasks into one model, UNINEXT is highly parameter efficient compared to task-specific models. The joint training also enables sharing representations across tasks.

- Limitations: The focus is more on instance-level recognition tasks. It does not cover some panoptic or semantic segmentation tasks. The offline training paradigm also limits real-time applications.

Overall, this paper makes excellent progress in unified instance perception by reformulating diverse tasks into a simple prompt-based formulation. The extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach on many major perception tasks. It significantly advances the state-of-the-art in unified vision models.
