# [Universal Instance Perception as Object Discovery and Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06674)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a unified model that can solve diverse instance perception tasks using a single network with the same model parameters. 

The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:

- Proposes a unified prompt-guided formulation to reformulate 10 instance perception tasks (object detection, instance segmentation, MOT, MOTS, VIS, REC, RES, R-VOS, SOT, VOS) into a unified paradigm of object discovery and retrieval. 

- Develops a universal model architecture termed UNINEXT that implements this unified formulation. It can flexibly perceive different types of objects by simply changing the input prompts.

- The unified formulation brings benefits like enabling joint training on data from different tasks/domains for learning universal representations, being parameter-efficient by sharing computation across tasks, and overcoming limitations of fixed classifiers.

- UNINEXT achieves superior performance on 20 challenging benchmarks spanning the 10 tasks using a single model. It outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods.

- The key novelty is the prompt-guided formulation to unify diverse instance perception tasks and the unified model architecture. This is the first work to solve such a diverse set of instance-level vision tasks with a single model.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards unified vision models by proposing a novel formulation and model to jointly address 10 important instance perception tasks, demonstrating superior performance over task-specific models. The unified paradigm and architecture offer greater flexibility, efficiency, and generalization ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes a unified prompt-guided formulation to reformulate diverse instance perception tasks into a unified object discovery and retrieval paradigm. This unified formulation brings multiple benefits:

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes UNINEXT, a unified model for diverse instance-level visual perception tasks like object detection, segmentation, tracking, and referring expression comprehension, which reformulates these tasks into a prompt-guided object discovery and retrieval paradigm to enable training a single model on data from different tasks and flexible perception of objects by changing input prompts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in universal instance perception:

- Overall Approach: This paper proposes a unified prompt-guided formulation to tackle diverse instance perception tasks using a single model. Other works have focused more on unified architectures or learning paradigms for a group of related tasks. This prompt-based approach allows flexible perception based on the input.

- Tasks Covered: The paper demonstrates results on 10 major instance perception tasks including object detection, segmentation, tracking, referring expression tasks, etc. This is one of the most extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks using a single model. Most prior works have focused on a smaller subset of 2-4 tasks.

- Performance: The proposed UNINEXT model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance across all 10 tasks on 20 datasets. The consistent strong results across many tasks highlight the effectiveness of the unified approach.

- Efficiency: By unifying multiple tasks into one model, UNINEXT is highly parameter efficient compared to task-specific models. The joint training also enables sharing representations across tasks.

- Limitations: The focus is more on instance-level recognition tasks. It does not cover some panoptic or semantic segmentation tasks. The offline training paradigm also limits real-time applications.

Overall, this paper makes excellent progress in unified instance perception by reformulating diverse tasks into a simple prompt-based formulation. The extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach on many major perception tasks. It significantly advances the state-of-the-art in unified vision models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

1. Broadening the range of supported tasks: The authors point out that UNINEXT currently focuses on ten instance-level perception tasks, but could be extended to other areas like panoptic segmentation, human pose estimation, action/event detection, etc. Expanding the scope could enable more universal visual perception.

2. Supporting prompt inputs in more modalities: Currently UNINEXT takes prompts in the form of text, images, and target annotations. They suggest exploring prompts in other modalities like audio and point clouds. This could further improve the flexibility and generality of the system.

3. Exploring open-vocabulary detection: UNINEXT shows potential for zero-shot object detection, since it uses a flexible retrieval mechanism instead of fixed classifiers. The authors suggest formally exploring open-vocabulary detection as an exciting research direction.

4. Deploying to real applications: The authors propose testing UNINEXT on real-world applications like autonomous driving, intelligent surveillance, etc. This could reveal challenges and lead to further improvements.

5. Pre-training foundation models: Inspired by foundation models like CLIP in NLP, the authors propose pre-training even larger and more general models on massive multimodal data as a promising direction. This could learn more universal representations to benefit various downstream tasks.

In summary, the main future directions are expanding the scope, support, and application of the unified formulation, as well as exploring large-scale pre-training to learn more universal foundations for visual perception. The authors position UNINEXT as a strong baseline and hope it will catalyze more research in this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes UNINEXT, a universal instance perception model that can perform 10 different instance-level visual perception tasks using a single network with the same model parameters. The key idea is to reformulate the diverse instance perception tasks into a unified object discovery and retrieval paradigm. Specifically, the model first generates object proposals guided by input prompts like category names, language expressions, or target annotations. Then it retrieves the final target instances from the proposals based on matching scores between the prompts and proposals. This formulation enables joint training on data from different tasks and domains, learning more generalizable representations. It also allows flexible perception of various targets by simply changing the input prompts during inference. Experiments show superior performance of UNINEXT on 20 benchmarks spanning 10 instance perception tasks including object detection, instance segmentation, referring expression comprehension, multiple object tracking, etc. The unified model is efficient and outperforms task-specific counterparts.
