# [Universal Instance Perception as Object Discovery and Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06674)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a unified model that can solve diverse instance perception tasks using a single network with the same model parameters. 

The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:

- Proposes a unified prompt-guided formulation to reformulate 10 instance perception tasks (object detection, instance segmentation, MOT, MOTS, VIS, REC, RES, R-VOS, SOT, VOS) into a unified paradigm of object discovery and retrieval. 

- Develops a universal model architecture termed UNINEXT that implements this unified formulation. It can flexibly perceive different types of objects by simply changing the input prompts.

- The unified formulation brings benefits like enabling joint training on data from different tasks/domains for learning universal representations, being parameter-efficient by sharing computation across tasks, and overcoming limitations of fixed classifiers.

- UNINEXT achieves superior performance on 20 challenging benchmarks spanning the 10 tasks using a single model. It outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods.

- The key novelty is the prompt-guided formulation to unify diverse instance perception tasks and the unified model architecture. This is the first work to solve such a diverse set of instance-level vision tasks with a single model.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards unified vision models by proposing a novel formulation and model to jointly address 10 important instance perception tasks, demonstrating superior performance over task-specific models. The unified paradigm and architecture offer greater flexibility, efficiency, and generalization ability.
