# [Variable Importance in High-Dimensional Settings Requires Grouping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10858)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Explaining machine learning model predictions is important for performance enhancement and human comprehension. 
- Variable importance methods like Permutation Importance (PI) can be used but fail when variables are correlated, giving misleading results.
- Conditional Permutation Importance (CPI) solves this issue but struggles in high-dimensional settings where variables are highly correlated, making the results unreliable and computationally expensive.
- Group-based analysis can help handle high correlations but current methods lack statistical guarantees like type-I error control.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose Block-Based Conditional Permutation Importance (BCPI), a new framework for statistically valid variable importance computation at both single and group levels.
- They introduce a novel "internal stacking" approach that extends the DNN architecture with additional linear layers to summarize variable groups. This speeds up computation for groups with high cardinality.
- Theoretical results are provided on conditional permutation for groups. The Wald statistic from the framework follows a standard normal distribution asymptotically, enabling p-value computation and type-I error control.

Main Contributions:
- BCPI framework for valid variable importance at group level with p-values and type-I error control.
- Internal stacking to extend DNN architecture for faster computation with groups.
- Theoretical results on conditional permutation for groups.
- Extensive benchmarks showing BCPI has high prediction performance and identifies informative groups while controlling type-I error rate.
- Analysis on large-scale UK Biobank dataset demonstrating consistency between detected important groups and prior biomedicine literature.

The paper makes variable importance with statistical guarantees feasible for models with groups of correlated variables in high-dimensions. The internal stacking approach also makes the computation with groups more efficient.
