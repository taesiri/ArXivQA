# [HMD-Poser: On-Device Real-time Human Motion Tracking from Scalable   Sparse Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03561)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Achieving accurate and real-time full body human motion tracking (HMT) using only sparse observations from head-mounted displays (HMDs) and wearable sensors is very challenging. 
- HMDs only provide tracking of the head and hands. Reconstructing full body pose, especially lower body, from such sparse input is an underconstrained problem.
- Consumer HMDs have limited computing resources, making deploying real-time HMT models difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- HMD-Poser is proposed to combine HMD with a scalable number of inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the lower body. This improves accuracy while maintaining user comfort and cost.
- A unified framework handles multiple input configurations: HMD only, HMD+2IMUs, HMD+3IMUs etc. More IMUs improve accuracy at the cost of more wearable sensors.
- A lightweight temporal-spatial feature learning (TSFL) network combines LSTM and Transformer modules. This captures temporal and spatial correlations in the data while being fast enough to run real-time on HMDs.
- Online body shape estimation is added to improve joint position accuracy compared to using a default shape.

Main Contributions:
- First unified approach to reconstruct full body motion from scalable, sparse HMD and IMU observations. Enables accuracy vs wearability tradeoff.
- Lightweight network architecture runs real-time on consumer HMDs while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.
- Quantitative evaluation on public dataset and new real-sensor dataset. Qualitative demonstration of real-time avatar driving on HMD.
- Open-sourced code and new dataset to spur more HMD-based HMT research.

In summary, HMD-Poser pioneers highly accurate, low-latency full body motion tracking on standalone VR headsets by fusing information from the headset and optional wearable sensors. The lightweight network design makes the technique practical for consumer devices.
