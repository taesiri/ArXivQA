# [PolyVoice: Language Models for Speech to Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02982)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:How can we develop an effective speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system that can handle both written and unwritten languages and also preserve the voice characteristics of the original speaker?The key points are:- The authors propose a novel framework called PolyVoice that consists of two main components:  - A speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) front-end that converts speech in the source language to semantic units in the target language.  - A unit-to-speech (U2S) back-end that converts the target units into speech while preserving the source speaker's voice.- The S2UT component uses a cross-lingual language model called U-XLM that translates between semantic units extracted from speech in an unsupervised way. This allows the system to handle unwritten languages.- The U2S component leverages the VALL-E X method to do in-context learning and clone the speaker's voice using the source speech and target units as context.- Overall, PolyVoice aims to develop an S2ST system that works for both written and unwritten languages, and also preserves voice characteristics, unlike previous pipeline systems. The key hypothesis is that the proposed architecture with its two language model components can achieve these goals.In summary, the main research question is how to develop an effective S2ST system for written and unwritten languages while preserving voice quality, which the authors hypothesize can be achieved through the proposed PolyVoice framework. The paper presents experiments and results to evaluate this hypothesis.
