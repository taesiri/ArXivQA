# [PolyVoice: Language Models for Speech to Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02982)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:

How can we develop an effective speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system that can handle both written and unwritten languages and also preserve the voice characteristics of the original speaker?

The key points are:

- The authors propose a novel framework called PolyVoice that consists of two main components:
  - A speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) front-end that converts speech in the source language to semantic units in the target language.
  - A unit-to-speech (U2S) back-end that converts the target units into speech while preserving the source speaker's voice.

- The S2UT component uses a cross-lingual language model called U-XLM that translates between semantic units extracted from speech in an unsupervised way. This allows the system to handle unwritten languages.

- The U2S component leverages the VALL-E X method to do in-context learning and clone the speaker's voice using the source speech and target units as context.

- Overall, PolyVoice aims to develop an S2ST system that works for both written and unwritten languages, and also preserves voice characteristics, unlike previous pipeline systems. The key hypothesis is that the proposed architecture with its two language model components can achieve these goals.

In summary, the main research question is how to develop an effective S2ST system for written and unwritten languages while preserving voice quality, which the authors hypothesize can be achieved through the proposed PolyVoice framework. The paper presents experiments and results to evaluate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a language model-based framework for speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) consisting of a translation language model and a speech synthesis language model. 

2. Using unsupervised discretized speech units instead of phonemes as the intermediate representation between source and target speech. This allows the framework to handle unwritten languages.

3. Adopting the VALL-E X approach for the speech synthesis component to build a unit-based audio language model, enabling voice cloning and preservation of speaking style.

4. Evaluating the system on Chinese -> English and English -> Spanish translation tasks, showing improved performance over previous systems in terms of BLEU score, ASV score, and naturalness.

5. Demonstrating the ability to handle translation between a written source language (English) and an unwritten target language (Spanish) without any Spanish text data.

In summary, the key innovation is proposing a fully language model-based S2ST framework that leverages unsupervised semantic units for cross-lingual speech translation and voice cloning, applicable even for unwritten languages. The experiments validate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes PolyVoice, a new language model-based framework for speech-to-speech translation that uses discrete semantic units as an intermediate representation between the source and target speech. The key idea is to use a decoder-only language model for translation and an autoregressive language model for speech synthesis while preserving speaker voice. The main advantage is the ability to handle unwritten languages by using unsupervised semantic units.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel language model-based framework for speech-to-speech translation using discrete semantic units. Here are some key ways it compares to other research in this field:

- Most prior work in speech-to-speech translation uses an encoder-decoder architecture, while this paper proposes using only a decoder model (U-XLM). This is inspired by recent advances in language modeling showing the power of decoder-only models like GPT. The results show their decoder-only model outperforms an encoder-decoder baseline.

- The use of discrete semantic units from self-supervised models like HuBERT is becoming more common in speech translation tasks. However, this paper shows how these units can be integrated into a language modeling framework more seamlessly than prior approaches that relied on multi-task learning.

- For speech synthesis, this paper adapts the in-context learning approach of VALL-E/VALL-E X to use unsupervised semantic units rather than phonemes. This is a novel way of applying these types of models to potentially lower-resource or unwritten languages.

- The paper demonstrates the approach on both written (Chinese-English) and unwritten (English-Spanish) language pairs. Showing strong performance on an unwritten setup is still relatively unique in speech translation papers.

- In addition to standard metrics like BLEU, the paper evaluates speaker similarity (ASV) and naturalness to show their model can preserve voice characteristics well. Assessing these prosodic/speaker aspects is an active area of research.

Overall, the key novelties seem to be the language model architectures for end-to-end speech translation and synthesis, the use of discrete units for unwritten languages, and the thorough evaluation. The results look promising and suggest this is a useful direction for speech translation compared to prior sequence-to-sequence style models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Investigating better ways to generate discrete units. The quality of the semantic units has a big impact on the overall system performance. The authors suggest exploring methods to generate more optimal sets of semantic units. 

- Using larger models. The authors point out that their system performance is highly dependent on model size. They suggest investigating how scaling up the models could further improve performance.

- Incorporating additional data types. The authors propose their framework could effectively utilize diverse data like unlabeled speech/text. They suggest exploring how to leverage different data sources.

- Improving translation quality. The semantic units lead to reduced translation accuracy compared to text. The authors suggest enhancing the extraction of semantic information from units to improve translation quality.

- Exploring model architectures. The authors show promise with the decoder-only architecture for translation. They suggest further exploring different model architectures and self-supervised pre-training approaches.

- Low-resource and unwritten languages. The authors highlight their model's potential for low-resource and unwritten langauges. They propose exploring these use cases more.

- Speaker style modeling. The authors note room for improvement in effectively capturing speaker style. They suggest investigating how to better preserve speaker vocal characteristics.

In summary, the main future directions are improving discrete units, using larger models, leveraging more data, boosting translation quality, exploring model architectures, and improving style modeling - especially for low-resource and unwritten languages.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper: 

The paper proposes LM4S2ST, a novel language model-based framework for speech-to-speech translation that can handle both written and unwritten languages. The framework utilizes discrete units obtained through self-supervised training (e.g. HuBERT) as an intermediate representation between the source and target speech. It consists of two components: 1) A speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) front-end that converts source speech to target language units using a cross-lingual language model (U-XLM), which is trained to generate target units given source units. 2) A unit-to-speech (U2S) back-end that converts target units to speech while preserving the source speaker's voice, using techniques like the VALL-E X system. Compared to previous work, LM4S2ST shows improved performance in terms of translation quality, speaker similarity and audio naturalness on Chinese-English and English-Spanish benchmarks. It also demonstrates the ability to handle unwritten target languages. The paper argues LM4S2ST has potential for practical systems due to its versatility, ability to leverage diverse datasets, and voice preservation capability.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel language model-based framework for speech-to-speech translation that can handle both written and unwritten languages. The framework consists of two components: a speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) front-end and a unit-to-speech (U2S) back-end. The S2UT component uses self-supervised methods like HuBERT to extract discrete semantic units from the source speech as an intermediate representation. A cross-lingual language model is trained to translate the source units to target units. The U2S component then synthesizes the target speech while preserving the speaking style of the source speaker using techniques similar to VALL-E X. 

The key advantages of this framework are its versatility in handling written and unwritten languages, its use of semantic units for representation, and its simplicity in leveraging diverse datasets by modifying prompts for the language model training. Experiments on Chinese-English and English-Spanish datasets demonstrate the system's ability to achieve high translation quality, naturalness and speaker similarity. The framework shows promise for advancing speech-to-speech translation research. Main future work involves generating better discrete units and scaling up the models.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel language model-based framework for speech-to-speech translation called \method that can handle both written and unwritten languages. The framework uses discrete units obtained through self-supervised training like HuBERT as an intermediate representation between the source and target speech. It consists of two components: a speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) front-end that converts the source speech into target language units, and a unit-to-speech (U2S) back-end that synthesizes the translated speech while preserving the source speaker's style. The S2UT component uses a cross-lingual language model called U-XLM that is trained to generate target language units from source language units using various data sources and prompts. The U2S component utilizes a unit-based language model called U-SLM to generate codec units retaining the source speaker's characteristics. A duration model is also used to predict durations for the target units. Together, the two language model components aim to perform high-quality speech-to-speech translation for both written and unwritten languages.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of speech-to-speech translation, with a focus on handling both written and unwritten languages and preserving the voice characteristics of the original speech. The key questions it seeks to address are:

- How can we develop a speech-to-speech translation system that can handle unwritten languages where textual transcripts are not available?

- How can we build a system that retains the voice characteristics and speaking style of the original speaker during translation?

- Can language models provide an effective framework for speech-to-speech translation compared to encoder-decoder models?

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel language model-based framework called PolyVoice for speech-to-speech translation. The key components it introduces are:

- A speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) front-end that converts speech to semantic units using an unsupervised unit extractor like HuBERT. This allows handling of unwritten languages.

- A unit-based cross-lingual language model (U-XLM) that translates between source and target language units using a decoder-only architecture.

- A unit-to-speech (U2S) back-end that converts target units to speech while preserving voice characteristics of original speaker.

- The ability to leverage diverse data sources like ASR, MT, speech using prompts.

So in summary, the key focus is on developing an end-to-end speech-to-speech translation system using language models that can handle unwritten languages and preserve voice characteristics. The proposed PolyVoice framework aims to address these open challenges.
