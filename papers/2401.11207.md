# [Unfair TOS: An Automated Approach using Customized BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11207)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Terms of Service (TOS) agreements often contain unfair clauses that limit companies' liability or allow them to unilaterally change terms. 
- Users frequently accept TOS without reading or understanding the implications.
- Existing methods for automatically detecting unfair clauses in TOS documents have limited performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using a fine-tuned Legal-BERT model combined with a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to automatically detect unfair clauses in TOS documents. 

Key Contributions:
- Achieves state-of-the-art results for unfair clause detection, with a macro F1-score of 0.922 on the binary unfair/fair classification task.
- Outperforms prior work on both binary classification and multi-label classification of specific unfair clause types like unilateral termination and limitation of liability. 
- Conducts comparative analysis to study the impact of different transformer models and methodologies. Fine-tuning is shown to outperform pre-training approaches.
- Makes code and detailed results publicly available to support further research.

In summary, the paper presents a Legal-BERT plus SVC approach for automated detection of unfair clauses in TOS that achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Detailed experiments compare transformer models and methodologies. The code and results are also released to advance work in this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents state-of-the-art results for automated detection of unfair clauses in terms of service documents by fine-tuning BERT language models and using them with support vector machine classifiers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting state-of-the-art results on unfair clause detection from terms of service (TOS) documents by integrating fine-tuned BERT with a support vector classifier (SVC). Specifically, the paper shows proficient performance in automatically detecting unfair clauses in TOS with a macro F1-score of 0.922, which surpasses prior work. The paper also performs a comparative analysis focused on different transformer models used to answer research questions about how performance fluctuates based on methodology and embedding modes.

The key highlights are:
- Achieving state-of-the-art results for unfair clause detection by fine-tuning BERT and using it with SVC
- Conducting comparative analysis to study impact of methods and embedding modes on transformer models
- Automating unfair clause detection to help users and businesses by identifying problematic terms in TOS

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a Legal-BERT model. Can you explain in more detail how this model differs from the original BERT model and why it is more suitable for detecting unfair clauses in legal documents? 

2. The paper utilizes a Fine-tune-base approach for Legal-BERT. Can you walk through the steps of this approach? What is the rationale behind only fine-tuning on the train set and not the full dataset?

3. The paper experiments with different methodologies like pre-training and fine-tuning. What are the key differences between these approaches? What are the computational and performance tradeoffs?

4. The paper uses a support vector classifier (SVC) after generating embeddings. Why was SVC chosen over other classifiers? What parameters and settings were tuned during the grid search? 

5. The paper calculates sentence embeddings using different modes that utilize mean/CLS tokens and different layers. Can you explain the difference between these modes and why modes 2 and 6 perform better for pre-trained models?

6. The paper achieves very high F1 scores, exceeding 0.92 for unfair clause detection. What are some possible reasons behind this significant performance gain compared to prior state-of-the-art results?

7. Can you analyze the confusion matrix for the top performing Legal-BERT fine-tune base model? What are some common reasons for false positives and false negatives?

8. The paper does not utilize the full dataset for fine-tuning to prevent data leakage. What techniques can be used to further increase the size of the train set in this scenario? 

9. What metrics were used for evaluating the performance on each unique unfair clause category? How do the results compare to overall binary classification?

10. The paper performs comparative analysis to answer two research questions. Can you summarize the key findings and insights gathered from this analysis? How can they be applied to other text classification tasks?
