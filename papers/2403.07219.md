# [Monocular Microscope to CT Registration using Pose Estimation of the   Incus for Augmented Reality Cochlear Implant Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07219)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Cochlear implant (CI) surgery relies on precise electrode array insertion into the cochlea which impacts hearing outcomes. Image guidance can improve placement but typically requires external tracking systems which are costly. 
- The goal is to develop a tracking method using only the monocular microscope camera to register pre-operative CT scans to the live microscope video for augmented reality guidance, without needing external trackers.

Proposed Solution:
- Identify the incus bone visible in the microscope view and map its visible surface to a standard coordinate system using geodesic distances. 
- Use a customized YOLOv8 network to detect and segment the incus in microscope images.
- Predict a color mapping of the visible incus surface using a UNet, representing latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Estimate 6D microscope pose by solving perspective-n-point (PnP) using predicted incus surface mappings.
- Apply estimated microscope pose to registered CT anatomy for augmentation.

Main Contributions:
- Surface coordinate mapping method for consistent mapping across patients, enabling category-level learning.
- Custom lightweight network tailored for heavy occlusion and cluttered surgical scenes.  
- Demonstration of feasible microscope tracking for AR guidance without external trackers, with average errors <25 deg rotation and <2mm translation.
- Potential for generalization to other surgeries with monocular microscope camera as only intra-operative imaging.

In summary, the key innovation is using only the microscope camera for microscope tracking/registration, by detecting and coordinate mapping the visible incus surface despite heavy occlusion, to estimate microscope pose via PnP. This could enable affordable AR guidance in CI and other surgeries.
