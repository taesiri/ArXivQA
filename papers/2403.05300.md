# [Unity by Diversity: Improved Representation Learning in Multimodal VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05300)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models for learning from multimodal data, which involves multiple modalities or views such as images, text, audio, etc. Existing multimodal VAEs impose hard constraints by sharing the encoder output, decoder input, or both across modalities to induce a shared latent representation. However, such hard sharing limits the flexibility of the model and leads to inferior results in terms of the quality and coherence of generated samples from the model. There is a need for more flexible approaches that balance modality-specific and shared information without overly restrictive assumptions.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a novel multimodal VAE called the Multimodal Variational Mixture-of-Experts (MM-VAMP) VAE. Instead of hard parameter sharing, the key idea is to use a data-dependent mixture-of-experts prior that softly guides each modality's latent representation towards an aggregate posterior computed over all modalities. This allows flexibility in balancing shared and private information. The resulting regularizer encourages similarity across modalities like in contrastive methods but retains independent encoders/decoders like autoencoders. 

The paper shows formally that the designed prior is optimal in minimizing the cross-entropy between the variational posterior and the prior. The resulting regularizer minimizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence between modality-specific posteriors, bringing them closer like positives in contrastive learning while retaining reconstruction objectives from autoencoders.

Contributions:
- A new way to share information across modalities in VAEs via a data-dependent mixture prior without restrictive aggregation assumptions
- Achieves improved coherence in conditional generation tasks by retaining more modality-specific details
- Demonstrates improved latent representations and generative performance over previous multimodal VAE methods on benchmark and real-world medical datasets
- Provides a principled information-sharing technique applicable to other multimodal representation learning methods

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in making multimodal VAEs more flexible and achieving superior quality through priors rather than restrictive posterior assumptions. The proposed MM-VAMP VAE advances multimodal deep generative models.
