# [Interactive Multi-Head Self-Attention with Linear Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17507)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) is a key component in vision transformers, where each head computes attention independently. However, there is no interaction between heads, limiting information flow. 
- Enabling cross-head interactions requires computing attention on the full matrix, which is computationally prohibitive due to its quadratic complexity.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose an interactive MHSA (iMHSA) method to facilitate cross-head interactions with linear complexity.
- Decompose attention into query- and key-less components to reduce matrix dimension. This allows cross-head interactions on the smaller matrices.
- Employ a reverse-order attention computation to further reduce matrix dimension.

Main Contributions:
- Propose iMHSA that enables efficient cross-head interactions in MHSA with linear complexity, enhancing information flow.
- Attention decomposition and reverse-order computation reduce matrix dimension to enable interaction layers.  
- iMHSA allows using MHSA with fewer resources on larger image sizes and earlier transformer stages.
- Propose interactive Vision Transformer (iViT) backbone leveraging iMHSA, achieving state-of-the-art results on image classification, detection and segmentation with high efficiency.
- Analyze benefits of cross-head interactions, showing performance gains with more heads and improved feature diversity.
- Qualitative visualization shows iMHSA captures better object boundaries than standard MHSA.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient way to enable cross-head interactions in MHSA to improve information flow, while reducing computational complexity. This facilitates better vision transformer designs, demonstrated through the proposed iViT backbone.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing an efficient interactive method for multi-head self-attention (iMHSA) that allows for cross-head interactions while maintaining linear computational complexity. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) A self-attention decomposition approach that splits the attention matrix into query- and key-less components to reduce the dimension and allow for efficient cross-head interactions.

2) A reverse-order attention computation strategy to further reduce the attention matrix dimension.

3) Applying cross-head interactions on the decomposed attention matrices to improve information flow between heads.

4) Introducing a new hierarchical vision transformer architecture called interactive Vision Transformer (iViT) that leverages the proposed iMHSA and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various visual recognition tasks with high efficiency.

In summary, the main contribution is developing an interactive and efficient multi-head self-attention mechanism to facilitate cross-head interactions and information flow in transformers, enabling strong performance on vision tasks. The decomposition and computation strategies are key to making the interactions computationally feasible.

The main focus of the paper is on proposing an efficient interactive method for multi-head self-attention via decomposition to allow cross-head interactions while maintaining linear complexity.

The iMHSA is used in a new CNN-Transformer hybrid backbone called iViT which obtains strong results on multiple vision tasks.
