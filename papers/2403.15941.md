# [Explore until Confident: Efficient Exploration for Embodied Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15941)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of Embodied Question Answering (EQA), where a robot needs to actively explore a 3D environment in order to gather enough information to answer a question confidently. Efficient exploration is challenging as scenes are complex and diverse, and robots lack prior maps. Recently, large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for EQA due to their reasoning skills, but they have limited memory and can be miscalibrated (over/under-confident) in their predictions.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a framework to enable efficient EQA by addressing the limitations of VLMs. First, to augment VLMs' limited memory, they build an external spatial semantic map that fuses global geometric information with local visual semantics from the VLM to guide exploration. Second, to address potential VLM miscalibration, they employ conformal prediction theory to rigorously quantify uncertainty and determine a calibrated stopping criterion for exploration.  

Main Contributions:
- A method to construct a semantic map using visual prompting of a VLM to obtain exploration preferences over the current view. This map guides exploration towards semantically relevant regions.
- A multi-step conformal prediction approach to calibrate VLM confidence for determining when to stop exploration and answer the question. This avoids under/over-exploration.  
- Experiments in simulation and on a real robot validate their approach over baselines, demonstrating improved exploration efficiency and question answering performance.
- Introduction of HM-EQA, a new embodied QA dataset based on the Habitat Matterport 3D dataset with realistic human-robot household scenarios.

In summary, the key innovation is in enabling efficient VLM-guided exploration for EQA via external spatial memory and uncertainty calibration. Experiments demonstrate clear benefits versus alternate exploration strategies and stopping criteria.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper: This paper proposes a method that leverages large vision-language models for efficient embodied question answering in 3D scenes, by fusing model reasoning into a mapping framework to guide exploration and using conformal prediction to determine when to stop.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a framework for efficient embodied question answering (EQA) that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs). The main contributions are:

1. A method to build a semantic map that fuses the semantic reasoning capabilities of VLMs with geometric information to guide efficient exploration. This addresses the challenge of VLMs having limited internal memory.

2. The use of multi-step conformal prediction to quantify the uncertainty of VLMs for determining when to stop exploration. This addresses the challenge of miscalibrated confidence from VLMs that can lead to under-exploration or over-exploration. 

3. Experiments in both simulation and on a real robot that demonstrate the proposed framework enables more efficient exploration compared to baselines without semantic guidance or confidence calibration.

4. A new EQA dataset called HM-EQA based on diverse, photo-realistic 3D scans that features more complex, open-ended questions compared to prior datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is an EQA framework that leverages VLMs for efficient exploration and quantifies their uncertainty for deciding when to stop, leading to improved performance over baselines. The new dataset also enables benchmarking EQA methods on more realistic and challenging scenarios.
