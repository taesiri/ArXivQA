# [Enhancing Molecular Property Prediction via Mixture of Collaborative   Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03292)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel architecture called GNN-MoCE for molecular property prediction (MPP) tasks. The model utilizes both graph neural networks (GNNs) as the encoder for capturing common molecular patterns and a mixture of collaborative experts (MoCE) structure as the predictor for establishing connections to diverse tasks. To enhance collaboration among experts, two methods are introduced - Expert-Specific Projection and Expert-Specific Loss. The former assigns each expert a unique projection perspective via learnable self-attention graph pooling parameters and an Attention Cosine Loss. This boosts expert diversity. The latter integrates individual expert loss into the group decision loss for more equitable training. Experiments conducted on 24 MPP datasets demonstrate superior performance, especially on tasks with limited data. Notably, by using natural language task descriptions, the model exhibits potential for zero-shot generalization to new tasks. The unified modeling of multiple MPP tasks allows GNN-MoCE to leverage relatedness among tasks. By enhancing collaboration among experts, it effectively extracts specific characteristics of each task.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Molecular Property Prediction (MPP) aims to predict biochemical properties of molecules based on their molecular graphs. MPP tasks face challenges like data scarcity and class imbalance. Existing methods use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as encoders to extract common molecular features, but use separate predictors for each task, neglecting shared traits among tasks.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes the GNN-Mixture of Collaborative Experts (GNN-MoCE) architecture with two key components - GNN encoder to capture common molecular patterns and Mixture of Experts (MoE) predictor to establish connections between molecules and tasks. 

To improve collaboration among experts, two methods are introduced:
1) Expert-Specific Projection: Assigns each expert a unique projection perspective for observing samples using self-attention graph pooling and attention cosine loss. This provides diverse inputs to experts.
2) Expert-Specific Loss: Integrates individual expert loss into group loss to ensure fairer training of experts in the decision group.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes GNN-MoCE architecture that utilizes both GNN and MoE to leverage molecular commonalities and task relationships.
2) Enhances MoE collaboration via Expert-Specific Projection and Loss for expert diversity and equitable group training.
3) Achieves superior performance over baselines on 24 MPP datasets, especially for limited/imbalanced data.
4) Model is easily extended to new tasks by modifying task descriptions, showing potential for out-of-distribution tasks.

In summary, the paper presents an effective GNN-MoE approach for MPP that focuses on improving collaboration among experts by providing expert diversity and balancing expert influence. The model shows strong performance on multiple MPP datasets.
