# [Enhancing Molecular Property Prediction via Mixture of Collaborative   Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03292)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel architecture called GNN-MoCE for molecular property prediction (MPP) tasks. The model utilizes both graph neural networks (GNNs) as the encoder for capturing common molecular patterns and a mixture of collaborative experts (MoCE) structure as the predictor for establishing connections to diverse tasks. To enhance collaboration among experts, two methods are introduced - Expert-Specific Projection and Expert-Specific Loss. The former assigns each expert a unique projection perspective via learnable self-attention graph pooling parameters and an Attention Cosine Loss. This boosts expert diversity. The latter integrates individual expert loss into the group decision loss for more equitable training. Experiments conducted on 24 MPP datasets demonstrate superior performance, especially on tasks with limited data. Notably, by using natural language task descriptions, the model exhibits potential for zero-shot generalization to new tasks. The unified modeling of multiple MPP tasks allows GNN-MoCE to leverage relatedness among tasks. By enhancing collaboration among experts, it effectively extracts specific characteristics of each task.
