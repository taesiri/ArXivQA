# [REST: Enhancing Group Robustness in DNNs through Reweighted Sparse   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03044)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) often struggle to perform well on certain minority groups of data, despite showing strong overall performance. This is because they tend to learn "bias attributes" from the majority groups that are spuriously correlated with the target variable.
- As a result, DNNs become biased towards these spurious correlations and perform poorly on out-of-distribution data from minority groups. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel reweighted sparse training (REST) framework to enhance DNN performance on biased datasets while improving efficiency. 
- REST utilizes sparse training techniques to identify compact subnetworks that avoid learning spurious correlations. This is done by pruning unimportant parameters during training.
- In addition, REST reweights the loss to focus more on minority groups and less on majority groups to reduce reliance on spurious correlations.  

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates that REST improves worst-group test error by 23-28% across 3 biased datasets compared to baselines.
- Shows 2-99% savings in FLOPs for inference/training while retaining accuracy.
- First work to apply sparse training to tackle bias problem rather than just model compression.
- REST trains sparse networks end-to-end unlike prior work that require costly dense pre-training.
- Analyzes impact of sparsity levels on debiasing performance.
- Demonstrates REST works across varying ratios of bias-conflicting data.

In summary, the key idea is that REST identifies sparse subnetworks that avoid capturing spurious correlations by training them directly with reweighting. This simultaneously enhances out-of-distribution performance and improves efficiency.
