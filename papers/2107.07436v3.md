# [FastSHAP: Real-Time Shapley Value Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07436v3)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is how to efficiently estimate Shapley values for explaining machine learning model predictions. Specifically, the paper introduces FastSHAP, a method to generate Shapley value explanations in a single forward pass using a learned explainer model. The key ideas are:- Shapley values provide theoretically appealing explanations for model predictions, but computing them exactly is intractable for large, high-dimensional models. Existing approximation methods are too slow. - The authors propose training an explainer model to directly output Shapley value estimates. This amortizes the cost across data points.- To enable efficient training without ground truth Shapley values, they derive a loss function based on the weighted least squares characterization of Shapley values. This allows optimizing the explainer via stochastic gradient descent.- Experiments on tabular and image data show FastSHAP generates accurate Shapley estimates with a significant speedup (orders of magnitude fewer model evaluations) compared to sampling-based approximations.In summary, the central hypothesis is that an explainer model trained with their proposed loss function can efficiently learn to estimate Shapley values accurately for explaining black-box model predictions. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis and characterize the speed/accuracy trade-off compared to other approximation methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The introduction of FastSHAP, a new method for efficiently estimating Shapley values by training an explainer model to output Shapley value estimates in a single forward pass. This avoids the need to re-estimate Shapley values from scratch for each sample.2. A training procedure for FastSHAP based on the weighted least squares characterization of Shapley values, which enables optimizing the explainer model parameters via stochastic gradient descent without requiring actual ground truth Shapley values.3. Empirical evaluation showing that FastSHAP can estimate Shapley values with high accuracy compared to sampling-based estimation approaches, while providing speedups of 200-2000x. Experiments also demonstrate FastSHAP's ability to generate high-quality image explanations.4. Theoretical analysis showing that under certain assumptions, the global minimizer of the proposed training objective will yield a model that outputs true Shapley values. Proofs are also provided for FastSHAP's gradient variance reduction techniques.In summary, the core contribution seems to be the proposal of FastSHAP as an efficient, amortized approach to estimate Shapley values by training an explainer model. The method avoids expensive re-estimation by using a custom training procedure, and experiments demonstrate its accuracy and significant speed gains compared to prior Shapley value approximation techniques.
