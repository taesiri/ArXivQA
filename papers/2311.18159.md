# [Compact3D: Compressing Gaussian Splat Radiance Field Models with Vector   Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18159)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a method called Compact3D to compress 3D Gaussian Splatting models for novel view synthesis. 3D Gaussian Splatting can render high-quality novel views faster than neural radiance fields (NeRF), but requires much more storage due to needing parameters for millions of 3D Gaussians per scene. The key idea is to use k-means vector quantization to cluster similar Gaussians and store only a compact codebook plus indices. Specifically, the color, scale, and rotation components of each Gaussian are quantized into separate codebooks with 4,016-32,768 codes learned using iterations interleaved with the main training. The Gaussians are sorted based on assignments so run-length encoding can further compress the indices. This compression achieves nearly 20Ã— smaller models than 3D Gaussian Splatting with minimal quality loss. Extensive experiments on standard datasets plus a new larger benchmark with 200 indoor scenes demonstrate the compression rate and maintained performance. The method retains the fast training and real-time rendering advantages of 3D Gaussian Splatting while reducing its much higher memory demand to be comparable with NeRF approaches, enabling applications to edge devices and VR/AR.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to compress 3D Gaussian Splatting models for novel view synthesis by using k-means vector quantization of the Gaussian parameters, reducing storage costs by up to 20x while maintaining image quality and real-time rendering capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a method to compress 3D Gaussian Splatting models for novel view synthesis. Specifically:

- They propose a vector quantization method using k-means to quantize the parameters of the Gaussians in the 3D Gaussian Splatting model. This allows sharing parameters across Gaussians, requiring storing only a small codebook and the indices. 

- They demonstrate their method, termed Compact3D or CompGS, reduces the storage requirements of 3D Gaussian Splatting by almost 20x while maintaining the image quality and real-time rendering capability.

- They introduce a new large-scale benchmark for novel view synthesis using 200 scenes from the ARKit dataset, which is an order of magnitude larger than standard benchmarks. They show CompGS maintains performance on this challenging dataset while other baselines struggle.

In summary, the key contribution is an effective way to compress 3D Gaussian Splatting scene representations to reduce storage and memory requirements while retaining the advantages of quality, speed, and editability compared to other scene representation methods.

The paper introduces a method called "Compact3D" to compress 3D Gaussian splat radiance field models using vector quantization. It builds on the 3D Gaussian splatting method for novel view synthesis and aims to reduce its storage requirements while maintaining rendering quality and speed. The key ideas involve using k-means to cluster similar Gaussian parameters, storing them as a codebook, and representing each Gaussian with the codebook index. Additional compression techniques like run-length encoding of indices are also used. The method is evaluated on standard novel view synthesis benchmarks as well as a new large-scale dataset called ARKit.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using k-means clustering to quantize the Gaussian parameters. Why was k-means chosen over other clustering algorithms like gaussian mixture models? How sensitive is the performance to the choice of clustering algorithm?

2. The paper sorts the Gaussians based on cluster assignments and uses run-length encoding on the indices. What is the storage reduction achieved by this? How does it affect the rendering efficiency?

3. The method updates cluster assignments periodically instead of every iteration to reduce compute costs. How does the frequency of assignment updates affect model compression and rendering quality? 

4. Could iterative clustering methods that update clusters incrementally be employed instead of k-means? Would that improve training efficiency? How may it impact compression rate?

5. What is the effect of codebook size on rendering quality, training time and model compression? Is there an optimal codebook size that balances these factors?

6. The method quantizes different components like color, scale, rotation separately. How do the reconstruction errors vary for quantization of these individual components?

7. Could other lossy compression techniques like autoencoders be applied instead of k-means VQ? Would it provide better compression or quality?

8. The paper introduced a new large-scale benchmark using the ARKit dataset. What are its unique characteristics compared to existing small datasets? How do the results compare?

9. The method achieves 20x compression on Gaussian parameters. Since positions are not compressed, what is the scope for further compression? Could positions be quantized or compressed as well?

10. The paper stores multiple codebook indices per Gaussian. Could indices be combined into one via product quantization? Would that improve compression rate and how may it affect rendering?
