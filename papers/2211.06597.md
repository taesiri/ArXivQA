# [OpenGait: Revisiting Gait Recognition Toward Better Practicality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06597)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: how to develop a gait recognition system that performs robustly in real-world outdoor environments? The key points are:- Existing gait recognition methods perform well on indoor datasets but struggle when applied to outdoor datasets, suffering significant performance drops. - The authors identify several potential issues with prior research: over-reliance on indoor datasets, lack of comprehensive ablation studies, and use of weak backbone networks.- To address these concerns, the authors develop OpenGait, a flexible codebase for gait recognition that supports various methods, frameworks, and datasets.- Using OpenGait, the authors re-implement and re-evaluate several recent gait recognition techniques. Their experiments reveal limitations of some prior model components designed on indoor data.- Drawing insights from their analysis, the authors propose GaitBase, a simple yet powerful baseline model for gait recognition. - Experiments show GaitBase achieves state-of-the-art performance on outdoor datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness for real-world gait recognition.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a gait recognition system needs to be re-designed with a focus on outdoor robustness rather than just indoor performance. The OpenGait codebase and GaitBase model are presented as solutions toward this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It presents OpenGait, a flexible PyTorch-based codebase for deep gait recognition, which supports various datasets, frameworks, state-of-the-art methods, and evaluation protocols. 2. It revisits recent gait recognition methods by re-implementing them in OpenGait and conducting comprehensive ablation studies. Through this process, it identifies some limitations of prior work, such as overreliance on indoor datasets like CASIA-B.3. It proposes GaitBase, a simple yet strong baseline model for gait recognition. GaitBase uses standard modules like ResNet backbone, temporal/horizontal pooling, triplet loss etc. But it achieves state-of-the-art results on major outdoor datasets like GREW and Gait3D, outperforming more complex prior models.In summary, the key contribution is providing the community with OpenGait codebase, insights from revisiting prior work, and the strong GaitBase baseline - to advance gait recognition research towards better practicality and performance in real-world conditions. The paper aims to lay a solid foundation to build better gait recognition systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes OpenGait, a flexible and unified codebase for gait recognition research, re-evaluates various methods to gain new insights, and presents GaitBase, a simple yet powerful baseline model that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of gait recognition:- The paper introduces OpenGait, a new codebase for gait recognition research. This is useful for the field as it provides a shared platform for implementing and comparing different methods. Other landmark codebases like MMDetection for object detection have benefited their research areas greatly.  - The paper comprehensively evaluates several recent gait recognition methods on multiple datasets, including newer outdoor datasets like GREW and Gait3D. This analysis provides new insights compared to what was reported in the original papers, showing some methods are less robust when evaluated on outdoor data. - The proposed GaitBase model achieves new state-of-the-art results on outdoor datasets, outperforming prior works by large margins. This suggests current gait recognition research needs to focus more on tackling challenges posed by uncontrolled outdoor settings.- The paper advocates for the importance of studying gait recognition in the wild, moving beyond controlled indoor datasets like CASIA-B. This echoes the general shift in computer vision from lab to real-world settings.- The paper argues for the need for stronger baseline models before incorporating complex modules tailored for particular datasets. Simple yet strong baselines like GaitBase can reveal limitations of current approaches and avoid dataset overfitting.Overall, by providing OpenGait and GaitBase, as well as critically revisiting recent progress, this paper makes important contributions to advancing gait recognition research towards real-world applicability and robustness. The analysis and insights will be valuable for guiding future work in this area.
