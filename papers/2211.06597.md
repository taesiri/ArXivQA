# [OpenGait: Revisiting Gait Recognition Toward Better Practicality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06597)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: how to develop a gait recognition system that performs robustly in real-world outdoor environments? The key points are:- Existing gait recognition methods perform well on indoor datasets but struggle when applied to outdoor datasets, suffering significant performance drops. - The authors identify several potential issues with prior research: over-reliance on indoor datasets, lack of comprehensive ablation studies, and use of weak backbone networks.- To address these concerns, the authors develop OpenGait, a flexible codebase for gait recognition that supports various methods, frameworks, and datasets.- Using OpenGait, the authors re-implement and re-evaluate several recent gait recognition techniques. Their experiments reveal limitations of some prior model components designed on indoor data.- Drawing insights from their analysis, the authors propose GaitBase, a simple yet powerful baseline model for gait recognition. - Experiments show GaitBase achieves state-of-the-art performance on outdoor datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness for real-world gait recognition.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a gait recognition system needs to be re-designed with a focus on outdoor robustness rather than just indoor performance. The OpenGait codebase and GaitBase model are presented as solutions toward this goal.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of gait recognition:- The paper introduces OpenGait, a new codebase for gait recognition research. This is useful for the field as it provides a shared platform for implementing and comparing different methods. Other landmark codebases like MMDetection for object detection have benefited their research areas greatly.  - The paper comprehensively evaluates several recent gait recognition methods on multiple datasets, including newer outdoor datasets like GREW and Gait3D. This analysis provides new insights compared to what was reported in the original papers, showing some methods are less robust when evaluated on outdoor data. - The proposed GaitBase model achieves new state-of-the-art results on outdoor datasets, outperforming prior works by large margins. This suggests current gait recognition research needs to focus more on tackling challenges posed by uncontrolled outdoor settings.- The paper advocates for the importance of studying gait recognition in the wild, moving beyond controlled indoor datasets like CASIA-B. This echoes the general shift in computer vision from lab to real-world settings.- The paper argues for the need for stronger baseline models before incorporating complex modules tailored for particular datasets. Simple yet strong baselines like GaitBase can reveal limitations of current approaches and avoid dataset overfitting.Overall, by providing OpenGait and GaitBase, as well as critically revisiting recent progress, this paper makes important contributions to advancing gait recognition research towards real-world applicability and robustness. The analysis and insights will be valuable for guiding future work in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest the following potential future research directions:1. Focusing more on the gait verification task instead of just the identification/retrieval task. Developing robust methods to reduce intra-class distances for verification despite changes in clothing, viewpoint, etc.2. Developing stronger baseline models, such as transformer-based models, to improve performance on complex outdoor datasets. The current baseline model still has room for improvement in accuracy.3. Exploring unsupervised gait recognition by learning general identity representations from unlabeled walking videos. This can help address the challenges of expensive labeled data collection and limited diversity in existing datasets.4. Paying more attention to gait recognition research and evaluation using outdoor datasets rather than just indoor lab datasets. Many conclusions drawn from indoor datasets do not transfer well to complex real-world conditions.5. Continuing to develop the OpenGait codebase with more methods, datasets, and capabilities to promote fair comparisons and reproducible research.In summary, the main future directions are developing more robust gait verification methods, stronger models to handle wild/unconstrained data, exploiting unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner, emphasizing outdoor datasets over indoor ones, and further extending the OpenGait platform. The goal is to advance gait recognition research towards real-world applications.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a simple yet strong baseline model for gait recognition called GaitBase. GaitBase utilizes a ResNet-like backbone network to extract spatial features from input gait silhouettes. It treats the gait sequence as a set and performs temporal pooling by taking the maximum across the temporal dimension to obtain a set-level representation. The set-level feature maps are divided horizontally into parts which are pooled into vectors and mapped to the metric space using fully-connected layers. The training uses both triplet and cross-entropy losses. For data augmentation, the paper explores several spatial transformations like flipping, rotation, perspective transform, etc. which are found to be effective especially for outdoor datasets. The model does not use any complex custom modules but still achieves state-of-the-art results on major gait datasets, showing its effectiveness as a simple yet strong baseline. The paper also provides insights from re-evaluating prior gait recognition methods on newer outdoor datasets.
