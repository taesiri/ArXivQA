# [Multilingual Visual Speech Recognition with a Single Model by Learning   with Discrete Visual Speech Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09802)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Visual speech recognition (VSR) has lagged behind audio speech recognition, especially for non-English languages. Two main challenges are: 1) High dimensionality of visual data leads to huge computational costs for training large-scale multilingual models, 2) Lack of labeled visual speech data compared to audio.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce "visual speech units", which are discrete representations obtained by quantizing visual speech features from a self-supervised model (mAV-HuBERT). This greatly reduces data size and enables more efficient training.

- Pre-train a Transformer encoder-decoder model to translate visual speech units to text in a discrete, unit-to-unit manner. Use curriculum learning strategy that starts with audio-visual inputs and progressively masks the audio over time.

- Finetune on continuous visual features to maximize VSR performance. Evaluate on 5 languages - English, Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese.

Main Contributions:

- First work exploring multilingual sentence-level VSR with a single model
- Propose using visual speech units for efficient modeling of multilingual visual speech
- Train mAV-HuBERT on 9 languages and 5512 hours of data to extract units capturing multilingual visemes  
- Unit-to-unit pre-training with curriculum learning from audio-visual to visual greatly speeds up training
- Achieve SOTA results on multilingual VSR, outperforming prior language-specific models on 3 out of 5 languages with a single model

The key idea is using discrete visual speech units allows more efficient training for multilingual VSR while maintaining performance through pre-training strategies. Curriculum learning and finetuning boost overall accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multilingual visual speech recognition method using visual speech units extracted from a self-supervised multilingual audio-visual model, enabling efficient training of a single model for multiple languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) This is the first work exploring sentence-level multilingual visual speech recognition (VSR) with a single trained model that can recognize multiple languages.

2) The paper proposes to use visual speech units, which are quantized representations of visual speech features extracted from a self-supervised speech model. This allows greatly reducing the data size and accelerating the training.

3) A multilingual audio-visual BERT model (mAV-HuBERT) is trained on over 5,500 hours of multilingual audio-visual data to extract visual speech units containing multilingual viseme information. 

4) A curriculum learning strategy is proposed that progressively transitions the inputs from audio-visual speech units to only visual speech units during pre-training. This complements the visual information with audio and helps optimization.

5) The model achieves new state-of-the-art results in multilingual VSR and comparable performance to previous best monolingual VSR models, using a single trained multilingual model. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed strategies for multilingual VSR.

In summary, the main contribution is the first exploration of multilingual VSR with a single model, enabled by proposing visual speech units and an effective training strategy.

The paper explores multilingual visual speech recognition, specifically sentence-level VSR, with a single model. Key ideas include using visual speech units to reduce computational costs, pre-training the model with discrete inputs/outputs for efficiency, using curriculum learning starting with audio-visual inputs, and leveraging automatically labeled data to increase training data. The proposed mAV-HuBERT model extracts multilingual visual speech units, and these units are used to pre-train a Transformer encoder-decoder model to translate between discrete visual speech inputs and text outputs. After pre-training, the model is finetuned on continuous features for VSR. Experiments show state-of-the-art multilingual VSR results with a single model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using "visual speech units" for multilingual visual speech recognition. What are visual speech units and how are they obtained? What are the advantages of using visual speech units over raw visual features?

2. The paper trains a multilingual Audio-Visual Hidden Unit BERT (mAV-HuBERT) model on over 5,000 hours of multilingual audio-visual data. Why is mAV-HuBERT needed instead of just using the original AV-HuBERT model? What languages are included in the multilingual training data?

3. The paper performs a unit-to-unit translation task for pre-training, where the inputs are visual speech units and outputs are text. Why is this pre-training helpful? What techniques are used during pre-training to improve performance, like curriculum learning?

4. How exactly does the curriculum learning work during pre-training? How are audio speech units incorporated initially and then masked out? What is the motivation behind this curriculum strategy?  

5. The paper analyzes the characteristics captured by the visual speech units, like phonetic content and speaker information suppression. What experiments are conducted to analyze this and what do the results show?

6. What is the overall architecture of the model used for the visual speech unit to text translation task? How many transformer encoder and decoder layers are used? What are the key hyperparameters like dimension sizes?

7. The model is later fine-tuned on continuous visual features instead of visual speech units. Why is this finetuning on raw features needed to boost performance after pre-training on units? How are the visual features incorporated at this stage?

8. How does the proposed method compare to training a single multilingual AV-HuBERT baseline? What overall performance gains are achieved across languages? Are there any languages where the baseline performs better?

9. The paper compares to multiple state-of-the-art monolingual VSR methods. How competitive is the single multilingual model compared to these individual language-specific models? In which languages does it achieve the best performance?

10. What are some possibilities for future work to build on this multilingual VSR approach? For example, how could the model scale and performance be improved with more data or model capacity?
