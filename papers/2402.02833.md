# [Behavior Tree Capabilities for Dynamic Multi-Robot Task Allocation with   Heterogeneous Robot Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02833)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Controlling teams of heterogeneous robots to cooperatively execute missions is challenging. There is a need for methods to conveniently model robot skills, match them to tasks, and dynamically allocate tasks at runtime based on current team composition and environmental conditions.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose an extension to their ros_bt_py Behavior Tree framework to introduce "Capabilities". Capabilities abstract robot skills into reusable BT nodes with defined inputs and outputs.
- Capability Implementations encapsulate the concrete BT that executes a skill on a specific robot. This allows skills to be used across heterogeneous robots.
- A Capability Assignment System handles dynamic allocation of Capability instances to suitable Capability Implementations at runtime via auctions. This allows adapting to changes in team composition or task priorities.
- Modelling of preconditions and input/output bridges enables checking feasibility and passing data across system boundaries during allocation.

Main Contributions:
- Formal definition of BT Capabilities and their binding to runtime Implementations on specific robots
- Decentralized architecture for capability-based task allocation via auctions during execution
- Demonstrated feasibility through simulated heterogeneous robot team performing a find-and-retrieve mission
- Improved flexibility and reusability compared to manual task allocation approaches
- Framework extension to enable future skill learning by transferring capabilities between robots

The authors' ros_bt_py framework with the proposed Capabilities concept allows intuitive modelling of multi-robot missions, while dynamically assigning tasks based on the robots' capabilities. This improves coordination of heterogeneous teams by matching skills to tasks without requiring central control. The concepts show promise to enable more flexible ad-hoc multi-robot collaboration.
