# [On the Limitations of Multimodal VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04121)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) that use modality sub-sampling during training are fundamentally limited in their ability to accurately model the joint distribution of multiple modalities. 

Specifically, the paper argues that modality sub-sampling, where only a subset of modalities is used to train the inference network during each training step, places an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal evidence lower bound (ELBO). This prevents the model from tightly approximating the true joint distribution when there is modality-specific variation in the data.

The key contributions of the paper are:

- A theoretical analysis proving that modality sub-sampling introduces an irreducible discrepancy in the multimodal ELBO that depends on the amount of modality-specific information.

- Empirical validation of this discrepancy on both synthetic and real multimodal datasets, showing a gap in generative quality compared to unimodal VAEs.

- Demonstrating a tradeoff between generative quality and coherence when modality sub-sampling is used, revealing limitations of existing multimodal VAE methods.

Overall, the central hypothesis is that sub-sampling modalities fundamentally limits the ability of multimodal VAEs to accurately model joint distributions, especially in the presence of modality-specific variation. The theoretical and empirical results support this claim.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is identifying and analyzing limitations of multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs). Specifically:

- The paper uncovers a fundamental limitation that applies to a large family of mixture-based multimodal VAEs. It proves that modality sub-sampling enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO that limits the generative quality of these models.

- Empirically, the paper showcases the generative quality gap compared to unimodal VAEs on both synthetic and real datasets. It presents tradeoffs between different variants of multimodal VAEs. 

- The paper finds that none of the existing approaches fulfills all desired criteria of an effective multimodal generative model when applied to more complex datasets than previous benchmarks. 

- Overall, the paper identifies, formalizes, and validates fundamental limitations of VAE-based approaches for modeling weakly-supervised multimodal data. It discusses implications for real-world applications.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be a theoretical and empirical analysis of limitations of multimodal VAEs, especially relating to modality sub-sampling and performance on complex real-world datasets. The paper uncovers tradeoffs between different variants of multimodal VAEs and highlights open challenges for developing more effective multimodal generative models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper identifies and formally proves limitations of a family of multimodal variational autoencoders, showing that subsampling modalities during training enforces an upper bound on the approximation of the joint distribution that prevents them from accurately modeling complex multimodal data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs):

- This paper identifies and proves a fundamental limitation with the generative quality of a family of mixture-based multimodal VAEs, including the MMVAE and MoPoE-VAE models. Prior work had observed that multimodal VAEs tend to underperform compared to unimodal VAEs, but this provides a theoretical explanation. 

- The paper formally shows that modality subsampling, which is used in mixture-based models for computational efficiency, enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO. This limits the tightness of the variational approximation to the true joint distribution.

- Through experiments on synthetic and real datasets, the paper demonstrates the tradeoff between generative quality and coherence faced by different multimodal VAE variants. It shows that none of the existing approaches excel on both criteria, especially for more complex data.

- This analysis is novel in rigorously studying the approximations made in mixture-based multimodal VAEs and their effects on generative performance. Prior work had evaluated VAE variants empirically but lacked this theoretical treatment.

- The paper introduces a new Translated-PolyMNIST dataset for a controlled study of what happens when shared information cannot be predicted in expectation across modalities.

- Compared to other types of multimodal generative models like GANs or autoregressive models, this provides a focused analysis of limitations in the VAE family for weakly supervised learning.

In summary, this paper advances understanding of multimodal VAEs through formal theoretical analysis plus comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the practical effects of model approximations. It clearly exposes tradeoffs faced by existing approaches. This sets the stage for developing improved VAE-based models for multimodal learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing new evaluation metrics for generative coherence that can be applied when ground truth labels on shared factors are not available. The authors note limitations in evaluating coherence on complex datasets like CUB where shared factors are not annotated. They suggest designing metrics that could measure coherence without relying on ground truth labels.

- Considering out-of-distribution generalization performance in addition to generative quality and coherence. The authors argue that good in-distribution coherence does not necessarily imply good out-of-distribution generalization. Evaluating models on out-of-distribution generalization could reveal more about their capabilities.

- Combining modality sub-sampling with modality-specific context to potentially circumvent the limitations of cross-modal prediction. The authors suggest providing context from the target modalities during decoding could help predict modality-specific details more accurately.

- Developing alternative objectives that do not require exact prediction of modality-specific details. The strict requirement of reconstructing all details limits current VAEs. More flexible objectives that don't penalize imperfect modality-specific predictions could help.

- Creating more challenging benchmark datasets where the generative discrepancy can be quantitatively measured. The authors suggest simulating datasets where the amount of modality-specific variation can be precisely controlled.

- Comparing models across a range hyperparameter settings to better reveal tradeoffs between coherence and quality. The limitations become more apparent when models are evaluated comprehensively.

In summary, the authors highlight the need for better evaluation methods, objectives, datasets, and model comparisons to push multimodal VAE research forward given the limitations identified. Developing capabilities like out-of-distribution generalization is also emphasized.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper identifies and formalizes limitations of multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) when modeling weakly-supervised multimodal data. The authors prove that a large family of mixture-based multimodal VAEs, including the MMVAE, MoPoE-VAE, and a special case of MVAE, are fundamentally limited by modality sub-sampling. Specifically, they show that sub-sampling enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO that limits the generative quality of these models. This is because sub-sampling prevents the recovery of modality-specific information through cross-modal prediction. 

The authors support their theoretical results with experiments on synthetic and real datasets. They empirically demonstrate the generative quality gap between unimodal and mixture-based multimodal VAEs. Further, they highlight tradeoffs between models, showing that none of the existing approaches fulfills all desired criteria of an effective multimodal generative model. Overall, their analysis reveals serious limitations of current VAE-based approaches for weakly-supervised multimodal modeling when there is high modality-specific variation. The results have important implications for model selection and generalization to more complex real-world datasets.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a family of mixture-based multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) for modeling weakly-supervised multimodal data. These models decompose the joint encoder as a mixture distribution over different subsets of modalities. As a result, they subsample modalities during training by only using a subset of modalities to reconstruct the full set of modalities. The main models that fall under this framework are the MMVAE, MoPoE-VAE, and a special case of the MVAE without ELBO subsampling. The key limitation identified is that modality subsampling enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO that depends on the amount of modality-specific variation in the data. This prevents the models from tightly approximating the joint distribution. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the resulting gap in generative quality compared to unimodal VAEs. Overall, the paper formalizes limitations of VAE-based approaches for weakly-supervised multimodal modeling when there is substantial modality-specific variation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is investigating why multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) consistently underperform compared to unimodal VAEs in terms of generative quality, despite the advantage of weak supervision from multiple modalities. 

- The authors uncover a fundamental limitation that applies to a large family of "mixture-based" multimodal VAEs, including models like MMVAE, MoPoE-VAE, and a version of MVAE without ELBO subsampling. 

- They prove that the subsampling of modalities during training enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO. This prevents a tight approximation of the joint distribution when there is modality-specific variation in the data.

- Empirically, they demonstrate the generative quality gap on synthetic and real datasets. They also show the tradeoff between different variants of multimodal VAEs in terms of generative quality vs generative coherence.

- On more complex datasets than previous benchmarks, none of the existing approaches fulfills all desired criteria for an effective multimodal generative model.

In summary, the key question is - why do multimodal VAEs underperform unimodal VAEs in generative quality? The authors identify and validate limitations of current VAE-based approaches for weakly supervised multimodal modeling.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reading the paper, some key terms and concepts that stand out are:

- Multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs): The paper focuses on multimodal VAEs, which are extensions of VAEs that can model multiple modalities of data (e.g. images and text) jointly. 

- Generative quality: The paper investigates limitations in the generative quality of multimodal VAEs compared to unimodal VAEs. Generative quality refers to how realistic/high-quality the samples are from the generative model.

- Generative coherence: Another desired criteria for multimodal VAEs is generative coherence, which measures if the model can generate semantically aligned samples across different modalities. 

- Mixture-based multimodal VAEs: The paper defines a family of mixture-based multimodal VAEs that use a mixture distribution over subsets of modalities in the encoder. This includes models like the MMVAE, MoPoE-VAE, and a version of MVAE.

- Modality sub-sampling: A key characteristic of mixture-based multimodal VAEs is that they subsample modalities during training, only using a subset of modalities for each encoder/decoder. 

- Irreducible error: A main theoretical contribution is showing there is an irreducible error or discrepancy that limits mixture-based VAEs due to modality sub-sampling, especially in the presence of modality-specific variation.

- Tradeoffs: The paper demonstrates tradeoffs empirically between generative quality and coherence for different multimodal VAE variants on both synthetic and real datasets.

So in summary, key ideas revolve around limitations of multimodal VAEs, the concept of an irreducible error due to modality sub-sampling, and tradeoffs between desired criteria like quality and coherence.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper uncovers fundamental limitations of multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) that use a mixture-based approach for modeling weakly-supervised multimodal data. The authors prove that the sub-sampling of modalities, which is inherent to mixture-based approaches like the MMVAE and MoPoE-VAE, enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO. This prevents a tight approximation of the joint distribution when there is modality-specific variation in the data, which is typical of real-world multimodal datasets. Through experiments on synthetic and real datasets, the authors demonstrate a significant generative quality gap compared to unimodal VAEs that increases with more modalities. Further, they reveal tradeoffs between generative quality and coherence, with neither fully satisfied by current methods when applied to more complex datasets than previous benchmarks. Overall, the results provide strong evidence that the sub-sampling of modalities fundamentally limits existing mixture-based multimodal VAEs. The authors suggest that future work should explore alternatives that do not require exact cross-modal prediction, as well as incorporate modality-specific context to enable modeling of non-shared information. Their analysis and empirical results raise important questions about the utility of current VAE-based approaches for multimodal learning on real-world datasets.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper uncovers fundamental limitations that affect a large family of mixture-based multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs). The authors prove that the sub-sampling of modalities during training, which is characteristic of these models, enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal evidence lower bound (ELBO). This prevents the models from tightly approximating the true joint distribution over modalities, especially in the presence of modality-specific variation. Through experiments on synthetic and real datasets, the authors empirically validate the theoretical limitations. They demonstrate a gap in generative quality between unimodal VAEs and multimodal VAEs that subsample modalities during training. Further, they show cases where none of the existing multimodal VAE variants achieves the desired criteria of high quality and coherent cross-modal generation. Overall, the paper provides a theoretical explanation for the limited generative performance of an important family of weakly supervised multimodal models, and reveals fundamental tradeoffs between different modeling objectives. The results have significant implications for the development of more effective multimodal generative models.
