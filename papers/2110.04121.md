# [On the Limitations of Multimodal VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04121)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) that use modality sub-sampling during training are fundamentally limited in their ability to accurately model the joint distribution of multiple modalities. Specifically, the paper argues that modality sub-sampling, where only a subset of modalities is used to train the inference network during each training step, places an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal evidence lower bound (ELBO). This prevents the model from tightly approximating the true joint distribution when there is modality-specific variation in the data.The key contributions of the paper are:- A theoretical analysis proving that modality sub-sampling introduces an irreducible discrepancy in the multimodal ELBO that depends on the amount of modality-specific information.- Empirical validation of this discrepancy on both synthetic and real multimodal datasets, showing a gap in generative quality compared to unimodal VAEs.- Demonstrating a tradeoff between generative quality and coherence when modality sub-sampling is used, revealing limitations of existing multimodal VAE methods.Overall, the central hypothesis is that sub-sampling modalities fundamentally limits the ability of multimodal VAEs to accurately model joint distributions, especially in the presence of modality-specific variation. The theoretical and empirical results support this claim.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs):- This paper identifies and proves a fundamental limitation with the generative quality of a family of mixture-based multimodal VAEs, including the MMVAE and MoPoE-VAE models. Prior work had observed that multimodal VAEs tend to underperform compared to unimodal VAEs, but this provides a theoretical explanation. - The paper formally shows that modality subsampling, which is used in mixture-based models for computational efficiency, enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO. This limits the tightness of the variational approximation to the true joint distribution.- Through experiments on synthetic and real datasets, the paper demonstrates the tradeoff between generative quality and coherence faced by different multimodal VAE variants. It shows that none of the existing approaches excel on both criteria, especially for more complex data.- This analysis is novel in rigorously studying the approximations made in mixture-based multimodal VAEs and their effects on generative performance. Prior work had evaluated VAE variants empirically but lacked this theoretical treatment.- The paper introduces a new Translated-PolyMNIST dataset for a controlled study of what happens when shared information cannot be predicted in expectation across modalities.- Compared to other types of multimodal generative models like GANs or autoregressive models, this provides a focused analysis of limitations in the VAE family for weakly supervised learning.In summary, this paper advances understanding of multimodal VAEs through formal theoretical analysis plus comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the practical effects of model approximations. It clearly exposes tradeoffs faced by existing approaches. This sets the stage for developing improved VAE-based models for multimodal learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:- Developing new evaluation metrics for generative coherence that can be applied when ground truth labels on shared factors are not available. The authors note limitations in evaluating coherence on complex datasets like CUB where shared factors are not annotated. They suggest designing metrics that could measure coherence without relying on ground truth labels.- Considering out-of-distribution generalization performance in addition to generative quality and coherence. The authors argue that good in-distribution coherence does not necessarily imply good out-of-distribution generalization. Evaluating models on out-of-distribution generalization could reveal more about their capabilities.- Combining modality sub-sampling with modality-specific context to potentially circumvent the limitations of cross-modal prediction. The authors suggest providing context from the target modalities during decoding could help predict modality-specific details more accurately.- Developing alternative objectives that do not require exact prediction of modality-specific details. The strict requirement of reconstructing all details limits current VAEs. More flexible objectives that don't penalize imperfect modality-specific predictions could help.- Creating more challenging benchmark datasets where the generative discrepancy can be quantitatively measured. The authors suggest simulating datasets where the amount of modality-specific variation can be precisely controlled.- Comparing models across a range hyperparameter settings to better reveal tradeoffs between coherence and quality. The limitations become more apparent when models are evaluated comprehensively.In summary, the authors highlight the need for better evaluation methods, objectives, datasets, and model comparisons to push multimodal VAE research forward given the limitations identified. Developing capabilities like out-of-distribution generalization is also emphasized.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper identifies and formalizes fundamental limitations of multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs). The authors prove that mixture-based multimodal VAEs, including models like the MMVAE and MoPoE-VAE, are limited in their ability to accurately model the joint distribution over multiple modalities due to modality sub-sampling during training. In particular, they show that modality sub-sampling enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal evidence lower bound (ELBO) that prevents a tight approximation of the joint distribution when there is modality-specific variation in the data. Through experiments on synthetic and real datasets, the authors demonstrate empirically that mixture-based multimodal VAEs exhibit a gap in generative quality compared to unimodal VAEs. They also find that none of the existing approaches, including models without sub-sampling, fulfill all desired criteria of an effective multimodal generative model when applied to more complex datasets. Overall, the work identifies fundamental tradeoffs between different types of multimodal VAEs and reveals limitations of existing approaches, especially when modeling data with significant modality-specific variation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper identifies and formalizes limitations of multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) when modeling weakly-supervised multimodal data. The authors prove that a large family of mixture-based multimodal VAEs, including the MMVAE, MoPoE-VAE, and a special case of MVAE, are fundamentally limited by modality sub-sampling. Specifically, they show that sub-sampling enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO that limits the generative quality of these models. This is because sub-sampling prevents the recovery of modality-specific information through cross-modal prediction. The authors support their theoretical results with experiments on synthetic and real datasets. They empirically demonstrate the generative quality gap between unimodal and mixture-based multimodal VAEs. Further, they highlight tradeoffs between models, showing that none of the existing approaches fulfills all desired criteria of an effective multimodal generative model. Overall, their analysis reveals serious limitations of current VAE-based approaches for weakly-supervised multimodal modeling when there is high modality-specific variation. The results have important implications for model selection and generalization to more complex real-world datasets.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a family of mixture-based multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) for modeling weakly-supervised multimodal data. These models decompose the joint encoder as a mixture distribution over different subsets of modalities. As a result, they subsample modalities during training by only using a subset of modalities to reconstruct the full set of modalities. The main models that fall under this framework are the MMVAE, MoPoE-VAE, and a special case of the MVAE without ELBO subsampling. The key limitation identified is that modality subsampling enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO that depends on the amount of modality-specific variation in the data. This prevents the models from tightly approximating the joint distribution. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the resulting gap in generative quality compared to unimodal VAEs. Overall, the paper formalizes limitations of VAE-based approaches for weakly-supervised multimodal modeling when there is substantial modality-specific variation.

The authors identify and validate limitations of current VAE-based approaches for weakly supervised multimodal modeling.
