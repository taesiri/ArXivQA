# [Anti-DreamBooth: Protecting users from personalized text-to-image   synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15433)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we protect users from the potential misuse of personalized text-to-image synthesis models like DreamBooth to generate fake or harmful images? 

The key hypothesis is that by adding imperceptible adversarial noise to users' images before publishing them, any DreamBooth model trained on those perturbed images will fail to generate high-quality personalized outputs.

In particular, the paper proposes an "Anti-DreamBooth" system that optimizes subtle perturbation noise to be added to each user's images. The noise is designed to disrupt the finetuning and generation process of DreamBooth models in various ways, such as causing distorted outputs or identity mismatches. 

The central goal is to verify the effectiveness of different adversarial noise generation algorithms in defending real users against personalized DeepFake generation from their photos, even under settings where the defense has limited or no knowledge of the target model's architecture or training process.

Overall, this paper aims to investigate and validate the hypothesis that adversarial image perturbation can be an effective approach to protect users' photos from being misused by malicious DreamBooth applications. The key research contribution is designing and evaluating algorithms that can reliably disrupt DreamBooth generation under diverse conditions.
