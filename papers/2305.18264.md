# [Gen-L-Video: Multi-Text to Long Video Generation via Temporal   Co-Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18264)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a novel paradigm called "Gen-L-Video" for generating and editing long videos conditioned on multiple text prompts using existing short video diffusion models. The central hypothesis is that the denoising path of a long video can be approximated by jointly denoising overlapping short video clips in the temporal domain. The key research questions addressed are:1) How to extend off-the-shelf short video diffusion models to generate long videos with hundreds of frames and diverse semantic segments without requiring additional training?2) How to enable text-driven video generation models to accept multiple text prompts to guide the generation of videos with varying content over time? 3) How to ensure content consistency across the generated long video that contains multiple semantic segments?To address these challenges, the paper proposes "temporal co-denoising", which treats a long video as overlapping short clips and approximates joint denoising of these clips to model the denoising path of the full video. This allows leveraging existing short video diffusion models for long video generation without retraining. The method also supports multi-text guidance by interpolating conditions between labeled clips. Experiments show this approach generates consistent and coherent long videos with diverse semantics.In summary, the central hypothesis is generating long, multi-prompt videos by co-denoising overlapping short clips with existing models. The key contributions are developing the temporal co-denoising formulation and demonstrating its effectiveness across various generation settings without requiring additional training data or models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a novel framework called Gen-L-Video for generating and editing long videos with multiple text segments using existing short video diffusion models, without requiring additional training. The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposes a new paradigm of "temporal co-denoising" that treats a long video as overlapping short clips and approximates the denoising path by joint denoising of short clips. This allows extending short video diffusion models for long video generation/editing.- Implements three main video diffusion strategies (pretrained, tuning-free, one-shot tuning) with Gen-L-Video and makes improvements like bi-directional cross-frame attention. Achieves strong results without needing to train long video models.- Shows the framework can incorporate additional controls like layout/pose guidance and object segmentation for more controllable and precise editing. Allows editing arbitrary objects while preserving other content.- Demonstrates generation of videos with multiple text prompts to create diverse semantic segments. Previous methods were limited to single text condition. - Evaluates on a collected dataset of 66 videos with quantitative metrics and user studies. Shows significant gains over isolated denoising baseline in consistency and alignment.- Overall, proposes an efficient and scalable approach to generate arbitrarily long and multi-text videos by extending existing models, with applications to controllable editing. Opens up new possibilities without needing large-scale training.In summary, the main contribution is the novel Gen-L-Video framework that enables existing short video diffusion models to generate and edit much longer and diverse videos without additional training. This significantly increases their practical applicability.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in text-to-video generation:- The paper presents a novel framework called Gen-L-Video for extending existing short video diffusion models to generate long videos with multiple text prompts. This allows leveraging existing models without additional training. Other works like LVDM, NUWA-XL, and Tune-A-Video require pretraining new models on large datasets to generate long videos.- Gen-L-Video supports conditional generation using multiple text prompts for different segments of the video. This allows control over diverse video content. Other methods like Tune-A-Video are limited to a single text prompt. NUWA-XL does support multiple prompts but requires pretraining.- The proposed temporal co-denoising through joint parallel denoising of short overlapping video clips allows efficient generation of videos of arbitrary lengths. Other long video generation methods like LVDM and NUWA-XL rely on slower autoregressive generation.- Gen-L-Video is flexible and versatile - it can extend different base methods like pretrained, tuning-free, and one-shot tuning text-to-video models. Other approaches are more constrained to specific base models.- The paper shows applications to personalized generation, layout control, and editing arbitrary objects by combining with external models. This demonstrates the broader potential of Gen-L-Video beyond just long video generation.In summary, Gen-L-Video introduces a novel and generalizable framework for long conditional video generation that mitigates limitations like single text prompts, short video lengths, and slow generation in prior arts. The flexibility and demonstrations on diverse applications highlight its versatility compared to other existing approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring the application of Gen-L-Video to allow co-working of various short video diffusion models with different lengths to obtain more flexibility in generation and editing. The authors mention they have not experimented with this yet. - Experimenting with more complex semantic changes in generated videos, such as moving from day to night smoothly over the course of a video. The authors show a simple example of this, but suggest more complex semantic transitions could be an interesting direction.- Incorporating more advanced controllable generation techniques, such as GAN inversion and image-to-image translation, into the framework. The authors demonstrate controllable generation by incorporating pose and segmentation maps, but suggest more advanced techniques could push capabilities further.- Extending the framework to allow interactive and iterative video editing. The current approach generates full videos in one pass, but allowing users to iteratively refine generations could improve results.- Validating the approach on more diverse and complex video datasets. The authors use a relatively small collected dataset, and suggest testing on larger, more complex video datasets.- Exploring unsupervised learning approaches to discover semantic changes over long videos, rather than relying on manual annotation of segments.- Investigating how to better preserve stylistic elements like color patterns across generated video segments. The authors note this can be challenging.In general, the authors seem to suggest future work could focus on expanding the capabilities, flexibility, controllability, and scalability of the Gen-L-Video framework. Testing it on more complex real-world data and integrating more advanced generation and editing techniques appear to be highlighted as promising directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper introduces an approach called Gen-L-Video to extend off-the-shelf short video diffusion models for generating and editing long videos with multiple semantic segments. It views long videos as collections of short clips with temporal overlap. By temporally co-denoising these short clips, it can approximate the denoising path of the long video. This allows leveraging existing short video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long videos with diverse content using single or multiple text prompts, without needing additional training. The method is versatile and can integrate with mainstream text-to-video paradigms like pretrained, tuning-free, and one-shot tuning. It can also incorporate control signals like poses or perform precise object editing via segmentation. Experiments validate it generates high-quality, consistent long videos, significantly extending generative abilities over prior arts.
