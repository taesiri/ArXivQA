# [GVGEN: Text-to-3D Generation with Volumetric Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12957)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating 3D objects from text descriptions is an important but challenging task in computer graphics. Existing methods either rely on slow optimization-based approaches that can produce artifacts, or fast feedforward approaches that struggle with generating high-quality and diverse 3D geometry and textures. Directly generating 3D Gaussians is difficult due to their unstructured nature.

Method:
This paper proposes a novel framework called GVGEN for efficiently generating high-quality 3D Gaussians from text input. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce GaussianVolume, a structured volumetric representation composed of a fixed number of 3D Gaussians. This representation is more amenable for feedforward generation while retaining the benefits of Gaussians. A Candidate Pool Strategy is used to effectively prune and densify Gaussians during fitting to capture details.

2) A coarse-to-fine generation pipeline that first generates a coarse geometry volume called Gaussian Distance Field (GDF), then predicts Gaussian attributes conditioned on GDF and text. This simplifies learning and improves quality.

Contributions:

- First method to directly generate 3D Gaussians from text in a feedforward manner.

- GaussianVolume representation and Candidate Pool Strategy for high-quality fitting and conversion to structured form.

- Coarse-to-fine pipeline that disentangles geometry generation from appearance prediction.

Results show that GVGEN produces higher quality and more diverse 3D objects compared to baselines. It also achieves fast runtime of ~7 seconds per object, effectively balancing quality and efficiency.
