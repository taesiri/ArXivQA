# [G-LLaVA: Solving Geometric Problem with Multi-Modal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to accurately comprehend geometric figures, even simple ones, hindering their ability to solve geometric reasoning problems. They have difficulty understanding relationships between basic elements like points/lines and precisely interpreting things like angle degree.

- Lack of large-scale datasets for training models on geometric reasoning. Existing datasets have limited data volume (few thousands), no detailed image descriptions, and little diversity in problem-solving methods/pathways. This limits models' understanding of basic geometry and problem-solving capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage unique characteristics of geometric problems (unique logic forms, representation uniqueness, scalability) and powerful text LLMs like ChatGPT to automatically generate a large multi-modal geometry dataset called Geo170K.

- Geo170K contains 60K image-caption pairs with detailed geometry diagram descriptions and 110K+ question-answer pairs covering diverse problem-solving methods. It is 28x larger than prior datasets.

- Use Geo170K to develop G-LLaVA, a MLLM for solving geometric problems. Has both a cross-modal alignment phase to comprehend geometry basics and an instruction tuning phase to understand user questions and generate accurate solutions.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis showing limitations of state-of-the-art MLLMs in interpreting basic geometric figures and diagrams

- Strategies for automatically generating a diverse, multi-modal geometry reasoning dataset by exploiting unique properties of geometric problems  

- Geo170K: A new large-scale dataset for geometric reasoning with 60K diagram descriptions and 110K+ question-answer pairs  

- G-LLaVA: A MLLM optimized for geometric reasoning that outperforms GPT-4-V on benchmark with only 7B parameters after training on Geo170K

The key insight is to leverage the structured nature of geometric problems to synthetically expand existing datasets and better align MLLMs to fundamental concepts in geometry. This allows developing specialized MLLMs with exceptional performance on geometric reasoning tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to improve multimodal large language models' ability to solve geometric reasoning problems by leveraging text-only large language models to generate an enriched multimodal dataset of geometry image-text pairs and question-answers, and shows their model trained on this data outperforms state-of-the-art models on geometry problem benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes strategies to augment existing geometric problem datasets by leveraging the unique characteristics of geometric problems and the capabilities of large language models. This results in a new enriched dataset called Geo170K.

2. It develops G-LLaVA, a multimodal large language model specialized for solving geometric problems. G-LLaVA is trained on the constructed Geo170K dataset.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions utilizing the unique characteristics of geometric problems like geometric logic form and scalability to generate the dataset. Can you elaborate more on these unique characteristics and how they were leveraged in the data generation process? 

2. The contrastive QA pair generation seems crucial for helping the model comprehend basic geometric elements. What strategies or techniques were used to create effective and diverse contrastive questions? 

3. How was the decision made regarding the size of the final generated dataset (\ourdata)? Were multiple dataset sizes experimented with? If so, what was the impact of dataset size on model performance?

4. The two-phase training methodology consisting of alignment and instruction tuning is interesting. Can you explain the motivation behind separating the tasks into two phases? Would a joint training be less effective?

5. For the alignment phase training, only the projection layer was updated. What is the intuition behind keeping the base LLM like LLaMA-2 frozen at this stage? 

6. The results show significant improvements over prior SoTA methods on GeoQA. Could you analyze the types of questions or geometric reasoning skills where \ourmodel shows the largest gains?

7. The human performance on MathVista GPS is quite low at 48.4\%. Why do you think humans struggle so much on this benchmark?

8. You compared against powerful multimodal models like GPT-4-V and Gemini. What limitations still exist in these foundation models when applied to mathematical geometric reasoning?

9. What were some of the biggest challenges faced when generating the training data automatically using LLMs like ChatGPT? How were issues like hallucination or factual inaccuracy addressed?

10. An interesting potential future direction is combining retrieved demonstrations with the generated training data. Do you think a retriever model over text corpora related to geometry can further improve performance? Why or why not?
