# [G-LLaVA: Solving Geometric Problem with Multi-Modal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to accurately comprehend geometric figures, even simple ones, hindering their ability to solve geometric reasoning problems. They have difficulty understanding relationships between basic elements like points/lines and precisely interpreting things like angle degree.

- Lack of large-scale datasets for training models on geometric reasoning. Existing datasets have limited data volume (few thousands), no detailed image descriptions, and little diversity in problem-solving methods/pathways. This limits models' understanding of basic geometry and problem-solving capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage unique characteristics of geometric problems (unique logic forms, representation uniqueness, scalability) and powerful text LLMs like ChatGPT to automatically generate a large multi-modal geometry dataset called Geo170K.

- Geo170K contains 60K image-caption pairs with detailed geometry diagram descriptions and 110K+ question-answer pairs covering diverse problem-solving methods. It is 28x larger than prior datasets.

- Use Geo170K to develop G-LLaVA, a MLLM for solving geometric problems. Has both a cross-modal alignment phase to comprehend geometry basics and an instruction tuning phase to understand user questions and generate accurate solutions.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis showing limitations of state-of-the-art MLLMs in interpreting basic geometric figures and diagrams

- Strategies for automatically generating a diverse, multi-modal geometry reasoning dataset by exploiting unique properties of geometric problems  

- Geo170K: A new large-scale dataset for geometric reasoning with 60K diagram descriptions and 110K+ question-answer pairs  

- G-LLaVA: A MLLM optimized for geometric reasoning that outperforms GPT-4-V on benchmark with only 7B parameters after training on Geo170K

The key insight is to leverage the structured nature of geometric problems to synthetically expand existing datasets and better align MLLMs to fundamental concepts in geometry. This allows developing specialized MLLMs with exceptional performance on geometric reasoning tasks.
