# [Blending Is All You Need: Cheaper, Better Alternative to   Trillion-Parameters LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02994)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current state-of-the-art conversational AI systems rely on extremely large language models with hundreds of billions of parameters, which have high computational costs. 
- Smaller models struggle to match the performance and engagement of these massive models.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a blending approach (Blended) that combines multiple smaller conversational AI models together. 
- During a conversation, Blended randomly selects one of the smaller models to generate each response, allowing the models to implicitly influence each other.
- This leads to more diverse and engaging conversations compared to any individual smaller model.

Main Contributions:
- Show that a Blended ensemble of just 3 moderate sized models (6B-13B parameters) can match or even outperform the much larger 175B parameter ChatGPT model.
- Demonstrate through large-scale A/B testing that Blended has significantly higher user engagement and retention compared to ChatGPT. 
- Highlight that Blended only requires a fraction of the inference cost and memory of large models like ChatGPT.
- Suggest the Blended approach as a promising and affordable method to develop high-quality conversational AI without explosive growth in model scale.

In summary, the key insight is that combining multiple smaller conversational models through stochastic blending can lead to performance rivaling giant single models, without their extreme resource costs. The Blended technique is shown to be an effective alternative path forward for conversational AI.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Blended, a method that combines multiple smaller chat AI models to match or exceed the performance of much larger models like ChatGPT, while keeping computational costs low.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is introducing and evaluating a new method called "Blended" for combining multiple chat AI systems. Specifically:

- The paper proposes a simple yet effective approach called "Blended" for blending together the outputs of multiple chat AI systems by randomly selecting one of the systems to generate each response in a conversation. 

- Through large-scale A/B testing on a real user platform, the paper shows that a Blended ensemble of just three moderate-sized chat AIs (6B-13B parameters) can match or even exceed the performance of much larger models like OpenAI's 175B parameter ChatGPT in terms of user engagement and retention.

- The Blended approach only requires the computational resources of a single smaller model per response, rather than scaling up model sizes. This demonstrates the potential for improving chat AI quality through model collaboration instead of simply parameter scaling.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and empirically validating the Blended technique for combining multiple chat AIs to improve conversational quality without increasing inference costs. The simple collaboration approach is shown to outperform individual state-of-the-art models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Blended - The proposed approach of combining multiple chat AI systems by stochastically selecting responses from different systems. Allows smaller models to match or exceed the performance of much larger models.

- Chat AI - Conversational AI systems designed to have engaging and entertaining conversations with users. Key application area explored in the paper. 

- User retention - An industry metric measuring the fraction of users that continue using a platform over time. Used as a proxy to evaluate chat AI quality.

- User engagement - Defined in the paper as the average time users spend interacting with the chat AI. Used as the key objective measure of chat AI performance.

- Model ensembling - The general concept of combining multiple machine learning models, typically to improve overall predictive performance. Blended is proposed as a method for ensembling chat AI systems.

- Human feedback - Explicit feedback from users, used to train components of chat AI systems to improve alignment with human preferences.

- Language models - Foundation models like GPT-3 that are pre-trained on large datasets. Fine-tuned conversational models used as components in the Blended approach.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes blending multiple conversational AI models together. What are the key benefits and challenges of this ensemble approach compared to scaling up a single model? How does the blending methodology help address those challenges?

2. The Blended algorithm selects a single model to generate each conversational response. How does this allow the strengths of the different models to be combined over the course of a multi-turn conversation? What mechanisms enable this?

3. The paper argues that blending creates more diverse and engaging conversations. What specific conversational attributes do you think each individual model contributes that leads to this outcome when blended?

4. How exactly is the inference cost of Blended the same as that of a single small model, despite using an ensemble? Explain the mechanisms that enable this computational efficiency. 

5. The selection of models in Blended currently uses a uniform distribution. The paper proposes training a classifier to predict better selection distributions. What signals could be used to train this classifier? How might the classifier architecture be designed?

6. The experimental methodology leverages user engagement statistics rather than human evaluations. What are the advantages and potential limitations of this evaluation approach? How could the methodology be strengthened?

7. The results show blending outperforms ChatGPT despite having far fewer parameters. What explanations are proposed for this counterintuitive finding? Do you find them convincing? Why/why not?

8. Could the Blended approach be applied successfully to other generative AI tasks beyond dialog systems? What tasks seem most suitable and why? Would any modifications be needed?

9. The paper focuses on open-sourced models for accessibility. Could Blended work as well with proprietary models? What practical challenges might arise in that setting and how could they be addressed?

10. The paper hints that diversity between models aids Blended's performance. What constitues an optimal level of diversity? Could too much diversity negatively impact coherence over multi-turn conversations? How could that issue be tackled?
