## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for learning an explainable representation of trajectories on a road network through dictionary learning. The key idea is to extract a compact dictionary of commonly traversed subpaths called "pathlets" from a collection of trajectories, such that each trajectory can be reconstructed by concatenating a small number of pathlets. An efficient algorithm based on randomized rounding of a relaxed optimization problem is presented, along with a theoretical analysis providing a probabilistic bound. To handle large networks, a hierarchical scheme is introduced that computes multi-scale pathlet dictionaries. Experiments on taxi datasets demonstrate the method learns semantically meaningful and visually interpretable pathlets, produces more compact dictionaries, and achieves better reconstruction rates compared to prior work. Downstream tasks of trip time prediction and data compression also showcase the usefulness of the learned representation. Overall, this pathlet learning framework generates a sparse and explainable trajectory encoding that reveals common mobility patterns shared among trajectories on a network.
