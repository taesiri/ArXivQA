# [Learning the Expected Core of Strictly Convex Stochastic Cooperative   Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07067)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies stochastic cooperative games where the reward function is unknown and modeled as a random variable. The goal is to learn a stable allocation (point in the expected core) that satisfies the core constraints in expectation.

- Prior works assume knowledge of the reward distribution or full-information feedback. This paper considers the challenging bandit feedback setting where only the reward of the queried coalition is observed.

- Learning the expected core with bandit feedback and without additional assumptions requires exponentially many queries, making it intractable. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper focuses on strictly convex games and makes assumptions to ensure the core has sufficient width. These help restrict the search space and enable tractability.

- A new "Common-Points-Picking" algorithm is proposed that estimates the vertices of the core by sampling cyclic permutation orders. It constructs half-spaces based on confidence sets to find a common stable point.

Main Contributions:

- First algorithm to learn the expected core of strictly convex games under bandit feedback with high probability using only polynomial samples.

- Novel extension of the hyperplane separation theorem to show existence of common points among multiple confidence sets.

- New results in convex geometry relating width of permutation polytopes to sample complexity.

- Analysis showing sample complexity scales as O(n^5) with constants capturing width and convexity parameters of the game. Highly adaptive to complexity of game instance.

- Algorithm and analysis technique may find use in other multi-agent learning problems involving convex geometry.
