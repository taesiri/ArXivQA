# [Improving Knowledge-aware Dialogue Generation via Knowledge Base   Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07491)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve knowledge-aware dialogue generation by transferring abilities from knowledge base question answering? 

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel model called TransDG that transfers the abilities of question representation and knowledge matching from a pre-trained knowledge base question answering (KBQA) model to improve dialogue generation. The goal is to better incorporate factual knowledge into open-domain dialog systems to generate more informative and appropriate responses. 

The key hypothesis is that leveraging KBQA can help with two main challenges in knowledge-aware dialogue:

1) Better understanding the input utterance to locate relevant facts from the knowledge base. The KBQA representation helps encode the utterance at both word and dependency levels.

2) Selecting the most appropriate knowledge facts to incorporate into the response generation. The knowledge matching abilities from KBQA can retrieve relevant knowledge given the dialogue context.

By transferring these capabilities from KBQA, the model can improve knowledge selection and diffusion to generate more informative dialogues. The experiments aim to test if TransDG outperforms previous knowledge-grounded dialogue models on metrics like perplexity, entity scores, and human evaluation.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that transferring specific abilities from KBQA can improve knowledge-aware dialogue generation compared to previous approaches. The TransDG model and experiments are designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

- Proposing a novel knowledge-aware dialogue generation model called TransDG, which transfers abilities for question understanding and fact extraction from a pre-trained knowledge base question answering (KBQA) model to facilitate dialogue encoding and decoding. 

- A multi-step decoding strategy to generate responses, where the first step decoder generates a draft response incorporating knowledge facts, and the second step decoder generates the final response considering the draft response as context. This aims to capture knowledge connections between the post and response.

- A response guiding attention mechanism that uses retrieved similar responses to steer the model to focus on relevant features in the input post. 

- Evaluations on benchmark datasets showing TransDG can generate more informative and fluent responses compared to other approaches, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

In summary, the key novelties seem to be in transferring KBQA abilities for dialogue generation, the multi-step decoding strategy, and the response guiding attention mechanism. The overall contribution is a knowledge-aware dialogue model that can produce more appropriate, logical, and informative responses.

In one sentence, I would summarize it as: The paper proposes a knowledge-aware dialogue model TransDG that transfers KBQA abilities for encoding, knowledge selection and multi-step decoding to generate informative dialogues.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in dialogue generation with knowledge:

- This paper focuses on integrating knowledge from a knowledge base (KB) into dialogue generation, which is an active research area. Many recent papers have explored similar ideas of leveraging external knowledge to improve informativeness.

- The main novelty of this paper is transferring representations learned from a knowledge base question answering (KBQA) model to facilitate utterance understanding and knowledge selection in the dialogue generation model. Other papers typically retrieve/select knowledge in a more direct way without this transfer learning approach.

- The proposed model transfers both the question representation and knowledge selection components from a pre-trained KBQA model. This allows it to better understand the dialogue context and select relevant knowledge facts. Other models may only focus on one of these aspects.

- The multi-step decoding strategy is also novel, aimed at improving coherence by considering knowledge relevance between the dialogue context and the generated response. Most other models generate the response in a single pass.

- For knowledge selection, this paper retrieves candidate facts using the input utterance words as queries. Some other models may construct more complex graph representations over the knowledge for retrieval.

- The paper shows strong improvements over baseline seq2seq and knowledge-aware models on dialogue datasets in terms of relevance and diversity of generated responses. The human evaluation and example responses demonstrate the benefits of their approach.

In summary, the transfer learning from KBQA and multi-step decoding seem to be the major novel contributions compared to other knowledge-aware dialogue generation papers. The empirical results validate that these ideas help generate more informative and appropriate responses.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more advanced neural network architectures for knowledge-aware dialogue systems, such as using memory networks or graph neural networks to better incorporate and reason over knowledge. 

- Exploring different strategies for retrieving and selecting relevant knowledge from large-scale knowledge bases during dialogue generation. The authors suggest going beyond just keyword matching to select knowledge.

- Improving context modeling in dialogue systems, especially capturing long-term context and coreference information to generate more coherent and consistent responses.

- Conducting more empirical analysis to better understand the behaviors of knowledge-grounded dialogue models, e.g. through visualize the attention mechanisms.

- Evaluating knowledge-grounded dialogue systems through more sophisticated automatic metrics and human evaluations that can assess the relevance, accuracy and appropriateness of the generated responses.

- Applying knowledge-grounded methods to other dialogue tasks beyond open-domain conversations, such as goal-oriented dialogues, conversational question answering, etc.

- Investigating how to acquire knowledge automatically and continuously for dialogue systems through reading documents, question answering, or interactions with users.

In summary, the key future directions are developing more advanced neural architectures, improving knowledge selection and reasoning, better context modeling, more comprehensive evaluation, and acquiring knowledge automatically. The authors propose many interesting ways to build more intelligent and knowledgeable dialogue agents.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel knowledge-aware dialogue generation model called TransDG, which transfers knowledge from a pre-trained knowledge base question answering (KBQA) model to improve dialogue generation. The key ideas are: 1) The encoder uses a question representation module from the KBQA model to better understand the input post. 2) A knowledge selection module from KBQA is used in the decoder to select relevant knowledge facts. 3) A multi-step decoding approach generates a draft response first, then a final response using knowledge about both the post and draft response. 4) A response guiding attention mechanism focuses on relevant features using retrieved similar responses. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show TransDG generates more informative and fluent responses compared to previous methods. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of each component. Overall, this work demonstrates transferring knowledge from KBQA is an effective technique to improve open-domain dialogue systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel knowledge-aware dialogue generation model called TransDG, which incorporates external knowledge into sequence-to-sequence models to generate more informative dialogues. The key idea is to transfer the abilities of question representation and knowledge matching from a pre-trained knowledge base question answering (KBQA) model to facilitate utterance understanding and factual knowledge selection in dialogue generation. Specifically, the input post is encoded using GRUs augmented with the question representation layer from the KBQA model. To select appropriate knowledge, the knowledge selection layer from the pre-trained KBQA model is integrated into the decoder through a multi-step decoding strategy. In the first decoding step, relevant knowledge facts are selected and incorporated to generate a draft response. The second decoding step then generates the final response by attending to the context information from the first step. In addition, a response guiding attention mechanism is proposed to focus on relevant features using retrieved response candidates. Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of TransDG in generating informative and fluent dialogues.

In summary, the key contributions of this paper are: (1) Transferring abilities from KBQA to facilitate post understanding and knowledge selection in dialogue generation; (2) A multi-step decoding strategy to capture knowledge connections between post and response; (3) A response guiding attention mechanism to focus on relevant features. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of TransDG in generating informative dialogues. The proposed techniques of transferring KBQA abilities and multi-step decoding strategy allow better knowledge grounding in neural dialogue models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel knowledge-aware dialogue generation model called TransDG that transfers the abilities of question representation and knowledge matching from a pre-trained knowledge base question answering (KBQA) model to facilitate utterance understanding and knowledge selection for generating informative dialogues. The key ideas are:

1) A KBQA model is pre-trained to encode questions and candidate answers into distributed representations and perform semantic matching to select the best answer. 

2) The input dialogue utterance is encoded using GRUs augmented with the pre-trained question representation layer from KBQA to capture multi-level semantics.

3) A multi-step decoder is used to generate responses by transferring the knowledge selection ability from KBQA. The first decoder generates a draft response attending to relevant facts. The second decoder generates the final response referring to the context and draft response, capturing knowledge connections.

4) A response guiding attention mechanism is introduced that uses retrieved responses of similar utterances to steer the model to focus on relevant features.

The method is evaluated on dialogue datasets and outperforms baseline methods in generating informative and fluent responses. The key novelty is the transfer of KBQA abilities to facilitate dialogue generation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is trying to address is how to incorporate commonsense knowledge into open-domain dialogue systems in order to generate more informative and appropriate responses. Specifically, it identifies three main challenges:

1) Matching posts to exact facts in a knowledge base is difficult, especially when related entities are far apart in the post. This makes it hard to select relevant factual knowledge.

2) Existing generation-based methods lack a global perspective and ignore the knowledge connection between the post and potential response. This results in generated knowledge/entities that are not reasonable given the context. 

3) Relying solely on the limited input posts makes it difficult to retrieve related facts and generate meaningful responses.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel knowledge-aware dialogue generation model called TransDG that transfers abilities from knowledge base question answering to facilitate utterance understanding and knowledge selection for dialogue generation. The key ideas are:

- Use a pre-trained KBQA model to encode posts at multiple semantic levels and select relevant knowledge.

- Propose a multi-step decoding strategy to capture knowledge connections between post and response.

- Introduce a response guiding attention mechanism using retrieved responses to focus on relevant features.

In summary, the core problem is improving the informativeness of open-domain dialogue systems by effectively incorporating external knowledge, which this paper aims to address through transferring capabilities from KBQA.

The paper proposes a novel knowledge-aware dialogue generation model called TransDG that transfers knowledge from a knowledge base question answering (KBQA) task to facilitate dialogue generation.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel knowledge-aware dialogue generation model called TransDG, which incorporates external knowledge into sequence-to-sequence models to generate informative responses. The key idea is to transfer the abilities of question representation and knowledge matching from a pre-trained knowledge base question answering (KBQA) model to facilitate utterance understanding and factual knowledge selection in dialogue generation. 

Specifically, the KBQA model consists of an encoding layer to represent questions and candidate answers, and a knowledge selection layer to select the most appropriate answer from the knowledge base. This KBQA model is first pre-trained on a separate dataset. 

The dialogue generation model has a knowledge-aware encoder and a multi-step decoder. The encoder represents the input post using GRUs augmented with the pre-trained question representation layer from KBQA to capture multi-level semantics. A response guiding attention mechanism is used to focus on relevant features. 

The multi-step decoder generates responses by transferring the knowledge selection layer from KBQA. The first decoder step generates a draft response attending to relevant facts. The second decoder step generates the final response by referring to the post, draft response, and context knowledge from the first step to improve coherence.

Experiments on two benchmarks show TransDG generates more informative and appropriate responses than compared methods. Ablation studies demonstrate the contributions of individual components. The work provides a novel way to effectively incorporate external knowledge into neural dialogue through transferring abilities from KBQA.
