# Improving Knowledge-aware Dialogue Generation via Knowledge Base   Question Answering

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve knowledge-aware dialogue generation by transferring abilities from knowledge base question answering? Specifically, the paper proposes a novel model called TransDG that transfers the abilities of question representation and knowledge matching from a pre-trained knowledge base question answering (KBQA) model to improve dialogue generation. The goal is to better incorporate factual knowledge into open-domain dialog systems to generate more informative and appropriate responses. The key hypothesis is that leveraging KBQA can help with two main challenges in knowledge-aware dialogue:1) Better understanding the input utterance to locate relevant facts from the knowledge base. The KBQA representation helps encode the utterance at both word and dependency levels.2) Selecting the most appropriate knowledge facts to incorporate into the response generation. The knowledge matching abilities from KBQA can retrieve relevant knowledge given the dialogue context.By transferring these capabilities from KBQA, the model can improve knowledge selection and diffusion to generate more informative dialogues. The experiments aim to test if TransDG outperforms previous knowledge-grounded dialogue models on metrics like perplexity, entity scores, and human evaluation.In summary, the central hypothesis is that transferring specific abilities from KBQA can improve knowledge-aware dialogue generation compared to previous approaches. The TransDG model and experiments are designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:- Proposing a novel knowledge-aware dialogue generation model called TransDG, which transfers abilities for question understanding and fact extraction from a pre-trained knowledge base question answering (KBQA) model to facilitate dialogue encoding and decoding. - A multi-step decoding strategy to generate responses, where the first step decoder generates a draft response incorporating knowledge facts, and the second step decoder generates the final response considering the draft response as context. This aims to capture knowledge connections between the post and response.- A response guiding attention mechanism that uses retrieved similar responses to steer the model to focus on relevant features in the input post. - Evaluations on benchmark datasets showing TransDG can generate more informative and fluent responses compared to other approaches, both quantitatively and qualitatively.In summary, the key novelties seem to be in transferring KBQA abilities for dialogue generation, the multi-step decoding strategy, and the response guiding attention mechanism. The overall contribution is a knowledge-aware dialogue model that can produce more appropriate, logical, and informative responses.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my understanding, the key points of this paper are:- It proposes a novel knowledge-aware dialogue generation model called TransDG, which transfers abilities from knowledge base question answering (KBQA) to facilitate utterance understanding and knowledge selection for generating informative dialogues. - It uses a pre-trained KBQA model for encoding questions and selecting answers. This is transferred to dialogue generation for encoding posts and selecting relevant knowledge.- It uses a multi-step decoding strategy to generate draft and final responses. This aims to capture knowledge connections between post and response.- It incorporates a response guiding attention mechanism using retrieved responses to focus on relevant features. - Experiments on two benchmarks show TransDG generates more informative and fluent dialogues compared to other methods.In one sentence, I would summarize it as: The paper proposes a knowledge-aware dialogue model TransDG that transfers KBQA abilities for encoding, knowledge selection and multi-step decoding to generate informative dialogues.
