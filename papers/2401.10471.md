# [DeepEdit: Knowledge Editing as Decoding with Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10471)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Knowledge editing for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT is important to keep them up-to-date without expensive retraining. 
- Existing methods rely on prompts to convey edits, but lack control over how edits impact outputs.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate knowledge editing as a decoding with constraints problem. 
- Propose 4 key constraints - uniqueness, coherence, awareness, relevance - that benefit knowledge editing.
- Present a progressive decoding method called DeepEdit that verifies if outputs meet constraints.
- If not, use knowledge retrieval and depth-first search to revise outputs to satisfy constraints.

Key Contributions:
- Avoids needing access to LLM internals like output distributions.
- Flexibly works with black-box LLMs without retraining them.  
- Qualitative case studies show DeepEdit makes LLMs reasoning more coherent and aware of updated knowledge.
- Quantitatively improves accuracy on question answering with knowledge editing task by 42-70% over state-of-the-art method.
- Progressive decoding offers a new way to control LLM outputs instead of just prompting them.

In summary, the key innovation is controlling LLM decoding to satisfy semantic constraints that benefit knowledge editing, through a neural-symbolic progressive revision approach. This directly steers LLM reasoning without needing to access or retrain the model.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes DeepEdit, a progressive decoding method that imposes semantic constraints on language models' outputs to improve knowledge editing for multi-hop question answering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new paradigm for knowledge editing of large language models (LLMs) called "decoding with constraints". Specifically:

- The paper proposes a progressive decoding method called \modelname that improves the knowledge editing capability of LLMs by enforcing constraints on their outputs during decoding. These constraints aim to improve coherence, relevance, and awareness of the reasoning with respect to the updated knowledge.

- \modelname works by progressively decoding one reasoning step at a time, verifying whether constraints are satisfied, and revising the outputs if needed. It does not require access to the LLM's parameters or output distributions.

- The constraints include uniqueness, coherence, awareness, and relevance of each reasoning step. Both local constraints (on individual steps) and global constraints (across the full reasoning chain) are applied.

- \modelname significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art knowledge editing method on the challenging MQuAKE benchmark. For example, it improves accuracy by 42% and 70% over the baseline on two LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is a new decoding-with-constraints paradigm for flexibly improving LLMs' reasoning and knowledge editing capability, along with an effective progressive decoding method called \modelname that implements this paradigm.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Knowledge editing - The paper focuses on developing methods for effectively editing the knowledge of large language models without needing to retrain them.

- Constrained decoding - The paper proposes viewing knowledge editing as a constrained decoding problem, where certain constraints are imposed to steer the language model's outputs during decoding.

- Progressive decoding - The proposed method performs iterative decoding, verification, and modification of each reasoning step to accommodate constraints.

- Semantic constraints - The paper proposes semantic constraints like uniqueness, coherence, awareness, and relevance that are beneficial for knowledge editing. 

- Depth-first search - A depth-first search strategy is used to revise reasoning steps globally to improve relevance.

- Multi-hop question answering - The method is evaluated on a multi-hop QA dataset requiring reasoning over a chain of facts with updated knowledge.

- MQuAKE - This is the multi-hop QA knowledge editing benchmark used for evaluation.

- Modularity - The proposed system has a modular design with separate verifiers and modifiers, providing interpretability.

In summary, the key terms cover knowledge editing, constrained/progressive decoding, semantic constraints, depth-first search, multi-hop QA, and the MQuAKE benchmark.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the central idea behind viewing knowledge editing for large language models as a problem of decoding with constraints? Why is imposing semantic constraints useful for representing desired properties that benefit knowledge editing?

2. How does the proposed progressive decoding approach bypass the requirement of accessing the output vocabulary distributions of large language models? Why is being able to accommodate black box models useful? 

3. How were the four proposed constraints - uniqueness, coherence, awareness, and relevance - decided upon? What reasoning led to the identification of these constraints as being beneficial for knowledge editing?  

4. What motivated the design choice of having both local and global verifiers? Why is having this distinction important for efficiently verifying and revising the constraints?

5. Why is the knowledge retrieval component needed in the local modifier? Would it be possible to just rely on the language model itself to generate replacements that satisfy constraints without external knowledge?

6. Explain the rationale behind using a depth-first search procedure for the global modifier. Why is a multi-step revision approach superior to simply removing single reasoning steps?  

7. What advantages does the modularized design of the proposed method offer in terms of accuracy and interoperability with black box models? How does it improve interpretability?

8. How do the qualitative results highlight cases where the baseline method fails but the proposed approach succeeds? What specifically about the reasoning process leads to more correct predictions?

9. What ideas for future work are mentioned? What other constraints could be analyzed for potentially improving knowledge editing further?

10. Overall, how does framing knowledge editing as a decoding with constraints problem enable better control and steering of language model outputs than typical prompt engineering approaches?
