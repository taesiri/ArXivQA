# [Zero-shot Model Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15441)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: Can we evaluate the sensitivity of deep learning models to arbitrary visual attributes without needing an annotated test set?The key hypothesis is that it is possible to do "zero-shot" model diagnosis using a generative model like StyleGAN and a multi-modal model like CLIP, without needing a labeled test set for the attributes of interest. The authors propose a framework called ZOOM (Zero-shot mOdel diagnsis) that allows users to specify textual attributes, and then generates counterfactual images to visualize the model's sensitivity to those attributes and quantify it via sensitivity histograms. This avoids the traditional need for collecting and annotating test datasets for model diagnosis.So in summary, the main research question is whether zero-shot model diagnosis is viable, and the central hypothesis is that their proposed ZOOM framework can enable this by leveraging recent advances in generative models and multi-modal models like CLIP. The experiments aim to validate if their framework can produce meaningful counterfactuals and sensitivity analysis without labeled test data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a zero-shot model diagnosis framework called ZOOM that can evaluate a target model's sensitivity to different attributes without requiring a labeled test set. 2. Generating counterfactual images using a generative model (StyleGAN) and guiding the image generation process using CLIP embeddings of user-defined textual attributes. This allows for an open-vocabulary setting without being limited to predefined datasets.3. Providing sensitivity analysis by generating sensitivity histograms that show how sensitive the target model is to each attribute. Higher bars mean the model is more sensitive to that attribute.4. Showing that fine-tuning the target model on counterfactual images (counterfactual training) can increase robustness and improve accuracy slightly, while also making the model much less prone to being fooled by counterfactuals.5. Demonstrating the flexibility of the framework by allowing users to easily customize and expand the attribute space without retraining the system components (StyleGAN, CLIP).In summary, the key novelty is enabling model diagnosis and sensitivity analysis without a labeled test set, instead relying on StyleGAN and CLIP to generate counterfactual examples based on user-defined textual attributes. The histograms and counterfactual images provide insights into model failures.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method called ZOOM for zero-shot model diagnosis of deep learning vision models using a generative model and CLIP to synthesize counterfactual images that reveal model biases, without needing a labeled test set.
