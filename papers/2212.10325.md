# SeqDiffuSeq: Text Diffusion with Encoder-Decoder Transformers

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we extend continuous diffusion models to natural language sequence generation tasks like machine translation and dialogue? Specifically, the authors propose a model called SeqDiffuSeq that adapts the continuous diffusion framework from prior work (DiffusionLM) to sequence-to-sequence text generation settings. The key ideas and contributions are:- Using an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture to model the diffusion and denoising processes, rather than just an encoder-only model. This allows better modeling of input-output dependencies.- Incorporating a self-conditioning technique to help the model better utilize past predicted sequence information during generation. - Proposing an adaptive noise schedule technique that balances the denoising difficulty across time steps at the token level, rather than using a fixed schedule.- Demonstrating improved performance over baselines like DiffuSeq and non-autoregressive models on various text generation tasks regarding both quality and inference speed.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that continuous diffusion models can be adapted to sequence generation by using an encoder-decoder architecture, self-conditioning, and an adaptive noise schedule. The results on multiple datasets seem to validate this hypothesis and show the potential of diffusion models for text generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes SeqDiffuSeq, a new text diffusion model for sequence-to-sequence text generation using an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture. This extends previous diffusion models like DiffusionLM to the sequence-to-sequence setting.2. It introduces two techniques - self-conditioning and adaptive noise schedule - to improve the performance of SeqDiffuSeq. Self-conditioning allows the model to better utilize predicted sequence information during generation. The adaptive noise schedule balances the difficulty of denoising across time steps. 3. It demonstrates improved performance of SeqDiffuSeq over previous diffusion models like DiffuSeq on several text generation tasks regarding quality and inference speed. Experiments show competitive results compared to autoregressive and non-autoregressive baselines.4. It provides analysis into the learned adaptive noise schedules, showing they differ across token positions and help distribute denoising difficulty evenly across steps. It also analyzes the trade-off between quality and diversity with the proposed techniques.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating an improved sequence-to-sequence text diffusion model incorporating useful techniques like self-conditioning and adaptive noise schedules. The techniques and encoder-decoder framework are shown to provide gains over previous diffusion approaches on various generation tasks.
