# [Systemic Biases in Sign Language AI Research: A Deaf-Led Call to   Reevaluate Research Agendas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02563)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sign language AI research lacks intentionality and meaningful input from Deaf stakeholders. As a result, research directions and methods are often misaligned with the interests and perspectives of Deaf communities.

- Systematic analysis of 101 recent sign language AI papers reveals several concerning biases:
   - Majority of papers motivated by perceived communication barriers, framing Deaf people as deficient
   - Models often use datasets not representative of target Deaf users 
   - Labels and annotation schemes lack linguistic foundations
   - Modeling decisions inherit biases from previous work
   
- These biases risk marginalizing Deaf users and subordinate sign languages to technology.

Solution:
- The field needs Deaf leadership to set research agendas and make key decisions.  
 
- Hearing researchers should support Deaf researchers by transferring opportunities to them and enhancing accessibility.

- All researchers should be transparent about their backgrounds and privileges (positionalities) to underscore how it impacts their work.

- Calls for Deaf leadership should promote ongoing conversation to determine appropriate involvement depending on project specifics. Leadership should come from a diverse range of Deaf perspectives.

Contributions:
- First systematic analysis focused on rhetoric and biases shaping sign language AI research directions
   - Reveals need to re-evaluate research agendas 

- Articulates need for Deaf leadership and outlines concrete steps hearing researchers can take
   - Transfers visibility and accountability to Deaf researchers

- Surfaces complexities in calls for Deaf leadership 
   - Highlights need for nuanced, consensus-driven approach accounting for inequalities

In summary, this paper provides evidence that sign language AI lacks Deaf perspectives and offers solutions towards more intentional, Deaf-centered research. Implementing these solutions will require continued discussion and re-evaluation from the entire research community.
