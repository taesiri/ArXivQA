# [Systemic Biases in Sign Language AI Research: A Deaf-Led Call to   Reevaluate Research Agendas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02563)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sign language AI research lacks intentionality and meaningful input from Deaf stakeholders. As a result, research directions and methods are often misaligned with the interests and perspectives of Deaf communities.

- Systematic analysis of 101 recent sign language AI papers reveals several concerning biases:
   - Majority of papers motivated by perceived communication barriers, framing Deaf people as deficient
   - Models often use datasets not representative of target Deaf users 
   - Labels and annotation schemes lack linguistic foundations
   - Modeling decisions inherit biases from previous work
   
- These biases risk marginalizing Deaf users and subordinate sign languages to technology.

Solution:
- The field needs Deaf leadership to set research agendas and make key decisions.  
 
- Hearing researchers should support Deaf researchers by transferring opportunities to them and enhancing accessibility.

- All researchers should be transparent about their backgrounds and privileges (positionalities) to underscore how it impacts their work.

- Calls for Deaf leadership should promote ongoing conversation to determine appropriate involvement depending on project specifics. Leadership should come from a diverse range of Deaf perspectives.

Contributions:
- First systematic analysis focused on rhetoric and biases shaping sign language AI research directions
   - Reveals need to re-evaluate research agendas 

- Articulates need for Deaf leadership and outlines concrete steps hearing researchers can take
   - Transfers visibility and accountability to Deaf researchers

- Surfaces complexities in calls for Deaf leadership 
   - Highlights need for nuanced, consensus-driven approach accounting for inequalities

In summary, this paper provides evidence that sign language AI lacks Deaf perspectives and offers solutions towards more intentional, Deaf-centered research. Implementing these solutions will require continued discussion and re-evaluation from the entire research community.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The paper conducts a systematic review of 101 recent sign language AI papers, identifies systemic biases including overfocusing on communication barriers, using mismatched datasets, lacking linguistic foundations, and building on flawed models, and issues a call to action for the field to foster Deaf leadership to set the research agenda.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It conducts a systematic literature review of 101 recent papers in sign language AI, analyzing trends in how research is framed, what datasets and annotations are used, and modeling decisions.

2) Through this analysis, it identifies several systemic biases in the field, including:
- An overfocus on solving perceived communication barriers for deaf people, rather than exploring sign languages as full languages
- Usage of datasets and annotation schemes misaligned with how deaf people actually use sign languages
- Reliance on pretrained models and other design decisions made primarily for convenience rather than appropriateness for sign languages

3) It takes the position that these systemic biases exist because the field lacks intentional inclusion of and leadership from Deaf stakeholders. 

4) It issues calls to action for the field to foster Deaf leadership, including transparency about researcher positionalities, transitioning visibility and accountability to Deaf researchers, and starting an ongoing conversation to re-evaluate how research agendas and decisions align with Deaf perspectives.

In summary, this paper makes both a substantive contribution in analyzing current work and identifying several key biases, as well as an activist contribution in issuing clear calls to action towards addressing systemic exclusion of Deaf stakeholders in the field.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Systemic biases in sign language AI research
- Lack of Deaf leadership and stakeholder involvement
- Overfocus on communication barriers as motivation for research
- Mismatched datasets that do not represent target users
- Flawed use of glossing and other annotation schemes
- Inheritance of biases from pretrained models
- Calls for transparency around researcher positionalities 
- Need for intentional inclusion of Deaf perspectives to guide research agenda
- Risks and limitations around calls for Deaf leadership

The paper conducts a systematic analysis of over 100 recent sign language AI papers and identifies issues around ableism, audism, lack of linguistic awareness, and lack of engagement with Deaf communities. It argues these systemic biases shape the research direction and methods used in ways misaligned with Deaf stakeholders' interests. The authors issue calls to action for the field to foster Deaf leadership, ensure transparency around researcher backgrounds, and continue an ongoing conversation to mitigate risks of even calls for Deaf leadership.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that the field lacks intentionality in problem formulation and model design. How can researchers ensure future work is guided by principles that align with Deaf stakeholder interests? What processes could be put in place?

2. The authors advocate for Deaf leadership in sign language AI research. What are some concrete ways hearing researchers can help amplify and support Deaf-led projects? How can power dynamics be shifted to facilitate this?  

3. The paper discusses tensions between clean ML data needs and procedures that allow for authentic diverse language contributions from Deaf signers. How can researchers balance these competing constraints? What novel data collection methods might help?

4. Many papers were found to use interpreter-only datasets despite limitations. What best practices should be followed for using interpreted data while ensuring it doesn't perpetuate marginalization? How can risks be mitigated?

5. A lack of linguistic awareness was identified in annotation schemes and targets chosen by papers. What processes are needed to ensure linguists are closely involved in guiding annotations and evaluations?

6. The authors surface issues with reliance on certain pretrained models not specialized for sign languages. What analyses should be conducted before employing transfer learning to quantify possible inherited biases? 

7. What mechanisms can help ensure Deaf collaborators have agency in leading projects rather than being brought on after key decisions are made? How can power imbalances be addressed?

8. The paper argues calls for Deaf leadership risk being tokenizing without critical reflection on which voices are included. What principles and selection criteria should guide who leads projects involving Deaf communities?

9. How can sign language AI researchers reconcile disagreements between different Deaf perspectives and stakeholders? What consensus-building practices could be beneficial? 

10. The authors acknowledge gaps in their own experience and note critiques of their past work. How can positionalities be woven deeply into sign language AI research to enhance transparency about researchers' backgrounds and privileges?
