# [Shaping and Being Shaped by Drones: Supporting Perception-Action Loops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09688)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores the challenges of human-drone interaction (HDI) design. Specifically, it looks at how non-experts with little prior experience were tasked to program and pilot a drone through an obstacle course using bodily gestures. This highlights issues around the mutual shaping of pilots and drones, including coping with the fragility and unpredictability of drones.

Study:
The authors organized a 3-day drone challenge where 5 teams programmedCrazyflie nano-drones to fly through an obstacle course to collect markers, inspired by the Pacman video game. Teams had to use gestures and proximity sensors on the drones to control them. Data was collected through field notes, interviews, video recordings and inspection of code.

Key Findings:
1) Participants' view of drones shifted from an initial assumption of seamless HDI to experiencing drones as fragile, willful and crash-prone. This created a "visibility problem" in understanding the drone's unpredictable behaviors.

2) Participants explored the drones' capabilities through intimate bodily interactions, tuning parameters and directly handling the drones to probe and determine their limitations.

3) Teams adopted different strategies - either "training the drone" through defensive coding to make it resilient, or "training the pilot" by adapting bodily movements to the drone's constraints.

Contributions: 
The paper provides an empirical, somaesthetically-focused perspective on challenges in current HDI. It argues for better supporting somatic engagement in drone design through programming environments that make the drone's perception-action loops felt and understood through embodied interaction. This would allow designers to shape both the technology and themselves in line with their aims.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper provides an empirical, somaesthetically focused account of current challenges in human-drone interaction by analyzing how participants in a drone programming challenge were mutually shaping and shaped by drones' fragility, wilfulness, and crash-proneness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contribution of this paper is providing an empirical, somaesthetically focused account of current challenges in human-drone interaction (HDI). Specifically, the paper:

1) Illustrates how participants' perspectives on drones transformed from an initial view of seamless HDI to seeing drones as fragile, willful entities prone to crashes. 

2) Depicts how participants engaged in intimate, bodily interactions with the drones to probe, understand, and determine their capabilities and limitations.

3) Contrasts different strategies adopted by teams, either emphasizing training the drone behavior through programming or training the human pilot's bodily movements. 

4) Calls for programming environments that support "action-feedback loops" to enable somatic engagement in the design and development of drones. This would facilitate understanding drones through embodied perception-action loops rather than just observing behavior or figuring out sensing.

So in summary, the key contribution is providing a rich, empirical account focused on the somatic and mutual shaping between humans and drones in HDI, and arguing for better tools and environments to support somatic engagement when programming drones.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Human-drone interaction (HDI)
- Somaesthetics 
- Movement-based interactions
- Perception-action loops
- Bodily knowledge
- Visibility problem
- Defensive programming
- Training the drone vs training the pilot
- Supporting somatic engagement in drone design
- Elucidating action-feedback loops

The paper examines human-drone interaction through a somaesthetic lens, focusing on the bodily movements and sensed experiences of pilots interacting with and controlling drones. It calls for better tools and environments to support the somatic, felt engagement of designers and developers with drones and robots, especially through facilitating perception-action loops and making action-feedback tangible through the body over time. Key ideas include training both the drone behavior and the pilot's movements, addressing the visibility problem in embedded programming, and leveraging bodily knowledge in improving human-drone coordination.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues for supporting "action-feedback loops" in drone programming environments to better enable somatic engagement. Could you expand more on what specific features or functionality a programming environment would need to properly support these action-feedback loops? 

2. The process of teams getting to "know" the drones through intimate bodily interactions and probing their capabilities is emphasized. Do you think providing simulators or other ways to safely test drone capabilities and limitations prior to physical flights would enhance or detract from this process of embodied learning?

3. The difference between "training the drone" via defensive programming versus "training the pilot" via changing bodily movements is highlighted. In an ideal programming environment, how could both of these approaches be supported simultaneously? 

4. The visibility problem of not being able to easily discern the internal states of the drone from external observations is discussed. Beyond better debugging/visualization, what new functionality could help address this issue in embedded programming for drones?

5. The paper argues current HDI systems wrongly assume bodily knowledge doesn't need explicit training. What are some ways we could integrate somatic skills development into the pipeline for designing movement-based HDI systems? 

6. Getting to know the intricacies and failings of the physical drone body is described as just as critical as understanding the software. How might a programming environment help designers build knowledge of these physical fragilities and breakdowns?

7. The difference between open-ended artistic explorations of HDI vs goal-oriented environments like the drone challenge is noted. In what ways do the insights from this constrained setting still transfer back to more open-ended HDI design processes?

8. The role of the expert tutors in providing technical support and answering questions is emphasized. Could similar scaffolding/support be provided in an intelligent programming environment instead? If so, what capabilities would it need?

9. The stilted bodily movements participants adopted to avoid occluding the positioning system are noted. How could the programming environment be designed to make participants aware of and avoid these sensor limitations?

10. Beyond aerial drones, what other areas of HRI could benefit from incorporating programming environments focused on supporting somatic engagement? In what application domains might this approach be most impactful?
