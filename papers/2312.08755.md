# [PROPRES: Investigating the Projectivity of Presupposition with Various   Triggers and Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08755)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding presuppositions (information taken for granted in an utterance) is an open challenge for language models. A key property of presuppositions is projectivity - they project out of entailment-canceling environments like negation.  
- Prior NLP work fails to fully capture the variable nature of presupposition projectivity based on the trigger and environment. They use no or limited human evaluation, and only negation as the environment.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct extensive human evaluation and model testing using two datasets:
    1) Re-evaluate a subset of the ImpPres dataset with 900 sample pairs judged by humans. Test RoBERTa and DeBERTa models.
    2) Introduce new ProPres dataset with 12K pairs using 6 presupposition triggers and 5 entailment environments. Get human judgments on 600 pairs. Test 4 models.

Key Findings:
- Humans show variable projectivity depending on trigger and environment combinations. New variable cases found beyond previous linguistic studies.
- Best model (DeBERTa) fails to fully capture the variable projectivity patterns seen in humans. Indicates lack of true pragmatic understanding of presuppositions. 

Main Contributions:  
- New ProPres dataset enables more comprehensive analysis of presupposition projectivity.
- Human evaluation reveals variable projectivity in some new trigger-environment combinations. 
- Models do not mirror the human patterns, highlighting the need for datasets covering more linguistic variability when probing for true language understanding abilities.

In summary, the paper demonstrates through targeted datasets and human studies that current models lack a human-like understanding of the variable nature of presupposition projectivity. The findings suggest creation of more varied datasets and evaluation against human patterns is key for developing more pragmatic language comprehension abilities.
