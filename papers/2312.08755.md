# [PROPRES: Investigating the Projectivity of Presupposition with Various   Triggers and Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08755)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding presuppositions (information taken for granted in an utterance) is an open challenge for language models. A key property of presuppositions is projectivity - they project out of entailment-canceling environments like negation.  
- Prior NLP work fails to fully capture the variable nature of presupposition projectivity based on the trigger and environment. They use no or limited human evaluation, and only negation as the environment.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct extensive human evaluation and model testing using two datasets:
    1) Re-evaluate a subset of the ImpPres dataset with 900 sample pairs judged by humans. Test RoBERTa and DeBERTa models.
    2) Introduce new ProPres dataset with 12K pairs using 6 presupposition triggers and 5 entailment environments. Get human judgments on 600 pairs. Test 4 models.

Key Findings:
- Humans show variable projectivity depending on trigger and environment combinations. New variable cases found beyond previous linguistic studies.
- Best model (DeBERTa) fails to fully capture the variable projectivity patterns seen in humans. Indicates lack of true pragmatic understanding of presuppositions. 

Main Contributions:  
- New ProPres dataset enables more comprehensive analysis of presupposition projectivity.
- Human evaluation reveals variable projectivity in some new trigger-environment combinations. 
- Models do not mirror the human patterns, highlighting the need for datasets covering more linguistic variability when probing for true language understanding abilities.

In summary, the paper demonstrates through targeted datasets and human studies that current models lack a human-like understanding of the variable nature of presupposition projectivity. The findings suggest creation of more varied datasets and evaluation against human patterns is key for developing more pragmatic language comprehension abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces a new dataset, ProPres, to investigate the variable projectivity of presuppositions triggered by different lexical items across linguistic environments, finding that while humans exhibit flexibility, state-of-the-art models do not fully capture the subtle pragmatic patterns.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing a new dataset, \textsc{ProPres}, using six novel presupposition triggers embedded under five environments, which enables a comprehensive investigation of the projectivity of presupposition. 

2. Providing human evaluation results that give evidence for the variable projectivity depending on the combination of triggers and environments. 

3. Model evaluation results against human judgments revealing that the models and humans behave differently in the understanding of presuppositions. The best performed model, DeBERTa, does not fully capture the variable projectivity patterns.

In summary, the paper introduces a new dataset to probe presupposition projectivity more comprehensively, provides new human data showing variable projectivity, and model analysis indicating models do not fully learn the pragmatics of presupposition as humans do.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Presupposition - Information taken for granted by the speaker in an utterance. The paper investigates the projectivity of presuppositions.

- Projectivity - The property of presuppositions that allows them to project out of entailment-canceling environments like negation, questions, conditionals, etc. 

- Presupposition triggers - Linguistic items or constructions that introduce presuppositions, like "again", "stop", "only", etc.

- Natural language inference (NLI) - The task used to evaluate models' capabilities of understanding presuppositions.

- Variable projectivity - The observation from linguistics that the projectivity of presuppositions can vary based on factors like specific triggers, environments, context, etc. 

- Entailment-canceling environments - Environments like negation, questions, conditionals, and modals where entailments may be canceled but presuppositions still project.

- Evaluation datasets - The paper introduces and evaluates models on two datasets: ImpPres and ProPres, to test projectivity of presuppositions.

So in summary, the key terms have to do with presuppositions, their projective behavior, the factors that influence it, and the evaluation of natural language understanding models on this pragmatic phenomenon.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper introduces a new dataset called ProPres to investigate the projectivity of presuppositions. What are the key components of this dataset and how do they allow for a more comprehensive analysis compared to prior datasets?

2. The paper conducts both human and model evaluations using the ProPres dataset. What are some of the key differences observed between human and model performance in understanding presuppositions? What limitations of current models does this reveal?  

3. The paper finds evidence that projectivity can vary depending on the combination of triggers and linguistic environments. Can you describe 2-3 specific examples highlighted in the results where certain triggers behave differently across environments?

4. One interesting finding is the variable projectivity patterns exhibited for manner adverbs. What explanations are provided in the paper for why manner adverbs may show weaker projectivity in certain syntactic environments?

5. This paper argues that the combination of triggers and environments in ProPres allows discovery of new cases of variable projectivity. Do you agree with this conclusion? What specifically about the dataset design facilitates uncovering more subtle context-dependent patterns?

6. The paper excludes certain triggers and environments from analysis due to issues like disagreement in human judgments. Do you think this exclusion biases the overall conclusions? How might a follow-up study address some of these exclusions more systematically?  

7. The best performing model, DeBERTa, is analyzed in depth. What specific gaps are revealed between DeBERTa's understanding of presuppositions compared to humans? Are there any cases where DeBERTa matches or outperforms humans?

8. Do you think the template-based approach for generating ProPres sentences has any important limitations compared to more naturalistic data? How might the use of templates be expanded or improved in future iterations?

9. The paper does not consider the role of contextual information in interpreting presuppositions. How important do you think context is for determining projectivity? How might context be systematically incorporated into the dataset and evaluation?

10. What do you see as the most interesting or surprising conclusions from this study? What new research directions does it open up for better evaluating and improving pragmatic competencies of language models?
