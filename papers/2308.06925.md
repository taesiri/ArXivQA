# [CBA: Improving Online Continual Learning via Continual Bias Adaptor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06925)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a method called Continual Bias Adaptor (CBA) to address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in online continual learning. The key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

- How to deal with the catastrophic distribution shifts caused by non-stationary data streams in online continual learning? The paper argues that both the label distribution and feature distribution can shift catastrophically over time, leading to severe forgetting of past knowledge. 

- Can we model and adapt to the posterior distribution shift directly to alleviate catastrophic forgetting? The paper hypothesizes that explicitly capturing the posterior distribution changes can help consolidate knowledge learned from previous tasks.

- Can a lightweight module be designed to assimilate the posterior distribution shift during training, and removed during testing for efficiency? The paper proposes a Continual Bias Adaptor (CBA) module to dynamically augment the classifier to adapt to distribution changes, without overhead during testing.

- Can CBA effectively improve existing rehearsal-based methods for online continual learning? The paper demonstrates consistent gains by applying CBA to various rehearsal-based methods like experience replay.

- How does bi-level optimization of CBA aid in learning a stable classifier and alleviating catastrophic shifts? Theoretical analysis provides insights into how CBA's training strategy enables gradient alignment to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling and adapting to posterior distribution shifts can help mitigate catastrophic forgetting in online continual learning. The CBA module and associated training procedure are proposed to achieve this goal in an efficient and robust manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new approach called Continual Bias Adaptor (CBA) for online continual learning. The key contributions are:

- It proposes a bi-level learning framework to model the posterior distribution shift in an online manner during continual learning. This allows adapting to catastrophic distribution changes and consolidating knowledge from previous tasks. 

- It introduces a CBA module that can plug into most rehearsal-based methods during training and be removed at test time, introducing no extra computation cost or memory overhead.

- It provides theoretical analysis to show CBA establishes gradient alignment between training and memory buffer data, explaining why it alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

- It demonstrates strong empirical performance by applying CBA to 4 rehearsal baselines on 3 benchmarks, consistently improving their accuracy and forgetting measures under online continual learning settings.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the CBA approach to explicitly model and adapt to distribution shifts in online continual learning, both theoretically and empirically showing it helps consolidate knowledge across tasks. The bi-level learning and removable module allow flexibility to apply CBA to existing rehearsal methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a Continual Bias Adaptor module that augments the classifier network to adapt to catastrophic distribution shifts during online continual learning training, allowing the classifier to consolidate knowledge across tasks, and this module can be removed during testing so it adds no computational overhead.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of continual learning:

- This paper focuses on tackling catastrophic forgetting in the online continual learning setting. Most prior work has focused more on the offline setting where models can train on batches from previous tasks multiple times. The online setting is more challenging and realistic since models only see each example once.

- The key contribution is proposing a Continual Bias Adaptor (CBA) module to dynamically adapt the classifier to distribution shifts during training. This is a unique approach compared to prior methods that typically try to replay old examples, regularize model updates, or separate task-specific modules. Modeling the posterior directly seems more principled.

- The CBA module allows the classifier to learn a stable consolidation of knowledge across tasks, while absorbing catastrophic distribution shifts into the adaptor parameters. This is a clever bi-level optimization strategy.

- They demonstrate broad improvements by plugging CBA into several strong replay-based baselines like Experience Replay, DER++, RAR, and CLSER. Showing consistent gains across different algorithms is a strong result.

- The theoretical analysis provides justification for why CBA helps align gradients and reduce forgetting. Connecting to prior gradient alignment work like GEM helps explain the mechanism.

- Overall, modeling distribution shift explicitly via the posterior is novel compared to prior bias correction layers or simpler replay strategies. The bi-level optimization and ability to plug into existing methods are also strengths. The gains across multiple benchmarks substantiate the benefits. I think it's an interesting and valuable contribution to continual learning.

In summary, the CBA module and bi-level optimization approach seem unique compared to related methods. The results demonstrate clear improvements in a challenging online setting across diverse algorithms and benchmarks. The theoretical insights also help explain the success. I find it to be a solid incremental contribution over prior art in this domain.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring more advanced architectures for the Continual Bias Adaptor (CBA) module. The authors used a simple MLP to parameterize CBA in this work. They suggest exploring more sophisticated architectures like attention networks or transformers to further enhance the adaptation capability of CBA.

- Extending the proposed method to other continual learning settings such as domain incremental learning and task incremental learning. The current work focused on class incremental learning. Applying the idea of modeling posterior distribution shifts using CBA to other CL settings could be an interesting direction. 

- Theoretical analysis of the proposed method. The authors provided some initial theoretical analysis of why the proposed bi-level optimization provides gradient alignment. More in-depth theoretical analysis of the properties and behavior of the CBA module could provide better insights.

- Applications to more complex real-world continual learning problems. The experiments were on image classification datasets. Testing the approach on more complex domains like natural language processing, speech recognition etc. would be valuable.

- Combining rehearsal and regularization-based continual learning methods with the proposed approach. The current work augmented rehearsal-based methods with CBA. Exploring regularization methods like EWC, SI etc. jointly with CBA could further boost performance.

- Long-term continual learning with hundreds or thousands of tasks. The experiments were limited to 10-20 tasks. Scaling up to much longer task sequences would pose additional challenges.

In summary, the key future directions are around developing more advanced CBA architectures, combining CBA with other CL approaches, testing on more complex and larger-scale problems, and providing more theoretical analysis. Advancing along these lines can further unlock the potential of the proposed idea of dynamically adapting to posterior distribution shifts.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a Continual Bias Adaptor (CBA) module to tackle catastrophic forgetting in online continual learning. Online continual learning aims to learn new knowledge from non-stationary streaming data while retaining previously learned knowledge. However, the changing data distribution over time causes catastrophic forgetting of past knowledge. To address this, the paper introduces CBA, which augments the classifier to adapt to the changing posterior distribution during training. CBA allows the classifier to learn a stable consolidation of past knowledge. Specifically, CBA dynamically models the posterior distribution shift through a parametric nonlinear transformation applied to the classifier outputs. The parameters of CBA and classifier are optimized through a bi-level procedure to consolidate past knowledge while learning new tasks. Experiments show CBA consistently improves several rehearsal-based baselines on standard benchmarks. A key advantage is CBA can be removed at test time, introducing no overhead. Overall, the paper provides a simple yet effective approach to tackle catastrophic forgetting in online continual learning by explicitly adapting to the posterior distribution shift.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a Continual Bias Adaptor (CBA) module to improve online continual learning (CL) methods. Online CL aims to learn continuously from non-stationary streaming data, but suffers from catastrophic forgetting of past knowledge. The paper argues that this is caused by shifts in both the label distribution and feature distribution between tasks. To address this, they introduce a CBA module that dynamically adapts the classifier network during training to model these distribution shifts. This allows the original classifier network to consolidate knowledge stably across tasks. 

Specifically, the CBA module is a small multi-layer perceptron that transforms the output logits of the classifier. The classifier and CBA module are trained with a bi-level optimization strategy. The inner loop updates the classifier on current task data to learn new knowledge. The outer loop updates the CBA module on the memory buffer to maintain old knowledge against distribution shifts. Experiments show the CBA module consistently improves several rehearsal-based online CL methods across benchmarks. The bi-level optimization and modeling of the full posterior distribution shift are vital for its effectiveness. During inference, the CBA module can be removed, introducing no computational overhead.

In summary, the key ideas are using a lightweight CBA module to dynamically model distribution shifts during online CL training, so the original classifier can learn a stable consolidation of knowledge across tasks. This improves performance while adding no inference cost. The bi-level optimization strategy is critical for training the CBA module effectively.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a Continual Bias Adaptor (CBA) module to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting in online continual learning. Online continual learning suffers from severe distribution shifts during training due to non-stationary streaming data. To tackle this, the authors introduce the CBA module which dynamically adapts the classifier network to fit the changing distributions over time. Specifically, CBA takes the outputs of the original classifier as input, and transforms them via a multi-layer perceptron to produce adjusted outputs that can better fit the evolving distributions. A bi-level optimization framework is used to update the classifier and CBA module - the classifier is updated to minimize the training loss on current data, while CBA is updated based on the performance on a memory buffer to avoid forgetting past knowledge. By assimilating the distribution shifts during training, CBA allows the classifier network to learn a stable consolidation of knowledge across tasks. A key advantage is that CBA can be removed during testing, avoiding any overhead. Experiments show CBA consistently improves various rehearsal-based methods on multiple benchmarks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of catastrophic forgetting in online continual learning. Specifically, it focuses on handling the distribution shift that arises in online continual learning settings due to the non-stationary and time-varying nature of the data streams. The key questions the paper tries to address are:

1) How to deal with the catastrophic distribution shifts caused by both label distribution changes (when new classes arrive) as well as feature distribution changes in online continual learning? 

2) How to accomplish a stable consolidation of knowledge across different tasks and time steps in online continual learning under such distribution shifts?

3) How to adaptively correct the bias arising from distribution shifts during online continual learning training process?

The main novelty of the paper is proposing a Continual Bias Adaptor (CBA) module to dynamically model and adapt to the posterior distribution shifts during online continual learning. The CBA augments the classifier to produce diverse posteriors and makes the original classifier learn an implicit stable posterior. This allows consolidating knowledge across tasks under distribution shifts. The CBA can be removed at test time.

In summary, the paper proposes a method to handle catastrophic distribution shifts in online continual learning by learning to adaptively correct bias using the proposed CBA module. This allows stable consolidation of knowledge across tasks.
