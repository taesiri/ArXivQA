# [From Text to CQL: Bridging Natural Language and Corpus Search Engine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13740)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Corpus Query Language (CQL) is critical for linguistic research to query annotated text corpora and conduct detailed linguistic analysis. However, manually crafting CQL queries is time-consuming and requires expertise.  
- There has been little focus on developing methods for automatically converting natural language queries into CQL despite advances in similar text-to-query tasks like text-to-SQL.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the novel task of Text-to-CQL to bridge the gap between natural language and CQL.
- A large-scale, diverse dataset is proposed for the task based on collocation extraction from corpora and manual annotation.
- LLM-based methodologies are presented, including prompt engineering and fine-tuning pre-trained models like BART.
- Specialized evaluation metrics are designed - Exact Match, Valid Accuracy, Execution Accuracy and a new metric CQLBLEU considering both syntactic and semantic correctness.

Main Contributions:
- A benchmark dataset to facilitate research in text-to-CQL conversion. 
- Innovative LLM-based conversion approaches adapting large pre-trained models for the task.
- Thorough experiments demonstrating efficacy of proposed techniques. The best performing model achieves 67.49% Exact Match score.
- Analysis providing insights into the complexity of mapping natural language to the intricate CQL syntax and semantics.

In summary, the paper introduces the novel and challenging text-to-CQL task with datasets, models and metrics to automate the conversion of natural language queries into complex CQL statements.
