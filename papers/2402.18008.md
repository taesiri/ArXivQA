## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Fast and Interpretable 2D Homography Decomposition: Similarity-Kernel-Similarity and Affine-Core-Affine Transformations":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of efficiently computing a 2D homography between two images given corresponding coplanar points. Homography computation is a key component in many computer vision tasks like image stitching, SLAM, camera calibration etc. Prior methods either lack geometric interpretability, are not efficient enough, or cannot handle general point correspondences.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes two new homography decomposition methods - Similarity-Kernel-Similarity (SKS) and Affine-Core-Affine (ACA) transformations. 

In SKS, the homography is decomposed into - two similarity transforms based on two anchor point correspondences that normalize the planes, and a middle kernel transform with 4 parameters that captures the projective distortion. This avoids expensive SVD computation.

ACA further improves efficiency by using three anchor points to compute two affine transforms, and a middle core transform with just 2 parameters. ACA can compute homography with just 85 FLOPs and no divisions.

The methods have clear geometric interpretation, extend prior art like SAP decomposition, can handle points/lines in a unified way, and the tensorized ACA can directly replace solvers in deep homography pipelines.

Main Contributions:

- Two efficient homography decomposition methods (SKS and ACA) with geometric interpretability
- ACA computes homography with minimum 85 FLOPs which is >100x faster than prior art
- Unified computation for points and lines based homography
- Extends prior Similarity-Affine-Projective decomposition  
- Polynomial formulation to express homography parameters directly in terms of point coordinates
- Tensorized ACA can readily replace solvers in deep homography estimation networks

The methods are comprehensively evaluated on both CPU and GPU through extensive experiments, and integrated into traditional RANSAC pipelines as well as deep networks to demonstrate speedups.
