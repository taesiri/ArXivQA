# [Parallax-Tolerant Unsupervised Deep Image Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08207)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we develop an unsupervised deep learning method for image stitching that is robust and can handle large parallax? 

Some key points:

- The paper notes limitations of prior work in image stitching using traditional feature-based methods and existing deep learning approaches:
    - Traditional methods rely on handcrafted features like SIFT that may not work well in all scenes
    - Existing deep methods have trouble with large parallax

- The paper proposes a new unsupervised deep image stitching method called UDIS++ that aims to overcome these limitations through:
    - A robust and flexible warp model that combines global homography and local thin-plate spline warping to handle parallax 
    - An unsupervised composition approach to seamlessly stitch images without introducing blur
    - An iterative strategy to adapt the warp model to new datasets/resolutions

- Experiments compare UDIS++ to prior methods and show improved performance, especially on challenging cases with low texture or large parallax.

So in summary, the main research question is how to develop a deep learning solution for image stitching that is robust and can handle parallax, which prior methods struggled with. The proposed UDIS++ method aims to address this through its flexible warp model and unsupervised composition approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents the LaTeX author guidelines for preparing papers for the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV). The main contributions are:

- It provides instructions and guidelines for formatting ICCV papers using LaTeX, including paper structure, section formatting, math equations, figures, tables, references etc. 

- It describes the submission process and policies around paper length, dual submissions, anonymization for blind review etc.

- It explains how to format the title, authors, affiliations, abstract, keywords, and outlines the overall two-column format for the main text. 

- It specifies formatting details like margins, fonts, captions, footnotes, headings etc. to ensure consistency across all paper submissions.

- It shows how to number sections, equations, figures, tables and format references/citations properly. 

- It provides tips on writing mathematics and including figures/images in a LaTeX document.

- Overall, it aims to help authors prepare high-quality papers that adhere to the ICCV formatting and style requirements, by providing this comprehensive LaTeX template and guidance. The consistent formatting is designed to facilitate high-quality peer review and eventual publication in the ICCV proceedings.

In summary, this paper mainly serves as an author's formatting guide for ICCV paper submission and covers all key aspects to help authors prepare papers using LaTeX that comply with the conference requirements.
