# [Can LLMs Separate Instructions From Data? And What Do We Even Mean By   That?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06833)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) lack a formal separation between "instructions" that are meant to be executed vs "data" that is meant to be passively processed. This causes issues like models failing to translate text that says "Don't translate this."
- There is no established definition or measure of instruction-data separation. This gap makes it hard to evaluate models and progress in this area.

Proposed Solution
- The authors introduce a formal measure called the "separation score" to quantify how differently a model responds to the same text being placed in either the instruction or data input.
- They propose an "empirical separation score" that can be estimated from model outputs without needing internal representations.
- They create a dataset called SEP for estimating the separation score. It has diverse tasks and probe/witness pairs to test if probes get executed or processed.

Key Contributions
- Formalizing instruction-data separation for the first time.
- Introducing a separation score measure and its empirical estimate. 
- Releasing the SEP dataset for evaluating separation.
- Finding that current major LLMs fail to adequately separate instructions from data, with scores as low as 0.225 for GPT-4.
- Showing separation does not improve with scale and may get worse, needing new architectures.

In summary, this paper identifies and formalizes the lack of instruction-data separation in LLMs as a key problem. It proposes quantitative solutions for defining and measuring this phenomenon, as well as demonstrating that more progress is needed by evaluating current models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a formal measure of instruction-data separation in language models, proposes an empirical variant that can be estimated from black-box outputs, introduces a dataset for this purpose, and evaluates several state-of-the-art models, finding that they fail to achieve high separation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a formal definition of "instruction-data separation" for language models, quantifying how differently a model treats probe strings when placed in the instruction input versus the data input. 

2) It introduces an empirical, computable proxy measure for estimating this separation score from model outputs, without needing access to internal model states.

3) It creates a new dataset, SEP (Should it be Executed or Processed?), for evaluating this separation score. The dataset contains diverse instruction-data pairs along with probe and witness strings.

4) It provides an experimental evaluation of several state-of-the-art language models using the proposed separation score and SEP dataset. The results show that current models lack reliable mechanisms for separating instructions from data according to the proposed measure.

In summary, the paper formalizes the notion of instruction-data separation, proposes a way to measure it, introduces a dataset for estimation, and empirically demonstrates that existing models perform poorly on this metric. The main contribution is a rigorous characterization and quantification of an important safety aspect in language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Instruction-data separation - The paper formally defines and quantifies the ability of language models to separate instructions that should be executed from passive data that should just be processed.

- Language models (LLMs) - The authors evaluate the instruction-data separation abilities of several state-of-the-art large language models, including GPT-3, GPT-4, Llama, and others.

- Safety and security - The lack of adequate instruction-data separation can lead to safety issues and vulnerabilities to manipulation or interference from third parties. 

- Formal measures - The paper introduces formal definitions and quantifiable measures related to instruction-data separation, aiming to provide rigor akin to other areas of computer science.

- Empirical separation score - A computable proxy measure of instruction-data separation that can be estimated from model outputs without access to internal states.

- Dataset (SEP) - The authors introduce a new dataset for evaluating instruction-data separation abilities, containing instruction prompts, data prompts, probes, and potential "surprise witnesses".

- Experimental evaluation - The paper reports experimental results evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on the proposed separation score and dataset, finding that none of them achieve adequate separation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The separation score in Definition 2 quantifies the difference in distribution between executing the probe in the instruction vs. data argument. However, it does not capture adversarial cases where the probe intentionally hides its effect. Could the definition be extended to address such cases?

2) The surprise witness provides an intuitive approximation for the separation score. But the choice of witness can significantly impact results. Are there principled ways to generate good witness candidates? 

3) The empirical separation score does not require model internals or probabilities. What other proxy metrics could be proposed that provide useful insights into instruction-data separation?

4) The dataset contains manually written probes and witnesses. Could the process be automated by leveraging the model's capabilities, similar to adversarial example generation?

5) The insistence level clearly impacts separation scores. Is there an optimal level that balances urgency and separation for real applications? How could this be determined?

6) Different task types lead to varying amounts of separation. Is there a underlying explanatory factor for this? Can this inform architectural choices to improve separation?

7) The system/user prompt split proxies instruction/data arguments. But models likely process them very differently. How could true separation be evaluated while accounting for this?

8) The results suggest separation may degrade with scale. Is this an inevitable trade-off or can alternative training methods or architectures improve scaling? 

9) The evaluation relies on short texts. How well would the metrics and findings transfer to long, multi-turn conversations? Are adjustments needed?

10) The separation problem seems fundamental. What other domains could benefit from analogous definitions and evaluations? Are there relevant cross-domain lessons?
