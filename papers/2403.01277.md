# [Optimal Integrated Task and Path Planning and Its Application to   Multi-Robot Pickup and Delivery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01277)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of integrated task and path planning for multi-robot systems. Specifically, it considers the scenario where a team of mobile robots needs to perform certain tasks like picking up objects from one location and dropping them off at another location in a workspace. Solving this problem involves (1) a task planner that decides which robot should perform which task and the order of tasks, and (2) a path planner that finds collision-free trajectories for the robots to move between different task locations. Developing an optimal integrated planner for such problems that scales well with increasing number of robots and tasks has remained a challenge.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a planning framework that combines an SMT-based optimal task planner with an optimal graph-based multi-robot path planner (CBS-PC). The key idea is to alternate between the task and path planners, refining the task assignment based on the cost of the computed collision-free paths, until the assignment cost matches the cost of the paths. 

The SMT-based task planner encodes the tasks, robots and operational constraints into SMT constraints that allow finding optimal task assignments efficiently through Boolean search. The path planner (CBS-PC) computes optimal collision-free trajectories for the robots based on the current task assignment. By iterating between these two components and adding constraints to avoid revisiting prior assignments, the framework converges to an optimal integrated plan.

Contributions:
The key contributions are:

- A general integrated planning algorithm that leverages interaction between an optimal task planner and optimal path planner to find optimal collision-free trajectories.

- An SMT-based formulation for task planning in multi-robot pick-up and delivery problems while incorporating various operational constraints.

- Adaptations of the CBS-PC multi-robot path planning algorithm to work with task assignment constraints and multiple goal locations per robot.

- Experimental evaluation on warehouse scenarios demonstrating improved performance over classical multi-agent planners in terms of scalability, computation time and plan quality.

The framework provides an extensible way to optimally solve complex multi-robot coordination problems with constraints.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a generic multi-robot planning mechanism that combines an optimal task planner based on SMT solving and an optimal path planner based on conflict-based search to efficiently generate optimal collision-free trajectories for complex logistics planning problems like multi-agent pickup and delivery in warehouses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a general multi-robot planning algorithm that induces an interaction between the task planner and the path planner to generate optimal collision-free trajectories for the robots to enable them to complete the mission successfully.

2. It provides an SMT-based task planner for object pick-and-drop applications in a warehouse scenario that is general enough to incorporate many application-specific operational constraints. 

3. It adapts the state-of-the-art graph-based multi-robot path planner MLA*-CBS-PC to deal with a sequence of goal locations for each robot using plans generated from the task planner.

4. It demonstrates the overall algorithm for multi-agent pickup and delivery application on predefined as well as randomly generated maps for various scenarios and compares it to the state-of-the-art classical planner ENHSP. The results show that the proposed integrated planning framework outperforms ENHSP in terms of computation time and quality of the generated plan.

In summary, the key contribution is an integrated planning framework that combines an SMT-based optimal task planner and a graph-based optimal path planner to efficiently solve complex multi-robot planning problems with various operational constraints.
