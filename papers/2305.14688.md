# [ExpertPrompting: Instructing Large Language Models to be Distinguished   Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14688)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the quality of responses from large language models like ChatGPT by instructing them to answer questions like distinguished experts. Specifically, the authors propose an "ExpertPrompting" method that first generates a customized expert identity description conditioned on the question, and then instructs the LLM to answer the question while adopting this expert identity. The main hypothesis seems to be that prompting LLMs in this way will elicit higher quality, more expert-like responses compared to vanilla prompting without providing an expert identity description. The authors test this via both automatic and human evaluations, and find that ExpertPrompting does improve answer quality over baseline methods. Developing prompting strategies to unlock the full potential of LLMs is an important area, and this paper provides evidence that explicitly conditioning on an expert identity is a promising approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called ExpertPrompting to improve the quality of answers from large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The key ideas are:1. Automatically generate a detailed description of an "expert identity" that is specialized for each question or instruction. For example, for a question on physics, describe an identity as a physicist with relevant background and experiences. 2. Use this expert identity to condition the LLM when prompting it to generate an answer. For example, "As a physicist, please explain the structure of an atom."3. Show that answers generated using ExpertPrompting are rated higher quality compared to vanilla prompting without the expert identity, based on evaluations using GPT-4.4. Use ExpertPrompting to collect improved instruction-following data from GPT-3.5, and train a new open-source chatbot called ExpertLLaMA which outperforms existing chatbots like Alpaca.So in summary, the main contribution is proposing ExpertPrompting as a simple but effective prompting strategy to elicit more expert, high-quality responses from LLMs for any type of question, and demonstrating its benefits through evaluations and by releasing improved data and models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes ExpertPrompting, an automated method to instruct large language models to give high quality responses by first generating expert profiles adapted to the question, and demonstrates its effectiveness by using it to create a new high performing open-source chatbot called ExpertLLaMA.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on ExpertPrompting compares to other related work on prompting large language models:- It proposes a novel method of ExpertPrompting that involves automatically generating a detailed expert identity/background tailored to each specific question, and then instructing the LLM to answer from the perspective of that expert. This goes beyond many existing prompting methods that use more generic prompts.- The expert identities are generated automatically using in-context learning rather than requiring manual creation of prompts. This makes the method more scalable.- The approach is model-agnostic and can work with any large language model. Many prompting papers focus on a specific model architecture.- The paper shows strong empirical results, with ExpertPrompting answers preferred 48.5% of the time over vanilla answers according to GPT-4 based evaluation. This helps demonstrate the efficacy of the method.- The authors use ExpertPrompting to create a new open source chatbot ExpertLLaMA which outperforms other publicly available models like Alpaca. Releasing the model/data is a useful contribution.- The simplicity of the approach contrasts with some other prompting methods that require more complex meta-learning or iterative procedures. ExpertPrompting is straightforward to implement.Overall, I would say the main innovations are in the intuitive idea of prompting for expert identities, the use of in-context learning to automate that process, and empirical evidence that this simple approach can yield significantly improved performance over vanilla prompting. The proposed method seems promising compared to related techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Enlarging the scale of the instruction data beyond the 52k Alpaca examples used in this work to further improve ExpertLLaMA. The authors mention this specifically in the conclusion. Using more data could allow the model to be trained to higher performance levels.- Exploring different methods for generating the expert identities beyond the In-Context Learning approach used here. The authors note that ExpertPrompting relies on high-quality expert identity descriptions, so improving this generation process could further boost performance. - Applying ExpertPrompting to other large language models besides GPT-3.5. The authors use GPT-3.5 in this work, but ExpertPrompting could likely also improve other LLMs. Evaluating on more models would strengthen the generalization of the method.- More rigorous validation of ExpertLLaMA's performance relative to ChatGPT. The authors claim ExpertLLaMA reaches 96% of ChatGPT's capability but note this requires more validation. More extensive benchmarks could better quantify ExpertLLaMA's abilities.- Extension of ExpertPrompting to other tasks beyond chat assistants. The authors focus on chatbots here, but suggest ExpertPrompting may generalize more broadly as a prompting strategy. Testing on other LLM applications could reveal further benefits.- Iteratively re-training ExpertLLaMA on its own outputs to improve quality, similar to approaches like Anthropic's Constitutional AI. The authors train on GPT-3.5 outputs, but iterative training could lead to further gains.So in summary, the key suggestions are around improvements to the prompting, applying the method to more models and tasks, scaled up data and benchmarking, and iterative training procedures. The core ExpertPrompting idea seems very promising and there are many interesting ways to build on this initial work.

The paper presents a method called ExpertPrompting that improves the answering quality of large language models (LLMs) by instructing them to respond as domain experts. It first uses in-context learning to automatically generate detailed descriptions of expert identities tailored to each question. Then it conditions the LLM on this expertise description when prompting it to answer, eliciting more knowledgeable responses. The authors apply ExpertPrompting to a diverse set of 52k questions using GPT-3.5, creating higher quality training data. They use this to train ExpertLLaMA, an open-source conversational agent. Evaluations using GPT-4 show the expert data is significantly better than vanilla data, and ExpertLLaMA outperforms other assistants like Alpaca and Vicuna, achieving 96% of ChatGPT's performance. The key ideas are customizing prompts to make LLMs act like experts, and using this to create better training data and models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a method called ExpertPrompting to improve the quality of responses from large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT when given an instruction. ExpertPrompting first uses in-context learning to automatically generate a detailed description of an expert identity that is specialized for each specific instruction. For example, for an instruction asking how to explain the structure of an atom, it might generate an identity description of a physicist with expertise on atomic structure. It then provides this expert identity along with the original instruction to the LLM. Based on this approach, the authors apply ExpertPrompting to a large set of 52k instructions using the LLM GPT-3.5, and generate higher quality responses according to GPT-4 evaluations. Using these expert responses as training data, they train a new conversational agent called ExpertLLaMA which outperforms other open source agents like Alpaca. Experiments show ExpertLLaMA achieves 96% of ChatGPT's performance on a benchmark while using a weaker LLM backbone. Overall, ExpertPrompting is a simple but effective method to automatically improve prompting and produce higher quality instruction-following data and models. The ExpertLLaMA model is publicly released.
