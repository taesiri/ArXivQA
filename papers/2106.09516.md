# [Transductive Few-Shot Learning: Clustering is All You Need?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09516)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a general formulation for clustering and transductive few-shot learning that integrates prototype-based objectives (e.g. K-means, K-modes), Laplacian regularization, and supervision constraints. 2. It develops a concave-convex relaxation of the problem and derives an efficient block-coordinate bound optimization algorithm called SLK with convergence guarantees. The algorithm performs parallel updates of the assignment variables.3. It adapts the formulation for transductive few-shot learning tasks, where the goal is to classify query samples given a support set with a few labeled examples per class.4. It provides a thorough convergence analysis of SLK based on point-to-set maps and Cauchy sequences. 5. It evaluates SLK extensively on clustering and few-shot learning tasks, showing it is competitive in terms of accuracy and optimization quality while scaling to large problems.6. Surprisingly, it finds that basic clustering methods like K-means perform competitively to state-of-the-art transductive few-shot learning techniques on standard benchmarks, indicating potential limitations of current evaluations.In summary, the central hypothesis is that formulating few-shot learning as a constrained clustering problem, relaxing it appropriately, and optimizing it with a scalable block-coordinate approach can yield an effective and efficient solution for transductive few-shot tasks. The experiments aim to validate the viability of this approach against the state-of-the-art.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a general formulation and solution for transductive few-shot learning based on clustering. The main contributions are:- They formulate transductive few-shot learning as a constrained clustering problem with a Laplacian regularization term and supervision constraints from the support set. - They propose a concave-convex relaxation for the formulation and derive an efficient block-coordinate bound optimization algorithm called SLK to solve it. The algorithm has parallel updates and convergence guarantees.- They adapt the formulation for two clustering objectives - K-means (SLK-Means) and K-modes (SLK-MS).- They provide a thorough convergence analysis using point-to-set maps and prove the algorithm converges to a stationary point.- They evaluate the clustering methods extensively on several datasets and show they achieve competitive accuracy and optimization quality compared to baselines. - They apply SLK-Means and SLK-MS to few-shot learning tasks on miniImageNet, tieredImageNet and CUB datasets. Without any meta-learning, they show the methods outperform many recent meta-learning techniques by significant margins.- Surprisingly, they find even basic K-means achieves competitive accuracy, questioning the usefulness of complex few-shot learning methods. Their results indicate simple clustering could be an effective baseline for few-shot learning.In summary, the main contribution is a general clustering formulation for transductive few-shot learning that has an efficient optimization algorithm and achieves excellent empirical performance compared to recent few-shot learning techniques. The simplicity and effectiveness questions the need for complex meta-learning based techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points of comparison between this paper and other research on transductive few-shot learning:- This paper proposes a general formulation for constrained clustering that integrates prototype-based objectives, Laplacian regularization, and supervision constraints. Many other recent transductive few-shot learning methods have focused more narrowly on specialized models tailored for few-shot tasks, often relying on complex meta-learning.- The proposed method does not require episodic training or complex optimization used in meta-learning techniques. Instead, it is based on direct training on the base classes and transductive constrained clustering on the novel classes. This is a simpler and more straightforward approach compared to meta-learning.- The paper shows strong experimental results, achieving state-of-the-art on few-shot benchmarks. Surprisingly, even basic clustering methods like K-means perform competitively, suggesting limitations of current few-shot benchmarks. Many recent papers have reported small incremental gains, while this work questions if those gains are meaningful.- The proposed formulation enables easy integration of Laplacian regularization, which leverages the manifold structure of data. Most other transductive few-shot methods do not explicitly account for the manifold structure. Laplacian regularization has been widely used in semi-supervised learning but not as commonly for few-shot learning.- The optimization method scales easily to large datasets with a parallel block coordinate descent approach. Many transductive few-shot methods rely on expensive operations like matrix inversions, while this method has lower computational complexity.- The convergence and optimization quality is thoroughly analyzed, unlike most few-shot papers which focus only on accuracy results.Overall, this paper presents a principled transductive learning framework with strong experimental results. The surprising effectiveness of even simple clustering baselines questions the progress claimed by much more complex recent few-shot learning literature. The proposed formulation and scalable optimization enable practical applications without relying on intricate meta-learning methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing optimized and scalable versions of their SLK algorithm to handle very large-scale clustering and few-shot learning problems. The authors point out that their current MATLAB implementation can already scale up to large problems, but suggest exploring ways to further optimize and distribute their approach.- Extending their framework to semi-supervised clustering and few-shot learning scenarios. The authors currently focus on the transductive setting, but suggest it could be useful to explore versions that can also leverage additional unlabeled data. - Applying their method to other few-shot learning benchmarks and tasks beyond image classification, such as few-shot object detection and segmentation. The authors demonstrate strong performance on standard few-shot image classification datasets, but suggest their clustering approach may generalize well to other few-shot computer vision problems.- Further theoretical analysis of the proposed model and optimization procedure, for instance deriving rates of convergence or sample complexity bounds. The authors provide a convergence analysis, but suggest more theoretical characterization could be useful.- Exploring the integration of their model within deep neural networks, for end-to-end few-shot learning. The current work uses pretrained features, but learning the features and clustering jointly could be beneficial.- Developing extensions of their model that can handle heterogeneous data types and modalities beyond vectorial features. The authors focus on standard vectorial data, but suggest extensions to graph or sequence data could be relevant.In summary, the main future directions pointed out relate to scaling up the approach, applying it to new few-shot learning problems and modalities, further theoretical analysis, and integration within end-to-end deep learning frameworks. The authors position their work as opening up a new clustering perspective on few-shot learning.
