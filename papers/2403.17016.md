# [HEAL-ViT: Vision Transformers on a spherical mesh for medium-range   weather forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17016)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Medium-range weather forecasting (10 day forecasts) is an important and challenging task. Several machine learning models have shown skill in this area, outperforming numerical weather prediction (NWP) models on some metrics.
- Vision Transformer (ViT) based models work well but suffer from distortion and disproportionate compute needed for the poles when using a latitude-longitude grid. Graph-based models use a spherical mesh to avoid this issue but are more memory intensive.
- Goal is to get the benefits of both approaches - efficient spatial representation and ability to leverage vision transformers.

Proposed Solution:
- Present HEAL-ViT, a novel architecture that allows standard vision transformers to be used on a spherical HEALPix mesh.

- Encoder maps longitude-latitude grid to HEALPix mesh using a graph network.

- Processor applies a U-Net style architecture with SWIN transformers to model interactions between mesh nodes. Local self-attention is done within "windows" on the mesh.

- Windows are shifted on the mesh to enable modeling long-range dependencies, exploiting favorable properties of the HEALPix scheme.

- Decoder maps processed mesh back to longitude-latitude grid.

Contributions:
- Shows how to adapt SWIN transformers to work directly on a spherical HEALPix mesh, avoiding distortion issues with latitude-longitude grids.

- Leverages benefits of vision transformers and graph-based approaches for weather forecasting.

- Achieves better bias accumulation and less blurring compared to other ML weather models.

- Has lower memory and compute requirements compared to models using lat-lon grids, useful for operational forecasting.

- Can serve as a general approach for applying vision transformers to geo-spatial data.

In summary, HEAL-ViT combines the representational benefits of a spherical mesh with the modeling capabilities of vision transformers to advance machine learning based weather forecasting.
