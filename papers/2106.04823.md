# [Taxonomy of Machine Learning Safety: A Survey and Primer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04823)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, this paper appears to do a comprehensive review and establish a taxonomy of machine learning techniques that can help improve the safety and robustness of ML models, particularly for safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles. The key aspects covered seem to be:

1. Identifying the gaps between traditional engineering safety standards/methods (which are designed for code-based systems) and the characteristics of modern ML systems. 

2. Reviewing the fundamental limitations and vulnerabilities of ML models from a safety perspective, such as lack of interpretability/transparency, inability to formally verify, susceptibility to adversarial attacks etc.

3. Proposing a taxonomy that categorizes existing ML research techniques into different safety strategies - inherently safe design, enhancing robustness, and runtime error detection. 

4. Providing a detailed literature review of techniques in each of these safety categories, like methods for model transparency, robust training, uncertainty estimation, adversarial defense etc.

5. Highlighting challenges and opportunities in developing safer ML systems that are dependable for deployment in the real world. 

So in summary, the key research contribution seems to be the proposed taxonomy that connects ML safety needs to relevant techniques, as well as the comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in ML safety research. The taxonomy and review seem intended to serve as a guide for developing safer ML systems by choosing techniques that cover diverse safety strategies.
