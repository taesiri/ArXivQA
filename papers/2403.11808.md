# [Dynamic Tuning Towards Parameter and Inference Efficiency for ViT   Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for Vision Transformer (ViT) adaptation focus on improving parameter efficiency during fine-tuning by updating only a small subset of parameters. However, they overlook the inference efficiency after adaptation. This poses challenges when deploying large ViTs to downstream tasks, especially when the model is computationally demanding.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Dynamic Tuning (DyT), a new approach to improve both parameter and inference efficiency for ViT adaptation. The key ideas are:

1) Insert lightweight adapter modules into ViT to maintain parameter efficiency.

2) Design a token dispatcher before each transformer block to distinguish informative tokens from redundant ones. Only informative tokens are processed by the original transformer block and adapter, while redundant tokens skip the block and are only processed by the adapter. This reduces computation at inference time.

3) Explore multiple variants (e.g. skipping tokens in attention or MLP blocks) to find the best practice of DyT.

4) Introduce a Mixture-of-Experts adapter to further enhance adaptation capability.

Main Contributions:

1) DyT achieves superior parameter efficiency over full fine-tuning and competitive accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods on VTAB-1K benchmark, while only requiring 71%-85% FLOPs.

2) Experiments on image classification, video recognition and semantic segmentation show DyT's efficiency generalizes across domains and tasks. For example, on ADE20K segmentation, DyT surpasses full-tuning accuracy with 21 GFLOPs reduction.

3) Analysis on the impact of dispatch variants, adapter designs, and visualizations offer new insights into efficient ViT adaptation.

In summary, this work unifies parameter and inference perspectives for efficient ViT fine-tuning, achieving significant efficiency improvements with competitive accuracy across vision tasks. The design and evaluations of DyT provide a promising direction for efficient model deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a dynamic tuning approach called DyT that improves both parameter and inference efficiency for vision transformer adaptation by using lightweight adapters and a token dispatcher to selectively activate or deactivate tokens, allowing less informative tokens to skip transformer blocks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach called Dynamic Tuning (DyT) to improve both parameter efficiency and inference efficiency for Vision Transformer (ViT) adaptation. Specifically:

1) It designs a token dispatcher to distinguish informative tokens from less important ones, allowing the latter to dynamically skip transformer blocks during inference to reduce computation.

2) It explores multiple variants to determine the best practice of skipping tokens in different components (attention blocks, MLP blocks, layers).

3) It introduces an enhanced adapter module based on the mixture-of-experts mechanism to further boost adaptation performance.  

4) It validates the effectiveness of DyT for ViT adaptation across various tasks including image recognition, video recognition, and semantic segmentation. The method achieves superior parameter and inference efficiency compared to prior arts while maintaining competitive performance.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the DyT approach to simultaneously improve parameter efficiency and inference efficiency for adapting Vision Transformers to downstream tasks, which has not been well explored previously. The efficiency benefits are validated across diverse vision tasks.
