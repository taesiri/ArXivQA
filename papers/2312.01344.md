# [tsMorph: generation of semi-synthetic time series to understand   algorithm performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Time series forecasting is important for decision making in many domains. However, there is limited understanding of the conditions and data characteristics that lead to good or bad performance of forecasting algorithms. 
- Empirical analysis can provide such understanding, but sources of realistic time series data for benchmarking are limited. Existing approaches for generating synthetic data focus on realism, not on systematic variation of data to study algorithm performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes tsMorph, a simple approach to generate semi-synthetic time series through dataset morphing. It creates a sequence of datasets gradually transforming from a source to a target time series.
- The morphing uses a linear transformation function that spaces the generated series equally between the source and target. This results in a gradual departure from the source's characteristics and convergence to the target's.

Main Contributions:
- Adaptation of dataset morphing idea to time series data, providing a new tool for generating sequences of semi-synthetic data.
- Demonstration of using tsMorph to assess performance of LSTM networks on time series forecasting. Experiments show tsMorph can systematically vary data characteristics.
- Even simple analysis of correlated meta-features reveals insights about conditions impacting relative LSTM performance, highlighting potential of tsMorph for understanding algorithm behavior.
- Discussion of extensions like non-equal length time series, comparing multiple algorithms, using generated data to expand meta-learning approaches.

In summary, the paper presents tsMorph as an effective approach to generate controlled variations of time series to support gaining nuanced understanding of forecasting algorithm behaviors and performance boundaries. Simple analysis shows its promise; advanced methods can extract further insights.
