# [Can Temporal Information Help with Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13046)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: Can temporal information help with contrastive self-supervised learning for videos?More specifically, the authors aim to investigate:1) Whether simply adding temporal augmentations to existing contrastive self-supervised learning (CSL) frameworks is sufficient to improve video representation learning. 2) How to better incorporate temporal information into CSL frameworks to learn useful video representations.3) Whether using multiple video prediction tasks jointly can further help with video CSL. The key hypothesis is that directly applying temporal augmentations is not enough, but explicitly modeling temporal information as extra self-supervision signals can significantly improve video CSL.To summarize, the paper focuses on studying the effects of temporal information on video contrastive self-supervised learning, and proposes a new framework called TaCo that integrates temporal knowledge more effectively for learning better video representations.
