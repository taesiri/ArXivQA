# [Multiple-Input Auto-Encoder Guided Feature Selection for IoT Intrusion   Detection Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15511)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for IoT networks is challenging due to the heterogeneity and high dimensionality of data collected from diverse IoT devices. 
- Existing machine learning models struggle to handle such heterogeneous and high-dimensional data from multiple inputs.
- Sophisticated attacks like Slowloris can evade detection by mimicking regular user traffic patterns.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Multiple-Input Autoencoder (MIAE) neural network architecture that can handle heterogeneous data inputs of different dimensions using multiple encoder branches.
- MIAE is trained in an unsupervised manner to learn a joint lower-dimensional representation that retains characteristic features from the multiple inputs. 
- To further eliminate redundant features from the MIAE representation, the authors propose Multiple-Input Autoencoder Guided Feature Selection (MIAEFS) which adds a feature selection layer after the MIAE representation layer.

Main Contributions:
- MIAE outperforms other representation learning models like Autoencoders, PCA etc. in detecting attacks from heterogeneous IoT data.
- MIAE+Random Forest classifier achieves 96.5% accuracy in detecting sophisticated Slowloris attacks.
- MIAEFS further improves detection performance by discarding redundant features from MIAE representation.
- Experiments show MIAE and MIAEFS have low complexity suitable for IoT devices, with high attack detection accuracy.
- Analysis shows MIAEFS can select the most intrinsic features on image data rather than background features.

In summary, the paper proposes novel neural network architectures MIAE and MIAEFS to effectively handle heterogeneous and high-dimensional IoT data for building accurate IDSs. A key benefit is unsupervised learning capability to reduce labeling costs.
