# [Do Similar Entities have Similar Embeddings?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge graph embedding models (KGEMs) are widely used to learn vector representations of entities in knowledge graphs. A common assumption is that these models position similar entities close together in the embedding space (called the KGE entity similarity assumption). 
- However, this assumption is rarely formally evaluated. KGEMs are typically only evaluated on link prediction performance using rank-based metrics like Hits@K and MRR, not on how well they group similar entities.
- So the key research questions are: (1) To what extent does proximity in the embedding space actually align with similarity of entities in the original graph? (2) Is link prediction performance correlated with embedding similarity? (3) Do different KGEMs focus on different subsets of predicates that influence their notion of similarity?

Proposed Solution:
- Compare the neighbors of entities based on graph similarity (using Jaccard similarity of 1-hop and 2-hop subgraphs) versus neighbors based on embedding proximity using Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO)
- Correlate rank-based link prediction metrics like MRR with RBO to see if good link prediction correlates with embedding similarity
- Analyze importance of different predicates in determining neighbors for different KGEMs 

Main Contributions:
- Show that different KGEMs fulfill the KGE entity similarity assumption only to a limited extent; results vary substantially per model and per entity class
- Demonstrate that link prediction performance does not reliably correlate with adherence to entity similarity assumption 
- Find that different KGEMs focus on different subsets of predicates to determine semantic similarity, explaining differences in notions of similarity

Implications:
- Choosing KGEM solely based on link prediction performance may be suboptimal for tasks relying on semantic similarity
- Need more nuanced KGEM selection based on predicate importance for entities/classes of interest 
- Assumption of similar embeddings reflecting entity similarity does not universally hold and needs careful evaluation


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper challenges the common assumption that knowledge graph embedding models inherently capture entity similarity from the graph structure by showing empirically that different models encode different, often inconsistent notions of similarity that do not reliably align with graph-based similarity, implying cautions for usage in downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Showing that different KGEMs fulfill the "KGE entity similarity assumption" only to a limited extent. In particular, results can vary substantially on a per-class basis. Moreover, the semantics of classes is inequally captured by different KGEMs, highlighting that they expose different notions of similarity.

2. Demonstrating that in most cases, performance in link prediction does not correlate with a model's adherence to the KGE entity similarity assumption. This shows that rank-based metrics cannot be reliably used as a proxy for assessing the semantic consistency of the embedding space. 

3. Showing that different KGEMs focus on different subsets of predicates to learn similar embeddings for related entities in the KG. This suggests that the notion of similarity in the embedding space is partially influenced by the distribution of predicates in the close neighborhood of entities.

In summary, the main contribution is challenging the common assumption that entity similarity in knowledge graphs is inherently preserved in knowledge graph embeddings, through an extensive empirical analysis from different perspectives. The findings have important implications for the use of KGEMs in downstream applications relying on accurate capturing of entity similarity.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using the Jaccard coefficient to measure the similarity between entity subgraphs. What are the advantages of using the Jaccard coefficient over other graph similarity measures like graph edit distance? What are some limitations?

2. The paper experiments with using 1-hop and 2-hop subgraphs around entities to represent their graph context. What additional information does considering 2-hop subgraphs provide compared to just 1-hop? What challenges does it introduce? 

3. Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) is used to compare the ranked lists of similar entities from the graph and embedding spaces. Why was RBO chosen over other ranked list similarity measures? What parameters of RBO can be tuned and how do they impact the notion of similarity being measured?

4. The paper demonstrates that rank-based link prediction metrics like MRR do not reliably correlate with graph-based entity similarity (RBO). Why might this be the case? Does this finding challenge common practices around KGEM evaluation and selection?

5. The analysis reveals substantial variation in the embedding of entity similarity across models and entity types. What factors might explain why some models better capture the semantics of certain entity classes than others? 

6. The paper hypothesizes that differences in entity similarity across models stem from them weighting predicates differently. How exactly could differential predicate weighting manifest itself in entity embeddings? What analysis could further test this hypothesis?

7. Are there any potential limitations or caveats around using RBO for comparing ranked lists of entities from such different sources as graph search and vector space proximity?

8. Could the graph-based notion of entity similarity using subgraph overlaps be improved or expanded? What other graph search strategies could complement it?

9. The paper focuses exclusively on entity similarity. Wouldanalogous analysis of relation/predicate similarity be feasible? If so, how should graph and embedding based relation similarity be compared?  

10. What steps could be taken to design a KGEM that more intentionally and directly encodes graph-based entity similarity in its embeddings? What objectives could be incorporated during training to achieve this?
