# [Do Similar Entities have Similar Embeddings?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge graph embedding models (KGEMs) are widely used to learn vector representations of entities in knowledge graphs. A common assumption is that these models position similar entities close together in the embedding space (called the KGE entity similarity assumption). 
- However, this assumption is rarely formally evaluated. KGEMs are typically only evaluated on link prediction performance using rank-based metrics like Hits@K and MRR, not on how well they group similar entities.
- So the key research questions are: (1) To what extent does proximity in the embedding space actually align with similarity of entities in the original graph? (2) Is link prediction performance correlated with embedding similarity? (3) Do different KGEMs focus on different subsets of predicates that influence their notion of similarity?

Proposed Solution:
- Compare the neighbors of entities based on graph similarity (using Jaccard similarity of 1-hop and 2-hop subgraphs) versus neighbors based on embedding proximity using Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO)
- Correlate rank-based link prediction metrics like MRR with RBO to see if good link prediction correlates with embedding similarity
- Analyze importance of different predicates in determining neighbors for different KGEMs 

Main Contributions:
- Show that different KGEMs fulfill the KGE entity similarity assumption only to a limited extent; results vary substantially per model and per entity class
- Demonstrate that link prediction performance does not reliably correlate with adherence to entity similarity assumption 
- Find that different KGEMs focus on different subsets of predicates to determine semantic similarity, explaining differences in notions of similarity

Implications:
- Choosing KGEM solely based on link prediction performance may be suboptimal for tasks relying on semantic similarity
- Need more nuanced KGEM selection based on predicate importance for entities/classes of interest 
- Assumption of similar embeddings reflecting entity similarity does not universally hold and needs careful evaluation
