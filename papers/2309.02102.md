# [Iterative Superquadric Recomposition of 3D Objects from Multiple Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02102)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: how can we recompose 3D objects from multiple 2D views using simple volumetric primitives, without access to 3D supervision? Specifically, the authors propose a framework called Iterative Superquadric reComposition of Objects (ISCO) that can take multiple 2D views of an object as input and reconstruct its 3D shape using superquadrics. The key aspects are:- The method does not require 3D supervision. It works directly from 2D silhouettes extracted from images.- It represents the 3D shape using an interpretable composition of simple superquadric primitives. - It fits the superquadrics in an iterative coarse-to-fine manner, first capturing overall shape and then finer details.- Each superquadric is optimized via a differentiable renderer to match the input 2D views, without training any neural network model.The central hypothesis is that by optimizing superquadric parameters through a renderer, and adding them iteratively to explain silhouettes from different views, the method can accurately recompose 3D objects and their parts without 3D supervision.In summary, the paper aims to address 3D shape abstraction from multiple views using an interpretable superquadric representation, in a self-supervised manner without 3D ground truth data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing an iterative self-supervised algorithm called Iterative Superquadric reComposition of Objects (ISCO) that can recompose 3D objects from 2D views using superquadrics, without needing 3D supervision. The key ideas are:- The method optimizes the parameters of superquadric primitives to best match the 2D silhouettes rendered from different viewpoints of the 3D object. This is done using a differentiable renderer based on volumetric ray marching.- Superquadrics are added iteratively one at a time. Each new superquadric is initialized in the region with highest reconstruction error. This provides a coarse-to-fine decomposition from large object parts to finer details. - By optimizing superquadric parameters directly on the target object instance, the method does not need a dataset of 3D shapes for training. This makes it more robust for novel objects.- Experiments show the method reconstructs shapes accurately on ShapeNet and ShapeNet-Part datasets. It also provides semantically meaningful part segmentations, outperforming prior instance-based methods. The method transfers well to real images from the CO3D dataset.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a self-supervised iterative algorithm to decompose 3D objects into simple superquadric parts using only 2D views as input. The iterative coarse-to-fine approach and direct optimization provide good reconstruction and part segmentation without 3D supervision.
