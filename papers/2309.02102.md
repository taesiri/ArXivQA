# [Iterative Superquadric Recomposition of 3D Objects from Multiple Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02102)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: how can we recompose 3D objects from multiple 2D views using simple volumetric primitives, without access to 3D supervision? Specifically, the authors propose a framework called Iterative Superquadric reComposition of Objects (ISCO) that can take multiple 2D views of an object as input and reconstruct its 3D shape using superquadrics. The key aspects are:- The method does not require 3D supervision. It works directly from 2D silhouettes extracted from images.- It represents the 3D shape using an interpretable composition of simple superquadric primitives. - It fits the superquadrics in an iterative coarse-to-fine manner, first capturing overall shape and then finer details.- Each superquadric is optimized via a differentiable renderer to match the input 2D views, without training any neural network model.The central hypothesis is that by optimizing superquadric parameters through a renderer, and adding them iteratively to explain silhouettes from different views, the method can accurately recompose 3D objects and their parts without 3D supervision.In summary, the paper aims to address 3D shape abstraction from multiple views using an interpretable superquadric representation, in a self-supervised manner without 3D ground truth data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing an iterative self-supervised algorithm called Iterative Superquadric reComposition of Objects (ISCO) that can recompose 3D objects from 2D views using superquadrics, without needing 3D supervision. The key ideas are:- The method optimizes the parameters of superquadric primitives to best match the 2D silhouettes rendered from different viewpoints of the 3D object. This is done using a differentiable renderer based on volumetric ray marching.- Superquadrics are added iteratively one at a time. Each new superquadric is initialized in the region with highest reconstruction error. This provides a coarse-to-fine decomposition from large object parts to finer details. - By optimizing superquadric parameters directly on the target object instance, the method does not need a dataset of 3D shapes for training. This makes it more robust for novel objects.- Experiments show the method reconstructs shapes accurately on ShapeNet and ShapeNet-Part datasets. It also provides semantically meaningful part segmentations, outperforming prior instance-based methods. The method transfers well to real images from the CO3D dataset.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a self-supervised iterative algorithm to decompose 3D objects into simple superquadric parts using only 2D views as input. The iterative coarse-to-fine approach and direct optimization provide good reconstruction and part segmentation without 3D supervision.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents an iterative self-supervised algorithm called ISCO that recomposes 3D objects from multiple 2D views into abstract 3D shapes using superquadrics, without requiring 3D supervision during training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents an iterative algorithm for reconstructing 3D objects from multiple 2D views using superquadrics. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:- Most prior work on 3D shape decomposition and abstraction has focused on learning-based approaches applied to datasets of 3D shapes. This includes methods like SQ, BAE, RIM, etc. that learn shape priors from large 3D datasets. In contrast, this paper takes an instance-based approach that operates on a single object without training.- Compared to other instance-based superquadric fitting methods like EMS and NBP that use 3D point clouds as input, this approach only requires 2D views as input. Despite the weaker supervision, it achieves more accurate 3D reconstruction quantitatively.- The proposed iterative procedure for initializing and optimizing superquadrics is novel. It allows focusing superquadrics on particular object parts and representing details in a coarse-to-fine manner. This provides better part-level decomposition than non-iterative baselines.- By working from 2D views, the method is naturally applicable to real-world images, as shown through experiments on the CO3D dataset. Other instance-based methods rely on 3D point clouds extracted from multi-view reconstruction.- For segmentation and part labeling, the instance-based method struggles to achieve consistency across objects of the same class. But it still produces competitive or better quantitative results than supervised methods by decomposing salient object parts.In summary, the key distinctions are the iterative superquadric fitting from 2D views without training, resulting in a method that requires less supervision, while achieving strong performance on 3D reconstruction and part segmentation compared to related works. The trade-off is lack of generalization across instances.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Applying the iterative superquadric recomposition method to more complex 3D scenes with multiple objects. The current method focuses on single objects, but extending it to full scenes could be an interesting direction. This would require handling occlusions and interactions between objects.- Combining the iterative superquadric fitting with some learned shape priors or constraints. For example, using a neural network to help guide the placement and refinement of superquadrics could improve results, especially for challenging geometries. - Exploring alternative primitive shapes beyond superquadrics that may represent certain 3D structures more compactly or precisely. The authors suggest potential primitives like cuboids, spheres, or convexes.- Improving runtime performance through optimizations or neural rendering techniques. The current method can be slow due to the need for iterative optimization. Reducing the computational costs would make it more practical.- Extending the method to use not only silhouettes but also color, texture, and lighting information during the fitting process. This could improve reconstruction quality.- Applying the approach to video sequences rather than static images to take advantage of temporal consistency constraints. Tracking objects over time could help resolve ambiguities.So in summary, some of the main future work directions include extending to full 3D scenes, combining learning-based shape priors, exploring new primitives, improving runtime, leveraging color/texture cues, and using video as input. Overall the iterative recomposition idea seems very promising.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes Iterative Superquadric reComposition of Objects (ISCO), an unsupervised method to decompose 3D objects into simple superquadric parts from only 2D silhouette views of the object. Without access to 3D training data, ISCO directly optimizes the superquadric parameters by comparing rendered 3D views to input 2D silhouettes using a differentiable renderer. It starts with coarse shapes covering large object regions and iteratively adds new superquadrics to explain finer details, initializing them in high error areas. Experiments show ISCO accurately reconstructs objects and identifies semantic parts better than prior instance-based methods, even generalizing to real images without 3D supervision. As an unsupervised approach acting on instances, ISCO provides simple 3D abstractions without the need for costly 3D training data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a framework called Iterative Superquadric reComposition of Objects (ISCO) to reconstruct 3D objects from multiple 2D views using superquadrics. The key idea is to iteratively fit superquadrics to the target object by comparing rendered and real object silhouettes. In each iteration, a new superquadric is initialized in the region where the reconstruction error is highest and then optimized to fit that part of the object. This allows the method to move from coarse to fine details, first capturing overall shape and then finer aspects of the object. The optimization is done by directly adjusting the superquadric parameters through gradient descent, enabled by a differentiable renderer. Experiments on ShapeNet and ShapeNet-Part datasets demonstrate that ISCO can accurately reconstruct 3D shapes from just 2D views. It also identifies semantic parts of objects well, outperforming recent instance-based superquadric fitting methods that use 3D point clouds as input. Qualitative results on real images from the CO3D dataset further highlight the applicability to real-world objects. A key advantage of ISCO is that it works on individual objects without needing a dataset of 3D shapes for training. The iterative coarse-to-fine fitting strategy is shown to be crucial for good performance compared to jointly optimizing all superquadrics. Overall, the paper presents a novel self-supervised framework for reconstructing 3D objects from 2D views using simple interpretable parts.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes Iterative Superquadric Recomposition of Objects (ISCO), a self-supervised algorithm to recompose 3D objects from multiple 2D views using superquadrics. The key idea is to optimize the superquadric parameters that compose the 3D object by comparing its rendered 3D view with the input 2D image silhouette. ISCO starts with no superquadrics and iteratively adds new ones to regions with high reconstruction error. Each superquadric is optimized via a differentiable renderer to match the input views. By starting with coarse regions and progressing to finer details, ISCO provides a simple coarse-to-fine 3D abstraction of the object composed of superquadrics representing its parts. ISCO does not require 3D supervision or neural network training. Experiments show it provides better 3D reconstruction and part decomposition than previous instance-based methods, even on real images.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of decomposing 3D objects into semantic parts using simple geometric primitives, specifically superquadrics. The key issues and questions it tackles are:- How to decompose 3D objects into meaningful parts using superquadrics without relying on 3D supervision or training on a dataset of 3D shapes.- How to fit superquadrics to an object instance given only 2D views of the object, rather than 3D data like point clouds. - How to consistently decompose different instances into semantically similar parts, without training a model with part annotations.- How to incrementally build up a decomposition by adding superquadrics in a coarse-to-fine manner to cover the object and abstract its shape at different levels of detail.In summary, the main problem is obtaining consistent and meaningful part-based abstractions of 3D objects using superquadrics, without 3D supervision or training, given only 2D views as input. The key question is how to effectively fit superquadrics to 2D silhouettes in an iterative coarse-to-fine manner to achieve this.
