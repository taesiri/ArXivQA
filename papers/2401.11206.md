# [InferAligner: Inference-Time Alignment for Harmlessness through   Cross-Model Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11206)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes InferAligner, a novel inference-time alignment method that utilizes cross-model guidance with safety steering vectors from an aligned model to modify activations and guide target models to respond safely to harmful inputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing InferAligner, a novel inference-time alignment method that utilizes cross-model guidance for harmlessness alignment. Specifically, InferAligner extracts safety steering vectors from an aligned model and uses them to modify the activations of the target model when responding to harmful inputs, guiding the target model to provide harmless responses. The key benefits highlighted in the paper are that InferAligner is simple to use, does not require training, can be effectively applied even without access to aligned models, and significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining performance on downstream tasks. The experiments demonstrate InferAligner's effectiveness when applied to domain-specific models and multimodal models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the InferAligner method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that InferAligner utilizes cross-model guidance for harmlessness alignment. Can you elaborate more on why cross-model guidance is more effective than using the target model's own activations? What is the intuition behind this?

2. Safety steering vectors (SSVs) play a key role in InferAligner. What factors affect the quality of extracted SSVs? Would SSVs extracted from small versus large safety-aligned models differ in effectiveness? 

3. The guidance gate in InferAligner selects which layers to intervene on during inference. What criteria were used to determine the optimal layers? How sensitive is performance to the choice of layers?

4. What is the impact of the hyperparameter α (intervention strength) on harmlessness versus downstream task performance? Is there a tradeoff between safety and capability here? 

5. Could the SSV concept be extended to other safety attributes beyond harmlessness, such as truthfulness or impartiality? What challenges might arise?

6. The paper shows InferAligner working on domain-specific models. How would its effectiveness differ when applied to general conversational models? Would adjustment of parameters be needed?

7. InferAligner achieves cross-model safety guidance. Could other guidance signals like human feedback also be incorporated as additional steering vectors?

8. What scope exists for further optimization of the parameters (bl, α, LG)? Could these be dynamically tuned for each model rather than kept static?

9. The success on LLaVA highlights InferAligner's applicability to multimodal models. But could it work for other modalities like speech or robotics?

10. How could InferAligner handle diversity of language, given that harmful content may differ across languages and cultures? Would safety-aligned models for each language be needed?
