# [Graph Representation of Narrative Context: Coherence Dependency via   Retrospective Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13551)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Individual passages in narratives are often cohesively related rather than isolated, but existing methods do not explicitly model the global coherence dependencies between passages. This limits performance on tasks requiring deeper understanding of narratives.

Proposed Solution:  
- Propose a new graph representation called NARrative COgnition graph (\textsc{NarCo}) that captures task-agnostic coherence dependencies between narrative passages.

- Graph nodes are short passages/chunks from the narrative. Edges are free-form retrospective questions from a later passage to an earlier passage, reflecting their coherence relation.

- Questions are generated via a 2-stage LLM prompting scheme, without human annotations. A question generation stage creates candidate questions which are filtered in a verification stage. 

- The graph provides explicit global coherence flow and augments local passages with contextual dependencies.

Key Contributions:

- Novel graph representation for narratives that models global coherence relations without formal discourse parsing or annotations.

- Practical instantiation of the graph via prompting scheme using LLMs like GPT-4 and ChatGPT.

- Demonstrated utility of the graph in 3 studies - evaluating edge efficacy, using edges to enrich node embeddings, broader application in long document QA.

- Experiments show performance gains over baselines in recap identification, plot retrieval tasks and 2-5% accuracy boost in QuALITY dataset for QA.

In summary, the paper proposes an original graph structure called \textsc{NarCo} that models implicit coherence relations in narratives to augment understanding. The graph is instantiated via LLM prompting and shown to provide consistent improvements on multiple narrative comprehension tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a graph representation for narratives dubbed \graphns, where nodes are context snippets and edges are retrospective questions reflecting coherence relations, realized via a two-stage LLM prompting scheme without human annotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new paradigm for narrative understanding called NARrative COgnition graph (\graphns). This graph representation parses the narrative context into nodes (passages) connected by edges that represent coherence dependencies in the form of retrospective questions.

2. A two-stage LLM prompting approach to automatically realize the graph without reliance on human annotations. This includes question generation and filtering stages.

3. Demonstrating the utility of the graph representation on three narrative understanding tasks:

- Evaluating edge efficacy on recap identification
- Enriching node embeddings for plot retrieval 
- Broader application in long document QA

The key motivation is to explicitly model the global coherence relations in narratives to facilitate fine-grained tasks, while removing dependence on fixed taxonomy or annotations. Experiments suggest performance improvements on all three applications using the graph.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Graph Representation of Narrative Context (NarCo): The proposed graph structure to represent coherence dependencies in narratives by connecting nodes (context snippets) with edges (retrospective questions).

- Nodes: Short consecutive passages that the full narrative context is split into. 

- Edges: Free-form inquisitive questions going from a succeeding node to a preceding node, reflecting their coherence relations.

- Two-stage LLM prompting: The proposed approach to realize the NarCo graph automatically using large language models, consisting of a question generation stage and a question filtering stage. 

- Edge efficacy: One of the three studies examining whether the graph edges express competent coherence relations. Evaluated on recap identification.

- Node augmentation: Second study focusing on injecting global contextual information from graph edges into node representations. Evaluated on plot retrieval. 

- Broader application: Third study demonstrating wider utility of NarCo graph in long document QA.

- Retrospection: Concept of humans reinstating causal events from prior context while reading narratives, which inspired the backward direction of edge questions in the graph.

- Precision-focused: Prioritizing precision over recall in generating the graph edges using LLMs, as a practical approach without human involvement.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the Narrative Cognition Graph (NarCo) differ from traditional discourse parsing approaches in terms of the granularity of nodes and flexibility of edge types? What are the motivations behind these design choices?

2. The paper proposes a two-stage prompting scheme to generate edge questions without human annotations. Can you explain the strengths and weaknesses of this approach compared to having human experts create the graph?

3. What are some ways the quality of the generated edge questions could be further improved? For example, could matching models between questions and target texts help rule out invalid questions?

4. How does the concept of "retrospection-oriented" questions that look backwards to prior context compare to forward-looking questions in conventional Question Under Discussion (QUD) frameworks? What are the tradeoffs?

5. Could the graphical representation proposed in this paper be combined with other methods for long context understanding like compressed soft prompts or iterative prompting schemes? If so, how?

6. For the node augmentation study, what are some ways the graph could provide additional signals during the actual QA inference phase beyond just enhancing the retrieval process?

7. How might the weighting or selection of edge questions be adapted for different downstream tasks? Does every edge relation provide uniformly useful information?

8. What types of narratives beyond books and TV shows could this graph representation be useful for comprehending? How might the formulation need to change?  

9. Can you foresee potential graph-based representations being useful even beyond narrative understanding into other long document comprehension tasks?

10. What are some of the key challenges and limitations that need to be addressed in future work to make the Narrative Cognition Graph more robust and widely usable?
