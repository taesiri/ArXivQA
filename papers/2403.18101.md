# [Towards Explainable Clustering: A Constrained Declarative based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18101)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Towards Explainable Clustering: A Constrained Declarative based Approach":

Problem:
- Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique to group similar data points. However, the obtained clusters are often not interpretable or explainable to humans. 
- Existing explainable clustering methods have limitations: 
    - They explain an existing clustering rather than constructing an explainable clustering from scratch.
    - They do not consider both cluster compactness and interpretability when constructing the clusters.
    - They have limited ways to incorporate human knowledge and constraints.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new constrained clustering ensemble method called ECS that constructs explainable clusters along with their explanations. 
- The clusters are computed based on a feature space while Boolean explanations (sets of patterns) are extracted from a separate descriptor space.
- The notions of coverage (patterns should cover a minimum ratio of cluster instances) and discrimination (patterns should not cover many instances of other clusters) are formally defined.
- ECS has four main steps:
    1. Generate a diverse set of candidate clusters using different algorithms and parameters.
    2. Compute frequent patterns for each cluster that satisfy coverage constraints. 
    3. Filter clusters based on constraints.
    4. Use a Constraint Programming (CP) model to simultaneously select clusters and pattern explanations that optimize objectives while satisfying the coverage, discrimination and other constraints.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of interpretable clustering using coverage and discrimination constraints.
- A CP model to create a clustering and explanation for each cluster from a set of candidates. 
- Ability to leverage expert knowledge via constraints at different stages.
- Introduction of new explanation quality measures.
- Demonstration on real datasets that ECS can construct explainable and high quality clusters compared to existing methods.

The key idea is to construct compact and interpretable clusters with explanatory patterns simultaneously while allowing incorporation of domain knowledge, rather than explaining an existing cluster. The coverage and discrimination constraints guide the process to achieve explainability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel constrained clustering ensemble method called ECS that builds a clustering along with discriminative and covering pattern-based explanations for each cluster, through a configurable constraint programming model integrating expert knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A formalization of the notion of interpretable clustering, through configurable constraints on coverage and discrimination of cluster explanations.

2) A novel CP (Constraint Programming) clustering model to create a clustering and the explanation of each cluster from a set of candidate clusters and their descriptions.

3) A clustering method based on generating a set of base partitions (as in ensemble methods), allowing the selection of clusters of different shapes. 

4) The possibility of incorporating expert knowledge at different stages of the cluster selection process through various constraints.

5) The introduction of three new clustering explanation quality measures - Pattern Coverage Rate (PCR), Explanation Coverage (EC), and Inverse Pattern Contrastivity (IPC).

In summary, the paper proposes a new constrained clustering ensemble method called ECS that focuses on building interpretable clusters with high quality explanations, allowing the flexibility to configure coverage and discrimination requirements and integrate expert knowledge. The cluster and explanation selection is formulated as a combinatorial problem solved through a CP model.

The paper introduces a new interpretable constrained clustering method called ECS that focuses on building cluster explanations with high coverage of the cluster instances and high discrimination from other clusters. It leverages frequent pattern mining to generate candidate explanations and constraint programming to select clusters and explanations simultaneously under coverage, discrimination, and user constraints. Key aspects include the notions of coverage and discrimination formalized at the cluster and clustering levels, the use of two representation spaces for clustering and explanations, the integration of user knowledge, and the ensemble-based approach to generate diverse candidate clusters.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the notion of coverage and discrimination for evaluating cluster explanations. Can you expand on how these metrics are formally defined and how they capture the key properties of good explanations? 

2. One key aspect is the integration of prior expert knowledge through various constraints. What are the different types of constraints that can be specified in this framework and at what stages of the process can they be integrated?

3. The method relies on generating a pool of candidate clusters and explanations first before selecting the final clustering. What is the rationale behind this ensemble-based approach and how does it lead to better explainable clusterings?

4. Explain in detail the four main steps of the ECS method: (i) candidate cluster generation, (ii) cluster filtering, (iii) candidate description generation, and (iv) explainable cluster selection. What are the key operations happening at each step?

5. The final cluster and explanation selection step is modeled as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem. Why is Constraint Programming well-suited for this problem compared to other optimization techniques? Can you discuss some of the constraints and objective functions formulated in the CP model?

6. One of the claims is that constructing the clustering and explanations simultaneously leads to better solutions than a posteriori explanation approaches. Can you articulate why this is the case and support this claim with empirical or theoretical justifications?  

7. The clustering and explanation spaces can be completely disjoint. What are some real-world scenarios where this could be useful? What preprocessing steps might be required in such cases?

8. The experiments analyze the impact of different coverage and discrimination thresholds on the explainability metrics. What general trends and trade-offs between these parameters can be observed? How should one set these thresholds in practice?

9. The paper introduces three new explanation quality measures - PCR, EC, and IPC. Provide an intuitive explanation of what each metric captures. You may use examples to illustrate.

10. The comparison shows some advantages over existing methods like descriptive clustering and decision tree-based approaches. Can you summarize 2-3 limitations of these existing techniques that are addressed through the proposed ECS method?
