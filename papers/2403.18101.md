# [Towards Explainable Clustering: A Constrained Declarative based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18101)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Towards Explainable Clustering: A Constrained Declarative based Approach":

Problem:
- Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique to group similar data points. However, the obtained clusters are often not interpretable or explainable to humans. 
- Existing explainable clustering methods have limitations: 
    - They explain an existing clustering rather than constructing an explainable clustering from scratch.
    - They do not consider both cluster compactness and interpretability when constructing the clusters.
    - They have limited ways to incorporate human knowledge and constraints.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new constrained clustering ensemble method called ECS that constructs explainable clusters along with their explanations. 
- The clusters are computed based on a feature space while Boolean explanations (sets of patterns) are extracted from a separate descriptor space.
- The notions of coverage (patterns should cover a minimum ratio of cluster instances) and discrimination (patterns should not cover many instances of other clusters) are formally defined.
- ECS has four main steps:
    1. Generate a diverse set of candidate clusters using different algorithms and parameters.
    2. Compute frequent patterns for each cluster that satisfy coverage constraints. 
    3. Filter clusters based on constraints.
    4. Use a Constraint Programming (CP) model to simultaneously select clusters and pattern explanations that optimize objectives while satisfying the coverage, discrimination and other constraints.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of interpretable clustering using coverage and discrimination constraints.
- A CP model to create a clustering and explanation for each cluster from a set of candidates. 
- Ability to leverage expert knowledge via constraints at different stages.
- Introduction of new explanation quality measures.
- Demonstration on real datasets that ECS can construct explainable and high quality clusters compared to existing methods.

The key idea is to construct compact and interpretable clusters with explanatory patterns simultaneously while allowing incorporation of domain knowledge, rather than explaining an existing cluster. The coverage and discrimination constraints guide the process to achieve explainability.
