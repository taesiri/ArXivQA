So in summary, the key research question is assessing how the capabilities of recent open-source instructed LLMs vary on different code comprehension and generation tasks across different settings. The study aims to provide useful insights into applying instructed LLMs for software engineering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. This paper presents the first study evaluating open-source instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) on code comprehension and generation tasks. Specifically, it evaluates 10 recent open-source instructed LLMs along with 5 baseline models on 4 representative code-related tasks (defect detection, clone detection, assertion generation, and code summarization).

2. It performs a large-scale experiment, evaluating the models in diverse settings - zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. The extensive experiments take around 1000 GPU-hours. 

3. The paper provides several findings and practical implications regarding using instructed LLMs for code comprehension and generation:

- Instructed LLMs are competitive on code tasks even without fine-tuning, and sometimes outperform smaller specialized models. General-domain instructed LLMs can perform well on code.

- Adding demonstration examples helps, but can sometimes worsen performance. Performance tends to decrease with longer input context.

- Fine-tuning consistently improves performance over zero/few-shot learning. After fine-tuning, instructed LLMs outperform both small specialized models and uninstructed LLMs.

- BM25 retrieval is the best shot selection strategy for code generation tasks. No strategy is clearly better for code classification.

- There are trade-offs between model performance and computational costs. Smaller models are more efficient but instructed LLMs achieve better performance.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive empirical study and useful insights on leveraging instructed LLMs for code intelligence tasks. The large-scale evaluation and findings can inform future research and practice in this emerging area.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

1. Develop more sound and thorough evaluation approaches for instructed LLMs on code-related tasks. This includes implementing automatic evaluation protocols, constructing practical code-related benchmarks, and designing sound evaluation metrics. This could benefit the community by enabling more systematic evaluation of the large number of instructed LLMs.

2. Build more efficient tuning and inference methods for instructed LLMs. While instructed LLMs show promising performance on code tasks, they require substantially more memory and time compared to small pre-trained models. Developing techniques to make instructed LLMs more efficient would enable their practical usage in code domains.

3. Build instructed LLMs oriented specifically for code comprehension and generation tasks. There are many potential code-related instructions that could be used to tune LLMs. Creating LLMs tuned on diverse code instructions could produce models with enhanced capabilities to assist software engineering activities.

4. Explore how to better leverage instruction tuning and fine-tuning together. The study shows both instruction tuning and subsequent fine-tuning provide benefits. Investigating how to combine both techniques optimally could further improve model performance on downstream tasks.

5. Analyze model behaviors to explain unintuitive few-shot performance drops. The study reveals unstable or degraded few-shot performance in some cases. Analyzing model internals could provide insights into these behaviors.

In summary, the authors highlight needs for more rigorous LLM evaluation, more efficient tuning/inference, specialized code-tuned models, optimizing tuning strategies, and interpreting model behaviors as promising future work arising from this study.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper evaluates open-source large language models (LLMs) that have been tuned with instructions on code comprehension and generation tasks. The authors experiment with 10 recent instructed LLMs, including general models like Vicuna, Alpaca, and Dolly as well as code-specific models like CodeAlpaca. They evaluate the models on four tasks: defect detection, clone detection, assertion generation, and code summarization. The paper has three main findings. First, even without fine-tuning, the instructed LLMs are competitive on the code tasks compared to small state-of-the-art models that were fine-tuned on each task. Second, adding a few demonstration examples substantially improves performance on most tasks, although sometimes causes worse or unstable results. Third, further fine-tuning the models on each task leads to additional gains over the zero-shot or few-shot performance. After fine-tuning on the same data, the instructed LLMs outperform both the small specialized models and uninstructed LLMs of similar scale. Based on the comprehensive evaluation, the paper provides recommendations on model selection, tuning strategies, and tradeoffs between performance and computational costs.
