# [RecursiveDet: End-to-End Region-based Recursive Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13619)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes RecursiveDet, a method to improve end-to-end region-based object detectors like Sparse R-CNN, AdaMixer and DiffusionDet. The central hypothesis is that the decoder modules in these detectors are redundant and can be made more efficient by sharing parameters across stages to create a recursive structure. Specifically, the paper addresses the following research questions:- Can we reduce the model size of region-based detectors by sharing decoder parameters across stages to create a recursive structure?- Can we reuse the dynamic convolution layers within a stage to increase model depth without adding parameters? - Can encoding bounding box positions into positional encodings help the shared recursive decoder adapt better across stages?- Can a centerness-based positional encoding provide better localization within a region of interest compared to just using the global box coordinates?The key ideas proposed and evaluated are:- Sharing decoder parameters across stages and making the decoder recursive to reduce model size.- Reusing the dynamic convolution and output layers within a stage to increase depth without adding parameters. - Introducing bounding box positional encodings to make the shared recursive decoder more adaptive.- Designing a centerness-based positional encoding to provide better localization within each region of interest.The central hypothesis is that these ideas can improve accuracy and efficiency for region-based detectors like Sparse R-CNN. The experiments validate the effectiveness of RecursiveDet across different base detectors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing RecursiveDet, a common cascade decoder structure built on dynamic conv for region-based object detectors. - Sharing the decoder parameters among different stages to reduce model size. Reusing the dynamic layer and out layer to increase model depth within a stage.- Designing bounding box positional encoding (PE) and centerness-based PE to provide geometry information of proposals to the decoder, making self attention and dynamic conv position-aware.- Implementing RecursiveDet in three mainstream region-based detectors (Sparse R-CNN, AdaMixer, DiffusionDet) and showing consistent performance improvements with reduced model size.In summary, the key ideas are to make the decoder recursive to reduce parameters, reuse modules to increase depth, and introduce positional encodings based on proposal boxes to enhance the decoder's adaptability. This improves mainstream region-based detectors with lower model cost.
