# [RecursiveDet: End-to-End Region-based Recursive Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13619)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes RecursiveDet, a method to improve end-to-end region-based object detectors like Sparse R-CNN, AdaMixer and DiffusionDet. The central hypothesis is that the decoder modules in these detectors are redundant and can be made more efficient by sharing parameters across stages to create a recursive structure. Specifically, the paper addresses the following research questions:- Can we reduce the model size of region-based detectors by sharing decoder parameters across stages to create a recursive structure?- Can we reuse the dynamic convolution layers within a stage to increase model depth without adding parameters? - Can encoding bounding box positions into positional encodings help the shared recursive decoder adapt better across stages?- Can a centerness-based positional encoding provide better localization within a region of interest compared to just using the global box coordinates?The key ideas proposed and evaluated are:- Sharing decoder parameters across stages and making the decoder recursive to reduce model size.- Reusing the dynamic convolution and output layers within a stage to increase depth without adding parameters. - Introducing bounding box positional encodings to make the shared recursive decoder more adaptive.- Designing a centerness-based positional encoding to provide better localization within each region of interest.The central hypothesis is that these ideas can improve accuracy and efficiency for region-based detectors like Sparse R-CNN. The experiments validate the effectiveness of RecursiveDet across different base detectors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing RecursiveDet, a common cascade decoder structure built on dynamic conv for region-based object detectors. - Sharing the decoder parameters among different stages to reduce model size. Reusing the dynamic layer and out layer to increase model depth within a stage.- Designing bounding box positional encoding (PE) and centerness-based PE to provide geometry information of proposals to the decoder, making self attention and dynamic conv position-aware.- Implementing RecursiveDet in three mainstream region-based detectors (Sparse R-CNN, AdaMixer, DiffusionDet) and showing consistent performance improvements with reduced model size.In summary, the key ideas are to make the decoder recursive to reduce parameters, reuse modules to increase depth, and introduce positional encodings based on proposal boxes to enhance the decoder's adaptability. This improves mainstream region-based detectors with lower model cost.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in end-to-end object detection:- Most prior work focuses on improving DETR-style detection transformers, while this paper targets region-based detectors like Sparse R-CNN. So it explores a different direction than works like Deformable DETR, Anchor DETR, etc.- The main contribution is introducing a recursive decoder architecture that shares parameters across stages. This compact structure reduces model size substantially compared to other region-based detectors with independent cascade stages.- It incorporates bounding box positional encodings into both self-attention and dynamic convolutions. Applying positional information in dynamic convs is novel compared to prior works. - Experiments show consistent gains over strong region-based detector baselines across various backbones, demonstrating the broad applicability of the proposed approach.- Overall, this paper pushes further on end-to-end region-based detection, an area receiving increased interest lately. The recursive decoder design and positional encoding techniques offer useful insights compared to prevailing focus on DETR-style architectures. The model size reduction while maintaining accuracy is an important advantage.In summary, this paper advances research on end-to-end detection by targeting region-based methods with a compact recursive decoder design and novel application of positional encodings. It offers competitive results and model size compared to related works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper proposes a novel RecursiveDet approach for end-to-end region-based object detection. Some potential future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring other ways to further reduce model size and computation cost. The authors share decoder parameters across stages to reduce size, but more ways could be explored. - Applying the recursive structure and positional encodings to other vision tasks like segmentation and pose estimation that also use ROI features.- Designing better positional encodings to capture more fine-grained spatial information within the ROI feature. The centerness encoding helps but more advanced encodings could be developed.- Implementing the RecursiveDet in other advanced region-based detectors beyond Sparse R-CNN, AdaMixer and DiffusionDet.- Evaluating RecursiveDet on more datasets and domains beyond COCO to analyze generalization.- Developing extensions of RecursiveDet for video object detection, where recursion across frames could be beneficial.- Combining ideas from RecursiveDet with advances in transformers, self-attention, and dynamic convolutions to further improve modeling.So in summary, the main future directions are around extending the RecursiveDet approach to new tasks/models, designing better position encodings, reducing model complexity further, and evaluating generalization to new datasets and domains. The core recursive structure shows promise.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes RecursiveDet, an end-to-end region-based object detector with a recursive cascade decoder structure. It shares decoder parameters across stages to reduce model size, and reuses the dynamic convolution layer within a stage to increase depth without adding parameters. To enhance the decoder's adaptability, bounding box and centerness-based positional encodings are introduced for self-attention and dynamic convolution. Experiments show RecursiveDet achieves consistent improvements over Sparse R-CNN, AdaMixer, and DiffusionDet detectors while requiring fewer parameters. The key contributions are a compact recursive decoder, enhanced with positional encodings, that boosts performance of region-based detectors with lower model cost.
