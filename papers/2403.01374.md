## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing light-section 3D scanning systems face a trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and measurement range. Systems utilizing galvanometer-based laser scanning can achieve high accuracy but have a limited field-of-view. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel dynamic light-section 3D reconstruction system that combines a dynamic laser scanner and a dynamic camera system based on multi-galvanometers. This synchronizes the laser scanning and camera field-of-view switching to achieve both high accuracy and wide measurement range.

- The system consists of a camera, line laser, and two galvo mirror systems (Galvo-1 and Galvo-2). Galvo-1 controls camera viewpoint and Galvo-2 scans the laser.

- A complete mathematical model is derived to relate the galvo angles, camera intrinsics, laser plane equation and 3D point coordinates. 

- Accurate calibration methods are introduced for the dynamic camera, dynamic laser scanner, and joint system calibration. An error model and correction approach is also presented.

Key Contributions:

1) A novel dynamic 3D scanning system combining synchronized laser scanning and camera switching to enable both high precision and wide measurement range.

2) Mathematical modeling of the multi-galvo dynamic system relating galvo angles to laser plane and camera viewpoint.

3) Flexible and accurate calibration methods proposed for the dynamic camera, laser scanner and joint system. 

4) Extensive experiments demonstrated high accuracy of 0.3 mm over a large 1100×1300×650 mm^3 measurement range, 25× larger range than comparable systems.

In summary, the key innovation is the multi-galvo dynamic 3D scanning system with associated modeling and calibration to achieve unprecedented scanning accuracy across a very wide measurement area.
