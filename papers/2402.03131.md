# [Constrained Decoding for Cross-lingual Label Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- For NLP tasks involving word/phrase predictions (e.g. NER, event extraction), zero/few-shot transfer learning with multilingual LLMs lags behind supervised fine-tuning methods. 
- To improve performance, existing methods translate training data from high-resource to low-resource languages and project labels across languages. 
- However, state-of-the-art marker-based label projection methods degrade translation quality by inserting extra markers into the input sentences.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a new method called \CD~(Constrained Decoding for Cross-Lingual Label Projection) that uses constrained decoding to overcome above issues.
- Key ideas: 
   (1) Translate sentences without markers to preserve quality
   (2) Use second pass of constrained decoding to insert markers at correct positions
   (3) Design efficient search algorithm with heuristic bounds to find top label projections
- Benefits: Preserves translation quality, versatile for both translate-train and translate-test strategies  

Main Contributions:
- Introduce a more accurate marker-based label projection method using constrained decoding
- Demonstrate the importance of high-quality translation for label projection
- Show that translating test data can boost cross-lingual transfer performance compared to just translating training data
- Extensive experiments on NER and event extraction tasks over 20 languages show CD outperforms prior marker-based and alignment-based label projection techniques

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in advancing label projection for multilingual NLP via a novel constrained decoding approach that generates higher quality projected data while retaining efficiency and versatility across different transfer learning scenarios.
