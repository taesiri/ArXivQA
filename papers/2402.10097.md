# [Adaptive Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks with   Independent Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10097)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative machine learning among clients without directly sharing private data. However, FL in wireless networks faces challenges due to heterogeneity in computation/communication capabilities (system heterogeneity) and non-IID data distributions (data heterogeneity).
- Existing client sampling strategies for FL have limitations in jointly addressing system and data heterogeneity, resulting in long wall-clock training times.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new independent client sampling strategy to minimize the wall-clock training time of FL, considering both system and data heterogeneity.
- Key ideas:
   - Derives a new convergence bound for non-convex loss functions under arbitrary/independent sampling probabilities.
   - Proposes an adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme to minimize expected per-round training time.
   - Formulates an optimization problem to find optimal independent sampling probabilities that minimize total training time under a convergence constraint.
   - Develops an efficient algorithm to solve the formulation using estimated parameters and convex approximation.

Main Contributions:
- Convergence analysis for FL with independent sampling over non-IID data
- Adaptive bandwidth allocation strategy considering system heterogeneity in computation and communication
- Problem formulation and efficient algorithm for optimal independent sampling probabilities to minimize wall-clock training time
- Extensive experiments on real-world prototype with various models/datasets demonstrate substantially improved training time compared to state-of-the-art sampling schemes

In summary, the paper provides an end-to-end approach spanning from convergence analysis to algorithm design for optimal client sampling in heterogeneous federated learning over wireless networks, with significant improvements validated experimentally. The key innovation lies in the joint modeling and optimization of system/data heterogeneity to minimize actual training time.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an independent client sampling strategy that adapts to data and system heterogeneity to minimize the wall-clock federated learning training time over wireless networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new independent client sampling strategy to minimize the wall-clock training time of federated learning (FL) in heterogeneous wireless networks, while considering both data heterogeneity and system heterogeneity in communication and computation. Specifically, the key contributions include:

1) Deriving a new convergence bound for FL with arbitrary and independent client sampling probabilities for non-convex loss functions.

2) Proposing an adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme that jointly considers heterogeneous computation and communication capacities as well as limited system bandwidth to characterize the expected per-round training time. 

3) Formulating an optimization problem to minimize the FL convergence wall-clock time by optimizing the independent sampling probabilities, subject to a convergence threshold constraint. An efficient algorithm is developed to approximately solve this non-convex optimization problem.

4) Conducting experiments on a real-world prototype with practical heterogeneous network settings and demonstrating substantial reduction in FL wall-clock training time compared to current best sampling schemes.

In summary, the key innovation is in the joint design and optimization of the independent client sampling strategy to minimize wall-clock FL training time, while accounting for both data and system heterogeneity in communication and computation.
