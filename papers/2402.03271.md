# [Uncertainty of Thoughts: Uncertainty-Aware Planning Enhances Information   Seeking in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03271)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) are being deployed in real-world settings involving uncertainty and ambiguity, where they need to actively seek out information by asking questions. However, most benchmarks assume all necessary information is provided upfront and do not evaluate models' abilities to ask effective questions to gather missing information. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose Uncertainty of Thoughts (UoT), an algorithm to enhance LLMs' abilities to actively reduce their uncertainty by asking useful questions. UoT has three main components:

1) An uncertainty-aware simulation framework where the LLM generates candidate questions and simulates possible futures and likelihoods for each question. 

2) Uncertainty-based rewards motivated by information gain, which incentivize the LLM to seek information that maximally reduces uncertainty.

3) A reward propagation scheme to select the optimal question that maximizes expected reward over both the immediate and downstream rewards.

Main Contributions:

1) Introduce a benchmark with 3 tasks (20 Questions, medical diagnosis, troubleshooting) over 5 datasets to evaluate LLMs' active information gathering through questions.

2) Propose UoT, a novel method to improve LLMs' question asking abilities by modeling and seeking to reduce uncertainty. UoT uses simulation, information gain rewards, and reward propagation.

3) Experiments over multiple LLMs show UoT improves success rate by 57.8% on average over direct prompting baselines. UoT also shows gains over prior methods like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thoughts.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in developing methods for LLMs to gather needed information via effective questioning, introducing suitable benchmarks, and demonstrating strong empirical improvements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Uncertainty of Thoughts (UoT), an algorithm to enhance large language models' ability to actively seek needed information by modeling their own uncertainty, simulating possible futures, and asking questions that maximize the reduction of uncertainty.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

1. Introducing Uncertainty of Thoughts (UoT), a plug-and-play approach enabling LLMs to explicitly model and seek to reduce their uncertainty. UoT utilizes a principled approach based on an uncertainty-aware framework for simulating possible futures, rewards motivated by information gain, and a reward propagation scheme to select the optimal question to ask.

2. Introducing a benchmark of 3 tasks and 5 datasets, designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to seek the information they need by asking questions. 

3. Experiments showing that UoT improves the success rate of multiple LLMs by 57.8% on average compared to direct prompting, achieving top performance on both task success and efficiency. The benchmark and code are publicly released.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the UoT method to improve LLMs' active information seeking abilities, along with introducing a new benchmark to evaluate this capability, and showing through experiments that UoT significantly outperforms baseline methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware simulation framework to model possible futures - could you expand more on how this framework works to simulate future scenarios and compute their likelihoods? What algorithms or techniques enable the effective simulation?

2. The uncertainty-based rewards are motivated by information gain - could you explain more about how these rewards are formulated, especially the mathematical framework behind computing uncertainty reduction? How is entropy formulated and calculated?  

3. The reward propagation scheme seems critical for evaluating candidate questions - could you walk through how the accumulated and expected rewards are computed and how these guide the final question selection? What are the key steps in the propagation process?

4. In the extension on open set UoT, how exactly is the possibility space initialized and then reinitialized during the interaction? What prompts guide this initialization and update process as new information comes in?

5. The paper mentions simplifying assumptions like non-overlapping affirmative/negative responses - what challenges would allowing overlaps introduce and how might the framework be extended to handle such cases?

6. For computational efficiency, pruning is used during tree simulation - what specific pruning heuristics are used? How was the balance struck between efficiency gains and performance?

7. What adjustments were made to tailor the overall UoT framework across the different tasks like medical diagnosis versus troubleshooting? Were new task-specific components needed?

8. How was GPT-4 evaluated in terms of accuracy as an answerer simulator? What metrics quantified its reliability? Were errors observed and how might they impact overall performance?

9. What key limitations remain in the approach? For instance, allowing more open-ended questions or incorporating uncertainty over time - how might these be addressed in future work?

10. How might the overall framework extend beyond simplified scenarios to handle more complex, realistic settings? Would new components be needed to scale up performance?
