# [Rethinking Conversational Recommendations: Is Decision Tree All You   Need?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14614)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: Can a simple rule-based method (specifically a decision tree model) achieve better performance than state-of-the-art reinforcement learning based methods for multi-turn conversational recommendation? The key hypothesis is that decision trees are sufficient to characterize the interactions between users and items, and can effectively solve the key challenges in multi-turn conversational recommendation systems, namely determining which questions to ask, how to rank candidate items, when to recommend, and how to handle negative user feedback.The authors propose a decision tree based solution called FacT-CRS and demonstrate through experiments on three benchmark datasets that it outperforms existing reinforcement learning based methods by successfully asking questions and identifying target items in fewer turns.In summary, the paper explores whether a simpler alternative to complex deep reinforcement learning models can achieve comparable or better performance for conversational recommendation systems. The results support the hypothesis that decision trees are effective for this task.
