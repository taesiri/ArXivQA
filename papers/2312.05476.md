# [Exploring the Naturalness of AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05476)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
As AI-generated images become more prevalent, evaluating their visual naturalness is increasingly important but also challenging. Compared to natural images, AI-generated images have more diverse contents and could be affected by both technical distortions (e.g. noise, blur) and rationality distortions (e.g. unusual objects, improper layout). Existing image quality assessment methods are inadequate for this new task. 

Approach:
1) The authors construct an AI-Generated Image Naturalness (AGIN) database with human ratings on 6,049 images from multiple generation tasks. Ratings are provided on overall naturalness as well as technical and rationality perspectives. Analysis on AGIN shows both distortions affect naturalness and simply using overall naturalness as supervision can bias individual perspective predictions.

2) A brain-inspired naturalness assessment model called JOINT is proposed, with separate technical and rationality branches to mimic human reasoning. Tailored designs are introduced in each branch, like patch shuffling and feature regularization. Two training schemes are explored: using overall naturalness labels (JOINT) or individual perspective labels (JOINT++). An effective weighting strategy combines both branch predictions into the final score.

Contributions:
- AGIN database with multi-perspective human opinions on AI-generated image naturalness 

- Analysis and insights on how technical and rationality factors influence human perception

- JOINT and JOINT++ models outperforming state-of-the-art IQA and aesthetics models by jointly learning on both perspectives as humans do

The database, code and methods not only advance the understanding and assessment of AI-generated image naturalness, but also inspire future multimedia quality research from a multi-perspective viewpoint.
