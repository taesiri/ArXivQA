# [Novi jeziƒçki modeli za srpski jezik](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14379)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There has been a recent proliferation of transformer-based language models for Serbian, but little analysis on how model size, training data size, and data quality impact performance on key NLP tasks.

- The paper aims to benchmark and analyze 10 selected Serbian text embedding models across 4 tasks: masked language modeling, sentence similarity, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.

Models Analyzed:
- The 10 models analyzed span the RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and XLM-RoBERTa model families and range from 80 million to 560 million parameters. 

- They were trained on Serbian corpora ranging from 500 million to 11.5 billion tokens. Two new models (jerteh-81 and jerteh-355) are presented.

Tasks and Key Findings:

- Masked Language Modeling: The 355 million parameter jerteh-355 model achieved the best performance, showcasing the impact of high quality, in-domain training data.

- Sentence Similarity: Smaller RoBERTa models trained on Serbian (+ Croatian) performed the best, suggesting generalization plays a key role.

- POS Tagging and NER: Models based on XLM-RoBERTa shine due to exposure to more diverse vocabularies during pretraining. More data and model size provide gains.

Main Contributions:
- The paper provides a rigorous benchmark and analysis of Serbian NLP models across diverse tasks.

- It highlights model strengths, weaknesses, and data needs - guiding future model development for Serbian. Two new highly performant models (jerteh-81 and jerteh-355) are presented as part of this analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents ten selected Serbian language models, compares their performance across four natural language processing tasks, analyzes how model and training set size impact performance, and proposes guidelines for developing better Serbian language models in the future.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It presents an overview and brief history of language models for Serbian based on the transformer architecture. Several recently published Serbian language models are discussed.

2) It evaluates and compares 10 selected Serbian language models for text embedding on 4 different natural language processing tasks: masked language modeling, sentence similarity, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.

3) It analyzes the results to determine which models perform best on the different tasks. Trends are identified regarding model performance in relation to model size, training data size, and training data quality.

4) It introduces two new RoBERTa-based models for Serbian text embedding: jerteh/jerteh-81 and jerteh/jerteh-355. These models outperform others on the masked language modeling task.

5) Based on the experiments and analyses, recommendations are provided regarding optimal conditions and best practices for developing future Serbian language models. Key factors identified include model architecture, training data size and quality, and fine-tuning approaches.

In summary, the paper advances the state-of-the-art in Serbian language modeling through comparative evaluation, analysis, and introduction of new high-quality models. It also provides guidance to researchers on how to build better models going forward.

The paper discusses recent language models developed for Serbian using transformer architectures. It compares different models on tasks like masked language modeling, sentence similarity, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. Key models examined include variants of RoBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa developed specifically for Serbian or trained on Serbian and other South Slavic texts. The goal is evaluating model performance to determine optimal conditions for developing Serbian language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper compares 10 selected models for Serbian text embedding. What were the criteria for selecting these specific 10 models out of the 20+ existing models mentioned? 

2. Two new models, jerteh/jerteh-81 and jerteh/jerteh-355, are introduced in this paper. What architecture are they based on and what training data was used? How large are these models compared to the others?

3. Four tasks were used to evaluate the models: masked language modeling, sentence similarity, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. Why were these specific four tasks chosen? What other tasks could have been used?  

4. For the masked language modeling task, the jerteh models outperformed the others even when tested on text tokenized with other tokenizers. What does this suggest about the quality of the jerteh training data?

5. For the sentence similarity task, smaller RoBERTa models trained on more Serbian data performed the best. Why would smaller models generalize better for multilingual similarity?

6. The XLM-R models struggled on the two upstream tasks but excelled on the two downstream tasks. What factors contribute to this stark difference in performance?

7. Part-of-speech tagging performance correlated with model and training set size, but models achieved quite high performance overall. Are we reaching a performance ceiling for this task?

8. Named entity recognition benefited most from multilingual pretraining and additional fine-tuning. Is this task better suited to a transfer learning approach?

9. The paper concludes by proposing next steps for developing better models. What approach does it recommend based on the analysis? What other approaches could be explored?

10. Beyond the tasks and models discussed here, what other evaluations could advance Serbian language modeling and where should research focus next?
