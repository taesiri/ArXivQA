# [Human-vehicle interaction for autonomous vehicles in crosswalk   scenarios: Field experiments with pedestrians and passengers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12708)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Efficient human-vehicle interaction is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to ensure user acceptance and safety. However, there is a lack of studies on real-world interactions between AVs, passengers, and external road users like pedestrians in safety-critical scenarios. Prior works use simulated environments or Wizard-of-Oz methods which limit the conclusions. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents results from real-world experiments with an AV interacting with pedestrians at a crosswalk, with actual passengers inside. The AV uses internal (visual+audio) and external (LED strip) interfaces to communicate intentions. Two braking profiles - gentle and aggressive - are also tested as forms of implicit communication. Pedestrian and passenger confidence, risk perception and actual crossing behavior are evaluated using questionnaires and direct measurements of distance/speed.

Main Contributions:
- Performs real-world AV interaction experiments with passengers and pedestrian subjects, without using simulation or Wizard-of-Oz
- Analyzes combination of explicit communication interfaces (internal/external HMIs) and implicit communication (braking profiles) 
- Compares pedestrian confidence vs actual crossing behavior using questionnaires and direct measurements
- Finds that external HMI improves confidence but only when combined with gentle braking; internal HMI builds confidence but mainly for passengers
- Identifies gap between perceived confidence via questionnaires and actual crossing risk behavior
- Provides insights into designing communication mechanisms in AVs for safety-critical pedestrian interactions

In summary, this pioneering real-world study analyzes various explicit and implicit communication techniques for AVs interacting with passengers and pedestrians in crossing scenarios. The results demonstrate the need for holistic evaluation using multiple methods, and inform the design of interfaces and behavior for safe and trustworthy autonomous vehicles.
