# [Human-vehicle interaction for autonomous vehicles in crosswalk   scenarios: Field experiments with pedestrians and passengers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12708)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Efficient human-vehicle interaction is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to ensure user acceptance and safety. However, there is a lack of studies on real-world interactions between AVs, passengers, and external road users like pedestrians in safety-critical scenarios. Prior works use simulated environments or Wizard-of-Oz methods which limit the conclusions. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents results from real-world experiments with an AV interacting with pedestrians at a crosswalk, with actual passengers inside. The AV uses internal (visual+audio) and external (LED strip) interfaces to communicate intentions. Two braking profiles - gentle and aggressive - are also tested as forms of implicit communication. Pedestrian and passenger confidence, risk perception and actual crossing behavior are evaluated using questionnaires and direct measurements of distance/speed.

Main Contributions:
- Performs real-world AV interaction experiments with passengers and pedestrian subjects, without using simulation or Wizard-of-Oz
- Analyzes combination of explicit communication interfaces (internal/external HMIs) and implicit communication (braking profiles) 
- Compares pedestrian confidence vs actual crossing behavior using questionnaires and direct measurements
- Finds that external HMI improves confidence but only when combined with gentle braking; internal HMI builds confidence but mainly for passengers
- Identifies gap between perceived confidence via questionnaires and actual crossing risk behavior
- Provides insights into designing communication mechanisms in AVs for safety-critical pedestrian interactions

In summary, this pioneering real-world study analyzes various explicit and implicit communication techniques for AVs interacting with passengers and pedestrians in crossing scenarios. The results demonstrate the need for holistic evaluation using multiple methods, and inform the design of interfaces and behavior for safe and trustworthy autonomous vehicles.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents results from real-world experiments evaluating the impact of internal and external human-machine interfaces, combined with implicit communication techniques like gentle and aggressive braking maneuvers, on pedestrians' and passengers' confidence and perceived safety when interacting with an autonomous vehicle at a crosswalk.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is presenting results from real-world testing of human-vehicle interactions with an autonomous vehicle equipped with internal and external human-machine interfaces (HMIs) in a crosswalk scenario. Specifically:

- They conducted field experiments involving pedestrians and passengers interacting with an autonomous test vehicle in a crosswalk scenario. The vehicle drove fully autonomously rather than using a Wizard of Oz approach.

- They combined the use of internal and external HMIs with different implicit communication techniques through gentle and aggressive braking maneuvers. 

- They evaluated the effects on pedestrians' and passengers' perceived confidence and safety using both questionnaires and measurable variables like crossing distance and speed.

- Key findings indicate that external HMI and gentle braking improve pedestrians' confidence, while internal HMI only helps confidence when combined with more aggressive braking. There were some mismatches between subjective questionnaires and measurable behaviors.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting comprehensive real-world experimental data on how different HMIs and implicit communication techniques impact pedestrians' and passengers' perceptions and behaviors when interacting with an autonomous vehicle in a crossing scenario.

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Autonomous vehicles (AVs)

- Perceived confidence
- Trust in AVs

The paper presents results from real-world experiments evaluating different types of communication interfaces and techniques between an autonomous vehicle, its passengers, and pedestrians in a crosswalk scenario. Both subjective (questionnaires) and objective (measurements) data are collected to assess the impact on confidence, trust, and actual behavior during interactions. Key terms like iHMI, eHMI, braking maneuvers, field experiments, trust, and crosswalk scenarios reflect the main focus and contribution of this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using both internal and external HMIs for human-vehicle interaction. What are some of the key differences and challenges in designing effective internal vs external HMIs for autonomous vehicles? 

2. The study uses field experiments with actual autonomous vehicle driving and real pedestrians crossing. What are some of the advantages of this approach compared to simulated experiments? What are some of the challenges?

3. The paper defines a "crossing event" as the moment the pedestrian enters the vehicle lane, exposing themselves to potential injury. Why use this measure rather than trying to detect when the pedestrian makes an internal "decision" to cross? What are the tradeoffs?  

4. Both questionnaires and direct measurements are used to evaluate the interactions. Why is it important to use both subjective (questionnaires) and objective (measurements) evaluation methods? What different insights can be gained from each?

5. The results show a mismatch between pedestrians' subjective confidence vs their actual crossing behavior when using the external HMI with aggressive braking. What might explain this discrepancy? How could the HMI design be improved?

6. The study finds the optimal braking profile increases confidence for both pedestrians and passengers. What aspects of the braking profile contribute most to confidence - timing, smoothness, deceleration rate? How might these be further optimized?

7. The internal HMI uses both visual and audio messages. Why include both modalities? What specific role does each play in building confidence and awareness? 

8. To what extent could the presence of the backup safety driver have influenced the results on passenger and pedestrian confidence? How could any effects be minimized in future studies?

9. The sample size in the study is relatively small at 32 participants. What are some considerations in determining an appropriate sample size for this type of HMI evaluation study?

10. The paper mentions possible future work studying VR simulations of the scenarios. What are some of the tradeoffs between real-world vs simulated testing for human-vehicle interaction experiments? Which measures or effects might be hard to reproduce accurately in simulation?
