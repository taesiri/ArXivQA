# [Towards Balanced Alignment: Modal-Enhanced Semantic Modeling for Video   Moment Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12155)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing video moment retrieval (VMR) methods suffer from a modality imbalance problem where the semantic richness in videos far exceeds what is described in the query sentences. This leads to ineffective alignment between the video and text modalities.

Solution - Modal-Enhanced Semantic Modeling (MESM):
The paper proposes enhancing both the video and text modalities to achieve more balanced alignment:

1) Frame-word level enhancement: Reconstruct query words from video features to focus only on relevant portions and suppress irrelevant ones. This is done through a weight-shared cross-attention mechanism and an auxiliary masked language modeling task.

2) Segment-sentence level enhancement: Generate complementary knowledge tokens from context sentences and ground-truth segments, and concatenate them to the query. Supervise this through contrastive learning against segments with high IoU overlap.  

The enhanced video and text features are then aligned using cross-attention layers.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies and analyzes the modality imbalance problem in VMR
- Proposes modal enhancement strategies at two levels to achieve more balanced alignment between video and text
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on 3 datasets, with significant gains in out-of-distribution settings, demonstrating improved generalization

The main idea is balancing the semantics in both modalities through selective enhancement, instead of direct alignment, which helps bridge the modality gap. Both the frame-word and segment-sentence level enhancement strategies are shown to be compatible and improve performance.
