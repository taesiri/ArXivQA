## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called node-aware bi-smoothing to achieve certified robustness for graph-based node classifiers against graph injection attacks (GIAs). GIAs involve injecting new malicious nodes and edges into a graph to degrade model performance. The proposed method combines node deletion and edge deletion smoothing techniques in a synergistic manner to provide certificates against GIAs under evasion and poisoning threat models. A key theoretical contribution is deriving conditions to verify if a prediction for a node will remain consistent despite GIA perturbations. Experiments on node classification and recommender system tasks demonstrate that the method significantly improves certified robustness over adapted baselines. Notably, node-aware bi-smoothing also achieves competitive empirical defense performance when benchmarked against state-of-the-art defense techniques on a real-world GIA. The method's model-agnostic nature and applicability for both empirical and certified defense underscore its versatility. Overall, this work represents an important advancement in ensuring reliability of graph learning models against the practical and impactful threat of graph injection attacks.
