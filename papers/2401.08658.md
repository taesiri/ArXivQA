# [End-To-End Planning of Autonomous Driving in Industry and Academia:   2022-2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08658)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a review of the state-of-the-art methods for end-to-end planning for autonomous driving in both industry and academia. 

The paper first explains the motivation for autonomous driving - it can help reduce the over 1 million annual deaths from road accidents globally that are mostly caused by human error. End-to-end planning is a key capability for autonomous driving to generate smooth, safe and efficient driving trajectories.

The paper then reviews planning solutions from major industry players:

- Tesla's occupancy network based planning in bird's eye view space. It uses neural nets for end-to-end occupancy prediction and planning without maps.

- Momenta's online HD map based deep learning planning that aims for full autonomy by 2025.

- Horizon Robotics' spatial-temporal heatmap trajectory representation combined with a post-processing step for ensuring safety and comfort. This solution won 2nd place in the nuPlan challenge.  

- Motional's Inverse Reinforcement Learning based trajectory scoring approach DriveIRL that achieved good real-world performance.

- Toyota's Urban Driver that uses a closed-loop differentiable simulator and policy gradient based planning network.

The paper also covers the latest academic research:

- An integrated occupancy prediction and planning network that refines trajectories using predicted occupancies.

- The CVPR 2023 best paper UniAD that connects various driving subtasks like perception and prediction into one end-to-end network.

- A conditional predictive planning approach from NTU that enables interactive trajectory proposals.

- The nuPlan challenge winning method that uses proposal generation, simulation and a learned scoring model.

In summary, the paper gives readers a structured overview of the current state-of-the-art in one of the most critical areas of autonomous driving - end-to-end planning. Both industry solutions as well as innovative academic research ideas are covered. The concise and informative summary serves both as an introduction for beginners as well as a reference for experts.
