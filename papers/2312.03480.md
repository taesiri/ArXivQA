# [AMR Parsing is Far from Solved: GrAPES, the Granular AMR Parsing   Evaluation Suite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03480)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents GrAPES (Granular AMR Parsing Evaluation Suite), a new comprehensive evaluation suite for assessing the performance of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsers. GrAPES goes beyond existing metrics like Smatch by evaluating parsers on 36 fine-grained linguistic phenomena categorized into 9 sets. These categories range from seen vs unseen labels, to structural generalization, to coreference. The metrics are carefully designed to measure exactly the targeted phenomenon and nothing else. The dataset combines existing test sets and corpora with newly created grammar-generated and handcrafted sentence-AMR pairs. Results on 3 recent parsers show that while state-of-the-art AMR parsing has improved greatly, parsers still struggle with various phenomena like resolving contextual ambiguity, handling unseen words, and structural generalization. The authors quantitatively show the effect of data sparsity on parser performance. The suite allows developers to clearly see limitations of parsers to improve them and allows the research community to better understand abilities and limitations of AMR parsing. Overall, GrAPES enables more interpretable, focused evaluation to advance the state of AMR parsing.
