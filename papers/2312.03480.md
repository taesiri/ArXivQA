# [AMR Parsing is Far from Solved: GrAPES, the Granular AMR Parsing   Evaluation Suite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03480)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents GrAPES (Granular AMR Parsing Evaluation Suite), a new comprehensive evaluation suite for assessing the performance of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsers. GrAPES goes beyond existing metrics like Smatch by evaluating parsers on 36 fine-grained linguistic phenomena categorized into 9 sets. These categories range from seen vs unseen labels, to structural generalization, to coreference. The metrics are carefully designed to measure exactly the targeted phenomenon and nothing else. The dataset combines existing test sets and corpora with newly created grammar-generated and handcrafted sentence-AMR pairs. Results on 3 recent parsers show that while state-of-the-art AMR parsing has improved greatly, parsers still struggle with various phenomena like resolving contextual ambiguity, handling unseen words, and structural generalization. The authors quantitatively show the effect of data sparsity on parser performance. The suite allows developers to clearly see limitations of parsers to improve them and allows the research community to better understand abilities and limitations of AMR parsing. Overall, GrAPES enables more interpretable, focused evaluation to advance the state of AMR parsing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents GrAPES, a comprehensive evaluation suite for English AMR parsing consisting of 36 fine-grained categories of linguistic phenomena, custom-designed metrics that precisely measure performance on each category, analysis of 3 state-of-the-art parsers showing strengths and weaknesses, and recommendations for using GrAPES to advance the state of AMR parsing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A practically and linguistically informed evaluation suite with 36 categories grouped into 9 sets for evaluating AMR parsers.

2) Fine-grained evaluation metrics tailored for each category to precisely measure parser performance on specific linguistic phenomena.

3) Evaluation results and analysis for three recent AMR parsers using the suite, revealing their abilities and shortcomings in detail. 

4) Detailed analysis tools for parser developers included as part of the open source evaluation suite.

In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive test suite and set of tools for evaluating AMR parsers on a diverse range of phenomena beyond the standard Smatch metric. This allows more targeted measurement of progress and comparison of parser strengths/weaknesses.

The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation suite called GrAPES for testing AMR parsers on their ability to handle a diverse range of linguistic phenomena and structures. It includes custom metrics designed to precisely measure performance on 36 fine-grained categories. The goal is to provide more interpretable results compared to a single overall score like Smatch, and reveal strengths and weaknesses of different AMR parsing approaches.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces GrAPES, a new fine-grained evaluation suite for AMR parsing. What are the key motivations behind developing this new resource rather than just using Smatch score?

2. GrAPES evaluates AMR parsing performance on 36 categories grouped into 9 sets. What is the rationale behind selecting these specific categories - what principles guided the selection process?

3. The paper puts a strong emphasis on high annotation quality and ensuring the metrics measure what they are supposed to measure. What specific steps were taken during dataset creation and metric design to achieve these goals?

4. What role do the newly introduced concepts of "prerequisites" and "sanity checks" play in the evaluation metrics? How do they help make the metrics more targeted and interpretable? 

5. The paper evaluates 3 recent parsers on GrAPES - AM Parser, C&L Parser and AMRBart. Can you summarize and compare their overall performance? What relative strengths and weaknesses emerge from the fine-grained analysis?

6. The "impossible tasks" category includes phenomena like unseen predicate senses that current parsers fundamentally cannot predict correctly. Why are these tasks impossible under the standard training paradigm? 

7. What key insights does the analysis of structural generalization categories reveal about the generalization abilities of current parsers? How does their performance here compare to results on dedicated structural generalization datasets like COGS?

8. The analysis reveals better performance on some tasks (e.g. frequent predicates) but poorer performance on related more difficult phenomena (e.g. rare predicates). What does this suggest about the effect of sparsity and data availability on current AMR parsers?

9. In the comparison to previous work, what evidence does the paper provide that using more fine-grained categories and targeted metrics actually matters and leads to more insights?

10. The paper introduces tools for analyzing AMR parser outputs qualitatively. What is the benefit of combining quantitative evaluation with qualitative analysis for interpreting the results?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Current AMR parsers achieve high scores on the standard Smatch evaluation metric, close to or exceeding human inter-annotator agreement. However, recent human evaluations show parsers still frequently make errors that substantially distort sentence meaning. There is a need for more comprehensive, fine-grained evaluation suites to precisely quantify abilities and limitations of AMR parsers.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors present the Granular AMR Parsing Evaluation Suite (GrAPES), consisting of 36 linguistic phenomena categories grouped into 9 sets. It covers a diverse range of practical, technical and linguistic challenges for parsers such as structural generalization, coreference, rare words, unseen entities, etc. The suite uses targeted metrics focused specifically on the phenomenon of interest instead of an overall score. It also includes newly annotated sentence-AMR pairs and metrics designed to accurately measure what they intend to measure.

Contributions:
- A broad evaluation suite spanning 36 categories to precisely quantify parser abilities  
- Customized metrics per category to focus specifically on the target phenomenon
- 15,590 manually filtered or newly annotated challenging sentence-AMR pairs 
- Detailed quantitative analysis highlighting state-of-the-art parser strengths and limitations
- Tools for statistical analysis and visualization to interpret results

Overall, GrAPES enables fine-grained analysis of AMR parser abilities, precisely identifies limitations to address, and serves as a benchmark to drive further progress. Both the dataset and tools are openly available to the research community.
