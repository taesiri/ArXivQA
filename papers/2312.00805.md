# [Gender inference: can chatGPT outperform common commercial tools?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00805)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Many research studies rely on demographic data like gender to analyze phenomena such as gender bias and inequities. However, most datasets do not include self-reported gender information. 
- Researchers thus have to infer gender from other data like names, countries, etc. using commercial tools. 
- Existing tools fail to capture the non-binary nature of gender and are limited in terms of accuracy.

Proposed Solution
- The paper evaluates the ability of ChatGPT to infer gender by comparing it with 3 commonly used commercial tools - Namsor, Gender-API and genderize.io. 
- It uses a novel dataset of over 130,000 Olympic athletes over 120 years with known gender labels.
- Different input combinations are tested - first name only, first name + country, first + last name etc. 
- Comparative results are analyzed for the overall dataset, subsets like medalists, English speaking countries and East Asian countries.

Key Findings
- Of traditional tools, Namsor has the best performance but ChatGPT matches it and often outperforms it, especially for females when country/last name is provided.
- All tools perform better on medalists, indicating benefit from higher media coverage. 
- Performance declines on non-English names, but ChatGPT still does decently due to its multilingual model.
- Though not designed for it, ChatGPT could be a cost-effective gender inference tool currently. Future capabilities may allow better non-binary identification.

Main Contributions 
- First study evaluating ChatGPT for gender inference and comparing it with common commercial tools
- Analysis using large-scale Olympic athlete dataset covering wide temporal and geographic scope 
- Evaluation across different input combinations and subsets providing insights into strengths/limitations of different tools
