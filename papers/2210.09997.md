# [Bag All You Need: Learning a Generalizable Bagging Strategy for   Heterogeneous Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09997)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper addresses the challenging task of packing heterogeneous objects (both rigid and deformable) into a deformable bag using a robot system. The key research questions/hypotheses appear to be:- Can a robot system learn to strategically manipulate and arrange rigid and deformable objects to achieve a suitable "pre-bagging" configuration where objects are positioned ready to be dropped into an open bag? This involves challenges like learning to fold/crumple deformable objects based on their material properties.- Can a robot system learn to determine when a good pre-bagging configuration is achieved and decide where to grasp and lift a deformable bag so that the objects fall inside successfully? This involves perceiving the current object configuration and choosing suitable grasp points on the deformable bag.- Can the two policies (rearrangement and lifting) be learned jointly in simulation and successfully transferred to the real world to accomplish the full heterogeneous bagging task? Addressing sim2real transfer is key.Overall, the central hypothesis appears to be that a robotic system can learn reusable policies for heterogeneous object rearrangement and bag lifting to reliably accomplish the full task of packing novel rigid and deformable objects into deformable bags. The key technical contributions are the learned policies, the self-supervised bag opening detection method, and the new simulation benchmark for this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of the paper appear to be:- They introduce a new robotic task called "heterogeneous bagging", which involves packing both rigid and deformable objects into a deformable bag. This is a challenging task due to the complex interactions between multiple deformable objects.- They propose a robotic system with two learned policies to accomplish this task: a rearrangement policy that rearranges and folds objects to achieve a good pre-bagging configuration, and a lifting policy that determines where to grasp and lift the bag once the objects are suitably arranged. - The system uses a self-supervised network to detect the bag opening from real-world depth images. This enables robust sim-to-real transfer of the learned policies which are trained in simulation.- They develop a simulation environment and benchmark for heterogeneous bagging which will be publicly released to facilitate future research.- They demonstrate their system on a real 3-arm robot platform, achieving a 70% success rate on the task with novel objects. This is the first real-world robot system demonstrated for heterogeneous bagging.In summary, the key contribution appears to be the formulation of the heterogeneous bagging task, the proposed robotic system with rearrangement and lifting policies to accomplish it, and the demonstration of the system on real hardware, which sets a benchmark for this new problem domain. The self-supervised bag opening detection and the new simulation environment are also notable contributions towards this goal.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces a robotic system to pack rigid and deformable objects into a deformable bag, using learned policies to rearrange items and infer suitable grasp points for lifting the deformable bag.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Relaxing assumptions about the initial state of the bag: The current method assumes the bag starts open and flat on a surface. Future work could develop methods to open and position the bag into this initial state. - Exploring more expressive action spaces: The current system uses 2D pick and place actions. Future work could explore 6-DoF actions to insert objects from the side into a bag held up by one arm. This may help avoid grasp failures caused by object proximity to the selected grasp points.- Closing the loop between policies: Currently the rearrangement and lifting policies are trained independently. Connecting them more closely, for example by having the rearrangement policy avoid placing objects near potential lift points, could improve performance. - Expanding to more general containers: The techniques could potentially transfer to packing objects into boxes, baskets, etc. Exploring how well the approach generalizes is an interesting direction.- Integrating more modalities: Incorporating tactile feedback or audio could provide useful signals about internal object configurations unobservable from vision alone. - Long-horizon planning: Looking beyond one-step rewards to reason about multi-step outcomes may lead to more efficient or higher quality packing.In summary, some key directions are relaxing assumptions, expanding the action space, improving policy integration, testing generalization, and incorporating more modalities or planning for long-term outcomes. The authors lay the groundwork that can enable research along these dimensions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a practical robotics solution for the task of heterogeneous bagging, which requires placing multiple rigid and deformable objects into a deformable bag. This is a challenging task due to the complex interactions between highly deformable objects under limited observability. The proposed approach consists of two learned policies - a rearrangement policy that manipulates and reconfigures objects to achieve suitable pre-bagging conditions, and a lifting policy to determine suitable grasp points for bi-manual lifting of the deformable bag. The policies are trained in simulation and then evaluated on a real 3-arm robot platform, achieving 70% success for novel test objects. A key component is a self-supervised network to detect the bag opening in real images, enabling sim-to-real transfer. The work makes four main contributions: 1) the self-supervised opening detection algorithm, 2) the learned rearrangement policy, 3) the learned lifting policy, and 4) a novel simulation environment and benchmark for heterogeneous bagging tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a practical robotics solution for the task of heterogeneous bagging, which requires placing multiple rigid and deformable objects into a deformable bag. This is a challenging task due to the complex interactions between highly deformable objects under limited observability. The proposed approach consists of two learned policies - a rearrangement policy and a lifting policy. The rearrangement policy uses sequential pick-and-place actions to rearrange or fold items in order to achieve a suitable pre-bagging configuration. It learns to place rigid objects and fold deformable objects strategically to fit in the bag opening. The lifting policy determines suitable grasp points to lift up the bag once the pre-bagging conditions are met. It learns the relationship between object configurations and good lift points. The two policies also jointly estimate when the pre-bagging conditions are satisfied in order to decide when to transition from rearranging to lifting. The policies are trained in simulation and then evaluated on a real 3-arm robot platform equipped with a suction gripper for rearranging and parallel-jaw grippers for lifting. To improve sim2real transfer, a self-supervised network is trained to detect the bag opening from real-world depth images. This detection result is provided as additional input to the policies. Experiments demonstrate a 70% success rate on novel objects, significantly outperforming heuristic baselines. The work also contributes a new heterogeneous bagging simulation benchmark to facilitate future research. Overall, this is the first real-world robot system for heterogeneous bagging of rigid and deformable objects, requiring the integration of multiple manipulation skills based on object properties.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to prior work on robotic manipulation of deformable objects and bag packing:- This paper focuses on the challenging task of packing both rigid and deformable objects into a deformable bag. In contrast, prior work has mostly looked at either packing rigid objects into rigid containers or inserting rigid objects into deformable bags. Packing heterogeneous objects (rigid and deformable) into a deformable bag is more difficult due to complex object interactions.- The method uses two learned policies - a rearrangement policy to manipulate objects into a suitable pre-bagging configuration, and a lifting policy to determine grasp points and lift the deformable bag. In contrast, prior bag manipulation works have used more simplistic heuristics for grasping and lifting.- The system is able to manipulate multiple objects and infer lift points on a fully deformable bag directly from RGB-D images. This is more challenging than prior work that either manipulated a single object or relied on attaching beads around the bag opening to simplify lifting.- A key technical contribution is the self-supervised bag opening detection algorithm that enables robust sim-to-real transfer of the learned policies. The bag opening detection helps align the simulated and real environments.- The work includes real-world robot experiments that achieve a 70% success rate in packing novel objects into bags. This demonstrates the feasibility of using learned policies to accomplish complex heterogeneous bagging, going beyond prior simulation or limited real-world demonstrations.- The new heterogeneous bagging simulation benchmark and dataset will facilitate future research and comparison between different approaches on this challenging task.In summary, this work pushes the boundaries of deformable object manipulation by addressing a more complex real-world task, developing learning-based techniques tailored to this task, and providing extensive experiments demonstrating applicability to novel objects on a physical robot system. The bag opening detection and public benchmark are also valuable contributions to the field.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a robotic system for packing heterogeneous objects (both rigid and deformable) into a deformable bag. The system consists of two learned policies - a rearrangement policy that uses pick-and-place actions to manipulate the objects into a suitable pre-bagging configuration, and a lifting policy to determine where to grasp and lift the deformable bag once the objects are mostly inside the bag opening. The rearrangement policy is trained via self-supervised exploration in simulation to maximize the decrease in volume of objects outside the bag opening after each action. The lifting policy is also trained in simulation in a self-supervised manner by attempting to lift the bag after rearrangement and labeling each attempt as successful or not. To enable sim-to-real transfer, the system uses a self-supervised segmentation network to predict the bag opening from real-world depth images. This predicted bag opening is provided as additional input to both policies during test time deployment. The full system with the learned policies is evaluated on a physical robot with three arms and achieves a high success rate in packing novel rigid and deformable objects into the deformable bag.
