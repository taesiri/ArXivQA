# [Bag All You Need: Learning a Generalizable Bagging Strategy for   Heterogeneous Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09997)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper addresses the challenging task of packing heterogeneous objects (both rigid and deformable) into a deformable bag using a robot system. The key research questions/hypotheses appear to be:- Can a robot system learn to strategically manipulate and arrange rigid and deformable objects to achieve a suitable "pre-bagging" configuration where objects are positioned ready to be dropped into an open bag? This involves challenges like learning to fold/crumple deformable objects based on their material properties.- Can a robot system learn to determine when a good pre-bagging configuration is achieved and decide where to grasp and lift a deformable bag so that the objects fall inside successfully? This involves perceiving the current object configuration and choosing suitable grasp points on the deformable bag.- Can the two policies (rearrangement and lifting) be learned jointly in simulation and successfully transferred to the real world to accomplish the full heterogeneous bagging task? Addressing sim2real transfer is key.Overall, the central hypothesis appears to be that a robotic system can learn reusable policies for heterogeneous object rearrangement and bag lifting to reliably accomplish the full task of packing novel rigid and deformable objects into deformable bags. The key technical contributions are the learned policies, the self-supervised bag opening detection method, and the new simulation benchmark for this task.
