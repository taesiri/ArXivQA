# [Behavior Trees in Industrial Applications: A Case Study in Underground   Explosive Charging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19602)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Industrial automation requires effective task planning policies for autonomous systems. Finite State Machines (FSMs) are commonly used but lack reusability and modularity. Behavior Trees (BTs) offer modularity but few studies demonstrate them in industrial contexts. 

- This paper examines using BTs to automate underground explosive charging by a robotic system, a complex process requiring flexibility to adapt to varied environments. Key challenges are working in unstructured environments, parallel robot workflows, recoverability from failures, and incorporating human operator supervision.  

Proposed Solution:
- Combine a high-level FSM for operator interaction and mode switching with lower-level BTs for reactive execution behaviors. FSM handles transitions between environment scanning, hole detection, charge planning, and explosive charging modes. Each mode has an associated BT.

- Most complex BT controls explosive charging, coordinating two manipulators and hydraulic positioning. Designed with parallel root node and backward-chaining for conditions/actions. Uses queue system to iterate over charge holes. Includes failure recovery behaviors by reusing skills.

Contributions:  
- First documented use of combined FSM+BT in an industrial application, balancing operator control with autonomous reactive execution.

- Demonstrates applying BTs to complex unstructured environment and process requiring recoverability and human involvement. 

- Provides BT implementation suggestions like designing actions/conditions as ROS nodes for modularity and avoiding over-reliance on sequence memory.

- Shares lessons on challenges faced, including lack of BT best practices for industry and difficulty modeling cyclic workflows.

In summary, the paper presents a successful case study applying BTs in industry by combining them with an FSM for operator interaction, highlighting the possibilities and remaining challenges.
