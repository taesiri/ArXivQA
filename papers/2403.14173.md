# [HCTO: Optimality-Aware LiDAR Inertial Odometry with Hybrid Continuous   Time Optimization for Compact Wearable Mapping System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO) methods suffer from two main challenges when applied to compact wearable mapping systems (WMS):
1) Human motion vibrations cannot be properly modeled by low-order spline trajectories typically used in continuous-time optimization frameworks. This leads to loss of information and ill-fitted motion models.
2) Uneven point cloud feature distribution and degenerated scenes cause the iterative closest point matching process to converge to local minima, resulting in long-term drift, especially in attitude and z-direction.

These limitations result in inaccurate prior maps that are not suitable for robot navigation and planning.

Proposed Solution - Hybrid Continuous Time Optimization (HCTO):
1) Recognize high-frequency vibration parts (HFP) and low-frequency parts (LFP) of motion from raw IMU data. Use IMU pre-integration factors to constrain HFP to suppress vibrations. Use raw IMU factors to constrain LFP to fully utilize measurements.

2) Recognize constant velocity parts (CVP) and construct CVP factors to correct system attitude and restrict drift.

3) Select optimal LiDAR correspondences using stochastic greedy algorithm and grouping strategy based on Jacobian similarity. Improves accuracy and real-time performance.  

Main Contributions:
1) Hybrid IMU factorization for efficient handling of vibration without increasing spline trajectory complexity 

2) Simple yet effective CVP factor for maintaining attitude observability

3) Optimal feature selection scheme for real-time performance and improved accuracy

4) Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public and newly collected datasets from helmet-based WMS

The proposed HCTO enables accurate and robust LIO for compact WMSs to construct prior maps for robot navigation in complex environments.
