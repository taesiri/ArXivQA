# [PhaseEvo: Towards Unified In-Context Prompt Optimization for Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11347)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Crafting effective prompts is challenging as it requires significant human effort and expert knowledge. Existing work treats the optimization of prompt instruction and examples as separate problems, leading to sub-optimal performance. There is a need for a unified framework that enables joint optimization of instructions and examples. However, formulating this in the high-dimensional natural language space poses difficulties due to complexity and computational efficiency.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes PhaseEvo, an efficient automatic prompt optimization framework combining the generative capability of large language models (LLMs) with global search capabilities of evolutionary algorithms. The key innovation is a quad-phased design alternating between global and local optimization to balance exploration and exploitation. This is enabled by a suite of novel LLM-based evolutionary operators that enhance efficiency:

1) A task-aware similarity metric based on performance vectors and Hamming distance for better diversity.  

2) An adaptive strategy to transition between phases based on attainment of maximum performance improvement.

Main Contributions:
- First framework enabling joint optimization of instruction and examples for unified in-context prompting
- Innovative phased optimization schedule harnessing strengths of global and local search 
- Novel LLM-based evolutionary operators enhancing prompt search efficiency
- Extensive empirical evaluation showing state-of-the-art performance across 35 tasks with lower computational costs

The proposed PhaseEvo framework sets a new benchmark for in-context prompt optimization by holistically optimizing instructions and examples in a unified manner. The phased optimization strategy and specially designed evolutionary operators unlock superior efficiency and performance.
