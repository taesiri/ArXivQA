# [An open dataset for oracle bone script recognition and decipherment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15365)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Oracle Bone Script (OBS) is one of the earliest forms of ancient Chinese writing, dating back 3000 years. It provides invaluable insights into the Shang Dynasty but only about 1000 out of 4600 discovered OBS characters have been deciphered so far. 
- Deciphering OBS is challenging due to factors like damage, evolution of script over time, variability of characters.
- Progress in using AI to assist OBS decipherment has been hindered by lack of high-quality datasets. Existing datasets have limitations like limited diversity, inaccurate annotations, only including deciphered characters.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose the HUST-OBS dataset to address the limitations of previous OBS datasets.
- The dataset contains 140,053 images of OBS characters collected from diverse sources like books, websites and existing datasets.
- It includes 77,064 images of 1588 deciphered characters and 62,989 images of 9411 undeciphered characters.
- A semi-automated pipeline is designed to collect, annotate and integrate data from different sources. Experts also validate the final dataset.

Main Contributions:
- The HUST-OBS dataset is one of the largest and most comprehensive datasets of OBS images so far.
- It encompasses both deciphered and undeciphered OBS characters from varied sources, ensuring diversity.
- The semi-automated collection and expert validation process improves accuracy of annotations.  
- Classification experiments demonstrate high quality of dataset and suitability for training AI models to assist OBS decipherment.
- Public availability of dataset can facilitate and inspire future research on AI-assisted OBS interpretation.

In summary, the key innovation is a large-scale, high-quality, standardized and validated dataset of both deciphered and undeciphered OBS images to enable AI-assisted decipherment of these invaluable 3000 year old inscriptions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces HUST-OBS, a new high-quality dataset of over 140,000 images of deciphered and undeciphered oracle bone scripts collected from diverse sources to facilitate AI-assisted research in deciphering ancient Chinese scripts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be the creation and release of the HUST-OBS dataset for oracle bone script recognition and decipherment. Specifically:

- The paper details the construction of the HUST-OBS dataset, which contains over 140,000 images of deciphered and undeciphered oracle bone scripts collected from diverse sources. This makes it one of the largest and most comprehensive datasets of oracle bone scripts.

- The dataset goes through several stages of processing, including automatic annotation, data integration, and validation by experts to ensure accuracy and reliability.

- Both deciphered (77,064 images) and undeciphered (62,989 images) oracle bone scripts are included to aid in recognition and assist in future decipherment tasks. 

- Technical validation shows the dataset enables training a classifier to 94.3% accuracy, demonstrating its utility and quality.

- The complete dataset is publicly released to enable and hopefully inspire future research efforts in AI-assisted decipherment of ancient oracle bone scripts.

So in summary, the key contribution is the development and open release of a large-scale, high-quality dataset to promote research at the intersection of AI and oracle bone script decipherment.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a category assigner to automatically identify labels from books. What neural network architecture is used for this model and why was it chosen over other options? How is the training data generated?

2. When integrating data from different sources, the paper uses a MoCo model to encode images into feature vectors for similarity comparison. Explain what a momentum contrast (MoCo) model is and why it was selected for this task. 

3. The paper filters out 1,390 categories from the GuoXueDaShi website due to lack of reliability. What specific criteria are used to determine if a category is unreliable? How might more rigorous verification methods be incorporated?  

4. For the book data, the paper crops pages into individual character slices using OpenCV. What edge detection and other OpenCV techniques are employed? How are the slices then systematically categorized?

5. When scanning and processing book pages, what additional steps could be taken to further clean and preprocess the images? How might recent advances in document image processing be applied?

6. The paper achieved 94.3% accuracy on an image classification validation task. Analyze this result - what types of errors may the model still be making? How could the model be improved?

7. Table 2 shows sample validation accuracy on some categories. Compare and contrast the errors across categories and data sources. What insights can be gained?

8. How was the training and validation split determined for the image classification task? What other evaluation approaches could assess dataset quality?

9. What safeguards are in place to protect privacy when collecting data from public websites and resources? 

10. For sustainable maintenance, how might the dataset aggregation pipeline be updated as new sources emerge? Could automation assist expert reviewers?
