# Enhancing CLIP with GPT-4: Harnessing Visual Descriptions as Prompts

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:Can harnessing visually descriptive text from large language models like GPT-4 enhance Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models for both zero-shot and few-shot image classification on unseen datasets?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Appending visually descriptive text to CLIP's prompt templates can improve its zero-shot classification accuracy by providing more discriminative information beyond just the class name. 2) Large language models like GPT-4 can be manipulated to generate high-quality visually descriptive text for classes in a scalable manner, circumventing the need for expensive expert annotations.3) A simple few-shot adapter module that learns to select the most relevant visual descriptors from the GPT-generated set can further enhance CLIP's few-shot generalization ability.So in summary, the central research direction is leveraging visually descriptive text from LLMs to enhance CLIP, with specific hypotheses around how this can improve both zero-shot and few-shot classification. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is enhancing CLIP's image classification capabilities by incorporating visually descriptive text generated by a large language model (LLM) like GPT-4. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. Showing that using visually descriptive textual (VDT) information in prompt ensembles improves CLIP's 0-shot domain transfer performance over default prompts or non-visual prompts.2. Demonstrating that GPT-4 can be used to flexibly generate high-quality VDT information for constructing prompt ensembles and improving CLIP's 0-shot performance across 12 datasets.3. Designing a simple self-attention adapter module (CLIP-A-self) that selects and aggregates the most relevant VDT information from the prompts to build more generalizable classifiers for few-shot domain transfer.4. Showing that the proposed CLIP-A-self adapter outperforms recent methods like CoOp and CoCoOp on the Base-to-New few-shot benchmark, despite having fewer parameters and simpler architecture.5. Releasing the generated VDT prompts and auxiliary text data for all 12 datasets to enable further research on using LLMs for multi-modal prompt and adapter design.In summary, the key insight is that incorporating high-quality visually descriptive text from LLMs into CLIP's prompts and adapters enhances both its 0-shot and few-shot domain transfer capabilities. The proposed techniques offer computationally efficient ways to improve CLIP's generalization compared to other methods.
