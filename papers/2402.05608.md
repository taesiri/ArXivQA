# [Scalable Diffusion Models with State Space Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05608)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Diffusion models built on CNN or Transformer backbones have shown promising performance for high-quality image generation, but their computational complexity makes scaling them up challenging. 
- State Space Models (SSMs) have superior scalability compared to CNNs/Transformers for long sequence modeling, but have not been explored as backbones for diffusion models.

Method:
- The authors propose Diffusion State Space Models (DiS), a simple and general SSM-based architecture for diffusion models treating all inputs (time, condition, image patches) as tokens.
- DiS is based on a bidirectional SSM with modifications like concat-based long skip connections between shallow and deep layers to incorporate hierarchical information.
- Ablations study the impact of design choices like patch size, skip connections, condition incorporation, and model scaling.

Contributions:
- DiS achieves comparable or better performance than CNN/Transformer-based diffusion models on unconditional (CIFAR10, CelebA) and conditional (ImageNet) image generation with fewer parameters.
- Analysis shows favorable scaling behavior of DiS models with increased depth/width and input tokens, demonstrating strong correlation between model complexity and sample quality.
- DiS models achieve state-of-the-art FID on 256x256 and promising performance on 512x512 ImageNet, showing viability as efficient backbones for high-resolution generation.
- The simplified SSM-based design and extensive analysis offer valuable architectural insights for future backbone research in diffusion models.

In summary, the paper presents DiS as an effective and scalable diffusion backbone with design enhancements over vanilla SSMs, and provides extensive empirical evidence and analysis highlighting its capabilities.
