# [FlexiViT: One Model for All Patch Sizes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08013)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can a single vision transformer (ViT) model be trained to perform well across a range of different patch sizes, rather than needing to train separate models for different patch sizes?

The key hypothesis is that by randomizing the patch size during training, a single ViT model can learn to handle multiple patch sizes and achieve comparable performance to ViT models trained for a fixed patch size. This would allow for more flexible deployment of ViT models by adjusting the patch size at inference time to trade off between compute/latency and accuracy as needed.

In summary, the main research question is whether a single ViT model can be trained in a "flexible" way to handle varying patch sizes well, eliminating the need to train multiple fixed patch size models. The central hypothesis is that training with randomized patch sizes will enable this flexibility within a single model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing FlexiViT, a flexible Vision Transformer (ViT) model that can achieve strong performance across a wide range of patch sizes with a single set of model weights. 

The key ideas behind FlexiViT are:

- During training, the patch size is randomized, forcing the model to learn representations that work across different patch sizes and sequence lengths.

- The patch embedding weights and position embeddings are resized on-the-fly for each sampled patch size using a proposed pseudoinverse resize technique. This allows a single set of underlying weights to adapt to different patch sizes.

- The model is initialized from a powerful teacher ViT and trained with distillation, which improves performance especially for large patch sizes.

- Extensive experiments show FlexiViT matches or exceeds the performance of standard ViT models trained individually for each patch size, on tasks like image classification, detection, segmentation etc.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a simple and effective way to train a single ViT model that achieves excellent performance across a range of patch sizes, instead of training separate models for each desired patch size. This makes ViT models more flexible and adaptable to different compute budgets at deployment time.
