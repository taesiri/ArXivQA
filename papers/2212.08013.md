# [FlexiViT: One Model for All Patch Sizes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08013)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can a single vision transformer (ViT) model be trained to perform well across a range of different patch sizes, rather than needing to train separate models for different patch sizes?

The key hypothesis is that by randomizing the patch size during training, a single ViT model can learn to handle multiple patch sizes and achieve comparable performance to ViT models trained for a fixed patch size. This would allow for more flexible deployment of ViT models by adjusting the patch size at inference time to trade off between compute/latency and accuracy as needed.

In summary, the main research question is whether a single ViT model can be trained in a "flexible" way to handle varying patch sizes well, eliminating the need to train multiple fixed patch size models. The central hypothesis is that training with randomized patch sizes will enable this flexibility within a single model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing FlexiViT, a flexible Vision Transformer (ViT) model that can achieve strong performance across a wide range of patch sizes with a single set of model weights. 

The key ideas behind FlexiViT are:

- During training, the patch size is randomized, forcing the model to learn representations that work across different patch sizes and sequence lengths.

- The patch embedding weights and position embeddings are resized on-the-fly for each sampled patch size using a proposed pseudoinverse resize technique. This allows a single set of underlying weights to adapt to different patch sizes.

- The model is initialized from a powerful teacher ViT and trained with distillation, which improves performance especially for large patch sizes.

- Extensive experiments show FlexiViT matches or exceeds the performance of standard ViT models trained individually for each patch size, on tasks like image classification, detection, segmentation etc.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a simple and effective way to train a single ViT model that achieves excellent performance across a range of patch sizes, instead of training separate models for each desired patch size. This makes ViT models more flexible and adaptable to different compute budgets at deployment time.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper proposes FlexiViT, a Vision Transformer model that can be trained once and then efficiently evaluated at multiple different patch sizes without retraining, enabling a tradeoff between compute/speed and accuracy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on FlexiViT relates to other research on improving vision transformers (ViTs):

- This paper focuses specifically on making ViTs flexible to different input patch sizes. Many other works have explored modifying ViTs in other ways, like through efficient attention mechanisms, sparsity, dynamic networks, etc. FlexiViT is fairly unique in targeting patch size flexibility.

- Other works like MAE, DynamicViT, AutoViT, etc. also relate to exploiting ViT's patchification, but they focus on dropping or masking patches. FlexiViT keeps all patches and changes size instead. 

- Some NAS and "supernet" methods can search architectures that vary across many dimensions like depth, width, resolution, etc. FlexiViT sharply focuses on just patch size. This simplicity enables benefits like leveraging existing models.

- Methods like convolutions and some recent ViT works can adjust scale/resolution more naturally than standard ViTs. FlexiViT makes ViTs adaptive in their own paradigm of patchification.

- Compared to input resolution changes during pre-training (e.g. Swin Transformers), FlexiViT enables a single model to handle multiple resolutions, not just data augmentation.

- The training procedure and analysis of representations across scales provides interesting insights into ViT flexibility.

Overall, FlexiViT makes a fairly focused, simple change to ViT to enable patch size flexibility. The simplicity makes adoption easy, while still adapting ViTs in a core way that other approaches differ on. The analysis also yields new insights into ViT patch size.
