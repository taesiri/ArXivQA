# [FlexiViT: One Model for All Patch Sizes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08013)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can a single vision transformer (ViT) model be trained to perform well across a range of different patch sizes, rather than needing to train separate models for different patch sizes?

The key hypothesis is that by randomizing the patch size during training, a single ViT model can learn to handle multiple patch sizes and achieve comparable performance to ViT models trained for a fixed patch size. This would allow for more flexible deployment of ViT models by adjusting the patch size at inference time to trade off between compute/latency and accuracy as needed.

In summary, the main research question is whether a single ViT model can be trained in a "flexible" way to handle varying patch sizes well, eliminating the need to train multiple fixed patch size models. The central hypothesis is that training with randomized patch sizes will enable this flexibility within a single model.
