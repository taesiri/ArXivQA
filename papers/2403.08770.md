# [FastMAC: Stochastic Spectral Sampling of Correspondence Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on 3D point cloud registration, which aims to estimate the relative pose between two point clouds. A key component in recent state-of-the-art methods like MAC is the correspondence graph, where nodes are 3D correspondences and edges denote compatibility. However, operating on a dense correspondence graph is computationally expensive. The goal is to accelerate the correspondence graph based registration pipeline while preserving accuracy.

Method: 
The core idea is to sample a subset of correspondences so that the correspondence graph size is reduced. To achieve effective sampling, the authors formulate a stochastic spectral sampling strategy based on graph signal processing. Specifically, they use the generalized degree (weighted edge sum of each node) as the graph signal, and apply a high-pass Laplacian filter to extract its high-frequency component. The intuition is that high-frequency nodes undergo rapid degree changes and are better candidates for clique search. Then nodes are randomly sampled according to the response magnitude after filtering. This stochastic strategy avoids expensive SVD operations in deterministic sampling.

Contributions:
1) Introduce graph signal processing to analyze properties of correspondence graph and guide the sampling process. 
2) Propose a stochastic spectral sampling method to select correspondences that effectively preserves the high-frequency signal for clique search.
3) Develop a complete pipeline FastMAC that integrates the proposed sampling into the MAC registration framework. Experiments show FastMAC achieves 80x speedup over MAC while maintaining similar accuracy, even for a 5% sampling ratio.

In summary, the main highlight is the novel stochastic spectral sampling of correspondence graph to accelerate MAC registration. By operating on a sparse set of key correspondences, FastMAC reaches real-time efficiency with negligible performance degradation. The robustness and generalizability are validated on various datasets and descriptors.
