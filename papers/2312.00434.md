# [PEFTDebias : Capturing debiasing information using PEFTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00434)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Foundation models like BERT can propagate harmful biases from their training data to downstream tasks, an issue known as bias transfer. 
- Most debiasing methods are applied only during downstream fine-tuning and have limitations like needing extra annotations, no guarantees of debiasing downstream tasks, and losing debiasing when all parameters are tuned (fairness forgetting).

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a new method called PEFTDebias that uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFTs) to mitigate biases in foundation models.
- It has two main phases:
   1) Upstream phase: Use PEFTs and counterfactual data augmentation to acquire debiasing parameters along a specific bias axis (e.g. gender).
   2) Downstream phase: Incorporate the debiasing PEFTs into the model and keep them frozen while fine-tuning on a downstream task to preserve the debiasing effect.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate PEFTs can effectively capture task-agnostic debiasing information along specific bias axes that transfers across datasets.  
- Evaluate multiple PEFT methods and find prompt tuning performs the best for downstream debiasing while maintaining performance.
- Show transferred debiasing PEFTs achieve comparable performance to full fine-tuning in reducing extrinsic bias metrics, confirming their transferability.
- Release code to reproduce experiments on debiasing along gender and racial bias axes usingBiasBios, GHC, MNLI and LHC datasets.

In summary, this paper introduces an approach to learn reusable bias axis-specific debiasing PEFTs that mitigate bias when transferred to various downstream tasks, overcoming limitations of prior debiasing methods.
