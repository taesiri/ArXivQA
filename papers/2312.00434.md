# [PEFTDebias : Capturing debiasing information using PEFTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00434)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Foundation models like BERT can propagate harmful biases from their training data to downstream tasks, an issue known as bias transfer. 
- Most debiasing methods are applied only during downstream fine-tuning and have limitations like needing extra annotations, no guarantees of debiasing downstream tasks, and losing debiasing when all parameters are tuned (fairness forgetting).

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a new method called PEFTDebias that uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFTs) to mitigate biases in foundation models.
- It has two main phases:
   1) Upstream phase: Use PEFTs and counterfactual data augmentation to acquire debiasing parameters along a specific bias axis (e.g. gender).
   2) Downstream phase: Incorporate the debiasing PEFTs into the model and keep them frozen while fine-tuning on a downstream task to preserve the debiasing effect.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate PEFTs can effectively capture task-agnostic debiasing information along specific bias axes that transfers across datasets.  
- Evaluate multiple PEFT methods and find prompt tuning performs the best for downstream debiasing while maintaining performance.
- Show transferred debiasing PEFTs achieve comparable performance to full fine-tuning in reducing extrinsic bias metrics, confirming their transferability.
- Release code to reproduce experiments on debiasing along gender and racial bias axes usingBiasBios, GHC, MNLI and LHC datasets.

In summary, this paper introduces an approach to learn reusable bias axis-specific debiasing PEFTs that mitigate bias when transferred to various downstream tasks, overcoming limitations of prior debiasing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes PEFTDebias, a novel debiasing approach that utilizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to mitigate biases in foundation models by first acquiring debiasing parameters along a specific bias axis in an upstream phase, and then incorporating the frozen PEFTs into the downstream model during fine-tuning to preserve the upstream debiasing effect.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel debiasing approach called PEFTDebias that utilizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to mitigate biases in foundation models. Specifically:

- They explore using different PEFT methods like adapters, prompt tuning, LoRA, and sparse fine-tuning to capture debiasing information along specific bias axes (e.g. gender, race) in an upstream phase. 

- They then inject these debiasing PEFTs into a downstream model and keep them frozen during task fine-tuning to preserve the upstream debiasing effect and reduce biases in the downstream model along the same axis.

- They demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in mitigating gender and racial biases across multiple datasets, showing that certain PEFT techniques like prompt tuning are more efficient.

- They also show the transferability of the debiasing PEFTs in reducing biases across different downstream tasks along the same bias axis.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a novel debiasing approach using PEFTs that can effectively mitigate biases in foundation models and transfer debiasing information across tasks along specific bias axes.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Debiasing 
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
- Adapters
- Prompt Tuning
- Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA)
- Bias transfer hypothesis
- Gender bias
- Racial bias
- Upstream debiasing
- Downstream fine-tuning
- Intrinsic bias metrics (CrowS-Pairs, StereoSet)  
- Extrinsic bias metrics (TPR-GAP for gender, FPRD for race)
- BiasBios dataset (for gender bias)
- GHC dataset (for racial bias)
- Transferability of debiasing parameters
- Fairness forgetting

The main focus is on using PEFT methods like adapters and prompt tuning in two phases - upstream for acquiring debiasing parameters and downstream for injecting them into the model while keeping them frozen. The effectiveness is shown for mitigating gender and racial bias by evaluating on relevant datasets and metrics. The concept of transferability of these debiasing parameters to other downstream tasks is also explored.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-phase approach called PEFTDebias. Can you explain in detail the upstream and downstream phases of this approach and how they complement each other? 

2. Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) is used in the upstream phase to obtain debiasing parameters. Why is CDA a suitable technique for this purpose? How does it help capture debiasing information along a particular bias axis?

3. The paper examines multiple PEFT methods like adapters, prompt tuning, LoRA and sparse fine-tuning. Can you analyze the trade-offs between these different techniques in terms of debiasing capability, parameter efficiency, ease of transfer etc?

4. The results show that prompt tuning gives the best debiasing performance overall. What properties of prompt tuning might explain its effectiveness in mitigating bias compared to other PEFT methods? 

5. How exactly are the upstream debiasing PEFT parameters incorporated during downstream fine-tuning? Why is it important to keep them frozen instead of further updating them?

6. The paper demonstrates transfer of upstream debiasing parameters to downstream tasks in the same bias axis. Does this indicate the parameters capture generalizable axis-specific debiasing information? Why or why not?

7. For practical applications, how would you determine the right level of debiasing to apply so as to balance fairness considerations without impacting model performance or overcorrecting biases?

8. The paper relies on intrinsic bias benchmarks and extrinsic metrics to evaluate debiasing. What are the limitations of these evaluation approaches in comprehensively assessing biases in language models?

9. How could the PEFTDebias approach be extended to debias large generative language models like GPT-3 which are widely deployed but prone to inheriting biases from data?

10. The paper addresses two bias axes - gender and race. Could the PEFTDebias approach allow debiasing multiple intersectional biases simultaneously by combining parameters tuned on different axes? What challenges might this entail?
