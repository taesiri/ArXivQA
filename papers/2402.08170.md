## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have limitations in multi-task handling capability and weak generalization across datasets or tasks. 
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning and language generation capabilities, but directly applying them to graph data is challenging due to the difficulty in translating graph structures into natural language formats suitable as LLM inputs.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose LLaGA, a framework to effectively integrate graph data with LLMs while retaining LLMs' versatility. 
- LLaGA reorganizes graph nodes into structure-aware sequences using novel node-level templates that encapsulate surrounding structural information.
- These node sequences are mapped into LLM token spaces through a versatile projector tuned on tasks like node classification, link prediction and node description over multiple datasets.  

Main Contributions:
- Versatility: A simple yet universal graph encoding method paired with a versatile projector that handles diverse graph tasks and datasets with a single model, outperforming specialized models.
- Generalizability: Robust knowledge transfer to unseen datasets/tasks without tuning due to the comprehensive graph-text alignment.  
- Interpretability: LLaGA generates high-quality textual explanations of node embeddings, enhancing model transparency.
- Superior performance: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across tasks and datasets. LLaGA is the first single model with consistent superiority over specialized graph neural networks.

In summary, LLaGA introduces an innovative graph-text encoding approach to unlock the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for graph data without compromising versatility, outperforming prior arts across versatility, generalizability and interpretability.
