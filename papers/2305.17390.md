# SwiftSage: A Generative Agent with Fast and Slow Thinking for Complex   Interactive Tasks

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper seeks to address is: How can an artificial agent effectively combine fast, intuitive thinking and slow, analytical thinking to excel in complex interactive reasoning tasks?The authors propose a novel agent framework called SwiftSage that is inspired by the dual process theory of human cognition. The dual process theory posits that human thinking involves two distinct systems - System 1 for fast, intuitive thinking and System 2 for slower, analytical thinking. The SwiftSage framework integrates a "Swift" module (based on a small encoder-decoder language model trained via imitation learning) to emulate System 1, and a "Sage" module (based on prompting large language models like GPT-4) to emulate System 2. The key hypothesis is that by harmoniously integrating these two modules - fast intuitive thinking and slow analytical thinking - the SwiftSage agent will outperform previous methods and achieve state-of-the-art results in complex interactive reasoning tasks like those in the ScienceWorld benchmark.The paper presents empirical results demonstrating that SwiftSage significantly outperforms baseline methods like SayCan, ReAct and Reflexion across 30 distinct complex reasoning tasks. The authors argue this superior performance highlights the effectiveness of SwiftSage's dual process approach in addressing intricate real-world problems.In summary, the central research question is how to combine fast and slow thinking to create more capable AI agents. The key hypothesis is that a dual process agent like SwiftSage will excel in complex reasoning tasks compared to relying solely on fast or slow thinking approaches. The results provide evidence supporting this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper appear to be:1) Proposing a novel agent framework called SwiftSage for complex interactive reasoning tasks. SwiftSage is inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition and integrates both "fast" intuitive thinking (Swift module) and "slow" analytical thinking (Sage module).2) The Swift module is based on a small encoder-decoder language model trained via behavior cloning on oracle agent demonstrations. This enables efficient imitation learning. 3) The Sage module utilizes large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 in a two-stage prompting framework - planning and grounding - to generate longer-term plans and handle exceptions.4) Developing an algorithm to effectively integrate the Swift and Sage modules, leveraging their complementary strengths. This allows for efficient and robust problem-solving.5) Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of SwiftSage on 30 distinct complex reasoning tasks in the ScienceWorld benchmark compared to prior methods. The results highlight the benefits of the proposed dual-process approach.6) Showing SwiftSage is more cost-effective and efficient than prior LLM-based agents, requiring fewer tokens for LLM inference per action thanks to the Swift module and action buffering.In summary, the key contribution is proposing and validating a new agent architecture SwiftSage that combines imitation learning and LLM prompting in a novel way to enhance performance on complex interactive reasoning tasks over prior methods. The dual-process theory inspires the design.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes a new agent framework called SwiftSage, inspired by the dual process theory of human cognition, that combines a small language model for fast intuitive thinking (Swift) and large language model prompting for slower deliberate reasoning (Sage), in order to excel at complex interactive reasoning tasks like those in ScienceWorld.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on the SwiftSage agent compares to other research on agents for complex interactive reasoning tasks:- Uses a novel dual-module architecture inspired by dual process theory of human cognition. Most prior work uses a single model such as a reinforcement learning agent or a large language model. Integrating a smaller specialized module with a more general large language model is an innovative design.- Leverages both imitation learning and prompting of large language models. This allows combining the strengths of both approaches - mimicry of expert behavior from imitation learning and more reflective planning from language models. Other methods typically focus on just one technique.- Develops a prompting strategy specifically for planning and grounding subgoals. The two-stage prompting approach prompts LLMs for higher-level plans first, before grounding into action sequences. This is more efficient than prompting at every time step.- Evaluates on a comprehensive set of complex tasks from ScienceWorld benchmark. Many prior works have only been evaluated on simpler interactive tasks. The broad evaluation on diverse complex tasks demonstrates the generalizability.- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on the ScienceWorld benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods like SayCan, ReAct and Reflexion.- Provides extensive analysis of model behavior, including efficiency, cost-effectiveness. This sheds light on how the dual-module architecture results in improvements over single-module approaches.Overall, by combining fast and slow thinking, the SwiftSage agent represents an important advance in developing more capable and human-like agents for complex interactive reasoning tasks. The dual-process design and prompting strategies are novel contributions not explored deeply by prior work.
