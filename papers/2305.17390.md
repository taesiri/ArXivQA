# [SwiftSage: A Generative Agent with Fast and Slow Thinking for Complex   Interactive Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17390)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper seeks to address is: 

How can an artificial agent effectively combine fast, intuitive thinking and slow, analytical thinking to excel in complex interactive reasoning tasks?

The authors propose a novel agent framework called SwiftSage that is inspired by the dual process theory of human cognition. The dual process theory posits that human thinking involves two distinct systems - System 1 for fast, intuitive thinking and System 2 for slower, analytical thinking. 

The SwiftSage framework integrates a "Swift" module (based on a small encoder-decoder language model trained via imitation learning) to emulate System 1, and a "Sage" module (based on prompting large language models like GPT-4) to emulate System 2. 

The key hypothesis is that by harmoniously integrating these two modules - fast intuitive thinking and slow analytical thinking - the SwiftSage agent will outperform previous methods and achieve state-of-the-art results in complex interactive reasoning tasks like those in the ScienceWorld benchmark.

The paper presents empirical results demonstrating that SwiftSage significantly outperforms baseline methods like SayCan, ReAct and Reflexion across 30 distinct complex reasoning tasks. The authors argue this superior performance highlights the effectiveness of SwiftSage's dual process approach in addressing intricate real-world problems.

In summary, the central research question is how to combine fast and slow thinking to create more capable AI agents. The key hypothesis is that a dual process agent like SwiftSage will excel in complex reasoning tasks compared to relying solely on fast or slow thinking approaches. The results provide evidence supporting this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1) Proposing a novel agent framework called SwiftSage for complex interactive reasoning tasks. SwiftSage is inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition and integrates both "fast" intuitive thinking (Swift module) and "slow" analytical thinking (Sage module).

2) The Swift module is based on a small encoder-decoder language model trained via behavior cloning on oracle agent demonstrations. This enables efficient imitation learning. 

3) The Sage module utilizes large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 in a two-stage prompting framework - planning and grounding - to generate longer-term plans and handle exceptions.

4) Developing an algorithm to effectively integrate the Swift and Sage modules, leveraging their complementary strengths. This allows for efficient and robust problem-solving.

5) Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of SwiftSage on 30 distinct complex reasoning tasks in the ScienceWorld benchmark compared to prior methods. The results highlight the benefits of the proposed dual-process approach.

6) Showing SwiftSage is more cost-effective and efficient than prior LLM-based agents, requiring fewer tokens for LLM inference per action thanks to the Swift module and action buffering.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and validating a new agent architecture SwiftSage that combines imitation learning and LLM prompting in a novel way to enhance performance on complex interactive reasoning tasks over prior methods. The dual-process theory inspires the design.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new agent framework called SwiftSage, inspired by the dual process theory of human cognition, that combines a small language model for fast intuitive thinking (Swift) and large language model prompting for slower deliberate reasoning (Sage), in order to excel at complex interactive reasoning tasks like those in ScienceWorld.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on the SwiftSage agent compares to other research on agents for complex interactive reasoning tasks:

- Uses a novel dual-module architecture inspired by dual process theory of human cognition. Most prior work uses a single model such as a reinforcement learning agent or a large language model. Integrating a smaller specialized module with a more general large language model is an innovative design.

- Leverages both imitation learning and prompting of large language models. This allows combining the strengths of both approaches - mimicry of expert behavior from imitation learning and more reflective planning from language models. Other methods typically focus on just one technique.

- Develops a prompting strategy specifically for planning and grounding subgoals. The two-stage prompting approach prompts LLMs for higher-level plans first, before grounding into action sequences. This is more efficient than prompting at every time step.

- Evaluates on a comprehensive set of complex tasks from ScienceWorld benchmark. Many prior works have only been evaluated on simpler interactive tasks. The broad evaluation on diverse complex tasks demonstrates the generalizability.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on the ScienceWorld benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods like SayCan, ReAct and Reflexion.

- Provides extensive analysis of model behavior, including efficiency, cost-effectiveness. This sheds light on how the dual-module architecture results in improvements over single-module approaches.

Overall, by combining fast and slow thinking, the SwiftSage agent represents an important advance in developing more capable and human-like agents for complex interactive reasoning tasks. The dual-process design and prompting strategies are novel contributions not explored deeply by prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Evaluating the generalizability of SwiftSage to other domains beyond ScienceWorld. The authors note that ScienceWorld is a limited textual simulator with a constrained set of actions and tasks compared to real-world scenarios. They suggest developing more open-ended simulators that allow interacting with more diverse actions and objects to better emulate the real world.

- Exploring the potential for more lightweight approaches to slow thinking instead of relying solely on large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. The authors acknowledge the computational demands and potential scalability challenges of using LLMs. They suggest investigating distilling the planning abilities of closed-source LLMs into smaller, open-source models.

- Adding safeguards to prevent agents from taking potentially dangerous actions in real-world embodied tasks. The lack of such safeguards in the current work is noted as a limitation. Building agents that can act safely is highlighted as an important direction.

- Generalizing the framework to handle a wider range of unseen tasks without requiring human subgoal annotations. The need for subgoal annotations in ReAct and Reflexion limits their practicality. Developing methods that are more adaptable to new tasks is suggested.

- Evaluating whether the proposed dual-process approach can enhance performance in other complex reasoning domains beyond interactive tasks. The authors posit collaborative frameworks combining small and large LMs may be beneficial more broadly.

- Exploring whether the planning abilities of LLMs can be distilled into situational knowledge graphs for more efficient planning. This is suggested as a way to avoid repeated LLM calls.

In summary, expanding the diversity of tasks/environments, improving generalizability, avoiding LLM pitfalls, adding safety, and distilling knowledge are highlighted as key future work aimed at advancing complex reasoning abilities of AI agents.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents SwiftSage, a novel agent framework for complex interactive reasoning tasks. SwiftSage is designed to enable both fast and slow thinking, inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition. The framework integrates two primary modules - Swift and Sage. 

The Swift module is based on an encoder-decoder language model fine-tuned via imitation learning on oracle agents' action trajectories. It encodes short-term memory and the current environment state and decodes the next action, embodying intuitive and associative thinking.

The Sage module utilizes large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 for deliberate thinking. It employs a two-stage prompting approach - planning and grounding. In the planning stage, it prompts the LLMs to locate objects, track subgoals, and handle exceptions. In the grounding stage, it focuses on transforming the LLM outputs into executable action sequences. 

To combine the two modules, a heuristic algorithm determines when to activate the Sage module and how to merge its outputs using an action buffer. In experiments on ScienceWorld benchmark tasks, SwiftSage outperforms previous methods in completion, efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

- SwiftSage aims to incorporate these two modes of thinking into an artificial agent. It has two main modules:

1) Swift - Implements fast, intuitive thinking via a smaller Transformer LM trained to mimic oracle agents' behavior through offline imitation learning.

2) Sage - Implements slower, analytical thinking by prompting large LMs like GPT-4 to do more deliberate reasoning for planning subgoals and handling exceptions.

- The paper proposes methods to integrate these two modules effectively, including heuristics for switching between them and generating action buffers from the Sage module.

- Experiments on 30 tasks from ScienceWorld benchmark show SwiftSage significantly outperforms prior methods like SayCan, ReAct, Reflexion in terms of task completion and efficiency.

So in summary, the key focus is on developing a dual process agent that combines the strengths of imitation learning and large LM prompting to achieve better performance on complex reasoning tasks compared to prior approaches. The inspiration from human cognition is a distinguishing aspect.
