# [COSTREAM: Learned Cost Models for Operator Placement in Edge-Cloud   Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Distributed stream processing systems (DSPS) are crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios where data comes from heterogeneous sources like sensors and edge devices. A key challenge is finding good operator placements across the heterogeneous hardware to maximize performance.
- Getting a good initial placement is critical before running the streaming query to avoid issues like backpressure which can lead to crashes or data losses. However, finding the initial placement is hard without knowing the runtime behavior.
- Existing works rely heavily on runtime statistics from monitoring for online reconfiguration but cannot optimize the initial placement. Other works do not address hardware heterogeneity which is crucial for IoT environments.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper presents Costream, a novel learned cost model to predict performance metrics like throughput, latency and backpressure for a given streaming query and placement on heterogeneous hardware.
- A key idea is representing the hardware nodes, operators and data flows jointly as a graph. Node features describe hardware capacity, query complexity etc. in a generalizable way. 
- A Graph Neural Network (GNN) based model is proposed that uses a novel message passing scheme to learn and infer costs. The model can generalize to unseen queries, data and hardware.
- Costream is used to enumerate and evaluate alternative placements to find an optimal initial one before running the query.

Main Contributions:
- Costream - A GNN based cost model that can precisely predict streaming query costs on heterogeneous hardware and generalizes to unseen configurations.
- A joint graph representation of operators, hardware resources and data flows that enables the cost prediction.
- A new message passing scheme in the GNN model tailored for hardware awareness. 
- Using Costream for optimizing the initial placement of streaming operators across edge and cloud resources.
- Extensive evaluation showing high accuracy of Costream, significant speedups over baselines by finding better initial placements, and ability to generalize to unseen queries, data and hardware.

The paper makes a notable contribution in enabling effective initial placement for streaming queries on heterogeneous hardware, while also being highly generalizable. This both improves performance and avoids issues like crashes. Costream has strong potential for use in optimizing distributed stream processing workloads.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Costream, a novel learned cost model for distributed stream processing systems that provides accurate predictions of the execution costs of a streaming query in an edge-cloud environment to enable optimal initial operator placement across heterogeneous hardware.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting \costream, a novel learned cost model for Distributed Stream Processing Systems that provides accurate predictions of the execution costs (such as throughput, latency, backpressure occurrence, etc.) of a streaming query in an edge-cloud environment. The cost model can be used to find an initial placement of operators across heterogeneous hardware, which is particularly important in edge-cloud environments with devices of varying capabilities. A key advantage highlighted is that the cost model can generalize to unseen queries, data, and hardware without needing retraining. When used for optimizing operator placements, significant speedups are demonstrated compared to baseline approaches.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel joint graph representation to model the data flow, operators, hardware resources, and operator placement. What are the key benefits of this representation over prior works? How does it aid in accurate cost prediction?

2. The paper uses a graph neural network (GNN) architecture for cost prediction. Why is a GNN well-suited for this problem compared to other ML models? What modifications were made to the standard GNN message passing scheme and why?

3. Transferable features are proposed to enable generalization to unseen workloads and hardware. What makes these features "transferable"? What were some key considerations when selecting these features?  

4. The paper argues for a cost-based placement approach using a learned cost model instead of end-to-end learning. What are the comparative benefits and limitations of each approach? When would you choose one over the other?

5. Five different cost metrics are proposed - throughput, end-to-end latency, processing latency, backpressure occurrence, and query success. Why is it important to predict all of these metrics instead of just one or two? How do they complement each other?

6. The method relies on a heuristic search strategy to generate placement candidates. What adaptations were made to existing heuristics to suit IoT-edge scenarios? How do the enumerated candidates impact evaluation?

7. How does the method address hardware heterogeneity? What provisions enable it to generalize to resources beyond the training data range? What are its limitations?

8. The model seems to perform worse on predicting network-related metrics compared to compute. Why might this be the case? How can it be improved?

9. For unseen query patterns, fine-tuning is proposed to boost accuracy. How many additional training samples are needed? Is this feasible for rapidly changing queries? Are there other ways to handle new queries?

10. How useful are the cost estimates if the actual workload/data distributions at runtime deviate significantly from those seen during training? Could the model adapt online? What data would be needed?
