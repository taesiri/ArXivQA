# [Lessons from Usable ML Deployments and Application to Wind Turbine   Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02859)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper discusses lessons learned from deploying usable machine learning systems in real-world settings, focusing specifically on an application for predicting wind turbine brakepad failures. The authors highlight three main lessons. First, they introduce the concept of "bridges" - people within companies tasked with connecting domain experts to ML developers. Bridges play a key role in iterating on usable ML interfaces. Second, the authors present their system, Sibyl, for easily configuring usable ML interfaces. Sibyl has a Python library for generating explanations, an API, and an editable UI. Third, the authors argue for continuous evaluation by tracking domain-specific key performance indicators (KPIs) after deployment, rather than one-off user studies. They are applying these lessons to develop a usable ML system that helps turbine operators efficiently decide when to investigate potential brakepad failures onsite. Configurable interfaces show model explanations and supplementary information to aid this decision-making. Through careful application of these lessons around roles, systems, and evaluation, the authors demonstrate the potential for usable ML to positively impact the renewable energy industry.
