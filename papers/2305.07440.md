# [Optimizing Memory Mapping Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07440)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is:Can deep reinforcement learning be used to optimize the memory mapping problem that arises during compilation of machine learning programs?More specifically, the authors introduce an approach to formulate the memory mapping problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in the form of a single-player game called the "mallocGame". They then develop a deep reinforcement learning agent called "mallocMuZero" to play this game and find efficient memory mapping solutions. The central hypothesis is that by framing memory mapping as a sequential decision making problem amenable to planning and search, and applying deep RL techniques, they can discover better memory mapping solutions compared to heuristic approaches used in compilers like XLA. The paper tests this hypothesis by evaluating mallocMuZero on a range of machine learning workloads and comparing its performance to XLA's default memory mapping solver.In summary, the key research question is whether deep RL can be effectively applied to optimize the challenging combinatorial search problem of memory mapping during ML program compilation. The paper introduces a formulation and learning agent to test this hypothesis.
