# [IRFundusSet: An Integrated Retinal Rundus Dataset with a Harmonized   Healthy Label](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11488)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper introduces a new curated dataset called DATASETNAME for retinal fundus images. The goal is to provide a unified collection of images from publicly available datasets along with manually curated pathological labels. This will enable standardized benchmarks and research into retinal diseases using machine learning.

Proposed Solution: 
1) Consolidate images and metadata from 10 diverse public datasets spanning different countries, equipment, pathologies, age groups etc. This introduces diversity while leveraging existing public data.

2) Manually review and curate "is_normal" labels in multiple iterative rounds to identify healthy, non-pathological images. This employs literature review and atlases to aid the process.

3) Standardize pixel data via statistical normalization methods to mitigate batch effects arising from different sources.

4) Provide the final curated set as a unified catalog that maps back to original sources, with added metadata and curated labels.

Key Outcomes:
- New large-scale fundus image dataset containing over # images consolidated from 10 public sources
- Manually curated "is_normal" labels identifying healthy/non-pathological images, enabling new benchmarks
- Enables standardized research into retinal diseases using a diverse and manually-labeled image collection
- Validation via multiple rounds of curation, use of literature/atlases
- Options for statistical normalization to reduce batch effects 

The core value is a unified, diverse and manually-curated dataset with normal/healthy labels for retinal image analysis and disease research.
