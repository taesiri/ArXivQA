# [Decomposed Prompting: A Modular Approach for Solving Complex Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02406)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How to develop an effective approach for solving complex reasoning tasks using large language models with few-shot prompting?

The key hypothesis appears to be that decomposing complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks, and prompting large language models separately on these sub-tasks, can lead to better performance compared to prompting the model directly on the complex task. 

Specifically, the paper proposes an approach called "Decomposed Prompting" (DecomP) which involves:

1) Using a "decomposer" prompt to break down a complex reasoning task into simpler sub-tasks. 

2) Creating separate "sub-task handler" prompts to teach the model each sub-task.

3) Executing the sub-task prompts sequentially to solve the overall complex task.

The central hypothesis is that this decomposition approach will allow the sub-task prompts to be optimized better, sub-tasks could be further decomposed if needed, and different prompts or models could be swapped in for different sub-tasks. Overall, the paper tests whether this leads to improved performance over standard few-shot prompting methods on complex reasoning tasks.

In summary, the central research question is how to effectively solve complex tasks with few-shot prompting of large language models, with the key hypothesis being that decomposing tasks into sub-task prompts will improve performance. The DecomP approach is proposed and evaluated as a method to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a new approach called Decomposed Prompting (DecomP) for solving complex reasoning tasks by decomposing them into simpler sub-tasks. The key ideas are:

- Using a "decomposer" prompt to generate a sequence of simpler sub-tasks needed to solve a complex task, rather than having to demonstrate the full reasoning in a single prompt like in chain-of-thought prompting.

- The sub-tasks are handled by separate "sub-task handlers" which are prompting-based LLMs focused on those simpler tasks. This allows optimizing each sub-task prompt independently.

- The sub-tasks can be further recursively decomposed if still too complex. Sub-task handlers can also be symbolic functions like retrievers.

- This decomposition provides modularity, easier debugging/upgrading of components, ability to incorporate symbolic functions, and potential benefits like better generalization.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing the DecomP framework to break down complex reasoning tasks into modular sub-task prompts that can be optimized independently. Experiments demonstrate benefits like improved generalization and incorporation of symbolic functions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- The approach of using modular prompting to decompose complex tasks is novel and hasn't been explored much in prior work on few-shot prompting. Most prior work has focused on approaches like chain-of-thought prompting that demonstrate the full reasoning steps. This decomposition idea allows for more systematic debugging, optimization, and generalization.

- The idea of recursively decomposing tasks to make them scale-invariant is clever. This is related to ideas in program synthesis and algorithm design but hasn't been explored much in few-shot prompting. It allows the approach to work on longer sequences than the base model can handle.

- Incorporating symbolic functions like information retrieval into the prompting framework is powerful. Most prior few-shot prompting work has focused on pure LLM approaches. Allowing seamless integration of neural and symbolic AI is an important contribution.

- The evaluation covers a diverse set of reasoning tasks from math and symbolic manipulations to open-domain QA. Many recent prompting papers have focused narrowly on a single task or genre, so it's good to see a systematic assessment across different domains.

- The gains over chain-of-thought prompting are substantial across the board. This shows the flexibility of the approach over what was previously the state-of-the-art in few-shot prompting.

Overall, I think this is a very novel and important contribution that shows a promising new paradigm for few-shot prompting that supports modularity, generalization, and seamless integration of symbolic capabilities. The gains over prior prompting approaches are substantial and it addresses key limitations like handling complexity and length.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more sophisticated neural network architectures for multi-step reasoning. The authors mention possibilities like graph networks or memory networks that can better represent the structure and dependencies in multi-step reasoning problems.

- Exploring how to combine neural networks with symbolic methods or modular software engineering principles. The paper discusses the potential benefits of using neural modules together with more interpretable symbolic functions.

- Scaling up training with weak supervision. The authors suggest exploring ways to train multi-step reasoning models on large datasets by using weak supervision sources like demonstrations or natural language explanations.

- Generalizing to more complex reasoning tasks. Testing the methods on more unstructured tasks that require more flexible reasoning, common sense knowledge, and real-world understanding.

- Studying how to transfer or adapt reasoning strategies across different tasks and domains. Looking at meta-learning approaches to allow models to learn more generalizable reasoning procedures.

- Incorporating better structure and inductive biases into models. Using techniques like graph networks, modular architectures, or constrained attention to help models learn the right abstractions for multi-step reasoning.

- Exploring reinforcement learning and search-based methods for multi-step reasoning. The paper suggests these techniques may help optimize sequence generation and exploration of reasoning chains.

So in summary, advancing multi-step reasoning appears to require improvements in model architectures, training procedures, generalization, and interpretability. Combining neural networks with symbolic methods also seems promising. Testing on more complex real-world tasks is needed to drive further progress.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents an algorithm called SplitReverse for reversing the elements of a sequence. The algorithm works recursively by splitting the input sequence in half, reversing each half, and then concatenating the reversed halves back together. If the input sequence is small (length less than 4), it simply reverses the sequence directly. Otherwise, it splits the sequence in half, calls SplitReverse recursively on each half to reverse them, and concatenates the reversed halves back together in reverse order. This divide-and-conquer approach allows the algorithm to reverse a sequence in O(log n) time by recursively splitting the problem in half rather than reversing each element individually. The key ideas are using recursion to reduce large problems to smaller subproblems of the same type, and reversing the concatenation order of the subsolutions to achieve the final reversed sequence.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents an algorithm called SplitReverse for reversing the elements in a sequence. The algorithm works recursively by splitting the input sequence in half, recursively reversing each half, and then concatenating the reversed halves back together. This divide-and-conquer approach allows the algorithm to operate in O(log n) time complexity. 

The base case is when the input sequence has less than 4 elements, in which case the algorithm simply returns those elements in reverse order. For longer input sequences, the algorithm splits the sequence in half, calls itself recursively on each half to reverse them, and then concatenates the two reversed halves back together in the opposite order to produce the fully reversed output sequence. By repeatedly dividing the problem in half, the algorithm is able to operate efficiently on sequences of any length.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents Decomposed Prompting (DecomP), a new approach for solving complex reasoning tasks using large language models (LLMs) through few-shot prompting. DecomP involves decomposing a complex task into a sequence of simpler sub-tasks using a "decomposer" LLM. Each sub-task is then handled by a specialized LLM "sub-task handler". The decomposer is trained using a few examples that demonstrate how to decompose the task into sub-tasks. The sub-task handlers are trained separately on broader sets of in-context examples specific to their simpler task. At inference time, the decomposer generates a sequence of sub-tasks to solve the overall task, each of which is handled by the appropriate sub-task handler. This modular approach allows optimizing each component's prompt separately, recursively decomposing sub-tasks if needed, and even replacing sub-task handlers with symbolic modules. The method is evaluated on symbolic reasoning, long-context QA, open-domain QA, and math QA tasks, showing benefits over standard few-shot prompting methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called Decomposed Prompting (DecomP) that breaks down complex reasoning tasks into simpler sub-tasks handled by separate prompt-based modules to improve few-shot performance on challenging tasks like symbolic reasoning, long-context QA, open-domain QA, and math word problems.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, this paper appears to be addressing the challenge of getting large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks using few-shot prompting. 

Specifically, the authors note that while LLMs like GPT-3 have shown impressive abilities when prompted with just a few examples, their performance deteriorates as the reasoning tasks become more complex. For instance, providing just a few demonstrations of concatenating the kth letter of words in a sentence is insufficient for the model to reliably learn to extract the kth letter. 

The key limitation highlighted is that with standard few-shot prompting, it is difficult to effectively teach the model each of the reasoning steps required for complex tasks. The paper proposes a new approach called Decomposed Prompting (DecomP) to address this challenge. The core idea is to decompose complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be handled by specialized prompt-based modules. 

In summary, the key problem being addressed is how to get LLMs to reliably perform multi-step reasoning and complex problem-solving using the few-shot prompting paradigm, especially when the individual steps themselves are challenging to learn. The proposed solution is a prompt programming framework that breaks down tasks into modular sub-task prompts.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes DecomP, a new approach to solving complex reasoning tasks using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. DecomP decomposes a complex task into simpler sub-tasks by generating a prompting program, with each step directing a sub-query to a function in an auxiliary set of sub-task functions (other prompting-based LLMs or symbolic functions). This provides modularity and flexibility compared to prior few-shot prompting methods. Sub-tasks can be optimized independently, decomposed further if needed, or replaced with improved implementations. The authors demonstrate DecomP's capabilities on symbolic reasoning tasks, long-context QA, and open-domain multi-hop QA. For symbolic tasks, DecomP recursively decomposes problems into smaller instances and outperforms Chain-of-Thought prompting. For QA, it incorporates retrieval into the prompting program and uses specialized sub-task prompts to improve performance over Chain-of-Thought. Overall, DecomP provides a new prompting paradigm enabling LLMs to solve complex tasks in a flexible, modular manner.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Decomposed Prompting (DecomP), a new approach to solve complex reasoning tasks using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. DecomP works by decomposing a complex task into simpler sub-tasks via a prompting program, with each sub-task handled by a dedicated LLM prompt.
