# [JAXbind: Bind any function to JAX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08847)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- JAX is a popular library for machine learning and scientific computing that supports automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation for performance. However, much existing high-performance code is not written in JAX.
- Reimplementing existing code in JAX is often impractical. The existing JAX interface for binding custom code requires deep JAX expertise.
- There is a need for an easy way to connect existing high-performance code to JAX to leverage its capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present JAXbind, a package that provides an easy Python interface for binding arbitrary functions to JAX as "primitives". 
- JAXbind handles registering the function, its gradients, and transpose with JAX to support automatic differentiation and transformations.

Key Features:
- Allows specifying Python functions for the original function, its Jacobian-vector product, and vector-Jacobian product. JAXbind registers these to enable JAX automatic differentiation.
- Supports abstract evaluation functions for JAX compilation.
- Provides simplified interface for linear functions.
- Works for CPU execution currently. Could be extended for GPUs.

Main Contributions:
- Drastically reduces the effort to leverage JAX for existing high-performance code compared to directly using the JAX C++ backend.
- Enables easy mixing of JAX and non-JAX code to combine advantages.
- Opens up many new opportunities to use JAX in computational sciences by connecting to existing libraries.
- Includes plans to connect high-performance libraries like DUCC and NIFTY to JAX using JAXbind.

In summary, JAXbind makes it straightforward to bind external functions to JAX while retaining support for JAX's powerful automatic differentiation and compilation. This enables new applications and easier use of JAX in computational sciences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

JAXbind is a Python package that provides an easy interface for binding external functions written in languages other than JAX to JAX, enabling them to leverage JAX's powerful automatic differentiation and compilation capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of JAXbind, a Python package that provides an easy interface for defining JAX primitives to bind custom functions (implemented in languages other than JAX) to JAX. In particular, JAXbind allows registering arbitrary functions, their partial derivatives, and transpose functions as JAX primitives while supporting all JAX transformations like jit-compilation and batching. This allows incorporating existing high-performance code into JAX without needing to reimplement it in JAX or have deep knowledge of JAX's internals. The paper argues this will be highly useful for connecting specialized scientific computing code to JAX to utilize its automatic differentiation and other features.

In summary, the main contribution is the JAXbind package for easily binding external functions to JAX as primitives.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- JAXbind - The software package introduced in the paper for binding custom functions to JAX
- JAX - The machine learning framework that JAXbind connects other code to
- Automatic differentiation - A key capability of JAX that the custom functions bound with JAXbind need to support
- Primitives - The JAX concept for its basic operations that custom functions become when bound with JAXbind
- Pushforward/Jacobian-vector product (jvp) - Mathematical concept for the Jacobian matrix multiplied by a vector
- Pullback/vector-Jacobian product (vjp) - Mathematical concept for the transpose of the Jacobian multiplied by a vector
- Abstract evaluation - JAX concept needed to compile functions, requires specifying output shape and dtype
- Linear functions - A special case handled more efficiently by JAXbind
- Scientific computing - One of the main target application areas envisioned for JAXbind

The key goal of the paper is connecting existing high-performance code to JAX while supporting all of JAX's transformation capabilities like automatic differentiation. The terms above relate to the methodology introduced in JAXbind to accomplish this.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that JAXbind provides an easy-to-use Python interface for defining JAX primitives. Can you elaborate on what this interface looks like and how user-friendly it is for binding functions to JAX?

2. When binding a function to JAX using JAXbind, the user has to provide implementations of the Jacobian-vector product (jvp) and vector-Jacobian product (vjp) of that function. What strategies does JAXbind employ, if any, to make providing these derivatives easier for the user? 

3. The paper demonstrates binding a simple nonlinear function f(x1,x2) = x1*x2^2 to JAX using JAXbind. Walk through how you could use JAXbind to bind a more complex, real-world function with multiple inputs and outputs. What additional considerations need to be made?

4. For linear functions, JAXbind provides a specialized interface only requiring the user to provide an implementation of the function and its transpose. Explain why defining just the function and its transpose is sufficient for linear functions. What assumptions does this rely on?

5. The current version of JAXbind only supports primitives that act on CPU memory. Discuss the modifications needed to add support for GPU-based primitives. What GPU-specific optimizations could be implemented?

6. Higher-order derivatives beyond first derivatives are currently not supported in JAXbind. Propose an strategy to extend JAXbind to support specifying arbitrary higher-order derivatives when binding a function. What changes would need to be made to the interface?

7. The paper mentions connecting existing high-performance code to JAX to enable mixing with JAX code. What types of issues around mismatching data formats, memory layouts, etc. might arise when integrating external code with JAX? How could JAXbind help address these?

8. Explain the difference between a Jacobian-vector product and a vector-Jacobian product. Why does JAX require both to enable automatic differentiation of bound functions? Give an example function and its corresponding jvp and vjp. 

9. The paper compares JAXbind to Enzyme-JAX. What are some key differences and similarities between these two methods for connecting external functions to JAX? What are some pros and cons of each approach?

10. One use case mentioned is connecting spherical harmonic transforms from the DUCC library to JAX. Walk through how you could use JAXbind to bind this specific function to JAX. What components would you need to provide?
