# [JAXbind: Bind any function to JAX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08847)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- JAX is a popular library for machine learning and scientific computing that supports automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation for performance. However, much existing high-performance code is not written in JAX.
- Reimplementing existing code in JAX is often impractical. The existing JAX interface for binding custom code requires deep JAX expertise.
- There is a need for an easy way to connect existing high-performance code to JAX to leverage its capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present JAXbind, a package that provides an easy Python interface for binding arbitrary functions to JAX as "primitives". 
- JAXbind handles registering the function, its gradients, and transpose with JAX to support automatic differentiation and transformations.

Key Features:
- Allows specifying Python functions for the original function, its Jacobian-vector product, and vector-Jacobian product. JAXbind registers these to enable JAX automatic differentiation.
- Supports abstract evaluation functions for JAX compilation.
- Provides simplified interface for linear functions.
- Works for CPU execution currently. Could be extended for GPUs.

Main Contributions:
- Drastically reduces the effort to leverage JAX for existing high-performance code compared to directly using the JAX C++ backend.
- Enables easy mixing of JAX and non-JAX code to combine advantages.
- Opens up many new opportunities to use JAX in computational sciences by connecting to existing libraries.
- Includes plans to connect high-performance libraries like DUCC and NIFTY to JAX using JAXbind.

In summary, JAXbind makes it straightforward to bind external functions to JAX while retaining support for JAX's powerful automatic differentiation and compilation. This enables new applications and easier use of JAX in computational sciences.
