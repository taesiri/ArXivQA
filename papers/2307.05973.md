# [VoxPoser: Composable 3D Value Maps for Robotic Manipulation with   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05973)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize robot trajectories for a wide variety of manipulation tasks, given open-set instructions and objects, without requiring manual design of motion primitives or large-scale robot interaction data?The key hypothesis appears to be:LLMs can be prompted to compose 3D value maps that translate free-form language instructions into dense spatial objectives grounded in the robot's observation space. These value maps can then guide trajectory optimization in a model-based control framework to achieve zero-shot generalization to new tasks.In summary, the paper explores using LLMs as a knowledge source to map instructions to grounded cost functions, avoiding the need for manual engineering or training on large robot datasets. The value maps composed by the LLM can directly guide trajectory optimization for manipulating novel objects in new ways described by open-set natural language commands.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting VoxPoser, a method for extracting affordances and constraints from language models to compose 3D value maps that can guide robots to perform a variety of manipulation tasks. Specifically:- VoxPoser uses large language models (LLMs) to infer affordances and constraints from free-form natural language instructions. By leveraging the LLM's code writing capabilities, it interacts with visual-language models to ground the extracted knowledge into 3D voxel maps in the observation space of the robot. - These composed 3D value maps serve as dense reward functions that can be used by motion planners to synthesize trajectories for manipulating objects according to the instruction. This allows performing a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a zero-shot manner without additional training data.- VoxPoser enables closed-loop execution of the planned trajectories using model predictive control, showing robustness to disturbances. It can also efficiently learn dynamics models from limited online experience to handle contact-rich tasks.- The method is evaluated extensively in both simulated and real-world environments on an open-set of instructions and objects, demonstrating effective generalization.In summary, the key contribution is presenting VoxPoser as a general framework to leverage LLMs' knowledge to compose grounded 3D value maps for guiding robotic manipulation, enabling zero-shot generalization to diverse tasks while also being amenable to efficient online learning.

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper presents VoxPoser, a method that uses large language models to generate 3D voxel maps specifying affordances and constraints grounded in the visual observation space, enabling robotic manipulation for a variety of tasks from free-form language instructions without additional training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key observations on how this paper compares to other related work in robotic manipulation with language instructions:- This paper proposes a novel method called VoxPoser that leverages large language models (LLMs) to compose 3D value maps grounding language instructions for robotic manipulation. Compared to prior works that rely on learning from human demonstrations or reinforcement learning, VoxPoser is more of a zero-shot planning approach that does not require additional training of the LLM or robot.- Instead of using LLMs to directly output primitive actions or skills, this paper shows that LLMs can excel at inferring affordances and constraints from free-form instructions, and compose them into dense 3D maps that guide motion planning. This spatial grounding in observation space is a unique aspect not explored by prior language-conditioned policy works.- The paper demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to novel instructions and scenes by leveraging the knowledge already internalized in LLMs. In their experiments, VoxPoser outperforms supervised and LLM baselines in unseen tasks and instructions. This showcases the potential of foundation models like LLMs for robot learning compared to methods reliant on in-domain training data.- The paper also shows how VoxPoser can efficiently learn dynamics models for contact-rich tasks using the zero-shot trajectories as priors. This indicates the framework is not limited to planning, but can also aid online learning during deployment by focusing interactions.- Overall, the key differences of VoxPoser seem to be the spatial grounding of language affordances into 3D observation space without training, the generalizability from leveraging LLMs, and the flexibility to aid downstream learning. The evaluations demonstrate promise on a variety of everyday robot manipulation tasks.In summary, the paper proposes and validates an intriguing new paradigm for scalable acquisition of robotic manipulation skills using LLMs that contrasts with prior demonstration-based or reinforcement learning approaches. The results showcase potential generalization benefits compared to methods relying solely on training data.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some future research directions the authors suggest:- Developing more advanced optimization methods that can best interface with the 3D value maps synthesized by VoxPoser. The paper mentions that they use greedy search for trajectory optimization which is simple but likely not optimal. More advanced optimization methods could be explored.- Using multi-modal LLMs that can directly take in visual observations instead of relying on an external perception module. The authors note that relying on external perception is a limitation since LLMs may require more holistic visual reasoning for certain tasks. Multi-modal LLMs could help address this.- Learning a general-purpose dynamics model to achieve contact-rich tasks with the same level of generalization as the zero-shot performance. The paper shows VoxPoser can benefit from online experience to learn dynamics models, but notes that a general dynamics model would be useful.- Moving from end-effector trajectory planning to whole-arm planning, which the paper mentions is likely a better design choice.- Addressing the need for manual prompt engineering when using LLMs. The authors note prompt engineering is required currently and suggest methods for alignment or prompting could help alleviate this.- Leveraging the emergent capabilities exhibited by VoxPoser, like physics estimation or multi-step visual programming, and studying if they can be explicitly induced.In summary, the main future directions are improving the optimization and planning components, incorporating multi-modal perception with LLMs, learning more generalizable dynamics models, reducing the need for prompt engineering, and further exploring the emergent abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces VoxPoser, a method for generating robot trajectories to perform everyday manipulation tasks specified by natural language instructions. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract affordances and constraints from the instructions, and generates Python code that interacts with visual-language models to compose 3D "value maps" in the robot's observation space. These value maps represent costs and rewards that can guide motion planning to synthesize trajectories in a zero-shot manner without additional training. The approach is agnostic to the specific motion planner used. Experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate its ability to generalize to novel instructions and objects for tasks like moving objects, avoiding obstacles, opening doors, etc. It can also efficiently learn dynamics models for contact-rich tasks using limited online experience. Key benefits are leveraging pre-trained LLMs for task generalization and grounding language in 3D observation space for closed-loop control. Limitations include reliance on external perception systems and the need for more general dynamics models.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents VoxPoser, a method for extracting affordances and constraints from large language models (LLMs) to compose 3D value maps that can guide robots to complete manipulation tasks specified by free-form natural language instructions. VoxPoser leverages the code-writing capabilities of LLMs to interact with visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP to detect objects and parts from an RGB-D observation of the environment. The LLM generates Python code that calls the VLMs to obtain spatial-geometric information about relevant objects and parts. It then manipulates 3D voxel arrays using operations like Euclidean distance transforms and Gaussian filters to create dense value maps that prescribe reward or cost in the observation space based on the instruction. These composed 3D value maps serve as objective functions for model-based motion planners to synthesize trajectories to complete the manipulation task in a zero-shot manner without additional training of the LLM or VLMs. VoxPoser enables generalization to new tasks and environments.
