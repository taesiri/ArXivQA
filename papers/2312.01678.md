# [Jellyfish: A Large Language Model for Data Preprocessing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01678)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces Jellyfish, an open-source large language model designed specifically for data preprocessing tasks. Built on top of Meta's LLaMA model and instruction-tuned on datasets for error detection, data imputation, schema matching, and entity matching, Jellyfish serves as a universal data preprocessor that can generalize to other tasks. With 13 billion parameters, Jellyfish runs efficiently on a single local GPU while ensuring data privacy. Through natural language prompts, users can manually specify instructions and optional domain knowledge to specialize Jellyfish to new datasets and tasks. A key capability is Jellyfish's interpreter module, which provides natural language explanations justifying its output decisions. Evaluations using real-world datasets demonstrate Jellyfish's strong performance relative to state-of-the-art methods, impressive generalization ability, and superior reasoning compared to GPT-3.5. The techniques employed in constructing Jellyfish, including careful pre-tuning and injection of task knowledge, are shown to effectively improve its data preprocessing abilities.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of Jellyfish, an open-source large language model tailored for data preprocessing tasks. Specifically:

- Jellyfish is built on top of Meta AI's LLaMA model and is instruction-tuned for four typical data preprocessing tasks: error detection, data imputation, schema matching, and entity matching. It demonstrates strong performance on these tasks while also generalizing well to other unseen data preprocessing tasks.

- Jellyfish operates on a single, low-cost GPU with 13 billion parameters. This allows it to run locally without compromising data security or efficiency. The model is further tunable as it is open source. 

- The paper proposes methods for effectively tuning Jellyfish, including carefully selecting pre-training datasets to improve reasoning skills and using instruction tuning to teach the model using natural language prompts. Techniques like knowledge injection are also introduced.

- Jellyfish has an interpreter module that generates natural language explanations for its output decisions. This adds more transparency and interpretability compared to other language models.

In summary, the main contribution is an open, efficient, and accurate language model designed specifically for data preprocessing that also provides interpretability. The techniques explored in tailoring and tuning this model are also noteworthy contributions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes Jellyfish as an open-source large language model for data preprocessing. What are some key advantages of using an open-source model compared to relying on proprietary APIs like GPT?

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Data preprocessing (DP) is a crucial step in the data mining pipeline that deals with noise, missing values, inconsistencies, and heterogeneity in data. Prior DP solutions focused on specific tasks like error detection, data imputation, schema matching, and entity matching. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, there is interest in developing generic DP solutions applicable to a wide range of tasks by leveraging LLMs' ability to understand natural language instructions. However, existing LLM-based solutions rely on proprietary models like GPT-3, raising data privacy concerns.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Jellyfish, an open-source LLM tailored to various DP tasks. Jellyfish is built on Meta's LLama-13B model and instruction-tuned on datasets of typical DP tasks like error detection, data imputation, schema matching and entity matching. It employs an instance serializer to automatically translate raw data into prompts, and a knowledge injector to optionally specify prior knowledge. Jellyfish also includes an interpreter model to explain its output decisions.

Main Contributions:
- Jellyfish showcases several features like moderte size, assurance of data security, feasibility of further tuning, handling of natural language instructions and incorporation of prior knowledge.
- The paper details the techniques like selection of pre-tuning datasets, preparation of instruction data and reasoning data for DP tasks.  
- Experiments demonstrate Jellyfish's effectiveness on seen DP tasks, its generalizability to new unseen tasks, and superior reasoning abilities compared to GPT-3.5.
- Analysis highlights the usefulness of techniques employed in building Jellyfish like pre-tuning and knowledge injection.

In summary, the paper proposes Jellyfish, an open-source LLM for data preprocessing that is trainable, interpretable and generalizable, enabled by a set of tuning techniques tailored for DP tasks.
