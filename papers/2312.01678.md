# [Jellyfish: A Large Language Model for Data Preprocessing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01678)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces Jellyfish, an open-source large language model designed specifically for data preprocessing tasks. Built on top of Meta's LLaMA model and instruction-tuned on datasets for error detection, data imputation, schema matching, and entity matching, Jellyfish serves as a universal data preprocessor that can generalize to other tasks. With 13 billion parameters, Jellyfish runs efficiently on a single local GPU while ensuring data privacy. Through natural language prompts, users can manually specify instructions and optional domain knowledge to specialize Jellyfish to new datasets and tasks. A key capability is Jellyfish's interpreter module, which provides natural language explanations justifying its output decisions. Evaluations using real-world datasets demonstrate Jellyfish's strong performance relative to state-of-the-art methods, impressive generalization ability, and superior reasoning compared to GPT-3.5. The techniques employed in constructing Jellyfish, including careful pre-tuning and injection of task knowledge, are shown to effectively improve its data preprocessing abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Jellyfish, an open-source large language model tailored for data preprocessing tasks through instruction tuning on datasets for error detection, data imputation, schema matching, and entity matching.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of Jellyfish, an open-source large language model tailored for data preprocessing tasks. Specifically:

- Jellyfish is built on top of Meta AI's LLaMA model and is instruction-tuned for four typical data preprocessing tasks: error detection, data imputation, schema matching, and entity matching. It demonstrates strong performance on these tasks while also generalizing well to other unseen data preprocessing tasks.

- Jellyfish operates on a single, low-cost GPU with 13 billion parameters. This allows it to run locally without compromising data security or efficiency. The model is further tunable as it is open source. 

- The paper proposes methods for effectively tuning Jellyfish, including carefully selecting pre-training datasets to improve reasoning skills and using instruction tuning to teach the model using natural language prompts. Techniques like knowledge injection are also introduced.

- Jellyfish has an interpreter module that generates natural language explanations for its output decisions. This adds more transparency and interpretability compared to other language models.

In summary, the main contribution is an open, efficient, and accurate language model designed specifically for data preprocessing that also provides interpretability. The techniques explored in tailoring and tuning this model are also noteworthy contributions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes Jellyfish as an open-source large language model for data preprocessing. What are some key advantages of using an open-source model compared to relying on proprietary APIs like GPT?

2. The paper selects Llama-13B as the base model for Jellyfish. What were the main criteria used for selecting this base model and why is the 13B parameter size well-suited for data preprocessing tasks?

3. The paper employs both pre-tuning and instruction tuning when developing Jellyfish. What is the rationale behind using two separate tuning stages, and what specifically does each stage aim to enhance in the model?

4. Jellyfish is instruction-tuned on four data preprocessing tasks - error detection, data imputation, schema matching and entity matching. Why were these specific tasks selected and how does competency in these tasks translate to broader applicability?  

5. The paper introduces both a Jellyfish solver model and an interpreter model. Why is it beneficial to have separate models handling these two roles instead of a single combined model?

6. When generating training data for the interpreter model, GPT-4 responses are used as reasoning ground truths. Why is GPT-4 well-suited for providing explanatory responses and what are the limitations of this approach?

7. The instruction tuning injects both general knowledge and dataset-specific knowledge into Jellyfish. Provide some examples of each knowledge type and explain how they aid in enhancing performance.

8. How does the optional few-shot prompting technique allow Jellyfish to be conditioned for specific datasets and tasks without retraining the entire model? What are some automatic ways few-shot examples could be generated?

9. Jellyfish makes use of the LoRA technique to enable efficient switching between the solver and interpreter models. Explain how LoRA works and why it enables quick swapping of models.

10. The paper demonstrates Jellyfish's applicability to unseen data preprocessing tasks through column type annotation and attribute value extraction case studies. What modifications or prompt engineering techniques were required to extend Jellyfish to these new tasks?
