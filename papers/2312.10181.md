# [Coupling Fairness and Pruning in a Single Run: a Bi-level Optimization   Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10181)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural network pruning aims to remove redundant parameters to improve efficiency, but can introduce or amplify algorithmic bias issues. 
- Existing methods tackle fairness and pruning separately, which can degrade performance or fairness. Integrating them is challenging as pruning focuses on the mask while fairness focuses on the weights.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel framework called Bi-level Fair Pruning (BiFP) to jointly optimize the pruning mask and weight update processes with fairness constraints.  
- It formulates fair pruning as a constrained bi-level optimization problem, with the upper level optimizing the mask and the lower level optimizing the weights under fairness constraints.
- To facilitate optimization, it relaxes the discrete masks into continuous scores and reformulates the non-differentiable fairness metric into a differentiable constraint.

Main Contributions:
- Defines new fairness notions tailored for model compression - performance fairness and performance degradation fairness.
- Pioneers a joint optimization framework that simultaneously couples fair mask learning and fair weight learning. This unified approach ensures efficiency and fairness in one shot.
- Outperforms baselines in fairness, accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies validate the vital role of both mask and weight constraints in achieving fair pruning.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative bi-level optimization framework to simultaneously optimize masks and weights with fairness constraints. By harmonizing these typically disjoint processes, it achieves the delicate balance of performance, efficiency and fairness during neural network pruning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel bi-level optimization framework called BiFP to simultaneously optimize the pruning mask and weight update processes with fairness constraints in order to achieve fair and efficient neural network pruning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called Bi-level Fair Pruning (BiFP) to simultaneously optimize the pruning mask and weight update processes with fairness constraints during model pruning. Specifically:

- The paper formulates the fair pruning problem as a constrained bi-level optimization task and derives efficient solving strategies. 

- The framework jointly optimizes the masking and weight variables with fairness constraints on both, in order to strike a balance between preserving model performance and ensuring fairness.

- Through this simultaneous optimization approach, the method endeavors to maintain fairness throughout the bi-level optimization process for pruning. This avoids the need for separate sequential runs for fairness and pruning.

- Extensive experiments validate that the proposed approach can effectively mitigate bias and ensure comparable or better accuracy with notably lower training costs compared to baseline methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate the indispensable role of both the mask and weight constraints.

In summary, the key innovation is the formulation and solving strategy for fair pruning based on a novel bi-level optimization perspective to harmonize performance, efficiency and fairness in one joint process.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Neural network pruning - The paper focuses on methods to prune/compress neural networks to reduce complexity and improve efficiency. This is a core focus.

- Fairness - Ensuring fairness and mitigating algorithmic bias, especially in the context of neural network pruning, is a major goal addressed in the paper. 

- Bi-level optimization - The paper formulates the fair neural network pruning problem as a bi-level optimization problem and proposes solution methods based on this formulation.

- Joint optimization - The paper proposes jointly optimizing the pruning mask and weight update processes with fairness constraints in a unified manner.

- Performance - Maintaining accuracy and performance of the pruned models is also a key focus along with efficiency and fairness.

- Bias metrics - Notions like statistical parity, equalized accuracy, etc. are used to quantify bias/unfairness. Reducing these metrics is a goal.

- Ablation studies - Ablation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the importance of both mask and weight constraints for achieving fair pruning.

In summary, the key themes are around fairness-aware neural network pruning, using bi-level optimization to enable joint mask and weight fair learning, while preserving performance.
