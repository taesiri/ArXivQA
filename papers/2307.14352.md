# [General Image-to-Image Translation with One-Shot Image Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14352)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It proposes a novel framework called Visual Concept Translator (VCT) for general image-to-image translation guided by a single reference image. - The goal is to generate a new image that preserves the content/structure of a source image while reflecting the visual concepts of the reference image.- The VCT contains two key processes:   - Content-Concept Inversion (CCI): Extracts content representation from source image via pivot turning inversion, and concept representation from reference image via multi-concept inversion.   - Content-Concept Fusion (CCF): Employs a dual-stream denoising architecture to fuse the extracted content and concept information to generate the final image.- The main research question is: How can we perform general image-to-image translation with the ability to preserve content in the source image and translate visual concepts from a single reference image?- The VCT framework, CCI and CCF processes are proposed to address this question and enable translating visual concepts from reference images while maintaining structure/content of source images.So in summary, the key hypothesis is that the proposed VCT framework with CCI and CCF can enable general image-to-image translation guided by just a single reference image, with source content preservation and reference concept translation. The paper presents the approach and conducts experiments to validate it.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called Visual Concept Translator (VCT) for general image-to-image translation guided by a single reference image. The key ideas are:- Content-Concept Inversion (CCI): Extracts content and concepts from the source and reference images through pivot turning inversion and multi-concept inversion respectively.- Content-Concept Fusion (CCF): Employs a dual-stream denoising architecture to fuse the extracted content and concepts to generate the final output image. - Attention Control: Uses attention maps from the content matching branch to guide the main branch for better structure preservation.The proposed VCT allows translating visual concepts from a reference image into a source image while preserving the content structure, enabling a wide range of general image-to-image translation tasks with only one reference image. Experiments on various tasks like animal faces transformation, style transfer etc. demonstrate the effectiveness of VCT.In summary, the main contribution is developing a novel one-shot image-guided framework for general image translation by extracting and fusing content and concepts from source and reference images in an innovative way. The proposed techniques enable translating visual concepts from reference images effectively while preserving content structure.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new framework called Visual Concept Translator (VCT) that can perform general image-to-image translation guided by a single reference image, with the ability to preserve content from a source image while translating visual concepts from the reference image.
