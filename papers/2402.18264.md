# [Retrieval-based Full-length Wikipedia Generation for Emergent Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating full-length, structured Wikipedia articles for emerging topics is crucial but challenging. Prior works have limitations in length, faithfulness, consideration of pre-training corpus, and evaluation methods.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce new benchmark "WikiGenBen" with 309 events and retrieved web pages as evidence documents.
- Design comprehensive evaluation metrics for fluency, informativeness and faithfulness. 
- Propose "Retrieve-Plan-Retrieve-Read" (RPRR) framework to address context window limitation via multi-stage retrieval.
- Analyze impact of different retrieval methods and LLMs.

Key Contributions:
- New benchmark and task formulation for generating Wikipedia articles for emergent events using web search results.
- Systematic evaluation approach measuring multiple aspects like fluency, coverage of details, faithfulness.
- Analysis showing performance tradeoffs with different sizes of retrieved documents, retrieval methods, and LLMs. 
- Findings highlighting challenges like maintaining factual accuracy and role of task segmentation in enhancing coherence and focus.

The paper makes notable contributions in facilitating timely creation of Wikipedia entries, through the introduction of a new benchmark, evaluation metrics and analysis. It points to future work needed in areas like improving dense retrievers and citation generation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new benchmark called WikiGenBen for generating Wikipedia articles. What are some key characteristics of this benchmark dataset and how is it constructed?

2. The paper utilizes a Retrieve-Plan-Retrieve-Read (RPRR) framework for Wikipedia generation. Can you explain the workflow of this approach and how it helps overcome limitations like the context window of LLMs?

3. The paper analyzes the impact of different components like retrieval methods and LLMs on Wikipedia generation performance. What are some key findings from this analysis? For example, how do sparse and dense retrievers compare?  

4. One interesting finding is that search engine results can be as effective as human-curated references for emergent events. Why might this be the case? What implications does this have?

5. The paper proposes some novel evaluation metrics beyond n-gram similarity to assess qualities like fluency, informativeness and faithfulness. Can you describe 2-3 of these proposed metrics and how they provide a more comprehensive measure?

6. There is some evidence of inconsistency between n-gram metrics and more holistic GPT-4 based scoring. What might explain this discrepancy and why might GPT-4 be a "better judge" in certain cases?

7. How exactly does the paper evaluate whether statements in the generated text are properly supported by citations from the reference documents? What metrics are used?

8. One limitation noted is the redundancy that can occur from section-by-section generation. What approach does the paper suggest to address this issue?  

9. What broader impact might the benchmark and findings from this paper have on the advancement of Wikipedia content generation? Where is there clear potential for future enhancement?

10. Could the proposed benchmark and RPRR framework be extended to other knowledge base construction tasks beyond Wikipedia generation? What might need to be adapted?
