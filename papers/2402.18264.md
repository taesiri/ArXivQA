# [Retrieval-based Full-length Wikipedia Generation for Emergent Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating full-length, structured Wikipedia articles for emerging topics is crucial but challenging. Prior works have limitations in length, faithfulness, consideration of pre-training corpus, and evaluation methods.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce new benchmark "WikiGenBen" with 309 events and retrieved web pages as evidence documents.
- Design comprehensive evaluation metrics for fluency, informativeness and faithfulness. 
- Propose "Retrieve-Plan-Retrieve-Read" (RPRR) framework to address context window limitation via multi-stage retrieval.
- Analyze impact of different retrieval methods and LLMs.

Key Contributions:
- New benchmark and task formulation for generating Wikipedia articles for emergent events using web search results.
- Systematic evaluation approach measuring multiple aspects like fluency, coverage of details, faithfulness.
- Analysis showing performance tradeoffs with different sizes of retrieved documents, retrieval methods, and LLMs. 
- Findings highlighting challenges like maintaining factual accuracy and role of task segmentation in enhancing coherence and focus.

The paper makes notable contributions in facilitating timely creation of Wikipedia entries, through the introduction of a new benchmark, evaluation metrics and analysis. It points to future work needed in areas like improving dense retrievers and citation generation.
