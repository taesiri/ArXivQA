# [Towards Faithful Explanations: Boosting Rationalization with Shortcuts   Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07955)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Towards Faithful Explanations: Boosting Rationalization with Shortcuts Discovery":

Problem:
- Existing selective rationalization methods for explaining neural network predictions suffer from two key issues: 1) They exploit shortcuts in the data instead of true rationales when composing explanations. 2) They require extensive labeled rationales, which are expensive to obtain. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Shortcuts-fused Selective Rationalization (SSR) method to address the above issues. 
- Key ideas:
   - Identify potential shortcuts in the limited labeled data using an unsupervised rationalization model.
   - Mitigate shortcut usage for explanation generation via two strategies: 1) Inject shortcut information to disentangle shortcuts from rationales. 2) Generate virtual shortcut representations.
   - Perform data augmentation by replacing identified shortcuts.
- Overall, SSR explicitly exploits shortcuts to improve explanation faithfulness and reduce shortcut usage. Data augmentation is used to reduce the need for extensive labeled data.

Main Contributions:
- Novel shortcuts discovery approach to identify potential shortcuts from limited labeled rationales.
- Two strategies to inject real and virtual shortcut information respectively to promote faithful explanations.
- Data augmentation techniques leveraging identified shortcuts to reduce labeled data needs.
- Extensive experiments showing SSR outperforms competitive baselines in prediction and explanation quality with much fewer labeled rationales.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards generating faithful explanations for neural network predictions by properly utilizing shortcuts in the data. Both exploitation of real shortcuts and generation of virtual shortcuts aid in composing better rationales. Data augmentation further reduces the annotation requirements.
