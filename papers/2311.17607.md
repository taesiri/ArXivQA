# [Topology-Preserving Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17607)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel adversarial training method called Topology-Preserving Adversarial Training (TRAIN) to alleviate the natural accuracy degradation problem in adversarial training. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, the authors reveal that the disruption of natural sample topology in the representation space is highly correlated with reduced natural accuracy. To mitigate this issue, TRAIN simultaneously trains a standard model and an adversarial model, where the standard model provides topological guidance to preserve the neighborhood structure of natural samples. Specifically, TRAIN constructs a neighbor graph to capture inter-sample relationships in both models' representation spaces and aligns them via a topology preservation loss. As an easy plug-in regularization term, TRAIN can readily combine with existing adversarial training algorithms like TRADES and LBGAT. Extensive experiments on CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet datasets demonstrate that TRAIN consistently improves natural accuracy, robust accuracy, and topology quality over strong baselines. The maximum improvements reach 8.78% on natural accuracy and 4.50% on robust accuracy. Visualizations also confirm that TRAIN helps constitute a robust representation space with better-preserved natural sample topology. Overall, TRAIN offers a novel topology perspective and an effective solution for enhancing model robustness while mitigating natural accuracy degradation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a topology-preserving adversarial training method called TRAIN that improves model robustness by preserving the topological structure of natural samples from a standard model during adversarial training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a topology-preserving adversarial training method called TRAIN to alleviate the natural accuracy degradation problem in adversarial training. Specifically:

1) The paper reveals that natural accuracy degradation is highly related to the disruption of the natural sample topology in the representation space through quantitative and qualitative analysis. 

2) The paper proposes TRAIN to preserve the topology structure of natural samples from a standard model during adversarial training as an additional regularization. This allows improving both robust accuracy and natural accuracy.

3) Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet show that TRAIN can consistently and significantly improve various strong adversarial training baselines. It achieves up to 8.78% improvement in natural accuracy and 4.50% improvement in robust accuracy.

In summary, the key innovation is explaining and mitigating natural accuracy degradation from the new perspective of topology preservation, and proposing the TRAIN method to effectively realize it. This provides a plug-and-play enhancement for existing adversarial training algorithms.
