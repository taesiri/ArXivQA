# [One-stage Prompt-based Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16189)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing prompt-based continual learning (PCL) methods suffer from high computational costs due to two vision transformer (ViT) feedforward stages - one for generating the prompt query and another for the backbone model with selected prompts. This makes deployment difficult on resource-constrained devices. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a one-stage PCL framework (OS-Prompt) that removes the separate feedforward stage for query generation. Instead, it directly uses the intermediate layers' token embeddings as the prompt query. This is based on the observation that early layers show minimal shifts in feature space during continual prompt learning.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes OS-Prompt that reduces computational costs by ~50% with marginal drop in accuracy (<1%) by removing the separate query generation stage.

2) Introduces a Query-Pool Regularization (QR) loss to enhance representation power of prompts. This loss regulates the relationship between the prompt query and pool to be similar to the final layer's embeddings. The QR loss is only applied during training.

3) With the QR loss, the enhanced model OS-Prompt++ outperforms prior two-stage PCL methods by ~1.4% on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R and DomainNet benchmarks while still maintaining ~50% computational savings during inference.

4) Analysis shows OS-Prompt variants consistently perform better than prior PCL methods like L2P, DualPrompt across varying backbones and prompt configurations. The effectiveness does depend on the prompt formation strategy.

In summary, the paper makes PCL more efficient by removing the separate query generation feedforward, with marginal impact on accuracy. The QR regularization loss further bridges the minor performance gap.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a more efficient prompt-based continual learning framework called OS-Prompt that reduces computational costs by about 50\% during inference while maintaining or even slightly improving accuracy compared to prior methods, by using an intermediate layer token embedding as the prompt query instead of a separate query network.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a more efficient one-stage prompt-based continual learning (PCL) framework called OS-Prompt that reduces computational cost by nearly 50% without significant performance drop. Specifically:

1) The paper points out that existing PCL methods have high computational costs due to two separate ViT feed-forward stages. To address this, the proposed OS-Prompt framework uses the intermediate layer's token embedding directly as the prompt query, removing the need for an additional query ViT feed-forward stage. 

2) To counter the slight performance degradation in OS-Prompt, the paper introduces a Query-Pool Regularization (QR) loss that enhances the representation power of the prompt pool while adding no extra computational burden during inference.

3) Experiments on continual learning benchmarks like CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R and DomainNet show that OS-Prompt reduces GFLOPs by ~50% with marginal accuracy drop (<1%) compared to prior PCL methods. With the QR loss, OS-Prompt++ further bridges the performance gap and improves accuracy by ~1.4% over the previous state-of-the-art.

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient one-stage PCL framework that cuts nearly 50% computational costs with performance on par or better than existing two-stage PCL approaches.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using the intermediate layers' token embeddings as the prompt query instead of a separate query Transformer. What is the intuition behind why the intermediate layers would have more stable representations during continual learning?

2. The Query-Pool Regularization (QR) loss is introduced to improve representation power. Explain the formulation of the QR loss and how it helps bridge the performance gap compared to using just the intermediate layer embeddings. 

3. The paper evaluates one-stage PCL on class-incremental learning benchmarks. What are some potential challenges or limitations if applying this method to a task-incremental continual learning setting?

4. How does the training computational cost of one-stage PCL compared to prior two-stage methods? Discuss the tradeoffs for online vs offline continual learning.  

5. The prompt formation strategy has a significant impact on one-stage PCL's performance. Analyze how the performance varies when using different prompt selection schemes like L2P vs CodaPrompt.

6. An ablation study is conducted on components of the QR loss. Walk through the impact of excluding cosine similarity and softmax from the formulation.  

7. The number of prompt components and prompt length are evaluated. Summarize the trends observed and potential guidelines for configuring prompts in one-stage PCL.

8. Unsupervised pretraining (e.g. DINO) is experimented as an alternative to ImageNet supervision. Compare the model degradation across different methods when using unsupervised weights. 

9. Discuss the tradeoffs in accuracy vs efficiency when extracting the reference prompt query from different layers of the reference Transformer. What are good rules of thumb?

10. How does the inference latency and GPU memory usage compare between one-stage PCL and prior two-stage methods? Discuss optimizations for deploying this on edge devices.
