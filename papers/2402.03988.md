# [REBORN: Reinforcement-Learned Boundary Segmentation with Iterative   Training for Unsupervised ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03988)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Unsupervised automatic speech recognition (UASR) aims to learn the mapping between speech signals and text transcriptions without paired speech-text data supervision. A key challenge is that words/phonemes in speech are represented as variable-length segments, whose boundaries are unknown. Prior UASR methods rely on heuristics or separate models to obtain the segment boundaries, which are often suboptimal. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes \textsc{Reborn}, which alternately trains a segmentation model to predict segment boundaries in speech and a phoneme prediction model that takes the segmented speech as input to predict phonemes.

The segmentation model is trained with reinforcement learning to favor boundaries that yield phoneme predictions with lower perplexity. The phoneme prediction model is trained with adversarial learning to match the distribution of real phoneme sequences.

The two models enhance each other iteratively: the segmentation model provides better segments to improve phoneme prediction, while the phoneme model estimates segment quality to guide segmentation learning.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel iterative framework \textsc{Reborn} that jointly optimizes speech segmentation and phoneme prediction in an unsupervised manner.

- Designs a reinforcement learning approach with carefully constructed rewards (based on perplexity, edit distance etc.) to train the segmentation model without boundary labels.

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art UASR performance on LibriSpeech, TIMIT and 5 languages in MLS, outperforming previous unsupervised methods.

- Provides in-depth analysis on the learned segmental structures, which are shown to be finer-grained than phonemes and thus beneficial for phoneme prediction.

In summary, this paper presents an innovative unsupervised speech recognition algorithm that effectively exploits the duality between speech segmentation and phoneme prediction to achieve superior performance. The iterative joint training scheme is the key novelty.
