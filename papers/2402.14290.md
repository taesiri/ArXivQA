# [CEV-LM: Controlled Edit Vector Language Model for Shaping Natural   Language Generations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing controllable text generation (CTG) methods can control semantic, structural, and lexical properties of text, but struggle with more complex objectives like pacing (speed, volume, circuitousness). 
- These "nonstandard" control conditions require manipulation across multiple interconnected features at the sentence and paragraph level.
- Autoregressive models struggle with longer context lengths needed for such manipulation. Generative models allow more control but produce lower quality text.

Proposed Solution:
- Present Cev-LM, a lightweight semi-autoregressive language model for controllable text generation.
- Uses a prototype-then-edit approach: retrieve a prototype sentence from the training set and edit its latent representation.
- Apply two modifications:
   1) Constrained neighborhood creation: Retrieve prototypes with desired attribute change.
   2) Controlled edit vector perturbation: Encourage the edit vector in the desired direction of attribute change.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate significantly better control over speed, volume and circuitousness using Cev-LM compared to SOTA models, while preserving semantic similarity.
- Achieve this with fewer training samples and parameters than baselines.
- Establish extensive benchmarks for evaluating control over nonstandard conditions.
- Show that model can generalize to other attributes like formality and toxicity.
- Provide both quantitative metrics and qualitative examples to demonstrate controllability.

In summary, the paper presents a lightweight semi-autoregressive framework for fine-grained control over complex attributes of text by constraining both data selection and latent space editing direction.
