# [MineLand: Simulating Large-Scale Multi-Agent Interactions with Limited   Multimodal Senses and Physical Needs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19267)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conventional multi-agent simulators make unrealistic assumptions like perfect information and unlimited capabilities for agents. This reduces the authenticity and complexity of simulated social interactions.

- Specific gaps exist around supporting large numbers of agents, incorporating limited senses, and modeling physical needs.

Solution - MineLand Simulator:
- Allows up to 48 agents with limited vision, hearing, touch to encourage communication and collaboration. Models hunger, health etc.

- Flexible environment and task design to study emergent behaviors. Supports cooperative, competitive and free modes. 

- Covers daily life goals like cooking, shelter as well as community goals like construction, mining.

AI Agent Framework - Alex:
- Uses a Vision-Language Model to perceive and act in the world.  

- Has a multi-tasking ability to juggle and prioritize events like chats or injuries based on a priority scheme.

- Uses a hierarchical planner that interleaves daily routines with goal-driven tasks for realistic behavior.

Contributions:
- Pushes boundaries of multi-agent simulation towards more human-like constraints through limited senses and physical needs.

- Benchmark suite to develop and evaluate emergent intelligence in socially situated agents.

- Alex demonstrates sophisticated capabilities like long-term planning, self-correction, cooperation etc.

- Allows studying group dynamics in agent societies to inform social science theories and human-AI interaction.
