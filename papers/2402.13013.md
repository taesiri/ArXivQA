# [Code Needs Comments: Enhancing Code LLMs with Comment Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13013)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of alignment between natural language (comments) and code in existing pre-training data for code-focused large language models (LLMs). 
- Comments serve as a crucial bridge between natural language and code. But pre-training datasets have very low "comment density" (ratio of comment characters to total characters).

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a novel data augmentation method to generate comments for existing code using LLMs.  
- Use an "instruction tuning" approach to train an LLM to effectively generate comments when given "add comments" prompts.
- Employ a constrained generation method to generate comments line-by-line, preserving original code.
- Filter out low-quality generated comments using implicit and explicit rules.
- Conduct further pre-training of base LLMs on data with generated comments to achieve "self-augmentation".

Main Contributions:
- Show importance of comment density through experiments indicating performance gains as density increases.
- Propose an efficient pipeline for data augmentation through LLM-based comment generation. 
- Achieve consistent improvements in downstream tasks across multiple base models like Llama 2, Code Llama and InternLM2.
- Introduce a novel self-augmentation technique for code LLMs to recursively improve themselves.

In summary, the paper demonstrates a method to align natural language and code by generating comments, overcoming scarcity of aligned data in pre-training corpora. The proposed approach leads to consistent gains by enhancing PL-NL representation learning. The idea of specialized self-augmentation also opens up new directions for autonomous LLM improvement.
