# [Collision Avoidance Verification of Multiagent Systems with Learned   Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03314)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Verifying safety (collision avoidance) of learned neural network (NN) policies for multi-agent systems is challenging due to the non-convexity and potential high-dimensionality of the NN policies. 

- Exact computation of backward reachability analysis is intractable for such systems.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an efficient algorithm called ReBAR (Reachability-based Barrier Certificate) to compute an over-approximation of the backward reachability set called Relative BackProjection Over-Approximation (RBPOA). 

- For a 2-agent system, ReBAR formulates and solves mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) for multiple facets to compute a convex polytope over-approximation of the RBPOA. 

- This is done by bounding the relative state between agents across arbitrary future timesteps. The facets define half-spaces whose intersection gives the RBPOA.

- Safety is verified by checking if the RBPOA is a subset of the collision set. If yes, then no collision can occur from a non-colliding initial state.

- The method is extended to provide safety guarantees over longer horizons by recursively computing RBPOAs stepping backward in time.

Main Contributions:
- An efficient algorithm ReBAR to compute over-approximations of backward reachability sets (RBPOAs) for safety verification of multi-agent NN policies.

- Safety certificates for NN policies by formulating the verification as a convex optimization problem.

- Recursive formulation to provide safety guarantees over extended horizons. 

- Real-time safety guarantees by solving a LP during execution to check if the uncertain state lies outside the pre-computed RBPOA.

In summary, the paper makes algorithmic and practical contributions for safety verification of multi-agent NN policies using novel reachable set computations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a method called ReBAR to efficiently compute over-approximations of backward reachability sets to verify safety of neural network controlled multi-agent systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution seems to be:

The development of a method called ReBAR (Relative Backprojection Reachability Analysis) to compute an overapproximation of the relative backprojection set in order to verify safety (collision avoidance) for multi-agent systems using neural network controllers. 

Specifically, ReBAR formulates and solves mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) to compute a convex polytope that overapproximates the relative backprojection set between two agents. This allows efficiently verifying if a 2-agent system is safe, i.e. the agents will not collide starting from a non-colliding state. The key idea is that by checking if the overapproximated unsafe region is a subset of the collision set, the system can be verified as safe. 

The main advantages highlighted are:
1) The expensive reachability computation is moved offline 
2) Safety can still be checked online efficiently even with state uncertainty/noise by solving a linear program
3) The approach can be extended to provide safety guarantees over longer horizons

So in summary, the core contribution is an efficient method to provide formal safety verification for multi-agent neural network control systems.

The paper introduces the concept of relative backprojection sets to characterize the future evolution of dynamical systems with neural network controllers. It proposes an approach called ReBAR to efficiently compute a convex over-approximation of the non-convex backprojection sets using MILPs. This over-approximation provides safety guarantees for collision avoidance in multi-agent systems with neural network policies. The method works by computing the approximation offline and checking feasibility of an LP online to verify safety. It also discusses recursively extending the approach over a time horizon. So the key ideas revolve around computing and leveraging backprojection sets for safety verification.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The relative backprojection set is computed as a convex over-approximation using finitely many facets. How is the number of facets chosen and what is the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity? 

2. How does the complexity of computing the RBPOA scale with the dimensionality of the state space? Are there techniques to make this approach tractable for high-dimensional systems?

3. The safety guarantee requires checking if an uncertain state measurement lies inside the precomputed RBPOA. How tight are the bounds on the uncertain state needed to provide a non-conservative safety guarantee?

4. What classes of system dynamics can this approach handle? Are there assumptions needed on continuity, differentiability, linearity etc. for computing the RBPOA?

5. How is the approach extended to multi-agent systems with more than 2 agents? What additional computations are needed to provide safety guarantees? 

6. The RBPOA needs to be computed for each pair of agents. Does the complexity scale quadratically with the number of agents? Are there methods to reduce this complexity?

7. What mechanisms are used to provide safety guarantees over an extended time horizon? How does repeatedly computing RBPOAs affect the complexity and tightness of the computed safe set?

8. How can the offline verification approach be integrated with online learning of policies? Can the RBPOA be incrementally updated without full recomputation?

9. What classes of neural network policies can be handled by this approach? Are there limitations on network architecture, activation functions etc.?

10. How sensitive is the approach to inaccuracies in the models used, for instance, imperfect dynamics models? Can the method provide safety guarantees under model uncertainty?
