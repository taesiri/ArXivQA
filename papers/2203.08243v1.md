# [Unified Visual Transformer Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08243v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to effectively compress Vision Transformer (ViT) models to improve their efficiency and enable deployment under resource-limited scenarios. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a unified framework called UVC that integrates three compression techniques - pruning, layer skipping, and knowledge distillation - and jointly optimizes them under an overall budget constraint to compress ViT models. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

- The substantial architectural differences between CNNs and ViTs mean that existing successful CNN compression techniques may not directly transfer over to ViTs.

- Jointly composing and optimizing multiple compression techniques in an integrated manner can unlock greater compression and efficiency gains for ViTs compared to applying techniques individually/separately.

- Techniques like layer skipping are especially suitable for ViTs (vs CNNs) due to ViTs' uniform internal structure and observed redundancy in later layers.

- Formulating unified constrained optimization over model weights, layer-wise pruning ratios, and skip configurations can automatically find Pareto optimal compositions customized for the specific ViT under a given resource budget.

So in summary, the central research question is how to effectively compress ViTs to improve their deployability, with a hypothesis that a jointly optimized integration of pruning, skipping, and distillation can significantly outperform individual/separate application of techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a unified ViT compression framework called UVC that jointly optimizes three compression techniques: pruning, layer skipping, and knowledge distillation. 

- Formulating UVC as a constrained optimization problem that learns model weights, layer-wise pruning ratios/masks, and skip configurations under a distillation loss and overall budget constraint.

- Solving the UVC optimization problem using a primal-dual algorithm in an end-to-end fashion.

- Conducting extensive experiments on ImageNet with DeiT and T2T-ViT backbones, in which UVC consistently outperforms or matches recent compression methods. For example, UVC can reduce DeiT-Tiny FLOPs by 50% with minimal accuracy loss.

In summary, the key contribution is developing the first unified framework to jointly leverage multiple compression techniques for ViTs, formulated as a constrained optimization problem and solved end-to-end. Experiments demonstrate UVC can effectively compress popular ViT models on ImageNet.
