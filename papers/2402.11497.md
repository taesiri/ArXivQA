# [Thyroid ultrasound diagnosis improvement via multi-view self-supervised   learning and two-stage pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11497)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Thyroid nodule classification and segmentation in ultrasound images are important for computer-aided diagnosis, but they face limitations due to insufficient labeled data. 
- Annotating ultrasound images requires expertise and is time-consuming. Most labeled thyroid image datasets are small.
- Existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have some limitations when applied to multi-view thyroid ultrasound images, such as not handling missing views well.

Proposed Solution:
- A multi-view contrastive SSL method to improve thyroid nodule classification and segmentation with limited manual labels. 
- Aligns transverse and longitudinal views of the same nodule during pre-training so the model focuses more on the nodule area.
- An adaptive loss function that eliminates need for paired views and allows utilizing unpaired views.  
- A two-stage pre-training strategy combining ImageNet pre-training and self-supervised pre-training on thyroid images.

Main Contributions:
- Proposed a multi-view SSL method for thyroid ultrasound images that handles missing views.
- Designed an adaptive loss function for paired and unpaired views.
- Adopted a two-stage pre-training strategy to exploit benefits of ImageNet and self-supervised medical image pre-training.  
- Constructed a large-scale multi-center thyroid ultrasound image dataset.
- Showed proposed method significantly improves classification and segmentation with limited labels and outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods.
- Demonstrated two-stage pre-training surpasses ImageNet pre-training alone.
