## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing video text detection/recognition datasets and methods focus on normal/large text cases and single scenarios, while lacking more extreme challenges like dense and small text cases across different scenarios. 

- Previous datasets have limitations like: 1) lack of small text cases; 2) sparse text density (not dense enough) even in datasets with small text; 3) single scenario setting without diversity.

- There is a need for a more challenging benchmark with small & dense text cases across different scenarios to promote video text research.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors establish a new challenging benchmark called DSText, focusing on dense and small scene text in videos across 12 diverse scenarios.

- DSText has 100 video clips with 56k frames and 671k text instances. The density is 23.5 texts per frame on average. The average text size is 1,984 pixels, much smaller than previous datasets.  

- DSText covers scenarios like street views, sports, news, driving etc. The distribution has a high proportion of small texts compared to other datasets.

- Two tasks are supported - video text tracking and end-to-end video text spotting. Standard metrics like MOTA, MOTP and IDF1 are used for evaluation.

- A competition was organized on this benchmark, attracting 24 teams and 30 valid submissions. Detailed results and analyses are provided.

Main Contributions:
- A new, more challenging video text benchmark focusing on dense and small text cases across diverse scenarios.

- Statistical analyses demonstrating the heavy density and small size properties compared to other datasets.

- A competition organized on this benchmark to promote research, along with results and analyses.

- The benchmark and competition can inspire new innovations to handle extreme dense and small video text cases in the wild.
