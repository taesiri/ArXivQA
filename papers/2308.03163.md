# [CGBA: Curvature-aware Geometric Black-box Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03163)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the main research focus of this paper is on developing efficient decision-based black-box adversarial attacks. The key hypotheses or questions explored are:

- Existing decision-based attacks that rely on estimating the normal vector and conducting a binary search along that direction have limitations in terms of inefficiency and lack of convergence, especially when the decision boundary has high curvature. 

- Conducting the search along a semicircular path in a restricted 2D plane, guided by the estimated normal vector, can lead to more effective and query-efficient attacks compared to a 1D search along the normal vector.

- The curvature of the decision boundary is typically lower for non-targeted attacks versus targeted attacks. Therefore, different search strategies may be needed to efficiently generate adversarial examples in these two settings.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly accounting for the curvature in geometric decision-based attacks, through a 2D semicircular search strategy, can improve their query efficiency and success rate compared to existing methods like HopSkipJumpAttack and GeoDA. The variants CGBA and CGBA-H are proposed to address non-targeted and targeted attacks respectively by adapting to the expected curvature.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes CGBA and CGBA-H, two new decision-based black-box adversarial attacks. The main contributions are:

- CGBA conducts boundary search along a semicircular path on a restricted 2D plane, guided by the estimated normal vector. This overcomes limitations of existing attacks that rely on 1D search along the normal vector. CGBA effectively exploits low curvature boundaries common in non-targeted attacks.

- CGBA-H adapts CGBA to work better on the high curvature boundaries typical of targeted attacks. It conducts a modified semicircular search to swiftly enter the adversarial region. 

- An initialization algorithm is introduced to obtain a better starting boundary point, which further boosts targeted attack performance.

- Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that CGBA and CGBA-H outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on non-targeted and targeted attacks, respectively.

In summary, the key novelty is the proposed 2D semicircular search that works for arbitrary boundary curvatures but is particularly effective at exploiting low curvatures. CGBA and CGBA-H represent the first attacks designed specifically to leverage boundary geometry.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes two new query-efficient decision-based black-box attacks, CGBA and CGBA-H, that conduct boundary search along a semicircular path on a restricted 2D plane guided by estimated normal vectors to effectively generate adversarial examples exploiting low curvature boundaries or adapting to high curvature ones, respectively.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of adversarial machine learning:

- The paper proposes a new decision-based black-box attack method called CGBA that uses a curvature-aware geometric approach to craft adversarial examples. This approach is novel compared to prior decision-based attacks like Boundary Attack, HSJA, GeoDA, etc. that do not explicitly consider the decision boundary's geometry. 

- A key novelty is using a semicircular trajectory guided by the estimated boundary normal to search for adversarial points, instead of binary search along the normal vector as in some prior works. This makes CGBA robust to decision boundaries with high curvature.

- For non-targeted attacks, CGBA outperforms recent methods like GeoDA, SurFree, and TA that also use geometric insights but don't account for curvature. For targeted attacks, the proposed CGBA-H variant outperforms state-of-the-art targeted attacks.

- The paper provides useful theoretical analysis on why the semicircular boundary search works better than just using the estimated normal, especially on highly curved boundaries. This analysis helps explain CGBA's empirical success.

- The improved initialization method to find a better starting boundary point is another contribution over prior targeted attacks that just use random initialization.

- Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets against standard models substantiate CGBA's effectiveness and superiority over competing approaches for both non-targeted and targeted attacks.

In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in decision-based black-box attacks by developing a principled curvature-aware geometric approach and providing useful analysis. The proposed techniques outperform prior methods, especially on curved boundaries, making this an important advance in this research area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more query-efficient decision-based black-box attacks, especially for targeted attacks where the decision boundary often exhibits higher curvature. The authors propose some new techniques like CGBA and CGBA-H, but there is still room for improvement.

- Exploring ways to better initialize the attack, for example by using transferability from other models or gathering information about the decision boundary early on. The authors show their initialization method can significantly boost performance.

- Studying the geometry and curvature of decision boundaries for common classifiers. A better understanding of these properties could inform the development of more effective geometric attacks. 

- Developing defense techniques robust to the proposed curvature-aware attacks. Adversarial training helps but specialized defenses may be needed.

- Extending the curvature-aware attacks to other perturbation types like l_inf, discretized inputs, etc. The current work focuses on l_2 perturbation in continuous space.

- Analyzing the transferability of decision-based attacks between models. The authors note the perturbations crafted are model-specific, so transferability is challenging.

- Applying the attacks to other data domains beyond images, like audio, video, text, etc.

In general, the core ideas around exploiting curvature and boundary geometry seem promising for future work on decision-based black-box attacks and defenses. Understanding these geometric properties is key.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new curvature-aware geometric decision-based black-box attack (CGBA) to craft adversarial examples. Existing attacks relying on estimating the normal vector at the decision boundary can be ineffective due to inaccurate estimates or high curvature boundaries. CGBA overcomes these limitations by conducting a boundary search along a semicircular path in a 2D plane defined by the estimated normal vector and direction towards the boundary point. This allows it to find a new boundary point with reduced perturbation regardless of the curvature. For non-targeted attacks where the boundary often has low curvature, CGBA demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. For targeted attacks where the boundary has higher curvature, the paper develops a variant CGBA-H that adapts more quickly. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets against popular classifiers show the effectiveness of CGBA and CGBA-H for non-targeted and targeted attacks, respectively. The paper also proposes a better initialization method for targeted attacks. Overall, the work introduces a principled way to exploit curvature information in decision-based black-box attacks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new curvature-aware geometric decision-based black-box attack (CGBA) to craft adversarial examples. Existing attacks that rely on estimating the normal vector at decision boundary points can be inefficient, especially when the boundary curvature is high. The key idea of CGBA is to query boundary points along a semicircular path in a 2D plane spanned by the estimated normal vector and direction from source image to current boundary point. This allows it to find a new boundary point with reduced perturbation more effectively than just searching along the normal vector. 

The paper shows CGBA exploits the typically low curvature of decision boundaries for non-targeted attacks. For targeted attacks where curvature is higher, they develop a variant CGBA-H that adapts more quickly. They also propose an initialization method to obtain a better starting boundary point which further improves performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate CGBA and CGBA-H outperform state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets for non-targeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Theoretical analysis and experiments also verify the semicircular search is more effective than just searching along the normal vector direction, especially for higher curvature boundaries.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel curvature-aware geometric decision-based black-box attack (CGBA) to craft adversarial examples. Unlike previous attacks that search the decision boundary along the estimated normal vector direction, CGBA conducts the boundary search along a semicircular path in a 2D plane spanned by the direction towards the boundary point and estimated normal vector. This allows effectively overcoming limitations of existing normal vector based attacks and ensures finding a boundary point with reduced perturbation regardless of the decision boundary's curvature. While CGBA is particularly effective for non-targeted attacks exploiting the low curvature, the paper develops a variant CGBA-H adapted for targeted attacks with higher curvature boundaries. Moreover, an algorithm is introduced to obtain a better initial boundary point by using multiple target class samples, further boosting attack performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the improved query efficiency and lower perturbations achieved by CGBA and CGBA-H over state-of-the-art methods.
