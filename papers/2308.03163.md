# [CGBA: Curvature-aware Geometric Black-box Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03163)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the main research focus of this paper is on developing efficient decision-based black-box adversarial attacks. The key hypotheses or questions explored are:

- Existing decision-based attacks that rely on estimating the normal vector and conducting a binary search along that direction have limitations in terms of inefficiency and lack of convergence, especially when the decision boundary has high curvature. 

- Conducting the search along a semicircular path in a restricted 2D plane, guided by the estimated normal vector, can lead to more effective and query-efficient attacks compared to a 1D search along the normal vector.

- The curvature of the decision boundary is typically lower for non-targeted attacks versus targeted attacks. Therefore, different search strategies may be needed to efficiently generate adversarial examples in these two settings.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly accounting for the curvature in geometric decision-based attacks, through a 2D semicircular search strategy, can improve their query efficiency and success rate compared to existing methods like HopSkipJumpAttack and GeoDA. The variants CGBA and CGBA-H are proposed to address non-targeted and targeted attacks respectively by adapting to the expected curvature.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes CGBA and CGBA-H, two new decision-based black-box adversarial attacks. The main contributions are:

- CGBA conducts boundary search along a semicircular path on a restricted 2D plane, guided by the estimated normal vector. This overcomes limitations of existing attacks that rely on 1D search along the normal vector. CGBA effectively exploits low curvature boundaries common in non-targeted attacks.

- CGBA-H adapts CGBA to work better on the high curvature boundaries typical of targeted attacks. It conducts a modified semicircular search to swiftly enter the adversarial region. 

- An initialization algorithm is introduced to obtain a better starting boundary point, which further boosts targeted attack performance.

- Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that CGBA and CGBA-H outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on non-targeted and targeted attacks, respectively.

In summary, the key novelty is the proposed 2D semicircular search that works for arbitrary boundary curvatures but is particularly effective at exploiting low curvatures. CGBA and CGBA-H represent the first attacks designed specifically to leverage boundary geometry.
