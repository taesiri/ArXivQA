# [A Dataset for Movie Description](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02530)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research contributions are:1. The introduction of a new dataset called the Movie Description dataset, which contains transcribed and aligned audio descriptions (DVS) as well as movie scripts for 72 full-length HD movies. This dataset allows for multi-sentence video description and understanding stories/plots across sentences in an open-domain scenario at large scale, which was not possible with previous video description datasets.2. A characterization and benchmarking of different approaches for generating video descriptions on this new dataset. The main approaches compared are: nearest neighbor retrieval, an adaptation of the translation model from Rohrbach et al. (2013) using automatically extracted semantic representations, and a translation model using visual word labels.3. A method for semi-automatically collecting and aligning DVS data from audio tracks.4. An analysis comparing DVS and movie scripts as sources of descriptions. Through human evaluation, they find DVS to be more visually relevant and correct than movie scripts.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that this new large-scale, open-domain dataset of DVS and movie scripts will enable new research in video understanding, including multi-sentence video description, story/plot understanding, and characterizing how different models perform on the task of video description. The authors support this viaintroducing the dataset, benchmarking existing methods, and analyzing the differences between DVS and scripts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. The introduction of a new dataset called the "Movie Description" dataset, which contains over 54,000 sentences aligned to video snippets from 72 HD movies. The sentences come from two sources - descriptive video service (DVS) transcripts and movie scripts. 2. A method to semi-automatically collect and align the DVS transcripts to video by extracting and transcribing the audio, then manually aligning the sentences. 3. The alignment and collection of movie script data by automatically aligning scripts to subtitles, then manually aligning sentences to video.4. An analysis comparing DVS and movie scripts, which found DVS sentences tend to be more visually relevant and correct than script sentences.5. Benchmarking different video description methods on the new dataset, including nearest neighbor retrieval and an adapted statistical machine translation approach using automatic semantic parsing to extract training labels from the sentences.6. The adapted machine translation method was shown to achieve competitive performance on another dataset without annotations, and outperformed retrieval baselines on the new movie dataset.In summary, the key contributions appear to be the introduction of this large new movie description dataset, the methods to collect and align it, the analysis of DVS vs scripts, and benchmarking video description approaches on it. The dataset and analysis seem valuable for future video and language research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents a new dataset of movies with aligned descriptive audio and text sourced from scripts and audio descriptions for the blind, compares these sources, benchmarks approaches for generating video descriptions using this data, and shows promising results by adapting a recent translation method to extract semantic representations automatically using parsing instead of manual annotations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in video description and the use of movie scripts and descriptive video service (DVS):- The main contribution of the paper is presenting a new large-scale dataset for video description consisting of aligned sentences from movie scripts and DVS with clips from 72 full-length movies. This is a uniquely large and diverse open-domain video description dataset. Other video description datasets are limited to specific domains like cooking or contain only short clips.- The paper benchmarks several approaches on the new dataset, including nearest neighbor retrieval and an adapted statistical machine translation approach using semantic parsing to automatically extract labels from the sentences. This allows the translation approach to work without manual annotations.- The authors also present a semi-automated approach for collecting and aligning the DVS data. Prior work has used movie scripts for video analysis but DVS has been largely unexplored by the computer vision community. The paper provides the first systematic comparison of DVS and scripts as sources of descriptions.- The results show DVS tends to be more precisely aligned and visually descriptive than scripts, which often contain extra flourishes or deviations from the visuals. The aligned DVS data could enable future work on understanding stories and plots across multiple sentences.- Overall, the size, diversity, and multi-sentence nature of the new dataset combined with the comparisons of description sources seem to represent useful contributions relative to prior video description research. The new dataset and benchmarks help move the field forward into open-domain video description and understanding temporal/narrative relationships.
