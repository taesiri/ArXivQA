# [Inference to the Best Explanation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10767)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Interpreting and evaluating the reasoning process behind large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 is challenging due to their black-box nature. Specifically, it is hard to assess the quality and plausibility of natural language explanations generated by LLMs. 

- Existing methods for evaluating LLM-generated explanations rely on resource-intensive human annotations, weak supervision using answer correctness as a proxy, or injection of domain knowledge. 

- This paper investigates whether explicit linguistic and logical properties of LLM-generated explanations can be used to qualify the models' reasoning process without reliance on annotations or domain knowledge.

Method: 
- The paper proposes an interpretable framework called IBE-Eval inspired by philosophical accounts of "Inference to the Best Explanation" (IBE) for selecting the most plausible explanation amongst competing ones.

- IBE-Eval estimates explanation plausibility through logical and linguistic features like consistency, parsimony, coherence and linguistic uncertainty.

- It is applied in a multiple choice causal QA setting where given a question and answer candidates, IBE-Eval scores explanations generated by LLMs like GPT-3.5 and Llama-2 supporting each candidate. 

- The explanation with the highest IBE-Eval score is selected and evaluated whether IBE features correlate with QA accuracy.

Contributions:

- First framework inspired by IBE for automatically assessing quality of LLM-generated explanations without reliance on annotations or domain knowledge.

- Evidence that explanations by LLMs like GPT-3.5 and Llama-2 conform to IBE criteria, opening up their evaluation.

- IBE-Eval can identify best explanations accurately, improving over baselines by 17% and correlating significantly with human judgment. 

- Analysis reveals uncertainty, parsimony and coherence are most predictive while consistency is less effective as LLMs tend to rationalize even less plausible options.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an interpretable framework inspired by philosophical accounts on Inference to the Best Explanation to automatically assess the quality of natural language explanations generated by large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. Proposing an interpretable framework called IBE-Eval inspired by philosophical accounts on Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) to automatically assess the quality of natural language explanations generated by large language models (LLMs).

2. Introducing a set of criteria that can be computed on explicit linguistic and logical features of LLM-generated explanations, including consistency, parsimony, coherence, and linguistic uncertainty. 

3. Conducting experiments in the multiple-choice Causal Question Answering (CQA) setting to evaluate how well LLM-generated explanations conform to IBE expectations.

4. Finding that LLM explanations tend to align with IBE criteria, with linguistic uncertainty being the strongest predictor of explanation quality. 

5. Showing that IBE-Eval can successfully identify the best explanation supporting the correct answer in CQA with up to 77% accuracy, outperforming baselines.

6. Demonstrating that IBE-Eval is significantly correlated with human judgment in assessing explanation quality.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an interpretable evaluation framework for LLM-generated explanations based on philosophical accounts of inference, along with empirical analysis demonstrating its efficacy.

The paper proposes an interpretable framework called IBE-Eval that is inspired by philosophical accounts of Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE). It uses IBE criteria like consistency, parsimony, coherence, and uncertainty to evaluate the quality of explanations generated by large language models on causal question answering tasks. The goal is to select the most plausible explanation from competing ones produced by the LLM. Key methods employed include prompting strategies to elicit explanations, autoformalization to translate explanations into logical forms, and neuro-symbolic integration to verify logical consistency. The framework and experiments aim to provide insights into the alignment of LLMs with IBE expectations and serve as a step towards interpretable explanation evaluation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using philosophical principles of Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) to evaluate large language model explanations. What are some of the key advantages and limitations of using an IBE framework compared to other explanation evaluation methods?

2. The IBE criteria rely on both logical features like consistency and linguistic features like uncertainty. What is the relative importance of logical vs. linguistic features in identifying the best explanation according to the results? Are both types of features necessary?

3. The consistency metric seems to be less informative in practice since LLMs can rationalize even incorrect explanations. How might the consistency evaluation be improved to better differentiate plausible and implausible explanations? 

4. The paper finds that uncertainty is the strongest predictor of explanation quality. What types of linguistic uncertainty cues are most prevalent in incorrect explanations? How do the distributions of uncertainty language differ across LLMs?

5. Concept drift and proof depth are used as proxies for parsimony. What other metrics could also capture the complexity of an explanation? How could parsimony evaluation be expanded?

6. Step-wise entailment measures local coherence. What other methods could evaluate global coherence across the full explanation? How do local vs global coherence differ in problematic explanations?  

7. The IBE model is a simple linear model on top of the extracted features. What alternative compositional models could be explored for integrating the IBE criteria?

8. How robust is the autoformalization of the natural language explanations into logic programs? What errors may be introduced in that translation process?

9. To what extent could the proposed IBE method generalize to other types of reasoning problems beyond causal QA? What adaptations would be required?

10. The paper demonstrates promising human correlation results. What additional experiments could better evaluate how well IBE aligns with human judgments of explanation quality?
