# [CLIP2Video: Mastering Video-Text Retrieval via Image CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11097)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we effectively transfer an image-language pre-training model to the task of video-text retrieval? The key ideas and contributions are:- The authors propose to divide the video-text retrieval problem into two parts: (1) spatial image-text multi-modal learning, and (2) modeling the temporal relationships between video frames and video-text. - They introduce two modules - Temporal Difference Block (TDB) and Temporal Alignment Block (TAB) - to handle the temporal relationships in videos and between videos and text respectively.- TDB adds motion-based differences between frames to help the model focus on changes. TAB aligns video and text tokens to a shared space to enhance correlation.- They show state-of-the-art results on MSR-VTT, MSVD and VATEX by effectively transferring a powerful image-text pretraining (CLIP) model to the video domain using these blocks.In summary, the central hypothesis is that dividing video-text retrieval into spatial image-text learning and temporal modeling, and introducing TDB and TAB blocks, can allow effective transfer of image-text pretraining like CLIP to video-text retrieval. The results validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here are the main contributions of this paper:- The paper proposes a new perspective on video-language learning by dividing it into two independent problems - multi-modal image-text training and modeling the temporal relationships between video frames and video-text. - It introduces two modules - Temporal Difference Block (TDB) and Temporal Alignment Block (TAB) - for handling the temporal relationships of video frames and video-text respectively.- TDB captures motions at fine temporal video frames by inserting difference-enhanced tokens between frame features. - TAB aligns video and text tokens to the same embedding space using shared centers to enhance correlation.- The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on major video-text retrieval benchmarks, including new records on MSR-VTT, MSVD and VATEX datasets.- Thorough ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed divided concept and the contribution of each component.In summary, the key novelty is the divided perspective on video-language learning, transferring image-text pretraining to video domain using the two temporal modeling blocks TDB and TAB, which leads to SOTA retrieval accuracy. The ablation studies validate the design.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new approach called CLIP2Video to transfer an image-language pretraining model to video-text retrieval, using a Temporal Difference Block to capture motion between frames and a Temporal Alignment Block to align video and text tokens, achieving state-of-the-art results on MSR-VTT, MSVD, and VATEX benchmarks.
