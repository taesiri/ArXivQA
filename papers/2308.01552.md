# [InterAct: Exploring the Potentials of ChatGPT as a Cooperative Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01552)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: 

How can the integration of ChatGPT into embodied agent systems influence performance on interactive decision-making benchmarks like AlfWorld?

More specifically, the paper examines whether harnessing ChatGPT's language capabilities and having it play specialized roles (as a "checker" and "sorter") can enhance an agent's ability to make rational decisions and carry out complex multi-step tasks in simulated household environments. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that an architecture that strategically incorporates different ChatGPT models into an embodied agent (called InterAct) will demonstrate superior performance compared to a single language model agent (ReAct) on the AlfWorld benchmark metrics.

In summary, the core research question revolves around evaluating if and how ChatGPT can be effectively integrated into embodied agents to improve their interactive decision-making abilities, with a focus on testing this in the AlfWorld simulation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be:

The paper introduces a new model called InterAct that improves upon the existing ReAct model for learning agents. The key innovations of InterAct are:

1. It incorporates additional "helper" agents such as a checker and sorter to complement the capabilities of the main language model agent. This allows utilizing the strengths of different models. 

2. The prompts have been reformulated to enhance the agent's ability to plan comprehensive search paths and trajectories when looking for multiple items.

3. InterAct achieved a 98% success rate on the AlfWorld benchmark consisting of household tasks, a significant improvement over the 75% accuracy of the base ReAct model. 

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the InterAct model that integrates multiple complementary agents and optimized prompts to substantially boost the performance of learning agents on interactive decision-making tasks like those in AlfWorld. The high success rate demonstrates InterAct's potential for advancing task planning abilities in robotics and AI systems.
