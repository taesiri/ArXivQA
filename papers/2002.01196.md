# Dynamic Knowledge Routing Network For Target-Guided Open-Domain   Conversation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is how to develop an open-domain conversational agent that can naturally guide a conversation towards a specified target or goal. The key hypotheses are:1. Injecting semantic knowledge relations among candidate keywords into the model can help improve next keyword prediction and lead to smoother topic transitions. 2. Using a dual discourse-level target-guided strategy can achieve a better balance between conversation smoothness and successfully reaching the target.3. Their proposed dynamic knowledge routing network (DKRN) architecture and dual strategy can outperform previous methods on target-guided open-domain conversations.In summary, the central research question is how to create an open-domain conversational agent that can both converse naturally and also proactively guide the conversation towards a specified target. The key hypotheses focus on using knowledge relations and a dual strategy to achieve smooth and coherent conversations that successfully reach the target. The proposed DKRN model aims to demonstrate improved performance on this task compared to prior approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing a novel dynamic knowledge routing network (DKRN) that injects semantic knowledge relations among candidate keywords into turn-level keyword prediction for smooth topic transition.- Introducing a simple but effective dual discourse-level target-guided strategy for better balancing between transition smoothness and target achievement. - Constructing a new large-scale Chinese target-guided open-domain conversation dataset to push the research boundary.- Conducting extensive experiments showing the proposed method can produce more meaningful and effective target-guided conversations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both automatic metrics and human evaluation.In summary, the key contribution is developing an effective framework consisting of the DKRN module and dual discourse strategy to guide open-domain conversations towards specified targets in a natural and smooth manner. The introduction of the large-scale dataset also enables more research in this direction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes a novel dynamic knowledge routing network and dual discourse-level target-guided strategy for open-domain conversational agents to have natural conversations while proactively guiding the dialogue towards a specified target. The key idea is to leverage semantic keyword relations and apply constraints on keyword prediction and response selection to balance conversation coherence and target achievement.
