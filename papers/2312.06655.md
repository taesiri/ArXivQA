## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Sherpa3D, a new framework for generating high-fidelity, diverse, and multi-view consistent 3D assets from text prompts. The key insight is to leverage easily accessible coarse 3D knowledge from existing 3D diffusion models to guide the optimization process of a 2D diffusion model to achieve better 3D coherence. Specifically, a structural guidance based on normal maps and a semantic guidance using CLIP features are derived from the coarse 3D prior and used to supervise the 2D lifting process. An annealing strategy further balances the influence of the 3D guidance against the 2D refinement over time. Experiments demonstrate Sherpa3D's ability to produce compelling 3D models aligned with input text across different viewpoints. Both qualitative results and user studies confirm the advantage of Sherpa3D over current state-of-the-art text-to-3D approaches in terms of quality, diversity and consistency. The method bridges the gap between 2D and 3D diffusion models, inheriting their respective strengths, and provides an effective technique to automate high-fidelity 3D content creation.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Sherpa3D: Boosting High-Fidelity Text-to-3D Generation via Coarse 3D Prior":

Problem Statement:
Generating 3D assets from text prompts has shown remarkable progress with 2D and 3D diffusion models. However, 3D diffusion models often produce low-quality results due to limited 3D data, while 2D lifting methods suffer from multi-view inconsistency issues (e.g. Janus faces). The goal is to achieve high-fidelity, diverse and multi-view consistent 3D asset generation from text prompts.

Proposed Solution - Sherpa3D:
1. Use a 3D diffusion model to generate a coarse 3D prior which captures basic shapes and semantics. 
2. Derive two guidance strategies from this 3D prior:
   - Structural guidance using normals and gradients to guide geometry optimization.
   - Semantic guidance using CLIP features to maintain view consistency.
3. Incorporate guidance strategies into 2D lifting process with Stable Diffusion, using an annealing schedule to balance 3D guidance and 2D refinement.
4. Achieve final high-quality 3D asset with appearance modeling.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework to incorporate easy-to-obtain coarse 3D knowledge into 2D lifting process for refinement. 
- Two tailored 3D guidance strategies (structural and semantic) to enhance prompts and guide optimization.
- Achieves state-of-the-art high-fidelity, diverse and multi-view consistent 3D generation from text. 
- Significantly outperforms baselines in quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

In summary, Sherpa3D bridges 3D and 2D diffusion models via meticulously designed guidance strategies to achieve impressive text-to-3D generation results. The framework is efficient, taking only 25 minutes from prompt to high-quality 3D asset.
