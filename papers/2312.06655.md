# [Sherpa3D: Boosting High-Fidelity Text-to-3D Generation via Coarse 3D   Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06655)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Sherpa3D, a new framework for generating high-fidelity, diverse, and multi-view consistent 3D assets from text prompts. The key insight is to leverage easily accessible coarse 3D knowledge from existing 3D diffusion models to guide the optimization process of a 2D diffusion model to achieve better 3D coherence. Specifically, a structural guidance based on normal maps and a semantic guidance using CLIP features are derived from the coarse 3D prior and used to supervise the 2D lifting process. An annealing strategy further balances the influence of the 3D guidance against the 2D refinement over time. Experiments demonstrate Sherpa3D's ability to produce compelling 3D models aligned with input text across different viewpoints. Both qualitative results and user studies confirm the advantage of Sherpa3D over current state-of-the-art text-to-3D approaches in terms of quality, diversity and consistency. The method bridges the gap between 2D and 3D diffusion models, inheriting their respective strengths, and provides an effective technique to automate high-fidelity 3D content creation.
