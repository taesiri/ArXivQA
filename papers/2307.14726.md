# [P2C: Self-Supervised Point Cloud Completion from Single Partial Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14726)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

Can a point cloud completion network be trained in a self-supervised manner using only single partial point clouds, without access to complete shape examples or multiple views of the same object instance?

The key hypothesis is that a category-specific structural prior can be learned from observing different object instances with diverse missing regions, allowing the network to complete severely incomplete point clouds by inferring the missing regions based on what it has seen before in other partial examples.

To summarize, the main goal is to develop a self-supervised point cloud completion method that relies only on single partial point clouds, eliminating the need for complete shapes or multiple views during training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a self-supervised framework called Partial2Complete (P2C) for point cloud completion using only single partial point clouds per object during training. The key highlights are:

- P2C is the first method that can learn to complete point clouds using only single partial observations, without requiring complete shapes or multiple views of objects. This eliminates the need for expensive complete shape annotation or alignment of multiple views.

- A novel Region-Aware Chamfer Distance (RCD) is proposed to measure point cloud similarity in a way that is aware of observed vs missing regions. This prevents limiting the completion capability while also regularizing outlier points. 

- A Normal Consistency Constraint (NCC) is introduced to encourage local surface continuity and completeness in the predicted point clouds by minimizing the variance of normal direction similarity of nearby points.

- Experiments on both synthetic ShapeNet data and real ScanNet data demonstrate that P2C achieves comparable or better performance than methods trained with complete shapes or multiple partial views. This validates the effectiveness of the self-supervised learning scheme.

In summary, the key novelty is the self-supervised point cloud completion framework that only relies on single partial point clouds, eliminating the requirement for complete shapes or multiple partial views during training. The RCD and NCC components also help improve completion quality in this challenging setting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised point cloud completion method called P2C that can be trained using only single partial point clouds per object, through designing a region-aware distance metric and local surface continuity constraint to enable learning from incomplete data without complete supervision.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of point cloud completion:

- Datasets: The paper evaluates on both synthetic datasets like 3D-EPN, PCN, and real-world ScanNet data. This allows for comparison against other methods on common benchmarks as well as demonstrating generalization. 

- Problem setting: The key novelty is proposing a self-supervised framework that only requires a single partial point cloud per object for training. This is a new setting compared to supervised methods needing complete shapes or unpaired methods using both partial and complete clouds.

- Approach: The method introduces new components to address the unique challenges of the single partial cloud setting. This includes the Region-Aware Chamfer Distance for measuring completeness without limiting completion capability, and the Normal Consistency Constraint to improve surface continuity.

- Results: The paper shows the method achieves comparable or better quantitative results than supervised methods with access to complete shapes. It also outperforms weakly-supervised techniques trained with multiple partial views. Qualitative results demonstrate realistic shape details are recovered.

- Impact: The self-supervised framework significantly reduces annotation cost by removing the need for complete shapes or multiple partial views. It also unifies supervised, unpaired, and weakly-supervised settings under one approach. This could enable new directions for point cloud completion using real-world scan data.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel self-supervised point cloud completion setting and method that demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The key impact is reducing the amount of annotation required compared to existing paradigms. The results show promise for point cloud completion from single real-world scans.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Investigating more advanced self-supervised learning techniques to further improve the quality of shape completion from single partial inputs. The authors mention contrastive learning as one potential direction.

- Generalizing the framework to handle incomplete point clouds with more complex topology or from uncommon categories not seen during training. The current method is limited to common object classes with simple surface topology.

- Exploring ways to make the framework more robust to biased or unrepresentative training data. As noted in the limitations, the method relies on seeing diverse partial examples to learn a good category-specific shape prior.

- Incorporating semantic or contextual information to aid completion, such as object part annotations or scene-level relationships between objects. This could improve plausibility and consistency.

- Extending the approach to video or dynamic point cloud completion over time by exploiting temporal consistency cues.

- Applying the self-supervised completion idea to other 3D tasks like denoising, upsampling, or compression.

- Investigating network architecture designs to improve efficiency and enable high-resolution completion.

So in summary, some of the key directions are: improving completion quality through advanced self-supervision, making the method more generalizable and robust, incorporating semantic information, handling dynamic point clouds, and applying the approach to other tasks. Advancing the network architecture is also mentioned as an important aspect.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents Partial2Complete (P2C), a self-supervised framework for point cloud completion using only single partial point clouds per object for training. The method takes an incomplete point cloud as input, divides it into patches, and predicts the masked patches based on the unmasked regions by learning structural priors from different partial objects. Two novel components are proposed - Region-Aware Chamfer Distance (RCD) to estimate correspondence based on regions around skeleton points, which allows completion of missing regions without restricting predictions, and Normal Consistency Constraint (NCC) to regularize predictions to follow the local surface manifold. Experiments on synthetic ShapeNet data and real ScanNet data demonstrate P2C achieves comparable or better performance than methods trained with complete shapes or multiple partial views. The key novelty is the self-supervised setting requiring only single partial point clouds, eliminating the need for complete samples or multiple views.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes P2C, a self-supervised framework for point cloud completion using only single partial point clouds per object during training. The key idea is to learn structural priors from a category-specific dataset of diverse incomplete objects to guide the reconstruction of severely incomplete point clouds. The method divides input point clouds into patches and predicts masked patches based on unmasked regions. Two main contributions are proposed - Region-Aware Chamfer Distance (RCD) to estimate correspondence aware of complete/missing regions, and Normal Consistency Constraint (NCC) to encourage local surface continuity and completeness. 

Experiments on synthetic ShapeNet datasets demonstrate P2C achieves comparable or better performance than methods trained with complete shapes or multiple partial views. Evaluations on real ScanNet data also show advantages over supervised and unpaired methods in terms of fidelity metrics. Overall, the method provides an effective approach to point cloud completion where only single partial observations are available, eliminating the need for complete ground truth shapes or multiple views. The design of RCD and NCC are shown to be important for achieving strong performance.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes P2C, a self-supervised point cloud completion method that can be trained using only single partial point clouds per object. The key ideas are:

1) The partial point cloud is divided into patches, which are partitioned into three groups - one for encoding, one for completion, and one for latent reconstruction. The encoder takes the encoding group to produce a shape prediction.  

2) A novel Region-Aware Chamfer Distance (RCD) is used to measure similarity between the prediction and input partial cloud. RCD constructs regions around skeleton points to avoid limiting completion capability.

3) A Normal Consistency Constraint (NCC) is introduced to encourage local surface planarity and continuity in the predicted shape. NCC computes the variance of normal direction similarity for nearby points as a regularizer.

4) The overall loss combines RCD terms for reconstruction and completion, latent reconstruction loss between two encoded patch groups, and the NCC term. This enables training with only single partial clouds by exploiting consistency across different incomplete shapes.

The method is evaluated on ShapeNet and ScanNet datasets, achieving comparable or better performance than supervised and weakly-supervised approaches. The ablation studies verify the contribution of the proposed RCD and NCC components.
