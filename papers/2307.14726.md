# [P2C: Self-Supervised Point Cloud Completion from Single Partial Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14726)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can a point cloud completion network be trained in a self-supervised manner using only single partial point clouds, without access to complete shape examples or multiple views of the same object instance?The key hypothesis is that a category-specific structural prior can be learned from observing different object instances with diverse missing regions, allowing the network to complete severely incomplete point clouds by inferring the missing regions based on what it has seen before in other partial examples.To summarize, the main goal is to develop a self-supervised point cloud completion method that relies only on single partial point clouds, eliminating the need for complete shapes or multiple views during training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a self-supervised framework called Partial2Complete (P2C) for point cloud completion using only single partial point clouds per object during training. The key highlights are:- P2C is the first method that can learn to complete point clouds using only single partial observations, without requiring complete shapes or multiple views of objects. This eliminates the need for expensive complete shape annotation or alignment of multiple views.- A novel Region-Aware Chamfer Distance (RCD) is proposed to measure point cloud similarity in a way that is aware of observed vs missing regions. This prevents limiting the completion capability while also regularizing outlier points. - A Normal Consistency Constraint (NCC) is introduced to encourage local surface continuity and completeness in the predicted point clouds by minimizing the variance of normal direction similarity of nearby points.- Experiments on both synthetic ShapeNet data and real ScanNet data demonstrate that P2C achieves comparable or better performance than methods trained with complete shapes or multiple partial views. This validates the effectiveness of the self-supervised learning scheme.In summary, the key novelty is the self-supervised point cloud completion framework that only relies on single partial point clouds, eliminating the requirement for complete shapes or multiple partial views during training. The RCD and NCC components also help improve completion quality in this challenging setting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a self-supervised point cloud completion method called P2C that can be trained using only single partial point clouds per object, through designing a region-aware distance metric and local surface continuity constraint to enable learning from incomplete data without complete supervision.
