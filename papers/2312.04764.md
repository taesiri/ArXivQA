# [First Attempt at Building Parallel Corpora for Machine Translation of   Northeast India's Very Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04764)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents the creation of initial parallel corpora between English and 13 very low-resource endangered languages from Northeast India, all belonging to the Sino-Tibetan language family. The parallel texts were extracted from Bible translations and consist of around 7,000 to 30,000 sentence pairs per language. The authors trained baseline neural machine translation systems on these corpora using transformers and fine-tuning of m2m-100 multilingual models. Results show the fine-tuned models substantially outperform transformers trained from scratch, achieving average BLEU scores of 13.93 for English->Indian languages and 22.67 for Indian languages->English. The authors discuss challenges in low-resource machine translation and plan to expand the corpora by extracting texts from scanned documents and social media, add more Indian languages, and continue evaluating approaches to improve performance. This represents pioneering work in creating resources and benchmarks for extremely low-resource endangered languages in India using neural machine translation.
