# [First Attempt at Building Parallel Corpora for Machine Translation of   Northeast India's Very Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04764)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents the creation of initial parallel corpora between English and 13 very low-resource endangered languages from Northeast India, all belonging to the Sino-Tibetan language family. The parallel texts were extracted from Bible translations and consist of around 7,000 to 30,000 sentence pairs per language. The authors trained baseline neural machine translation systems on these corpora using transformers and fine-tuning of m2m-100 multilingual models. Results show the fine-tuned models substantially outperform transformers trained from scratch, achieving average BLEU scores of 13.93 for English->Indian languages and 22.67 for Indian languages->English. The authors discuss challenges in low-resource machine translation and plan to expand the corpora by extracting texts from scanned documents and social media, add more Indian languages, and continue evaluating approaches to improve performance. This represents pioneering work in creating resources and benchmarks for extremely low-resource endangered languages in India using neural machine translation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents the creation of initial bilingual corpora for thirteen very low-resource languages of Northeast India and provides initial neural machine translation benchmark results for these languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

The paper presents the creation of initial bilingual corpora for thirteen very low-resource languages of India, all from Northeast India. It also presents the results of initial translation efforts in these languages. Specifically, it:

1) Creates the first-ever parallel corpora for these 13 low-resource Indian languages paired with English. 

2) Provides initial benchmark neural machine translation results using these new parallel corpora to translate between English and each of the 13 languages. 

3) Discusses plans to expand the corpora to include more low-resource Indian languages, as well as integrate it with prior work on African and Native American languages, to create corpora covering many low-resource languages globally.

In summary, the key contribution is developing the first parallel corpora and benchmark machine translation results for 13 extremely low-resource languages of Northeast India, with plans to expand this to additional languages.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Low-resource languages: The paper focuses on very low-resource languages from Northeast India. These languages have limited data and resources available.

- Parallel corpora: The paper presents the creation of initial parallel corpora between 13 Indian languages and English. This involves sentence alignment and dataset pre-processing. 

- Machine translation: A core focus is developing neural machine translation capabilities between English and these 13 Indian languages. Benchmark translation experiments are presented.

- Multilingual models: The paper experiments with transformer and m2m100 multilingual translation models, fine-tuning the latter.

- Sino-Tibetan languages: The 13 Indian languages focused on fall under the Sino-Tibetan language family. Specific subfamilies like Tani and Tibeto-Burman are also mentioned.

- Endangered languages: Many of the low-resource Indian languages focused on are endangered, making the development of computational capabilities for them important.

In summary, the key terms cover low-resource language translation, parallel corpora building, multilingual models, endangered language preservation, and the Sino-Tibetan language family. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a web crawler to extract texts from a Bible-related website. What considerations need to be made when developing a web crawler for extracting texts in low-resource languages? How can the crawler be optimized for multilingual content?

2. The paper aligns sentences between the Indian languages and English using a heuristic alignment method. What are some of the challenges in sentence alignment for low-resource languages? What techniques could be used to improve alignment accuracy? 

3. The paper divides the corpus into train, dev and test sets in a 70:10:20 ratio. What factors need to be considered when determining the optimal corpus split for low-resource neural machine translation? How could the split be improved?

4. The paper experiments with training transformers from scratch versus fine-tuning a multilingual model. What are the key differences between these two approaches? What are the tradeoffs in using one versus the other for low-resource languages? 

5. The fine-tuned model outperforms the transformer model significantly. What characteristics of the m2m100 model make it suitable for fine-tuning on low-resource languages? How could a transformer model be optimized for better performance on low-resource data?

6. There is a difference in model performance between translating to versus from English. What factors contribute to the asymmetry in translation quality? How can models be improved to reduce this asymmetry?

7. The authors mention linguistic diversity as a challenge. How specifically does linguistic typology and language relatedness impact neural machine translation for low-resource languages?

8. The authors state datasets with larger corpus sizes perform better. What techniques could be used to augment limited parallel datasets for neural machine translation? What data augmentation approaches would be most suitable? 

9. What types of evaluation metrics beyond BLEU score should be considered for low-resource neural machine translation, especially when target language native speakers are difficult to access? 

10. The paper proposes expanding the approach to additional Indian languages. What criteria should be used for the selection and prioritization of additional languages? What resources and approaches are needed to scale up effectively?
