# [G4G:A Generic Framework for High Fidelity Talking Face Generation with   Fine-grained Intra-modal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18122)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating high-fidelity talking face videos with fine-grained lip synchronization to arbitrary audio remains challenging. Existing methods struggle with preserving personal identity, aligning audio-visual features, and generating realistic mouth textures. 

Proposed Solution - Align-Deform Framework
1. Fine-Grained Alignment Network
- Intra-modality alignment - Aligns visual features to facial landmarks to retain personal identity 
- Inter-modality alignment - Matrix alignment of audio-visual features for better lip sync

2. Multi-Scale Perception Network  
- Audio-guided spatial deformation of visual features
- Generates talking face under multi-scale mask supervision 

3. Deformation Fusion Network
- Smooths face contour and eliminates artifacts

Main Contributions:
1) Comprehensive alignment network for intra-modal and inter-modal feature alignment at different granularities 

2) Align-deform network leveraging landmarks and audio guidance to address person-generic talking face generation

3) Multi-scale supervised spatial transformation to generate talking face while preserving texture and contour  

4) State-of-the-art performance demonstrated through quantitative metrics and user studies

The proposed align-deform framework with fine-grained alignment and multi-scale supervision effectively addresses key challenges in talking face generation. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate superiority over existing methods in producing high-fidelity and synchronized talking videos.
