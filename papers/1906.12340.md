# [Using Self-Supervised Learning Can Improve Model Robustness and   Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12340)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses of this paper appear to be:1) Can self-supervised learning improve model robustness and uncertainty estimates beyond what is possible with purely supervised training? The paper hypothesizes that adding self-supervised auxiliary tasks during training can improve model robustness to adversarial examples, label noise/corruption, common input corruptions, and enhance out-of-distribution detection. 2) Can self-supervised learning surpass fully supervised methods for out-of-distribution detection, particularly on near-distribution anomalies?The paper hypothesizes that the representations learned via self-supervision may better capture the structure of in-distribution data, allowing for superior OOD detection compared to supervised methods alone.3) Should robustness and uncertainty estimation be considered as additional evaluation axes for self-supervised learning? The paper proposes that future self-supervised methods could be judged based on their ability to improve model robustness and uncertainty estimates, not just standard accuracy metrics.In summary, the key hypotheses are that self-supervision can benefit robustness and uncertainty in ways that supervised learning alone cannot, and these benefits are often masked when evaluating only on clean accuracy. The paper aims to demonstrate these gains across several robustness tasks and OOD detection.
