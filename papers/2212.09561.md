# [Large Language Models are Better Reasoners with Self-Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09561)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, the main research question seems to be:

Can large language models demonstrate improved reasoning and inference abilities when equipped with a self-verification capability to check their own conclusions?

Specifically, the authors propose that large language models like GPT-3 can learn to self-verify their reasoning chains and conclusions, rather than relying solely on an initial chain of thought. Their hypothesis is that by prompting the model to verify its own outputs in a backward pass, the overall reasoning accuracy can be improved compared to just doing forward chained reasoning. The self-verification acts as a consistency check on the model's conclusions.

The paper introduces a self-verification method that does not require additional training or fine-tuning of the language model. Instead, it relies only on carefully designed prompts that induce the model to verify its reasoning steps in a backward direction. The core hypothesis is that language models possess an inherent self-verification capability that can be unlocked through proper prompting.

In summary, the central question is whether large language models can reason better when equipped with the ability to self-verify, avoiding some errors that can accumulate during multi-step forward reasoning. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability and its benefits empirically across several reasoning datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and demonstrating that large language models (LLMs) have the ability to self-verify their own prediction results, without needing additional training of verifier models. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. Proposing a self-verification method for LLMs that involves generating multiple candidate answers using chain of thought prompting, then verifying them by masking and re-predicting the original conditions. This allows calculating a verification score to select the best answer.

2. Showing that this approach improves reasoning performance across multiple datasets - arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning - achieving new state-of-the-art results on many.

3. Demonstrating that the self-verification ability emerges in larger LLMs and benefits from more verification conditions.

4. Proving LLMs can self-verify without extra training, unlike prior work on answer verification that requires fine-tuning verifier models. This makes the approach more flexible.

5. Providing an interpretable verification score compared to prior verification methods based on neural network outputs.

Overall, the key contribution is introducing and validating the idea that large language models can act as reasoners with built-in self-verification abilities, avoiding the need for additional specialized training. The proposed prompting-based method realizes this ability and achieves strong reasoning results across diverse tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper proposes and demonstrates that large language models like GPT-3 have the ability to self-verify their reasoning by generating multiple candidate answers using chain of thought, then evaluating and selecting the best answer through a prompt-based verification process without additional training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- This paper focuses specifically on using large language models for self-verification in reasoning tasks. Much prior work has explored improving reasoning abilities of LLMs through techniques like chain of thought prompting. However, the idea of leveraging self-verification is novel. 

- Most prior work on answer verification for LLMs involves training an additional model or classifier to score candidate answers. A key contribution here is showing LLMs can self-verify without additional training. This is more flexible and widely applicable.

- The approach builds directly on recent findings that LLMs exhibit some reasoning and chain of thought abilities with just prompting. However, it addresses the limitation of error propagation in multi-step reasoning. The self-verification acts as a way to check the validity of reasoning chains.

- The experiments cover a broad set of reasoning tasks and datasets. This demonstrates the generality of the approach beyond just mathematical reasoning. The gains over baseline CoT prompting are consistent across tasks.

- The analysis provides insights into the factors that impact self-verification abilities, like model scale and masking conditions. This sheds light on the reasoning process within LLMs.

- The proposed method does not require human annotated training data. This could allow self-verification to be applied easily to new domains. Overall it represents an advancement of few-shot reasoning for LLMs.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel technique for verifying LLM reasoning, demonstrates effectiveness across diverse reasoning tasks, and provides analysis to better understand the approach. The gains over CoT prompting alone are noteworthy.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more robust self-verification methods that can better handle incorrect reasoning chains generated during forward reasoning. The authors note limitations in the model's ability to reliably detect its own incorrect reasoning.

- Exploring targeted condition selection and masking for non-arithmetic tasks. The paper showed the conditional masking approach was more effective for arithmetic tasks, but other techniques may be needed for commonsense and logical reasoning datasets. 

- Applying self-verification more broadly to different models, tasks and domains beyond what was tested in the paper. The authors suggest self-verification could become a general paradigm for improving reasoning in LLMs.

- Combining self-verification with other methods that improve forward reasoning, like self-consistency prompting. The paper showed self-verification can further boost gains from these techniques.

- Developing better prompts and protocols to reduce bias and ensure self-verification draws on actual reasoning abilities. The reliability of self-verification depends on careful prompt design.

- Exploring self-verification in larger language models, since the approach appears more effective with increased scale and capability.

In summary, the main directions are developing more robust and generalizable self-verification techniques, combining self-verification with complementary methods, and harnessing larger models to realize the full potential of self-verification for reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-verification method to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. The method involves first generating multiple candidate answers to a reasoning question using chaining of thought prompting. Then a backward verification step is done where the model verifies its own candidate answers by masking conditions and seeing if it can re-predict them correctly. This provides a verification score to select the best answer. The approach does not require additional training or models. Experiments on arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning datasets show improvements over chain of thought baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art results on many datasets. The method demonstrates LLMs have an inherent ability to self-verify, similar to how humans check their own reasoning. The interpretable verification scores also enhance model transparency. Overall, the work shows self-verification is a promising technique to improve LLMs' reasoning and avoid error accumulation in multi-step inference, while maintaining model efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Large language models have shown impressive capabilities for few-shot reasoning on tasks like arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, and logical reasoning when prompted with chains of thought. However, they are prone to error accumulation due to the multi-step reasoning required in chain of thought prompting. This paper proposes using the language models themselves to self-verify the conclusions generated through chain of thought reasoning. The proposed method has two steps - forward reasoning to generate candidate conclusions using chain of thought, and backward verification where the model is prompted to re-predict masked conditions based on the candidate conclusions. This provides an interpretable verification score to rank the candidate conclusions without requiring additional training. 

Experiments were conducted using GPT-3 and InstructGPT on arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed self-verification method improves reasoning accuracy over just chain of thought prompting. The benefits are greater for larger models, showing self-verification is an emergent capability. The paper also shows the approach can be combined with other methods like self-consistency prompting. The results highlight the potential for large language models to self-verify, providing a way to enhance reasoning without extra training or resources.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a self-verification approach to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. The method has two main steps - Forward Reasoning and Backward Verification. In Forward Reasoning, the LLM generates multiple candidate answers for a reasoning question using chain of thought prompting. In Backward Verification, the LLM takes each candidate answer, rewrites it as a conclusion, and tries to predict/verify the original conditions used to derive that conclusion. This is done by masking the original conditions one by one and generating them again based on the candidate conclusion. Each candidate answer gets a verification score based on how many original conditions it is able to correctly predict. The candidate with the highest score is selected as the final answer. This approach allows LLMs to check their own work and select better answers without needing additional training or models. Experiments on reasoning datasets show improvements over chain of thought baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of improving the reasoning ability and reliability of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 when solving complex reasoning tasks. 

Specifically, it focuses on the issue that LLMs using chain of thought prompting can be highly sensitive to individual mistakes, leading to error accumulation and incorrect answers when performing multi-step reasoning. The paper proposes enhancing LLMs with a self-verification ability to select better predictions and mitigate errors in the reasoning process.

The key question the paper seeks to address is: How can we improve large language models to be better reasoners without needing additional training data or model fine-tuning? The self-verification method allows LLMs to check and verify their own reasoning, similar to how humans re-examine their thought process, without requiring extra annotations or model training.

So in summary, the core problem is improving reasoning accuracy and robustness of large language models on complex tasks using only the model's existing capabilities, and the proposed solution is to leverage self-verification based on masking and regenerating parts of the reasoning chain.
