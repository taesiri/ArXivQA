# [Classifying Nodes in Graphs without GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05934)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Graph neural networks (GNNs) are currently the dominant approach for node classification in graphs. However, GNNs have some undesirable properties such as high computational complexity and being prone to oversmoothing. Recently, knowledge distillation methods have shown that simple MLPs can match GNN accuracy at test time. However, these methods still require training a teacher GNN model. This paper investigates whether it is possible to achieve competitive performance without using GNNs at all.

Method: 
The paper first analyzes distillation methods and finds that their success stems from efficiently using unlabeled data rather than the benefits of message passing. This motivates developing a fully GNN-free approach consisting of:

1) Smoothness loss between label predictions of neighboring nodes 

2) Pseudo-labeling iterations to increase the labeled set

3) Neighborhood label histograms that summarize nearby labels to incorporate local context

The proposed CoHOp method combines these elements. It uses consistency regularization and iterative pseudo-labeling to prevent overfitting. The label histograms provide useful local information without needing to compute hidden representations over the graph like GNNs.

Contributions:

- Clarifying the role of distillation methods in overcoming sample complexity challenges 

- Introducing neighborhood histogram features to encode local context

- Achieving competitive accuracy to GNNs on benchmark citation and co-purchase datasets without training any graph neural networks.

The experiments show CoHOp matches or exceeds the performance of recent distillation techniques and GraphSAGE, demonstrating it is possible to effectively classify nodes while avoiding both message passing and teacher model training.
