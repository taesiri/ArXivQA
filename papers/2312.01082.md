# [On the Effects of Randomness on Stability of Learning with Limited   Labelled Data: A Systematic Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01082)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the literature on the effects of randomness on the stability of machine learning models trained with limited labelled data. The paper focuses specifically on approaches like meta-learning, language model fine-tuning, and in-context learning that aim to learn effectively from small labelled datasets. 

The paper highlights that models trained in such low-data regimes tend to be excessively sensitive to sources of randomness in the training process, such as random parameter initialization, order of training examples, or randomness in data splits. This randomness can significantly impact model stability, leading to high variance in performance across training runs and making comparisons between models unreliable.

The paper systematically reviews 134 relevant papers, categorized based on the main task they perform to address randomness (investigate, determine source, mitigate effects, benchmark/compare/report impact). Key findings are highlighted for each category. The paper also proposes a taxonomy to characterize papers based on factors like addressed randomness sources, machine learning approaches, evaluation methodology etc.

The main contributions of the paper are:

- The first comprehensive, systematic literature review focused specifically on the impact of randomness on stability for low-data learning regimes

- Taxonomy and detailed analysis to characterize and categorize existing literature

- Summary of findings across different categories of works that address randomness 

- Identification of 7 main challenges and open problems, like limited scope, disregard for interactions between factors, lack of consensus on methodology and results etc.

- Discussion of limitations of current approaches and suggestions for future work in this important but understudied area of machine learning research

Overall, this paper clearly synthesizes existing research and identifies critical gaps to emphasize the need for more focus on understanding and addressing the effects of randomness for reliable and reproducible machine learning with limited labelled data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this survey paper:

1) The paper proposes a taxonomy to categorize papers based on the tasks performed to address randomness, the specific randomness factors considered, and the machine learning approaches used. What are some limitations of this taxonomy and how could it be extended to capture additional nuances between papers?

2) When investigating the effects of randomness, the authors note that many papers choose an arbitrary number of training runs, often without justification. What criteria could be used to systematically determine an appropriate number of runs to balance representativeness and computational constraints? 

3) The survey identifies interactions between randomness factors as an important open problem. What statistical or experimental techniques could help disentangle and quantify these interaction effects?

4) The authors argue that more sophisticated statistical evaluation methods are needed, rather than just reporting aggregate performance over runs. What specific statistical methods would be well-suited to this goal and what challenges might arise in applying them?

5) Very few papers consider a comprehensive set of randomness factors jointly in their analyses. What modeling or experimental frameworks could enable managing this combinatorial explosion more feasibly?

6) When proposing mitigation strategies for randomness, how can their effectiveness be rigorously assessed while accounting for interactions with other factors? What metrics beyond simple performance comparison would be valuable?

7) The survey reveals many contradictory findings between papers investigating the same factors and settings. Besides interactions and limited runs, what other methodological differences could contribute to these inconsistencies?

8) What techniques from domains like sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, or robust optimization could inform the study of randomness in machine learning?

9) How well do the trends and findings generalize across different data modalities like text, images, and speech? What differences would be expected?

10) The benchmarking of systems in the presence of randomness is identified as an open challenge. What design principles and desiderata should guide the development of such benchmarks?
