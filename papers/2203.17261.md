# [R2L: Distilling Neural Radiance Field to Neural Light Field for   Efficient Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17261)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an efficient neural scene representation that enables fast rendering while maintaining high image quality. The key ideas proposed are:

1) Representing the scene as a neural light field (NeLF) instead of a neural radiance field (NeRF). This avoids the need for iterative sampling and ray marching required by NeRF, allowing for much faster rendering with just a single network query. 

2) Proposing a deep residual MLP network architecture for learning the NeLF. This provides sufficient capacity to represent complex scenes accurately. 

3) Distilling knowledge from a pretrained NeRF model to generate abundant pseudo training data for the NeLF network. This overcomes the data shortage problem when training deep networks.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that an appropriately designed deep neural light field network trained with sufficient data distilled from NeRF can achieve efficient high-quality novel view synthesis. Experiments validate this hypothesis, showing 26-35x speedup over NeRF with even better image quality.

 This paper presents a novel approach for efficient novel view synthesis by proposing a deep residual neural network to represent scenes as neural light fields (NeLF). It makes several key contributions compared to prior work:

- It is the first work to use a deep network architecture for NeLF, with 88 layers and extensive residual connections. Most prior NeLF methods use much shallower networks inherited from NeRF. The deeper network allows representing complex real-world scenes more accurately.

- It achieves significantly faster rendering speeds (26-35x) compared to NeRF with even better image quality, owing to the single-pass feedforward nature of NeLF. This efficiency gain is much greater than other methods like KiloNeRF or RSEN.

- It works on complex real-world scenes, unlike some recent NeLF papers only shown effective on toys. The real-world performance is competitive or better than state-of-the-art alternatives like DONeRF.

Overall, this paper makes important progress in neural scene representation by being the first to explore deep networks for NeLF. The proposed distillation strategy enables training such networks effectively. The results demonstrate NeLF can be as accurate as NeRF, while enjoying drastic speed benefits. Thiscombination of ideas is novel compared to prior work on efficient novel view synthesis.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in efficient novel view synthesis:

- The paper proposes representing scenes as neural light fields (NeLF) rather than neural radiance fields (NeRF). Most prior work sticks with the NeRF representation and focuses on reducing sampling. Using NeLF fundamentally avoids the need for sampling during rendering.

- To train the deep NeLF network, the paper distills knowledge from a pre-trained NeRF model by generating abundant pseudo-samples. Leveraging knowledge distillation and pseudo-data generation allows training a powerful deep network with limited real data.

- Experiments show the method achieves 26-35x speedup over NeRF in FLOPs with even better rendering quality. This is much greater efficiency than most prior work like DONeRF or KiloNeRF while maintaining quality.

- The method does not rely on any extra information like depth maps. Many efficient NeRF methods require ground truth depth, which is often unavailable. This makes the approach more practical.

- The deep residual MLP network design is novel in learning neural scene representations. Most works inherit the shallow MLP structure from the original NeRF, while this explores optimizing the network architecture itself.

Overall, the paper makes worthwhile contributions in representing scenes as NeLF, using knowledge distillation and pseudo-data to train deep networks, and designing deep residual MLPs for novel view synthesis. The substantial efficiency gains while improving quality stand out compared to related work.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents R2L, a method to distill knowledge from a neural radiance field (NeRF) model into a neural light field (NeLF) model for efficient novel view synthesis. While NeRF uses volume rendering along sampled points on camera rays, requiring hundreds of samples per ray, NeLF directly maps rays to RGB colors, requiring only a single network query. However, learning an effective NeLF model is challenging due to the lack of training data. To address this, the authors first propose a deep residual MLP architecture with 88 layers for the NeLF model, providing greater representational capacity over standard MLPs used in NeRF. They then leverage a pretrained NeRF teacher model to generate abundant pseudo training data by randomly sampling rays and querying the NeRF model for labels. Using this distilled data, the NeLF student model is trained via MSE loss to regress the NeRF outputs. Experiments show this achieves 26-35x speedup over NeRF in terms of FLOPs with even better image quality, outperforming NeRF by 1.4dB PSNR on synthetic scenes. The method also outperforms other efficient view synthesis techniques like DONeRF and KiloNeRF. Key ablations demonstrate the benefits of the deep residual MLP design and hard example mining during NeLF training.

In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: (1) A deep residual MLP network design for learning neural light fields to achieve efficient rendering. (2) Leveraging knowledge distillation from a NeRF teacher to synthesize abundant pseudo training data. (3) State-of-the-art results on NeRF datasets, outperforming NeRF itself and other efficient view synthesis methods in speed, quality, and model compactness. The proposed distillation strategy from neural radiance to light fields enables fast, high-quality novel view synthesis.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a method called R2L for efficient novel view synthesis. The key idea is to represent a scene as a neural light field (NeLF) instead of a neural radiance field (NeRF). The NeLF directly maps a ray to an RGB color, avoiding the need to sample multiple points along each ray like NeRF. However, learning an effective NeLF is challenging. To address this, the authors propose a deep residual MLP network with 88 layers. This high capacity allows it to represent complex light fields well. But deep networks require abundant data, which is lacking with only a few input images. So the authors use knowledge distillation - a pretrained NeRF teacher is used to synthesize pseudo training data by sampling random rays. With this extra data, the proposed deep NeLF network, trained with an MSE loss, can achieve high rendering quality.

Experiments show the R2L method gets 26-35x speedup over NeRF in FLOPs and 28-31x in actual runtime, while improving PSNR by 1.4-2.8dB on synthetic scenes. It also performs well on real world data. Ablations justify the design choices like the deep residual architecture, distillation, and hard example mining. Overall, R2L demonstrates representing scenes as neural light fields can enable highly efficient high-quality novel view synthesis. The key enablers are a properly designed deep network and leveraging knowledge distillation from an existing radiance field.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel deep residual MLP network called R2L for efficient novel view synthesis. Unlike previous works that use shallow MLP networks like NeRF, R2L employs an unprecedentedly deep (88 layers) residual MLP network to represent scenes as neural light fields instead of radiance fields. This allows directly mapping a ray to RGB outputs without needing to sample points along the ray like NeRF, enabling much faster rendering. To train such a deep network, the key insight is to leverage a pre-trained NeRF teacher model to synthesize a large amount of pseudo training data by rendering random views of the scene. The R2L student model is then trained on this abundant pseudo data to learn the mapping from rays to RGB outputs. This distillation from a NeRF teacher to an R2L student enables learning powerful light field representations for high quality but extremely efficient novel view synthesis, reducing FLOPs by 26-35x and running time by 28-31x versus NeRF.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of slow rendering speed in neural radiance fields (NeRF). The key issues identified with NeRF are:

- Rendering a pixel requires sampling hundreds of points along each camera ray and querying the NeRF network multiple times. This makes it very slow. 

- Reducing the NeRF network size hurts rendering quality.

- Other methods to reduce sampling like skipping empty space still require iterative sampling and network queries.

To address these issues, this paper proposes representing the scene as a neural light field (NeLF) instead of a radiance field. The key advantages of NeLF are:

- Rendering a pixel only requires a single network query without iterative sampling or ray marching. This makes it much faster.

- The paper proposes a novel deep residual MLP network to represent the scene as a neural light field. This allows compactly representing complex scenes while enabling real-time rendering.

- The paper shows that training such a deep network requires abundant data, which is generated by distilling knowledge from a pretrained NeRF model. This allows transferring knowledge from NeRF to NeLF.

In summary, the key question addressed is how to achieve fast rendering for novel view synthesis while maintaining high quality like NeRF. The paper proposes representing the scene as a neural light field using a specially designed deep network and training it with distilled data from NeRF.
