# R2L: Distilling Neural Radiance Field to Neural Light Field for   Efficient Novel View Synthesis

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an efficient neural scene representation that enables fast rendering while maintaining high image quality. The key ideas proposed are:1) Representing the scene as a neural light field (NeLF) instead of a neural radiance field (NeRF). This avoids the need for iterative sampling and ray marching required by NeRF, allowing for much faster rendering with just a single network query. 2) Proposing a deep residual MLP network architecture for learning the NeLF. This provides sufficient capacity to represent complex scenes accurately. 3) Distilling knowledge from a pretrained NeRF model to generate abundant pseudo training data for the NeLF network. This overcomes the data shortage problem when training deep networks.In summary, the main hypothesis is that an appropriately designed deep neural light field network trained with sufficient data distilled from NeRF can achieve efficient high-quality novel view synthesis. Experiments validate this hypothesis, showing 26-35x speedup over NeRF with even better image quality.

The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an efficient neural scene representation that enables fast novel view synthesis while maintaining high rendering quality. Specifically, the paper proposes representing scenes using a neural light field (NeLF) instead of a neural radiance field (NeRF). The key hypotheses are:1.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a novel approach for efficient novel view synthesis by proposing a deep residual neural network to represent scenes as neural light fields (NeLF). It makes several key contributions compared to prior work:- It is the first work to use a deep network architecture for NeLF, with 88 layers and extensive residual connections. Most prior NeLF methods use much shallower networks inherited from NeRF. The deeper network allows representing complex real-world scenes more accurately. - The key insight is to train this deep NeLF network by distilling knowledge from a pre-trained NeRF model, which provides abundant synthetic training data. This overcomes the insufficient training data problem when learning deep networks.- It achieves significantly faster rendering speeds (26-35x) compared to NeRF with even better image quality, owing to the single-pass feedforward nature of NeLF. This efficiency gain is much greater than other methods like KiloNeRF or RSEN.- It works on complex real-world scenes, unlike some recent NeLF papers only shown effective on toys. The real-world performance is competitive or better than state-of-the-art alternatives like DONeRF.Overall, this paper makes important progress in neural scene representation by being the first to explore deep networks for NeLF. The proposed distillation strategy enables training such networks effectively. The results demonstrate NeLF can be as accurate as NeRF, while enjoying drastic speed benefits. Thiscombination of ideas is novel compared to prior work on efficient novel view synthesis.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in efficient novel view synthesis:- The paper proposes representing scenes as neural light fields (NeLF) rather than neural radiance fields (NeRF). Most prior work sticks with the NeRF representation and focuses on reducing sampling. Using NeLF fundamentally avoids the need for sampling during rendering.- To train the deep NeLF network, the paper distills knowledge from a pre-trained NeRF model by generating abundant pseudo-samples. Leveraging knowledge distillation and pseudo-data generation allows training a powerful deep network with limited real data.- Experiments show the method achieves 26-35x speedup over NeRF in FLOPs with even better rendering quality. This is much greater efficiency than most prior work like DONeRF or KiloNeRF while maintaining quality.- The method does not rely on any extra information like depth maps. Many efficient NeRF methods require ground truth depth, which is often unavailable. This makes the approach more practical.- The deep residual MLP network design is novel in learning neural scene representations. Most works inherit the shallow MLP structure from the original NeRF, while this explores optimizing the network architecture itself.Overall, the paper makes worthwhile contributions in representing scenes as NeLF, using knowledge distillation and pseudo-data to train deep networks, and designing deep residual MLPs for novel view synthesis. The substantial efficiency gains while improving quality stand out compared to related work.
