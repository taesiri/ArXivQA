# [Automatic and Universal Prompt Injection Attacks against Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04957)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prompt injection attacks pose a significant threat to large language models (LLMs) by manipulating them to produce adversary-desired responses. 
- Research on defending against these attacks faces challenges due to unclear attack objectives and reliance on manually crafted attack prompts. This makes comprehensive evaluation difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Defines 3 categories of attack objectives - static, semi-dynamic, and dynamic - to unify the goals of prompt injection attacks.
- Introduces an automated momentum gradient-based method to generate highly effective prompt injection data by optimizing attack prompts using the victim LLM's gradients.

Key Contributions:  
- Attack objectives provide a unified framework for understanding prompt injection goals.
- Automated optimization method generates superior attacks using just 5 training samples, with over 50% average success rate across objectives and datasets. 
- Highlights need for gradient-based testing to avoid overestimating defense robustness.
- Adaptive attacks remain highly effective even against defenses like paraphrasing and prompt isolation.

In summary, the paper addresses key challenges in prompt injection attack research by defining unified objectives and developing an automated attack generation method. The attacks highlight vulnerabilities in LLMs and emphasize the importance of gradient-based adversarial testing for robustness evaluations.
