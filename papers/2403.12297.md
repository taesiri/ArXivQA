# [Leveraging Large Language Models to Extract Information on Substance Use   Disorder Severity from Clinical Notes: A Zero-shot Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12297)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Substance use disorders (SUDs) are complex health issues, but diagnosis codes used in medical records lack granularity on factors like severity, symptoms, and social determinants that impact treatment. This information is often recorded as unstructured text in clinical notes. 
- Traditional NLP methods struggle to accurately extract such nuanced information due to the variability of clinical language. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for adapting to diverse language without needing large labeled datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- Use zero-shot learning of LLMs to extract text indicating severity levels of SUD diagnoses from clinical notes. 
- Prompt engineering and post-processing techniques are used to improve performance. The Flan-T5 LLM is tested on a dataset of 577 VA clinical notes annotated for severity levels across 11 categories of substances.

Main Contributions:
- First study using LLMs to extract severity specifiers across 11 categories of SUD diagnoses, assessing performance against rule-based methods.
- Demonstrates Flan-T5 can achieve high recall in extracting severity information without training, overcoming annotation challenges. 
- Analysis of errors provides insights into differences in language patterns between substance categories.
- Lays groundwork for extracting other SUD risk factors like symptoms and social determinants toward improved assessment and treatment.

In summary, this paper presents a novel application of large language models to extract granular substance use disorder information from clinical notes. The zero-shot learning approach shows promise for enhancing risk analysis despite language variability, without needing large labeled datasets.
