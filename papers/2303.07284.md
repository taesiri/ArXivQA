# [Align and Attend: Multimodal Summarization with Dual Contrastive Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07284)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective multimodal summarization model that leverages the alignment between video frames and text transcripts to generate high quality video and text summaries?The key hypotheses of the paper are:1) Explicitly modeling the temporal alignment between video frames and text transcripts can help fuse cross-modal information and improve multimodal summarization performance. 2) Applying contrastive losses at both inter-sample and intra-sample levels can allow the model to better exploit cross-modal correlations.3) The proposed alignment-guided attention module and dual contrastive losses will enable the model (called A2Summ) to outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on multimodal summarization benchmarks.In summary, the main goal of this paper is to propose a new multimodal summarization framework called A2Summ that can align and attend to multimodal inputs using an alignment-guided attention module and dual contrastive losses. The central hypothesis is that explicitly modeling alignment and leveraging contrastive learning will lead to better multimodal summarization performance. The authors evaluate this hypothesis through experiments on multiple datasets.
