# [Align and Attend: Multimodal Summarization with Dual Contrastive Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07284)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective multimodal summarization model that leverages the alignment between video frames and text transcripts to generate high quality video and text summaries?The key hypotheses of the paper are:1) Explicitly modeling the temporal alignment between video frames and text transcripts can help fuse cross-modal information and improve multimodal summarization performance. 2) Applying contrastive losses at both inter-sample and intra-sample levels can allow the model to better exploit cross-modal correlations.3) The proposed alignment-guided attention module and dual contrastive losses will enable the model (called A2Summ) to outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on multimodal summarization benchmarks.In summary, the main goal of this paper is to propose a new multimodal summarization framework called A2Summ that can align and attend to multimodal inputs using an alignment-guided attention module and dual contrastive losses. The central hypothesis is that explicitly modeling alignment and leveraging contrastive learning will lead to better multimodal summarization performance. The authors evaluate this hypothesis through experiments on multiple datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes A2Summ, a novel unified transformer-based framework for multimodal summarization. The key aspects of A2Summ are:1) An alignment-guided self-attention module that aligns and attends to the multimodal input while leveraging the temporal correspondence between modalities like video and text. 2) Dual contrastive losses consisting of an inter-sample and an intra-sample contrastive loss. These losses model the cross-modal correlation at different granularities.- The paper collects and releases a large-scale multimodal summarization dataset called BLiSS. This dataset contains livestream videos and transcripts with annotated summaries for both modalities.- Extensive experiments on multiple standard datasets (SumMe, TVSum, DailyMail, CNN) demonstrate the effectiveness of A2Summ, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Experiments on the new BLiSS dataset also validate the superiority of A2Summ.In summary, the key contribution is a novel multimodal summarization framework A2Summ with aligned cross-modal modeling and dual contrastive losses. The release of a large-scale multimodal summarization dataset BLiSS is another major contribution.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in multimodal summarization:- This paper proposes a new model called Align and Attend Multimodal Summarization (A2Summ) for the task of multimodal summarization, where the goal is to summarize information from both video and text modalities. Many prior works have focused on summarizing only a single modality.- A key contribution of A2Summ is the use of an alignment-guided self-attention module to better fuse information between the video and text modalities by leveraging their temporal correspondence. Prior multimodal summarization models typically process the modalities separately. - The paper introduces two novel contrastive losses that help model cross-modal correlations at different levels: 1) An inter-sample contrastive loss that operates across sample pairs in a batch, and 2) An intra-sample contrastive loss that operates within each sample pair. Contrastive learning has not been explored much for multimodal summarization before.- The paper collects and experiments on a new large-scale dataset called BLiSS that contains long livestream videos and transcripts. This provides a new challenging testbed compared to prior datasets that had shorter videos.- Experiments show A2Summ outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on several standard datasets for video and multimodal summarization. This demonstrates the benefits of the model's design compared to previous approaches.In summary, the key novelties of this work compared to prior multimodal summarization research are the cross-modal alignment module, use of contrastive learning objectives, and introduction of a large new livestream dataset. The results demonstrate improved performance over existing models.
