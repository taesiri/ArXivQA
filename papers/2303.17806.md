# [Neural Microfacet Fields for Inverse Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17806)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we simultaneously recover accurate geometry, material properties, and illumination from images of a scene, in order to enable editing and downstream usage?

The key ideas and contributions towards addressing this question are:

- Combining aspects of volumetric and surface-based rendering for effective optimization. This enables reconstructing high-fidelity scene geometry, materials, and lighting from images.

- Using an optimizable microfacet material model rendered with Monte Carlo integration and multi-bounce raytracing. This allows capturing realistic interreflections on non-convex objects. 

- Achieving efficiency by optimizing a full scene from scratch in around 3 hours on a single GPU.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that by combining volumetric and surface-based rendering, and using a microfacet material model with Monte Carlo raytracing, the paper's method called "Neural Microfacet Fields" can effectively decompose a scene into geometry, materials, and illumination from images alone. The experiments and results then aim to demonstrate this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a new method called Neural Microfacet Fields (NMF) for simultaneously recovering geometry, materials, and illumination from images of a scene. 

- Combining volumetric and surface-based rendering paradigms by modeling each point in space as a "microfacet" with a volume density and surface normal/BRDF. This hybrid representation enables optimization through the inverse rendering problem.

- Using Monte Carlo raytracing with a microfacet BRDF model during optimization to capture interreflections and enable reconstruction of materials.

- Achieving state-of-the-art results on inverse rendering of synthetic scenes, outperforming prior work in reconstruction of high-fidelity geometry, materials, and lighting.

- Demonstrating applications like relighting and scene composition by rendering reconstructed objects under novel illumination conditions.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be proposing the Neural Microfacet Fields representation and optimization strategy to achieve high quality inverse rendering results not possible with prior methods. The hybrid volumetric-surface formulation and differentiable Monte Carlo rendering appear to be the main technical innovations enabling this advance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence TL;DR summary:

The paper presents a method called Neural Microfacet Fields that combines volumetric and surface rendering techniques to recover materials, geometry, and illumination from images by modeling each point in space as a microfacet with associated properties like density and reflectance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some ways it compares to other research in the field of inverse rendering:

- It builds on recent advances in volumetric rendering and neural radiance fields for novel view synthesis. However, it aims to go beyond just novel view synthesis to also recover materials, illumination, and disentangle scene properties. In this sense, it tackles a more challenging inverse rendering problem compared to methods focused solely on view synthesis.

- It combines both volumetric and surface-based rendering in a novel way, using a microfacet field representation. This is a unique hybrid approach compared to prior work relying purely on volumes or surfaces. It allows leveraging decades of research on surface light transport while retaining benefits of volumetric rendering.

- It recovers a spatially-varying BRDF and environment map illumination from images alone, without needing additional supervision. This enables relighting and appearance editing. Many recent methods assume known BRDFs, lighting, or geometry.

- It handles non-convex geometry and interreflections through MC raytracing and multiple bounces. This is more general than methods assuming convexity or single scattering. However, it still assumes far field lighting.

- It demonstrates results on synthetic datasets superior to recent state-of-the-art in inverse rendering in terms of metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and normal MAE. The rendering quality and run time also seem competitive.

- Limitations include assuming far field illumination, difficulty with refraction and transparency, some residual noise, and only demonstrating results on synthetic data currently.

In summary, it pushes the state of the art in inverse rendering in terms of generality and quality of materials, illumination and geometry recovered from images. But there remain open challenges and room for future work on aspects like handling near fields, transparency, and real world data.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests a few future research directions:

- Applying their method to other field representations and larger scenes captured in the wild. They note that their method currently works on small synthetic datasets and may not scale well to large real-world scenes. Extending the method to handle such scenes is an area for future work.

- Improving the handling of interreflections. Their method has a limited number of ray bounces, which limits its ability to accurately model multi-bounce interreflections. Developing techniques to better model interreflections is suggested as future work.

- Removing the far-field illumination assumption. Their method assumes all lighting comes from infinitely far away. Modifying the approach to handle near-field lighting would broaden its applicability. 

- Modeling translucent and refractive materials. Their method cannot currently handle non-opaque materials well. Extending the model to properly account for light transport in translucent and refractive media is noted as an area for future work.

- Developing better priors and regularization strategies specialized for different scene types. The ill-posed inverse rendering problem relies heavily on priors and regularization. Designing such priors specifically tailored for certain scene classes (like outdoor environments) may improve results.

- Exploring neural radiance caching approaches to accelerate rendering. Their method requires costly Monte Carlo sampling during rendering, limiting its efficiency. Leveraging neural networks to cache radiance fields could potentially speed up rendering.

- Applying the method to video capture and temporal consistency. The current method only handles static scenes. Extending it to video sequences and enforcing temporal consistency is noted as an interesting direction.

In summary, the main suggested future directions are: handling larger real scenes, better interreflection modeling, near-field lighting, translucent/refractive materials, specialized priors, neural radiance caching, and video. Overall the paper frames their method as an initial step toward full inverse rendering that could be built upon in many different ways.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a method called Illuminerfi for recovering materials, geometry, and illumination from images of a scene. The method combines volumetric and surface rendering techniques, representing the scene as a 3D field of microfacets where each point has a density and microsurface BRDF. Geometry is modeled using a voxel density field and normals are computed via spatial gradients. Materials are represented with a spatially-varying microfacet BRDF model combining diffuse and specular reflection. Illumination is parameterized using a HDR environment map. To render, Monte Carlo ray tracing is used to evaluate surface light transport at each volumetric sample, and sample colors are accumulated along the ray according to volume rendering. This hybrid volume-surface approach enables joint optimization of geometry, materials, and lighting. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the method's ability to reconstruct high quality geometry, materials, and illumination, outperforming prior inverse rendering techniques.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a method called Neural Microfacet Fields (NMF) for simultaneously recovering geometry, materials, and illumination from a collection of input images. The key idea is to represent the scene using a volumetric density field, like recent neural rendering techniques, but model the appearance at each point using microfacet reflectance modeled via Monte Carlo raytracing. This hybrid volumetric-surface representation combines the optimization benefits of volumetric density fields with the ability to reconstruct realistic materials and lighting using principles of physically based rendering. 

Specifically, the method represents scene geometry using a voxel grid density field, materials using a spatially-varying microfacet BRDF model with diffuse and specular lobes, and distant illumination using a parametric environment map. During rendering, points along each camera ray accumulate color using the volumetric integration equation, but the outgoing radiance at each point is determined by sampling the BRDF using Monte Carlo integration. The paper shows that this approach can recover high quality geometry, materials, and lighting from only input images, outperforming prior neural inverse rendering techniques. Limitations include reliance on distant lighting and difficulty modeling some complex spatially-varying material types.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method called Neural Microfacet Fields for inverse rendering. The key idea is to combine aspects of volumetric and surface-based rendering. Each point in space is modeled as a microfacet with a volume density and a local micro-surface. Volume rendering is used to accumulate light along rays for the overall image formation. However, the outgoing radiance at each point is determined using Monte Carlo integration of a surface-based rendering equation parameterized with a spatially-varying microfacet BRDF model. This hybrid volume-surface representation allows optimizing geometry, materials, and illumination directly from a set of input views of a scene. The volumetric parameterization provides useful gradients during optimization while the microfacet surfaces enable recovering realistic materials through differentiable rendering. Experiments show this approach can reconstruct high-quality geometry, materials, and illumination for a variety of objects.
