# [Variable-Rate Learned Image Compression with Multi-Objective   Optimization and Quantization-Reconstruction Offsets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18930)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Achieving variable bitrate compression using a single learned image compression model is challenging. Prior works either train multiple models or lose significant performance. 

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes three modifications to improve variable rate compression from a single model:
  1) Multi-objective optimization for training
  2) Quantization-reconstruction (QR) offsets
  3) Variable rate quantization of hyperprior latent

- Multi-objective optimization trains the model by simultaneously optimizing for multiple rate-distortion tradeoffs rather than averaging their losses. This better optimizes the shared parameters.  

- QR offsets shift the quantization reconstruction values away from interval midpoints to minimize distortion. This helps when using a wide range of quantization step sizes.

- Varying the hyperprior quantization with the latent quantization better balances their rate allocations.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates improved variable rate performance with negligible loss compared to multiple specialized models, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.  
- Achieves this through only minor modification of a pretrained single-rate model using simple post-training procedures.
- Enables practically continuous rate adjustment during compression through the proposed methods.
- Provides detailed analysis into the source of gains using an incremental application of the methods.

In summary, the paper presents simple and effective techniques to achieve improved variable rate learned image compression from a single model with minimal specialization needed. The gains are clearly demonstrated through comparison to multiple baselines using standard test image sets.
