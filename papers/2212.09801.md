# [Denotationally Correct, Purely Functional, Efficient Reverse-mode   Automatic Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09801)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents a new approach for reverse-mode automatic differentiation in a purely functional programming language. The central hypothesis is that it is possible to design a reverse-mode AD transformation that is:

- Denotationally correct - it is proven semantically correct using categorical semantics.

- Purely functional - it avoids using mutable state or other impure constructs. 

- Provably efficient - it satisfies the "cheap gradient principle" meaning the cost of computing gradients is no more than a small constant factor times computing the original function.

- Modular - it decomposes the overall transformation into separate compilation steps with cleaner interfaces.

The key ideas involve:

- Introducing a novel "Unary Normal Form" intermediate representation inspired by PROPs and compilation to categories. This simplifies reasoning about reverse-mode AD.

- Using partial evaluation and program transformations to optimize the naively constructed gradients into efficient code.

- Leveraging array primitives like map, reduce, scan to express the gradients, enabling parallelism and optimizations.

- Providing denotational semantics using multicategories and proving the correctness of each compilation step.

The overall approach demonstrates it is possible to achieve efficient, provably correct reverse-mode AD in a pure functional language through a combination of novel intermediate representations, semantic models, and optimization techniques. The modularity also makes the approach easier to understand, extend and optimize further.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here is a summary of the key contributions of this paper:

- It presents a purely functional (no side effects or mutation) reverse-mode automatic differentiation transformation for a functional language with arrays. This transformation is provably efficient and correct.

- It introduces a novel intermediate representation called Unary Normal Form (UNF) to decompose the complex reverse-mode transformation into simpler steps. UNF is inspired by PROPs and compilation to categories. 

- It proves complexity guarantees showing the transformed program satisfies a version of the cheap gradient principle, meaning the cost of computing gradients is no more than a small constant factor times the cost of the original program.

- It gives a denotational semantics for the language and transformations using multicategories and concategories. This semantics is used to prove correctness of the overall transformation by verifying correctness of each compilation step.

- The transformation produces efficient code by using partial evaluation and optimizations on the pure functional output. For simple programs the output resembles static single assignment (SSA) code.

- It shows the approach is modular - the language and transformation can be easily extended, for example with more array operations or conditionals.

In summary, the key contribution is a provably efficient and correct reverse-mode automatic differentiation technique for a functional array language, factored into simpler steps via a novel intermediate representation. The functional purity allows optimizations and a formal semantics.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a provably efficient and purely functional reverse-mode automatic differentiation transformation on a functional array language, using a novel intermediate representation called Unary Normal Form to decompose the complex transformation into simpler compilation steps and leverage categorical semantics to prove correctness.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in differentiable programming:

- This paper presents a purely functional approach to reverse-mode automatic differentiation that provides efficient gradients without sacrificing purity or correctness. Many other works in this area use impure techniques like mutable state or only focus on correctness without efficiency guarantees. The functional purity here is a notable advantage.

- The complexity analysis showing that the gradient computation satisfies a form of the cheap gradient principle is a useful theoretical result. Other works in functional AD often lack formal complexity guarantees. The cheap gradient principle is important for efficiency.

- Introducing the Unary Normal Form (UNF) as an intermediate representation is a novel approach not seen in other work. UNF helps decompose the overall transformation into simpler steps and aids the proofs. 

- Using denotational semantics in categories/multicategories to prove correctness gives a strong semantic foundation. Some other papers use operational semantics or informal reasoning. The categorical semantics connects to broader foundations.

- Support for array operations like map, reduce, scan puts this on firmer ground for modern ML than papers dealing only with scalars. Arrays are crucial for efficiency.

- The overall architecture using compilation through UNF seems more modular and extensible than end-to-end source transformations in other works. Adding extensions like new array ops or conditionals is simplified.

- There is less emphasis here on higher-order functions compared to some recent papers. Higher-order AD is still an open challenge. But the techniques here could integrate into compilers for higher-order languages.

So in summary, I'd say this paper advances the state of the art in functional AD by providing an efficient, provably correct technique with formal complexity guarantees, while also introducing new ideas like the UNF representation and compilation-based architecture. The connections to broader theory via categories are also valuable.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several promising avenues for future work:

- Exploring the design space further regarding the tradeoff between generality vs domain-specificity of the language, and balancing pureness/correctness with efficiency. They note it would be interesting to implement and benchmark their approach.

- Extending their work to handle higher-order functions and recursion. The current reverse-mode transformation does not support general recursion.

- Adding support for more array primitives and operations beyond the basic ones presented. Many large AD frameworks have hand-optimized gradients for hundreds of operations.

- Improving the cost model and capturing aspects like parallelism and memory access patterns. This could lead to more optimizations.

- Applying their approach to dynamic networks and recursive neural network architectures that use tree-like data structures, since those have proven effective but usually use manual/imperative backpropagation.

- Investigating the interaction of this work with other techniques like implicit differentiation and probabilistic programming.

- Implementing and evaluating the approach, potentially integrating it into a just-in-time compiler like JAX.

- Exploring the benefits for optimizing computations on GPUs, since the pure functional transform may help detect more parallelism.

In summary, they propose a range of ways to build on their theoretical foundations towards more practical applications and specialized systems that could leverage their provably correct and efficient approach to reverse-mode AD.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a source-code transformation for reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) in a purely functional language with array operations. The transformation uses a novel intermediate representation called Unary Normal Form (UNF) to decompose the overall transformation into simpler steps. This allows proving correctness and efficiency more modularly. The transformation is shown to satisfy a cheap gradient principle, producing gradient code with complexity linear in the complexity of the original program. It supports higher-order functions and conditionals through program unrolling before differentiation. Array operations like map, reduce, scan, etc. are covered and optimized reverse derivatives provided for them. The functional style enables further optimizations like constant propagation and algebraic simplification after differentiation. Overall, the paper provides a provably efficient, modular and optimizable approach to reverse-mode AD in a functional array language.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a purely functional reverse-mode automatic differentiation transformation for a simple array-based language. The key insight is to introduce an intermediate representation called Unary Normal Form (UNF) to simplify the overall transformation. UNF forces the program into a normalized form with only unary operators, simplifying the differentiation. 

The authors prove the complexity and correctness of their approach. They show the transformation satisfies a version of the cheap gradient principle, ensuring efficient gradients. For correctness, they provide denotational semantics using multicategories and concategories. This allows them to break down the overall transformation into three simpler translations between the source language, UNF, and target language. After optimization, the output resembles SSA code. The modularity of the approach allows easily adding more optimized array primitives. Overall, this provides an efficient, provably correct approach for reverse-mode AD using functional programming concepts.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a technique for denotationally correct, purely functional, and efficient reverse-mode automatic differentiation. The key idea is to introduce an intermediate representation called Unary Normal Form (UNF) inspired by PROPs and compilation to categories. The overall differentiation pipeline consists of first compiling the source language to UNF, then applying a simpler differentiation transform on UNF, and finally compiling back to the target language. UNF sequentializes the program to simplify tracking dependencies. Differentiation on UNF handles gradient storage and updates functionally. Compiling back leverages stored UNF information for efficiency. Together this provides an end-to-end functional reverse-mode AD transform with proven complexity and correctness guarantees. The modularity introduced by UNF enables simpler reasoning and optimizations at each stage.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper addresses the problem of performing efficient and correct reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) in a purely functional programming language setting. Specifically:

- Most implementations of reverse-mode AD introduce imperative features like mutable state even in functional languages, which makes optimization and reasoning about correctness more difficult. This paper aims to develop a purely functional approach.

- Existing functional approaches to reverse-mode AD often have poor performance compared to imperative implementations or require manual derivation of efficient derivatives. This paper aims to develop an approach that is both pure and efficient. 

- There is a lack of formal proofs of the correctness of reverse-mode AD techniques. This paper provides formal semantic models and proofs of correctness.

- Reverse-mode AD is typically defined directly on source languages, which can obscure the key ideas. This paper introduces a novel intermediate representation called Unary Normal Form to decompose the overall transformation into simpler steps.

In summary, the key contributions are:

1. A provably efficient, purely functional reverse-mode AD transformation on a simple array-based functional language.

2. Introduction of Unary Normal Form, a new intermediate representation inspired by categorical semantics, which simplifies reasoning about the transformation. 

3. Formal denotational semantics for the source, intermediate, and target languages using multicategories and concategories.

4. Proofs of correctness of the overall transformation by composing semantic equivalences between the languages.

5. Complexity analysis showing the transformed programs satisfy a "cheap gradient principle".

6. Demonstration of how the approach can be extended to more complex language features like conditionals and higher-order functions.

So in essence, the paper tackles the open problem of how to do efficient yet provably correct reverse-mode AD in a purely functional setting, using new semantic models and intermediate representations.
