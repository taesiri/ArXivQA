# [Hierarchical Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Graphs for Language-Grounded Robot   Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17846)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Classical robotic mapping methods focus on accurate geometry but lack semantic understanding of environments. Recent open-vocabulary mapping approaches enable richer semantics but struggle to represent large-scale, multi-floor scenes and abstract concepts beyond objects. This limits language-grounded navigation in complex environments.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper presents Hierarchical Open-Vocabulary Scene Graphs (HOV-SG), a 3D scene graph approach to represent multi-floor indoor environments. HOV-SG leverages open-vocabulary vision models to obtain segment-level maps, then constructs a hierarchy with floor, room and object nodes, each enriched with semantic features. This allows abstraction from dense maps while enabling prompting of a large language model.

Key Contributions:
- A pipeline to build hierarchical open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs from multi-floor RGB-D data and odometry. It achieve state-of-the-art semantic segmentation results.
- The scene graph structure represents floors, rooms and objects, with each node attributed by open-vocabulary features from CLIP. This enables language-based querying.  
- A cross-floor Voronoi graph that allows robotic navigation spanning multiple floors based on the scene graph.
- Evaluations on ScanNet, Replica and Habitat datasets show improved segmentation accuracy over baselines. Experiments also demonstrate successful object retrieval and long-horizon language-guided navigation in real-world multi-floor environments.
- Introduction of a new metric, AUC-top-k, to measure open-vocabulary similarity that works for large label sets.

In summary, the proposed HOV-SG scene graph approach advances language-grounded robotics by enabling efficient representation and navigation in complex multi-floor environments based on natural language queries. Both the segmentation accuracy and the real-world demonstrations showcase the efficacy of the approach.
