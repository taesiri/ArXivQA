# [Can ChatGPT Compute Trustworthy Sentiment Scores from Bloomberg Market   Wraps?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05447)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sentiment analysis is crucial for deciphering market news to gain predictive insights, but presents challenges in finance due to complex financial lexicon and multi-faceted emotions. 
- Existing sentiment analysis tools often struggle with context-specific outputs and converting scores into investment strategies.

Proposed Solution: 
- Develop a two-step ChatGPT based sentiment analysis approach to extract sentiment from Bloomberg market wrap headlines.  
- First prompt summarizes text into 15 key headlines. Second prompt classifies each headline as positive, negative or neutral. 
- Aggregate headline sentiments into a daily score bounded between -1 and 1, with properties like symmetry, neutrality, monotonicity.
- Compute cumulative sentiment scores over durations to smooth noise and enable analysis of predictive relationship with market returns.

Main Contributions:
1) Novel two-step prompting method to leverage ChatGPT's NLP strengths for sentiment analysis of financial news.
2) Introduction of daily and cumulative sentiment scores with useful mathematical properties.
3) Evaluation showing statistically significant correlation between sentiment score and future equity returns over short and medium terms, which reverts at longer horizons.
4) Demonstration of pattern robustness across major equity markets like S&P 500, Nasdaq, Nikkei etc through correlation analysis. 
5) Analysis of tradeoff between score lag and correlation intensity to determine optimal lookback for maximum predictiveness.

In summary, the paper pioneers ChatGPT based financial news sentiment analysis, proposes indicators that reveal valuable signals on market movements, and conducts a rigorous evaluation of their efficacy across markets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops a ChatGPT-based sentiment analysis approach for financial news to predict equity market movements, finding a statistically significant short-term positive correlation between sentiment scores and market returns that reverts to negative over longer horizons.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It designs a two-step ChatGPT based sentiment analysis extraction from Bloomberg markets wrap news. Specifically, it uses two prompts - first to summarize the text into headlines, and second to determine the sentiment score for each headline.

2. It proposes a sentiment score index to assess the ability of ChatGPT to assign sentiment to financial news. This sentiment score is validated by computing its correlation with future equity market returns.

3. It demonstrates that the proposed sentiment score reveals significant insights into market behavior and possesses robust predictive capabilities. Specifically, it documents a statistically significant positive correlation between the sentiment score and future returns over short to medium term, which reverts to a negative correlation over longer horizons. It also shows the validity of this correlation pattern across multiple equity markets, indicating robustness.

In summary, the main contribution is using ChatGPT for sentiment-based financial prediction, proposing a methodology to extract and validate a sentiment score from news, and demonstrating the predictive power and robustness of this score across markets.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Sentiment analysis
- ChatGPT
- Prompt engineering
- Two-step approach
- Cumulative sentiment score  
- Correlation analysis (Pearson, Spearman)
- False Discovery Rate (FDR)
- Financial indicators

The paper introduces a two-step ChatGPT based approach to extract sentiment scores from financial news summaries. It analyzes the correlation between these sentiment scores and future equity market returns across various indices and time horizons. Concepts like cumulative sentiment score, False Discovery Rate adjusted statistical tests, determination of optimal predictive horizon, and validation of robustness through equity market comparisons are some of the key ideas explored. The overall goal is to evaluate ChatGPT's capability for sentiment-driven financial prediction tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-step prompt design for ChatGPT to extract sentiment scores from financial news. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of breaking down the task into two simpler prompts compared to a single more complex prompt? 

2. The paper introduces a new sentiment score in Definition 1. What are some key properties this sentiment score satisfies? How does it differ from other standard sentiment analysis metrics?

3. The paper argues that using the raw daily sentiment score results in a noisy signal. How is the cumulative sentiment score proposed in Definition 2 useful in overcoming this limitation? What are some potential drawbacks?  

4. Figure 3 shows the cumulative monthly sentiment score over time. What insights can you draw from the patterns in this plot? How might it be useful in financial analysis?

5. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 evaluate the validity of the sentiment score using correlation analysis. What are some limitations of using correlation as a validity metric? What additional analyses could strengthen the validation?  

6. The paper finds high positive correlation between sentiment scores and near term returns, which eventually becomes negative over longer horizons. What theories or mechanisms could explain this dynamic?   

7. Section 5 introduces the notion of a trade-off between score lag and correlation strength. What key factors determine the optimal lag balance point? How might this differ across markets?

8. The robustness analysis in Section 6 uses statistical tests to quantify pattern similarity across markets. What are some limitations of the approaches used? What are some alternatives you might propose?

9. The optimal lag values for sentiment score differ substantially across the equity markets analyzed. What economic or financial factors might be driving this? Is further investigation warranted?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on equity market returns for evaluating the sentiment scoring method. What other financial metrics could be useful validation targets? Why?
