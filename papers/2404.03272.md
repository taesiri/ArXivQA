# [Cryptographic Hardness of Score Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03272)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for generative modeling, with score estimation being a key element. Recent work showed sampling reduces to having access to an oracle for L2-accurate score estimation. 

- This paper studies if score estimation itself can be done efficiently for interesting classes of distributions. Specifically, it shows that under minimal assumptions, L2-accurate score estimation is computationally hard, even when sample complexity is polynomial.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper establishes a statistical-to-computational gap for L2-accurate score estimation using "Gaussian pancake" distributions. These distributions are computationally indistinguishable from a standard Gaussian due to connections to lattice cryptography problems.

- A reduction is shown from distinguishing Gaussian pancakes from a standard Gaussian to L2-accurate score estimation with polynomial sample complexity. This implies score estimation requires stronger assumptions for computational feasibility.

Main Contributions:
- Formally establishes a statistical-to-computational gap for L2-accurate score estimation, which was anticipated but not proven. 

- Links hardness of score estimation to lattice cryptography and statistical query lower bounds via Gaussian pancake distributions.

- Provides positive results on sample complexity of parameter and score estimation for Gaussian pancakes despite computational hardness.

- Brings together latest advances in diffusion models and computational complexity of statistical inference to chart new research directions.

The key insight is that despite sample-efficient generative modeling reducing to score estimation under minimal assumptions, additional assumptions are necessary to enable computational efficiency of score estimation itself.
