# [Universal Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation by Mitigating Common-Class   Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11234)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The authors introduce Universal Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (UniSSDA), a new practical setting that lies at the intersection of Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) and Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA). 
- UniSSDA relaxes key assumptions of UniDA and SSDA: it assumes the target domain has a small subset of labeled samples (unlike UniDA) and allows for label space shift between source and target domain (unlike SSDA).
- A key challenge is that existing SSDA and UniDA methods suffer from "common class bias" in UniSSDA, where model learning focuses on classes common to source and target domains while neglecting target private classes not seen in source domain. This leads to poor performance on target private classes.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a pseudo-label refinement strategy to mitigate the reinforcement of common class bias during pseudo-labeling. 
- The strategy adds a supervised classifier head trained only on labeled samples. It uses this as a prior to refine the pseudo-labels predicted by the main semi-supervised classifier. 
- Refinement aligns the class distribution estimates between the two heads, followed by aggregation of their predictions.
- This prevents error propagation and drift caused by naive pseudo-labeling.

Main Contributions:
- First work studying the new Universal SSDA setup at intersection of UniDA and SSDA
- Show that existing SSDA and UniDA methods underperform on UniSSDA due to common class bias 
- Propose a simple and effective pseudo-label refinement strategy to mitigate reinforcement of common class bias
- Extensive experiments showing consistent improvement across datasets and model architectures
- Establish strong baselines for future research on UniSSDA

In summary, this paper identifies limitations of existing methods on the new UniSSDA setup, and contributes a pseudo-label refinement strategy to address the core issue of common class bias propagation. Experiments demonstrate clear improvement, outperforming prior arts and setting strong baselines for future UniSSDA research.
