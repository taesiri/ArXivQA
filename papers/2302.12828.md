# [SplineCam: Exact Visualization and Characterization of Deep Network   Geometry and Decision Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12828)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an exact (up to machine precision) method to compute, visualize, and characterize the decision boundary and geometry of deep neural networks with continuous piecewise linear activation functions? The key hypothesis is that by leveraging the theory of continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) spline networks, it is possible to directly compute a deep network's geometry without relying on approximations like sampling or architecture simplification.In more detail:- The paper aims to go beyond existing interpretability methods that rely on visualizing activations or finding closest points to the decision boundary. - It proposes SplineCam, which can exactly compute a deep network's decision boundaries and partitioning of the input space into linear regions.- This allows new capabilities like visualizing and quantifying geometry, comparing architectures, measuring generalizability, and sampling from the decision boundary.- The core enabling idea is that CPWL deep networks (like those with ReLU activations) are spline operators, allowing exact analysis and computation of their geometry. So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by leveraging spline theory, SplineCam can provide the first exact method to visualize and analyze the geometry and decision boundaries of common deep network architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the development of SplineCam, a method for exact visualization and characterization of the geometry and decision boundaries of deep neural networks with continuous piecewise linear activation functions. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Development of a scalable enumeration method that can compute the exact input space partition (linear regions) and decision boundary of a deep neural network over a specified 2D region of the input space.- Using this enumeration method to build SplineCam, which enables direct visualization of the network's partition geometry, computation of partition statistics, and sampling from the decision boundary. - Demonstration of how SplineCam can be used for model visualization, interpretation, comparison of architectures, measuring generalizability, and sampling from the decision boundary.- Providing quantitative analysis showing SplineCam's ability to characterize deep networks and compare architectural choices and training regimes based on the induced partition geometry.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the first provably exact and scalable method for visualizing and analyzing the geometry of deep networks with piecewise linear activations, enabling new approaches for model interpretation, debugging, and analysis.
