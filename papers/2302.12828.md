# [SplineCam: Exact Visualization and Characterization of Deep Network   Geometry and Decision Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12828)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an exact (up to machine precision) method to compute, visualize, and characterize the decision boundary and geometry of deep neural networks with continuous piecewise linear activation functions? The key hypothesis is that by leveraging the theory of continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) spline networks, it is possible to directly compute a deep network's geometry without relying on approximations like sampling or architecture simplification.In more detail:- The paper aims to go beyond existing interpretability methods that rely on visualizing activations or finding closest points to the decision boundary. - It proposes SplineCam, which can exactly compute a deep network's decision boundaries and partitioning of the input space into linear regions.- This allows new capabilities like visualizing and quantifying geometry, comparing architectures, measuring generalizability, and sampling from the decision boundary.- The core enabling idea is that CPWL deep networks (like those with ReLU activations) are spline operators, allowing exact analysis and computation of their geometry. So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by leveraging spline theory, SplineCam can provide the first exact method to visualize and analyze the geometry and decision boundaries of common deep network architectures.
