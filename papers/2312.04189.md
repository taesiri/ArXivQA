# [Joint-Individual Fusion Structure with Fusion Attention Module for   Multi-Modal Skin Cancer Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04189)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Joint-Individual Fusion with Multi-Modal Fusion Attention (JIF-MMFA) for skin cancer classification using both dermatological images and patient metadata. The key ideas are: 1) A Joint-Individual Fusion (JIF) structure that jointly learns shared features between modalities while preserving modality-specific features, outperforming regular joint fusion. 2) A Multi-Modal Fusion Attention (MMFA) module that mutually enhances the most relevant features between images and metadata using self-attention. 3) Evaluations on three skin lesion datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with JIF-MMFA achieving 2.7-3.5% higher balanced accuracy than prior methods. The results highlight the benefits of both the JIF structure and MMFA module, with MMFA consistently improving various fusion modules and backbones. Statistically significant improvements are shown over concatenation-based fusion and other attention mechanisms. Overall, the proposed JIF-MMFA framework advances multi-modal skin cancer classification through novel and mutually reinforcing fusion insights at both the structurally and attention levels.
