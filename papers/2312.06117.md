# [M3SOT: Multi-frame, Multi-field, Multi-space 3D Single Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06117)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes M3SOT, a novel 3D single object tracking framework that synergizes multiple input frames, multiple receptive fields, and multiple solution spaces into one model for robust tracking. M3SOT collects multi-frame point clouds as inputs to propagate target cues from historical templates to the search area using attention. It extracts multi-scale features through computation-free range sampling and transformer backbones to gather contextual information. Additionally, M3SOT sets intermediate supervision on mask and center prediction to enable asymptotic bounding box characterization during training. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: M3SOT achieves the best accuracy on KITTI and Waymo datasets while maintaining real-time efficiency. The simplicity, effectiveness and strong performance of M3SOT validates its capability in exploiting temporality, context, and hidden spaces for advancing 3D single object tracking.
