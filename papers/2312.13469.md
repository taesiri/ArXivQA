# [Neural feels with neural fields: Visuo-tactile perception for in-hand   manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13469)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
To achieve dexterous manipulation of novel objects, robots need spatial awareness which requires estimating the pose and shape of objects while manipulating them in-hand. However, current methods for in-hand perception mostly track known objects using vision and avoid situations with occlusion. There is a need for a more generalizable approach that can perceive unknown objects and handle occlusion during manipulation.  

Proposed Solution - NeuralFeels:
The paper proposes NeuralFeels, a method that combines vision, touch sensing, and proprioception to estimate the pose and shape of unknown objects while manipulating them in-hand. The key ideas are:

1) Represent the object shape as a neural signed distance field (SDF) that is optimized online from multimodal sensory input during manipulation.

2) Track the pose of this neural SDF using a pose graph optimizer. 

3) Handle occlusion by incorporating touch sensing from multiple fingertip sensors. Touch provides local shape information when vision is occluded.

4) Use a proprioception-driven policy to rotate objects in-hand, generating rich visual and tactile data for perception.

Main Contributions:

1) First demonstration of full simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with vision, touch and proprioception for dexterous in-hand manipulation.

2) Introduces a method to incorporate touch sensing directly into neural scene representations like Neural SDFs. 

3) Evaluates the role of touch in improving perception, especially in handling occlusion. Touch leads to low pose drift of 4.7mm and reconstructs object shape with 81% F-score.

4) Releases a multimodal dataset of 70 in-hand manipulation experiments in simulation and real-world for benchmarking visuo-tactile perception.

In summary, the paper presents NeuralFeels, a neural multimodal perception system for reconstructing and tracking novel objects manipulated in-hand. This is enabled by online optimization of a neural SDF with vision, touch and proprioception.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method called NeuralFeels that combines vision, touch, and proprioception to estimate the pose and shape of novel objects during in-hand manipulation by optimizing a neural signed distance field representation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is a method called "NeuralFeels" for estimating the pose and shape of novel objects during in-hand manipulation. Specifically:

- They combine vision, touch, and proprioception into an online neural representation (a neural signed distance field or SDF) that represents both the pose and geometry of manipulated objects. 

- They demonstrate simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for unknown objects, as well as robust tracking of known objects, using this neural representation and a proprioception-driven policy for in-hand rotation.

- Their method achieves final reconstruction F-scores of 81% on average and average pose drifts of just 4.7 mm on novel objects. Pose tracking is even more precise (2.3 mm average error) when object CAD models are known.

- They analyze the complementary roles vision and touch play, showing that touch helps disambiguate noisy visual estimates and provides critical information when visual occlusion occurs.

- They introduce a new visuo-tactile dataset called "FeelSight" with 70 trials of in-hand manipulation across 14 objects, which can serve as a benchmark for future work.

In summary, the main contribution is a complete system and approach for robust 6D pose tracking and 3D shape perception of manipulated objects using vision, touch and proprioception in a neural representation framework. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on this challenging problem.
