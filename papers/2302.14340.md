# [HelixSurf: A Robust and Efficient Neural Implicit Surface Learning of   Indoor Scenes with Iterative Intertwined Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14340)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to construct an inferential procedure for Granger causality in high-dimensional non-stationary vector autoregressive (VAR) models. More specifically, the authors aim to develop a method for testing Granger causality that does not require knowing the order of integration of the time series in the VAR model. 

The key points are:

- Granger causality testing is an important tool in time series analysis with many applications, but standard methods require knowing if the data is stationary/integrated. This is problematic as unit root and integration tests can be ambiguous.

- The authors propose a method combining lag augmentation (to avoid issues with non-stationarity) with a post-double selection procedure (to enable high-dimensional inference). 

- Lag augmentation is done only for the variable being tested as Granger causing, making the approach feasible in high dimensions.

- Post-double selection controls for omitted variables and prevents spurious regression, ensuring valid inference.

- Theoretical results show the resulting tests have asymptotic chi-squared distributions under the null, irrespective of integration properties.

- Simulations and an empirical application highlight good finite sample performance.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed lag-augmented post-double selection method will provide a way to perform valid Granger causality testing in high dimensions without requiring knowledge of the integration properties of the data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a method for testing Granger causality in high-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models that does not require knowing the integration/cointegration properties of the time series. The key aspects are:

- They use a lag augmentation approach based on Toda and Yamamoto (1995) where extra lags of the Granger causing variables are added. This provides asymptotic normality of the least squares estimators regardless of unit roots. 

- They modify this approach by only augmenting the Granger causing variables, making it feasible for high-dimensional VARs. 

- They combine lag augmentation with a post-double selection procedure to perform variable selection while guarding against omitted variable bias. 

- They show that the resulting post-selection OLS estimator is asymptotically normal uniformly over the parameter space, allowing for valid chi-squared inference.

- This provides a framework for Granger causality testing that is robust to unknown integration/cointegration properties of the data, avoiding issues with pre-testing and transformations.

- They provide conditions on sparsity, empirical process bounds, and restricted eigenvalues to establish the theorems.

- Finite sample performance is evaluated through simulations, and the method is applied to investigating the causes and effects of economic uncertainty.

In summary, the main contribution is a method for high-dimensional Granger causality testing that is robust to nonstationarity, removing the need for pre-testing or transformations of the data. This provides a practically useful framework for applied researchers working with many time series.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for testing Granger causality in high-dimensional vector autoregressive models that allows for unknown orders of integration in the time series by augmenting the lag length of only the variables being tested as Granger causing.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several important contributions to the literature on Granger causality testing in high-dimensional time series models:

- It proposes a new method for testing Granger causality that does not require pre-testing or knowledge of the integration/cointegration properties of the time series. This is accomplished through lag augmentation of the Granger causing variables, adapting the approach of Toda and Yamamoto (1995). 

- The paper shows how lag augmentation can be restricted only to the variables being tested for Granger causality. This makes the approach feasible in a high-dimensional setting, unlike previous methods that augmented lags of all variables.

- The paper combines lag augmentation with the post-double selection method of Belloni et al. (2014) to achieve valid post-selection inference. It appropriately modifies the procedure to prevent spurious regression with integrated processes.

- Uniform asymptotic normality of the post-selection OLS estimator is proven, establishing that standard chi-squared tests can be used for Granger causality in this framework. This holds irrespective of the presence of unit roots or cointegration.

- The paper provides practical recommendations for choosing the lag length and augmentation order in finite samples. It also proposes a method to data-driven estimate the lag length based on individual autoregressions.

Overall, this paper makes a significant methodological contribution by developing a Granger causality testing procedure that is robust to nonstationarity and applicable in high dimensions. This allows investigating Granger causal relationships in large datasets without requiring pre-testing or transformations. 

Compared to other related papers like Hecq et al. (2021), this paper is the first to consider Granger causality testing under unknown integration/cointegration orders in a high-dimensional VAR model. The lag augmentation restricts the parameter proliferation which enables feasible estimation. The adaptation of the post-double selection procedure is also novel. Overall, this paper nicely complements the existing literature on regularization methods for high-dimensional VARs and causality testing.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the method to allow for Granger causality testing between multiple variables or blocks of variables, rather than just the bivariate causality relations considered in the paper. The authors note this would require more involved notation and algebra but should be possible.

- Investigating the use of other variable/model selection methods besides the lasso in the initial selection steps. The lasso could potentially be replaced by other sparsity-inducing estimators.

- Considering ways to relax the exact sparsity assumption to approximate or weak sparsity. The current theoretical results rely on exact sparsity but the authors note approximations may be possible.

- Developing heteroskedasticity-robust versions of the tests, for instance using Eicker-White standard errors or modifying the LM test. This is noted to be straightforward based on existing methods.

- Deriving theoretical results allowing for a growing number of relevant variables, rather than the fixed/finite number currently assumed. This may require Gaussian approximation theorems or other tools to extend the results.

- Further investigating the choice of augmentation lag length $d$, in particular whether a higher $d$ than the $d=2$ recommended may be beneficial.

- Considering data-driven ways to select both the VAR lag order $p$ and augmentation order $d$, rather than just $p$ as currently done.

- Evaluating the finite sample performance of the method more extensively across wider range of data generating processes.

So in summary, the main suggestions involve extending the theoretical results to relax assumptions, broadening the methodology to wider settings, and deeper investigation into practical implementation issues such as lag selection and performance evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper develops a method for testing Granger causality in high-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models where the time series may contain unit roots. The key idea is to augment the VAR with additional lags of the variables being tested for Granger causality. This allows the variables to 'difference themselves' to the appropriate order, circumventing issues with nonstationarity. The method is combined with a post-double selection approach to allow application in high dimensions. Theoretical results are provided showing the uniform validity of the resulting tests. Simulations demonstrate good finite sample properties. An empirical application investigates the causes and effects of economic uncertainty, illustrating the importance of avoiding transformations to achieve stationarity which may remove predictive information. Overall, the paper provides a method to perform valid inference on Granger causality relations between potentially nonstationary variables in high-dimensional VAR models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method for testing Granger causality in high-dimensional non-stationary vector autoregressive (VAR) models. The authors' approach avoids needing to know the integration and cointegration properties of the time series. They augment the VAR model with additional lags of the Granger causing variable(s) being tested. This lag augmentation allows the variables to difference themselves to stationarity. The authors prove this transformation preserves the equivalence of testing the original and transformed models. They combine lag augmentation with a post-double selection procedure based on lasso regression to reduce the dimensions for inference. This allows valid post-selection inference in high dimensions. 

The authors prove uniform convergence and asymptotic normality of their post-selection estimator. This enables using chi-squared tests for Granger causality. Simulation results demonstrate good finite sample performance. The method is applied to investigate causes and effects of economic uncertainty using FRED-MD data. The results illustrate the importance of avoiding pre-testing and transformations, which can profoundly change results. Overall, this paper makes an important methodological contribution in enabling robust testing of Granger causality relations in potentially nonstationary high-dimensional time series.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is a lag-augmented post-double selection approach for Granger causality testing in high-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models with potentially non-stationary (integrated) time series. 

The key steps are:

1) Augment the VAR with additional lags of the Granger causing variable(s) to allow for unknown integration orders. This builds on Toda-Yamamoto but only augments the variables being tested rather than the full system to make it feasible in high dimensions. 

2) Perform an initial screening via penalized regressions (lasso) to select potential control variables. This is done in a double selection approach on both the outcome and Granger causing variables to prevent omitting relevant controls.

3) Estimate a second stage regression including the selected controls and test for Granger causality via LM or Wald tests. Lag augmentation ensures asymptotic normality of the OLS estimators regardless of integration properties.

4) Show that this post-double selection OLS estimator after lag-augmentation is asymptotically equivalent to the infeasible post-oracle OLS estimator, ensuring the validity of the asymptotic chi-squared distribution of the Granger causality tests.

In summary, the paper develops a method to perform valid high-dimensional Granger causality testing without requiring pre-testing or knowledge of integration/cointegration properties of the data. It combines lag-augmentation, double selection and uniform asymptotic results.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper develops a method for testing Granger causality in high-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models where the time series may contain unit roots and be cointegrated. 

- Standard methods for testing Granger causality require knowledge about stationarity and cointegration properties. The authors avoid this by using a lag augmentation approach based on Toda and Yamamoto (1995) that is robust to unknown integration and cointegration.

- They adapt this approach to the high-dimensional setting by only augmenting the lags of the Granger causing variable, avoiding parameter proliferation. 

- The lag-augmented VAR is combined with a post-double selection method to perform penalized regression and select relevant variables in two directions. This controls for omitted variables and allows valid inference.

- Theoretical properties are derived showing the OLS estimator converges uniformly to a normal distribution, enabling standard chi-squared inference.

- The method is applied to investigating predictive relationships between measures of economic uncertainty and macroeconomic variables. Different results are found compared to taking first differences.

In summary, the key contribution is a method to perform valid high-dimensional Granger causality testing without requiring knowledge about integration or cointegration properties of the data. This avoids pre-testing biases and loss of information from differencing.

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that integrating traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods with neural implicit surface learning can lead to more robust and efficient reconstruction of indoor scene surfaces from multi-view images. 

Specifically, the paper proposes that:

1) Using MVS predictions to regularly neural implicit surface learning can help capture fine geometric details. 

2) Leveraging homogeneity of superpixels in images can help handle textureless surface areas where MVS is unreliable.

3) Establishing dynamic occupancy grids can significantly improve efficiency of neural rendering.

4) Iteratively regularizing the learning of the two approaches in a "helix-shaped" manner leads to complementary benefits and overall improved surface reconstruction.

The key innovation is the iterative intertwined regularization between MVS and neural implicit learning, which enables capturing both global structure and local details in an efficient manner for complex indoor scenes. The central hypothesis is that this integrated approach can outperform existing methods on robustness, detail, and efficiency for multi-view indoor surface reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNet and Tanks & Temples datasets are conducted to validate the hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes HelixSurf, a new method for reconstructing indoor scene surfaces from multi-view images. HelixSurf integrates PatchMatch based multi-view stereo (PM-MVS) and neural implicit surface learning in a complementary way.

2. It proposes an iterative intertwined regularization scheme where the intermediate prediction from one method is used to regularize the learning/optimization of the other, in a "helix-shaped" optimization process. 

3. For textureless surface areas where MVS is unreliable, it proposes a scheme to leverage homogeneity inside image superpixels to regularize the implicit surface learning.

4. It proposes an efficient differentiable volume rendering scheme using dynamic occupancy grids, which improves efficiency by orders of magnitude over existing methods.

5. Experiments on ScanNet and Tanks and Temples datasets demonstrate that HelixSurf achieves state-of-the-art surface reconstruction quality while being much more efficient than existing neural implicit learning methods.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposed HelixSurf method that integrates PM-MVS and neural implicit learning in a complementary and efficient way for high quality indoor scene reconstruction. The iterative intertwined regularization and schemes for handling textureless areas and accelerating volume rendering are also important technical contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called HelixSurf for reconstructing 3D indoor scene surfaces from multi-view images, which integrates traditional multi-view stereo and neural implicit surface learning in a complementary way through iterative intertwined regularization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this CVPR 2023 paper compares to other research in the field of neural implicit surface reconstruction:

- The key novelty of this paper is the integration of traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods with neural implicit surface learning. Most prior work has focused just on one approach or the other. Combining them allows the authors to leverage the complementary strengths of each method.

- Compared to pure neural implicit methods like NeRF, this paper achieves significantly better reconstruction of details and completeness for indoor scenes. The MVS guidance helps impose geometric constraints that NeRF lacks. The results are state-of-the-art on benchmark datasets like ScanNet.

- Unlike some recent works that use auxiliary 3D data or pre-trained shape priors during training, this method relies only on input images. Not needing additional supervision is an advantage.

- The proposed efficient sampling scheme enables orders of magnitude faster training than prior neural implicit techniques. This improvement allows the method to scale well to large scenes.

- The focus is on robust indoor scene reconstruction. Performance on objects or outdoor scenes is not evaluated in depth. Generalization may be more limited compared to NeRF-based approaches.

- The iterative optimization approach between MVS and neural implicit learning is novel. Prior work either concatenates or pipelines the two strategies rather than intertwining them iteratively.

In summary, the key strengths of this paper compared to other neural implicit learning works are the efficiency and accuracy gains from incorporating MVS, the ability to handle textureless regions, and the unique iterative intertwined optimization approach. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art indoor scene reconstruction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the handling of textureless surface areas with significant curvature. The authors note that their current method assumes textureless areas are geometrically smooth, so it can fail on curved textureless surfaces. They suggest adopting more flexible geometric assumptions about curved surfaces to address these cases.

- Exploring more general and robust assumptions for identifying textureless areas. The authors' current method relies on the assumption that textureless areas have homogeneous color, but other cues could be used. Developing more generalized assumptions could make the method more robust.

- Extending the method to large-scale outdoor scenes. The authors show some initial results applying their method to outdoor scenes, but suggest more work is needed to handle the greater complexity and scale.

- Incorporating semantic information. The authors note semantic cues like object labels could inform the surface reconstruction, especially for things like furniture that follow common shapes. Leveraging this information could improve results.

- Improving run-time performance. The authors achieve fast training convergence, but real-time performance could enable more interactive applications. Optimizing run-time speed is an important direction.

- Validating on more diverse real-world data. The method was mainly validated on indoor datasets like ScanNet. Testing on more varied real-world capture could reveal areas for improvement.

- Jointly optimizing geometry and appearance. The current method focuses on geometry, but jointly recovering appearance details like texture could enable even better novel view synthesis.

- Integrating with other 3D tasks like segmentation. Combining reconstruction with higher-level 3D understanding tasks is an interesting direction for future work.

In summary, the main suggestions are improving the handling of challenging textureless areas, incorporating more scene priors and context, extending to new domains like outdoor scenes, and combining reconstruction with other 3D tasks - all to enhance the robustness and applicability of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called HelixSurf for reconstructing indoor scene surfaces from multi-view images. The key idea is to integrate traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) techniques with recent neural implicit surface learning methods in a complementary way. HelixSurf uses predictions from MVS to regularize the neural implicit surface learning, and vice versa, in an iterative intertwined manner. This allows it to leverage the benefits of both approaches - MVS is good at recovering geometry details in textured regions while neural implicit learning provides smoothness priors. The method also handles textureless regions by enforcing normal consistency within superpixels. Additionally, it uses dynamic occupancy grids to accelerate neural rendering. Experiments on ScanNet and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that HelixSurf achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and completeness while being orders of magnitude faster than other neural implicit methods. The integration of MVS and neural techniques in a tightly coupled iterative framework enables robust and efficient scene reconstruction.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called HelixSurf for reconstructing 3D surfaces of indoor scenes from multi-view images. The key idea is to leverage the complementary benefits of traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods and recent neural implicit surface learning techniques. 

The method works by iteratively using the intermediate predictions from one strategy to regularize the learning process of the other in an intertwined manner, forming a “double helix” shape optimization process. Specifically, the depth and normal predictions from MVS are used to supervise the neural implicit surface learning, while the learned implicit surface provides priors to improve MVS optimization in return. To handle textureless areas where MVS is unreliable, the method enforces smoothness by leveraging superpixel segmentation of the input images. The method also uses dynamic occupancy grids to accelerate volume rendering. Experiments on ScanNet and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that HelixSurf reconstructs high-quality surfaces efficiently, outperforming existing methods including those that use auxiliary training data.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called HelixSurf for reconstructing indoor scene surfaces from multi-view images. The key idea is to integrate complementary benefits from both traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods and recent neural implicit surface learning techniques. HelixSurf uses an iterative process where the intermediate prediction from one method helps regularize the learning/optimization in the other method. Specifically, the depth and normal predictions from MVS are used to regularize the neural implicit surface learning, while the learned depth and normal from the neural network provide priors to improve the MVS optimization. To handle textureless areas where MVS is unreliable, HelixSurf leverages homogeneity inside superpixels to smooth the surface normals. The method also uses dynamic occupancy grids to accelerate the differentiable volume rendering. Overall, HelixSurf aims to leverage the global optimization of MVS and the smoothness priors of neural networks in an intertwined, iterative fashion to get robust and efficient surface reconstruction.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of reconstructing indoor scene surfaces from multi-view images. It aims to recover fine details of the underlying scene geometry.

The key points are:

- Recent methods using neural implicit surface learning can recover smooth object surfaces well, but suffer when dealing with complex indoor scene surfaces due to the smoothness bias induced by the neural network priors. 

- Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods can recover geometry of textured surfaces by optimizing local pixel correspondence across views. But they fail on textureless areas.

- The paper proposes to combine the complementary benefits of the two methods by using each method's intermediate predictions to regularize the other, in an iterative intertwined manner.

- It uses superpixel homogeneity to regularize learning on textureless areas where MVS is unreliable. 

- It improves efficiency of differentiable rendering by using dynamic occupancy grids to skip empty areas during sampling.

- Experiments show it compares favorably to existing methods in accuracy and efficiency. It is orders of magnitude faster than other neural implicit learning methods.

In summary, the key contribution is an integrated solution called HelixSurf that iteratively intertwines traditional MVS and recent neural implicit learning in a robust and efficient framework for reconstructing complex indoor scene surfaces.

HelixSurf utilizes the complementary benefits of MVS and neural implicit learning through an iterative intertwined regularization scheme. Specifically, it regularizes the neural implicit surface learning using intermediate depth and normal predictions from MVS as guidance. It also regularizes the MVS optimization using the progressively recovered geometry from neural implicit learning as priors. To handle textureless areas where MVS is unreliable, HelixSurf leverages region-wise color homogeneity from superpixels in the input images. Moreover, HelixSurf incorporates a dynamic space partitioning scheme to significantly accelerate the expensive volume rendering process in neural implicit learning. Experiments on indoor scene datasets like ScanNet and Tanks and Temples demonstrate that HelixSurf achieves higher reconstruction quality than state-of-the-art methods, while having orders of magnitude faster training speed. The robustness and efficiency of HelixSurf stem from effectively integrating traditional MVS and recent neural implicit surface learning in a complementary manner.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes HelixSurf, a method that integrates traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) and neural implicit surface learning for reconstructing indoor scenes from images. HelixSurf uses the complementary benefits of MVS and neural implicit learning by regularizing one strategy with the intermediate predictions from the other in an iterative, intertwined manner during optimization. Specifically, HelixSurf uses MVS depth and normal predictions to regularize the neural implicit learning, and uses the neural implicit depth and normals to improve MVS predictions. For textureless areas where MVS is unreliable, HelixSurf leverages color homogeneity within image superpixels to smooth the surface normals. HelixSurf also uses dynamic occupancy grids to efficiently guide sampling during differentiable volume rendering. Experiments show HelixSurf achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality efficiently, outperforming existing MVS, neural implicit, and MVS-guided neural implicit methods. The intertwined regularization enables HelixSurf to leverage the strengths of both MVS and neural implicit learning.
