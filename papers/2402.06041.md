# [A Prompt Response to the Demand for Automatic Gender-Neutral Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06041)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Gender-neutral translation (GNT) is important for creating inclusive language technologies but there is a lack of dedicated parallel data to adapt MT systems for this task. 
- Existing MT systems are not suitable for GNT when used "as is".

Proposed Solution:
- Explore using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 for GNT by providing explicit instructions and examples to elicit neutrality.
- Compare GPT-4's capabilities to commercial MT systems (Amazon Translate, DeepL) for English->Italian translation.
- Prompt GPT-4 with different templates (contrastive, chain-of-thought) and shot examples (gender terms seen/not seen in the test set).

Key Findings:
- MT systems generate only ~3% neutral translations when used without adaptation.
- With prompting, GPT-4 produces 65-70% fully neutral and 15% partially neutral translations.
- GPT-4 generalizes well from few shot examples, even with unseen gender terms. 
- Best prompt configurations yield over 60% good quality neutralizations.
- Judging acceptability of GNT emerges as a subjective task with variability across human annotators.

Main Contributions:
- First systematic study exploring the potential of LLMs for automatic GNT.
- Extensive manual analysis revealing limitations of MT and capabilities of prompted GPT-4.
- Demonstration that GPT-4 can generalize after seeing just a few examples.
- Highlights challenges in evaluating quality and acceptability of automatically generated GNT.
- Public release of manually annotated data.

In summary, the paper shows that prompt engineering allows eliciting GNT from LLMs, while also highlighting remaining challenges around evaluation and subjectivity.
