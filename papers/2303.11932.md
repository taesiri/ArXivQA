# [Using Explanations to Guide Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11932)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

1. How effective are different attribution methods (Integrated Gradients, Grad-CAM, B-COS) and model architectures (Vanilla ResNet, X-DNN, B-COS) for model guidance using bounding box annotations?

The authors hypothesize that model-inherent explanations like B-COS will be more amenable to guidance compared to post-hoc methods like Integrated Gradients and Grad-CAM. They also expect B-COS models to produce higher quality explanations.

2. How do different localization loss functions compare in guiding models via bounding boxes to focus on relevant object features? 

The authors hypothesize that directly optimizing for attribution localization metrics like EPG with a loss like the proposed Energy loss will outperform other losses like L1 and RRR* in improving attribution localization.

3. Can model guidance with just bounding boxes improve accuracy by suppressing reliance on spurious correlations?

The authors hypothesize that guiding models to focus on object features inside bounding boxes will reduce reliance on spurious correlations in the data and thus improve accuracy.

4. How much annotation effort is needed for effective model guidance? 

The authors hypothesize that only a small fraction of annotated images (e.g. 1-10%) with bounding boxes is sufficient to significantly improve attribution localization.

5. How robust is model guidance to annotation noise and bounding box misalignment?

The authors hypothesize that the proposed Energy loss will be more robust to annotation errors compared to other losses based on its formulation.

In summary, the key questions are around comparing attribution methods, losses, and amount of supervision needed for model guidance using bounding box annotations to improve explanation quality and accuracy by suppressing spurious correlations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing and evaluating methods for model guidance using explanations to make models "right for the right reasons". Specifically, it proposes a novel loss function called the Energy loss and shows its effectiveness in guiding models to focus on relevant object features while ignoring irrelevant or spurious correlations. The key contributions are:

1. Comprehensive evaluation of model guidance on challenging large-scale multi-label classification datasets like PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. Prior work has mostly focused on smaller or synthetic datasets. 

2. Proposing a new Energy loss for model guidance that allows using coarse bounding box supervision while still focusing on object-specific features within the boxes. It is shown to be more robust to annotation noise compared to prior losses.

3. Demonstrating that model guidance can improve classification accuracy by mitigating reliance on spurious correlations, using the Waterbirds dataset as an example.

4. Showing model guidance can be effective even with very limited supervision (1-10% annotated images) and coarse bounding box annotations.

5. Systematic comparison between different attribution methods (Integrated Gradients, GradCAM, B-COS) and losses (Energy, L1, Per Pixel Cross-Entropy) for guiding models using explanations.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive empirical study of model guidance through explanations on real-world vision tasks. It proposes a new loss that effectively guides models using coarse bounding box supervision, and shows the utility of model guidance for improving performance by focusing on true discriminative features.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using coarse bounding box annotations to guide deep neural network models to produce more localized attribution maps that focus on relevant object features, rather than irrelevant features like background regions, through a novel energy-based loss function.

In short, the paper shows how to improve attribution localization using only coarse bounding box supervision during training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of using model explanations, specifically attribution maps, to guide deep neural networks to be "right for the right reasons". Other papers have explored using explanations for model guidance, but have typically focused on simpler datasets and tasks. This paper evaluates model guidance on large-scale multi-label image classification using PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.

- The paper compares several attribution methods, including Integrated Gradients, Internal Influence, Grad-CAM, and model-inherent B-COS attributions. Other work has tended to focus on a single attribution method like Grad-CAM. Evaluating multiple methods provides more robust insights. 

- The paper introduces a new Energy loss for optimizing model guidance, which directly maximizes the Energy-based Pointing Game (EPG) metric. Other losses like L1 and RRR loss have been explored in prior work. The Energy loss is shown to focus better on class-specific features compared to other losses.

- The paper studies the impact of guiding models at different layers, from input to output. Most prior work focuses on optimizing guidance at either input or output layers. This provides insights into how guidance varies across the network.

- The paper evaluates model guidance with limited annotations and noisy bounding boxes. Most work assumes full dense annotations are available. This makes the approach more practical in real-world settings.

- The paper shows model guidance can help improve accuracy by reducing reliance on spurious correlations, evaluated on the Waterbirds dataset. Most prior work has focused on improving localization, not accuracy.

Overall, this paper provides a more thorough evaluation of model guidance on complex datasets compared to prior work. The insights on attribution methods, losses, layers, annotation requirements etc. help advance research in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Evaluating model guidance on other complex vision tasks like segmentation and object detection. So far, model guidance has primarily been explored for image classification. Applying it to other tasks with richer supervision could be an interesting direction.

- Exploring techniques to make model guidance more efficient. Currently, model guidance requires computing attributions and losses for every class in an image, which adds significant overhead. Developing approximations to guide models efficiently with lower computational overhead would make the approach more scalable.

- Using model guidance to improve out-of-distribution robustness and mitigating reliance on spurious correlations. The experiments on Waterbirds in the paper show potential for this direction. More rigorous evaluation across distribution shifts would be needed.

- Exploring different forms of human supervision for model guidance beyond bounding boxes. For example, using language or interactive feedback to guide models.

- Evaluating model guidance when scaling up to larger and more complex models and datasets. The current experiments are on standard datasets like VOC and COCO using ResNet architectures. Testing how well the approach works for larger datasets and modern architectures would be an important next step.

- Theoretically analyzing model guidance to better understand its impact on generalization. Building theoretical grounding to explain why guiding models via explanations improves robustness.

In summary, the key directions are scaling model guidance to more complex tasks and data, making it more efficient, leveraging it to improve robustness, exploring richer supervision modalities, and establishing more rigorous theoretical understanding. Evaluating the approach on more modern and practical settings would be important future work.

The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of different methods for guiding deep neural network models to be "right for the right reasons" through the use of attribution maps. The authors evaluate different attribution methods (Integrated Gradients, Grad-CAM, etc.) and loss functions on large-scale image classification datasets like PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method for guiding deep neural network models to be "right for the right reasons" by optimizing the localization of their attribution maps to human-annotated bounding boxes during training. Specifically, they train models by jointly optimizing a classification loss and a localization loss that matches the model's attributions (computed via methods like Integrated Gradients and GradCAM) to ground truth bounding box masks. They compare various localization losses like L1 and a novel Energy loss inspired by the EPG metric, showing the Energy loss focuses best on class-specific object features. The models are trained efficiently by randomly sampling a single class per image per batch for localization. They perform extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets with various CNNs, showing the approach improves attribution localization metrics like EPG and IoU, sometimes even boosting accuracy. Key benefits are it works with cheap bounding box supervision rather than masks, shows robustness to annotation noise, and helps suppress spurious correlations.
