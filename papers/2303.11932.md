# [Using Explanations to Guide Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11932)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

1. How effective are different attribution methods (Integrated Gradients, Grad-CAM, B-COS) and model architectures (Vanilla ResNet, X-DNN, B-COS) for model guidance using bounding box annotations?

The authors hypothesize that model-inherent explanations like B-COS will be more amenable to guidance compared to post-hoc methods like Integrated Gradients and Grad-CAM. They also expect B-COS models to produce higher quality explanations.

2. How do different localization loss functions compare in guiding models via bounding boxes to focus on relevant object features? 

The authors hypothesize that directly optimizing for attribution localization metrics like EPG with a loss like the proposed Energy loss will outperform other losses like L1 and RRR* in improving attribution localization.

3. Can model guidance with just bounding boxes improve accuracy by suppressing reliance on spurious correlations?

The authors hypothesize that guiding models to focus on object features inside bounding boxes will reduce reliance on spurious correlations in the data and thus improve accuracy.

4. How much annotation effort is needed for effective model guidance? 

The authors hypothesize that only a small fraction of annotated images (e.g. 1-10%) with bounding boxes is sufficient to significantly improve attribution localization.

5. How robust is model guidance to annotation noise and bounding box misalignment?

The authors hypothesize that the proposed Energy loss will be more robust to annotation errors compared to other losses based on its formulation.

In summary, the key questions are around comparing attribution methods, losses, and amount of supervision needed for model guidance using bounding box annotations to improve explanation quality and accuracy by suppressing spurious correlations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing and evaluating methods for model guidance using explanations to make models "right for the right reasons". Specifically, it proposes a novel loss function called the Energy loss and shows its effectiveness in guiding models to focus on relevant object features while ignoring irrelevant or spurious correlations. The key contributions are:

1. Comprehensive evaluation of model guidance on challenging large-scale multi-label classification datasets like PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. Prior work has mostly focused on smaller or synthetic datasets. 

2. Proposing a new Energy loss for model guidance that allows using coarse bounding box supervision while still focusing on object-specific features within the boxes. It is shown to be more robust to annotation noise compared to prior losses.

3. Demonstrating that model guidance can improve classification accuracy by mitigating reliance on spurious correlations, using the Waterbirds dataset as an example.

4. Showing model guidance can be effective even with very limited supervision (1-10% annotated images) and coarse bounding box annotations.

5. Systematic comparison between different attribution methods (Integrated Gradients, GradCAM, B-COS) and losses (Energy, L1, Per Pixel Cross-Entropy) for guiding models using explanations.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive empirical study of model guidance through explanations on real-world vision tasks. It proposes a new loss that effectively guides models using coarse bounding box supervision, and shows the utility of model guidance for improving performance by focusing on true discriminative features.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using coarse bounding box annotations to guide deep neural network models to produce more localized attribution maps that focus on relevant object features, rather than irrelevant features like background regions, through a novel energy-based loss function.

In short, the paper shows how to improve attribution localization using only coarse bounding box supervision during training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of using model explanations, specifically attribution maps, to guide deep neural networks to be "right for the right reasons". Other papers have explored using explanations for model guidance, but have typically focused on simpler datasets and tasks. This paper evaluates model guidance on large-scale multi-label image classification using PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.

- The paper compares several attribution methods, including Integrated Gradients, Internal Influence, Grad-CAM, and model-inherent B-COS attributions. Other work has tended to focus on a single attribution method like Grad-CAM. Evaluating multiple methods provides more robust insights. 

- The paper introduces a new Energy loss for optimizing model guidance, which directly maximizes the Energy-based Pointing Game (EPG) metric. Other losses like L1 and RRR loss have been explored in prior work. The Energy loss is shown to focus better on class-specific features compared to other losses.

- The paper studies the impact of guiding models at different layers, from input to output. Most prior work focuses on optimizing guidance at either input or output layers. This provides insights into how guidance varies across the network.

- The paper evaluates model guidance with limited annotations and noisy bounding boxes. Most work assumes full dense annotations are available. This makes the approach more practical in real-world settings.

- The paper shows model guidance can help improve accuracy by reducing reliance on spurious correlations, evaluated on the Waterbirds dataset. Most prior work has focused on improving localization, not accuracy.

Overall, this paper provides a more thorough evaluation of model guidance on complex datasets compared to prior work. The insights on attribution methods, losses, layers, annotation requirements etc. help advance research in this area.
