# [PrimDiffusion: Volumetric Primitives Diffusion for 3D Human Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04559)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes PrimDiffusion, the first diffusion model for 3D human generation. The key insight is to represent the human body using a set of volumetric primitives - small volumes with radiance and kinematic information. This allows compactly modeling the articulated human topology while enabling efficient training and rendering. An encoder is designed to reconstruct the primitive representation from multi-view images in a generalizable cross-identity manner. The diffusion process is then applied on the primitive parameters to generate novel 3D humans. Compared to GAN baselines, PrimDiffusion achieves higher quality images and geometry. It also supports explicit control over views, poses and shapes. Notably, the primitive representation combined with decoder-free rendering enables real-time synthesis of 512x512 humans after the denoising is completed. Downstream applications like texture transfer and 3D inpainting can also be achieved without retraining. Limitations include modeling complex textures and animating loose garments. But overall, PrimDiffusion demonstrates the promise of diffusion models for 3D human generation through an efficient volumetric primitive representation.
