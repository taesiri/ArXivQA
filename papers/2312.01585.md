# [OCGEC: One-class Graph Embedding Classification for DNN Backdoor   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01585)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called One-class Graph Embedding Classification (OCGEC) for detecting backdoor attacks in deep neural network models. OCGEC converts model parameters and structures into graph data via a model-to-graph approach. It then leverages graph neural networks to extract discriminative features between benign and backdoored models and trains a one-class classifier based on the Deep SVDD objective to identify anomalies. A key advantage of OCGEC is that it only requires a small set of clean samples for training and makes no assumptions about the backdoor attack method. Extensive experiments on vision, speech, and NLP tasks under diverse backdoor attacks demonstrate that OCGEC significantly outperforms existing detection methods in terms of AUC score. Notably, it achieves over 98% AUC on multiple tasks while maintaining strong robustness. The authors also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the efficacy of the model-to-graph conversion and the joint optimization strategy. Overall, the proposed OCGEC framework sets a new state-of-the-art for practical backdoor detection with high effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability.
