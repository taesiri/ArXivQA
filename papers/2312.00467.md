# [Unfolder: Fast localization and image rectification of a document with a   crease from folding in half](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00467)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The authors present a two-stage algorithm called Unfolder for rectifying images of documents that have been folded in half. The algorithm first detects the hexagonal outer edges of the folded document. This includes identifying the crease line and ensuring continuity across the fold to avoid tearing content. The second stage applies separate projective transformations to each half of the document image to map them onto a flattened rectified output. 

The Unfolder algorithm is tailored to documents specifically folded in half and handles real camera-captured smartphone images robustly. To facilitate research, the authors created a new dataset called Folded Document Images (FDI) with 1600 annotated images, including 2, 3, 4 and 8 folds of documents on tables or held in hands. 

Experiments on FDI demonstrate Unfolder has the best recognition accuracy of 0.3-0.35 errors on twofold documents, outperforming neural approaches like DocTr and DewarpNet. Unfolder also runs quite efficiently, taking only 0.25 seconds per image on an iPhone XR and 0.11 seconds on a desktop CPU. The algorithm detects when images don't fit the expected folding model and avoids rectifying unsuitable cases. By handling a constrained but very common fold case effectively, Unfolder sets a strong baseline for the FDI dataset twofold subset.
