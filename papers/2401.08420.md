# [Ask the experts: sourcing high-quality datasets for nutritional   counselling through Human-AI collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08420)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have great text generation capabilities but can produce biased, harmful or hallucinated text, limiting their use for data generation in sensitive domains like healthcare. 
- Specifically, there is a lack of publicly available datasets for nutrition counseling, an important healthcare domain. Sourcing real-world nutrition struggles and supportive text from LLMs could be valuable but unsafe if done incorrectly.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present a case study on sourcing a nutrition counseling dataset through human-AI collaboration. 
- They combine crowdworkers, nutrition experts, and ChatGPT in a multi-stage process:
  1) Crowdsource ~2.4k real-world diet struggles from crowdworkers
  2) Nutrition experts help cluster and analyze the struggles
  3) Experts guide prompt engineering to reduce unsafe ChatGPT outputs
  4) ChatGPT generates ~97k supportive statements for the struggles
  5) Experts extensively evaluate the ChatGPT outputs for safety
- This results in the HAICOACHING dataset - the first expert-annotated, LLM-sourced nutrition counseling dataset.

Main Contributions:
- A methodology for safely sourcing LLM-generated text through human-AI collaboration
- The public HAICOACHING dataset with 2.4k struggles and 97k expert-validated supportive statements
- Extensive analysis showing ChatGPT's strengths (fluency, coherence) and weaknesses (hallucinations, unsafe suggestions)
- Guidelines for reducing risk in LLM data generation for sensitive domains
- Proof that while promising, ChatGPT cannot safely replace human expertise for nutrition counseling

In summary, the paper demonstrates an approach to overcome data scarcity in healthcare via human-AI collaboration, while also highlighting current limitations of LLMs that prevent their unsupervised use. The resulting dataset enables future research in this important domain.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a case study on sourcing a nutrition counseling dataset through human-AI collaboration by crowd-sourcing diet-related struggles from workers, prompting ChatGPT to generate supportive text, and having nutrition experts evaluate the safety of the text to create the HAI-Coaching dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents a case study on sourcing nutrition counseling datasets from large language models (LLMs) and humans through human-AI (HAI) collaboration. It details the process at each stage, from defining the actual content of the dataset, to sourcing it and evaluating it.

2. It presents HAI-Coaching, the first expert-annotated dataset for nutrition counseling, obtained through HAI collaboration. The dataset contains ~2.4K crowdsourced nutrition-related struggles and ~97K related supportive texts generated by ChatGPT. 

3. It provides an extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of the HAI-Coaching dataset, revealing both the strengths of ChatGPT like fluency and human-likeness, as well as weaknesses like generating useless text, harmful behaviors, and reinforcing dangerous stereotypes.

So in summary, the main contribution is the presentation of the first expert-annotated nutrition counseling dataset sourced through human-AI collaboration, along with a detailed analysis of the process and the dataset itself.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Human-AI collaboration
- Nutrition counseling 
- Dataset creation
- Prompt engineering
- Safety evaluation
- Crowdsourcing
- Expert annotation
- Harmful text generation
- Bias
- Hallucination
- Supportive text categories (reflections, comfort, reframing, suggestions)
- Topic modeling 
- Clustering
- Thematic analysis
- Dataset analysis (quantitative, qualitative)

The paper presents a case study on sourcing a dataset for nutrition counseling, which lacks public data, through a human-AI collaborative process. Key aspects include crowdsourcing struggles from workers, using LLMs like ChatGPT to generate supportive text, having nutrition experts evaluate the safety of the text, analyzing the dataset quantitatively and qualitatively, and identifying issues like useless or harmful text generation. The final dataset is called HAI-Coaching. So the core focus is on dataset creation, evaluation and analysis through human-AI collaboration in a sensitive domain like nutrition counseling.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What were the key motivations and goals behind proposing a Human-AI collaborative approach for generating a dataset in nutritional counseling? How does it aim to address the limitations of existing methods?

2. The paper defines several research questions (RQs) to frame the approach. Can you summarize the key aspects explored through each RQ? How do they break down the overall method?  

3. The requirement analysis phase involved interviewing domain experts. What were the main topics and concepts explored in these interviews? How did the authors derive the key elements of supportive text from the experts' inputs?

4. What were some of the key challenges faced in the automatic clustering of dietary struggles using standard NLP techniques? How did the involvement of human experts help mitigate these?

5. Can you outline the iterative process followed for prompt engineering with ChatGPT? What were some of the key prompt optimization strategies employed? 

6. The paper reports annotation agreement values during prompt engineering. What do these values indicate about the prompts and annotation process? How were disagreements handled?

7. What were some of the concerning behaviors observed in ChatGPT's outputs as per the qualitative analysis? How do the authors recommend mitigating the risks associated with such behaviors?  

8. The paper analyzed the generated dataset across several quantitative metrics. Can you summarize the key insights gained about ChatGPT's capabilities from this analysis? Were there any apparent gaps?

9. How was the concept of "safety" defined operationally for annotating the supportive statements? What complexities were involved in establishing a common understanding of safety across experts?

10. The paper provides some preliminary NLP applications using the dataset. Can you summarize the tasks explored and results obtained? What are some promising future directions for research using this dataset?
