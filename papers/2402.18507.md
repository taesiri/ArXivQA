# [Multimodal Learning To Improve Cardiac Late Mechanical Activation   Detection From Cine MR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18507)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Myocardial strain analysis from cardiac MR images is important for identifying regions of late mechanical activation (LMA) to guide cardiac resynchronization therapy. 
- DENSE MRI offers highly accurate strain quantification but has limited accessibility due to high cost and need for expertise. 
- Cine feature tracking (FT) is more accessible but has inferior accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
- A multimodal deep learning framework to improve LMA detection from standard cine MRIs, transferring knowledge from DENSE.
- Two key components:
   1) Registration-based strain prediction network - Learns latent motion features from cine images to predict myocardial strains, supervised by DENSE strains.
   2) LMA detection network - Predicts LMA using predicted strains from the first network.
- Jointly train the two networks for mutually improved performance.

Key Contributions:
- First work to leverage DENSE to guide analysis of cine images for LMA detection using machine learning. 
- Framework bridges the accuracy gap between DENSE and cine FT for strain analysis and LMA detection.
- Increases accessibility of advanced strain imaging by transferring knowledge to widely available cine images.
- Demonstrated substantially improved performance over cine FT and closer alignment with DENSE achievements.
- Shows promise for converging accessibility and accuracy in CMR strain imaging analysis.

The summary covers the key points on the problem being addressed, the proposed multimodal deep learning solution and its two key components, the key innovations of using DENSE to supervise cine image analysis, and the demonstrated improvements in performance.
