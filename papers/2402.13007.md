# [Improve Cross-Architecture Generalization on Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13007)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing dataset distillation methods are primarily model-based, where the synthesized dataset inherits biases of the model used, limiting generalizability to other models. This causes a drop in performance when evaluating distilled datasets on alternative model architectures.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a "model pool" concept during dataset distillation. This involves selecting models from a diverse pool based on a probability distribution when deriving the distilled dataset.
- Integrate knowledge distillation into the training process of the distilled dataset. Specifically, use a teacher-student framework to align predictions between models.

Methods:
- Model pool contains a "main model" (high probability) and other similar models (low probability). This allows convergence while improving cross-architecture generalization.  
- Knowledge distillation utilizes a ConvNet teacher model. Student models of different architectures are trained on the distilled dataset to mimic teacher predictions.

Main Contributions:
- Propose model pool method to improve dataset distillation generalization across architectures. Easily integratable with other distillation algorithms.
- Show combining model pool and knowledge distillation mitigates performance reduction when evaluating distilled dataset on alternate models.
- Experimentally demonstrate superior cross-architecture performance over baseline gradient-matching distillation.

In summary, the paper introduces two novel techniques - model pool and knowledge distillation - to address the limitation of model-based dataset distillation methods and improve generalization of the derived distilled dataset to new model architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a model pool method and knowledge distillation strategy to improve the cross-architecture generalization ability of dataset distillation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel methodology to improve the cross-architecture generalization ability of dataset distillation methods. Specifically, the paper introduces two key ideas:

1) Model pool: Selecting models from a diverse model pool based on a probability distribution during the data distillation process, instead of using a single model architecture. This exposes the distilled dataset to multiple architectures.

2) Integrating knowledge distillation: Applying knowledge distillation strategies when evaluating the distilled dataset on alternative model architectures, not just the one used during distillation. This transfers insights from a teacher model to other student models.

The combination of these two methods is shown through experiments to enhance the performance of the distilled dataset across a range of model architectures compared to prior dataset distillation techniques. This allows the distilled dataset to generalize better across architectures rather than being biased towards the specific model used during distillation.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel model pool and knowledge distillation approach to improve cross-architecture generalization in dataset distillation.
