# [Semantic Connectivity-Driven Pseudo-labeling for Cross-domain   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06331)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Semantic Connectivity-driven Pseudo-labeling (SeCo), a novel approach for enhancing pseudo-labels to facilitate robust domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. The key insight is to formulate pseudo-labels at the connectivity level instead of the pixel level. This allows capturing more structured semantics and simplifying the localization of category noise. Specifically, SeCo comprises two main components - Pixel Semantic Aggregation (PSA) and Semantic Connectivity Correction (SCC). First, PSA aggregates the speckled pseudo-labels into semantic connectivities by efficiently interacting with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). This interaction is conducted differently for "stuff" and "things" categories to ensure semantic precision. Next, SCC sets up a connectivity classifier and identifies noisy connectivities in a self-supervised manner based on loss distribution characteristics. The corrected connectivities then serve as high-quality pseudo-labels for domain adaptive training. Experiments across various domain adaptation settings (unsupervised, source-free, black-box) demonstrate that SeCo can flexibly and consistently improve state-of-the-art methods. For instance,  in unsupervised adaptation from GTA5 to Cityscapes, SeCo improves ProDA by 9.4 mIoU. The work highlights the promise of semantic connectivity for advancing pseudo-labeling techniques.
