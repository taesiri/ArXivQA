# [Mixer is more than just a model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18007)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Transformers have become dominant in various domains but their complex architectures have prompted reevaluation. MLP-based models like MLP-Mixer present an alternative by showing competitive performance with simplified architectures.
- Prior work has brought the Mixer concept to computer vision tasks but there is opportunity to adapt it to audio classification by mixing perspectives tailored to audio data.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Audio Spectrogram Mixer with Roll-Time and Hermit FFT (ASM-RH), which incorporates insights from both time and frequency domains of audio data.
- Propose RollBlock module to capture time-domain information by rolling data in place across time axis. Integrate between LayerNorm and FeedForward to enable Roll-Time-mixing.
- Leverage Hermit Fast Fourier Transform and its inverse to enable Hermit-Frequency-mixing that captures frequency characteristics. 

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate first adaptation of Mixer concept to audio classification tasks rather than standard channel/token mixing perspectives used in computer vision.
- Introduce RollBlock and associated Roll-Time-mixing to maintain integrity of time-domain audio information during processing.
- Introduce Hermit-Frequency-mixing to capture frequency domain characteristics crucial for audio analysis.
- Show superior performance over prior Audio Spectrogram Mixer and set new SOTA on RAVDESS dataset, validating efficacy of proposed mixing approaches tailored for audio tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is in tailoring the powerful Mixer concept to audio domains by developing new mixing perspectives like Roll-Time and Hermit-Frequency that align more closely with audio data requirements. Both structures and the overall ASM-RH model deliver impressive empirical performance across multiple audio classification benchmarks.
