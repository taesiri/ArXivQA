# [Transfer-Learning-Based Autotuning Using Gaussian Copula](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04669)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Empirical performance tuning, known as autotuning, is a promising approach to maximize the performance of applications on diverse HPC systems. However, autotuning can be computationally expensive as it requires evaluating multiple configurations of parameters by generating executables and running them. Transfer learning (TL) methods have been proposed to reduce this expense by leveraging data from tuning related tasks, but current TL methods are ineffective for few-shot tuning on new tasks as they require many samples to model the transfer relationship.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes the first generative TL-based autotuning approach using Gaussian copula (GC) to model the high-performing regions of the search space from prior data and generate high-performing configurations for new tasks. This allows a sampling-based approach to maximize few-shot performance. Key aspects:

- Use GC to model parameter distributions and codependencies. GC permits generative tuning via conditional sampling to focus on high-performing configurations.
- Enhance GC's ability to model distributions and mitigate limitations for autotuning through modifications like variable preprocessing and treating GC itself as the autotuner.
- Fit GC only to top performing data from source tasks to bias it towards high-performance. Use conditional sampling to transfer that knowledge to new tasks.  
- Provide probabilistic estimation of the few-shot budget needed for effective TL autotuning.

Main Contributions:

- First generative modeling approach for TL-based autotuning using GC. Enables rapid few-shot TL autotuning.
- Probabilistic estimation of success probability to determine necessary budget for quality TL autotuning results. First work to provide this for TL autotuning.
- Demonstrate new performance insights for Polybench and Exascale Computing Project benchmarks by utilizing few-shot autotuning.

The proposed GC technique is evaluated on several benchmark suites and compared to state-of-the-art autotuning methods. Results show GC can achieve high fraction of peak performance in very few shots and determine transfer budgets for large speedups over prior techniques.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:
