# [Introducing Rhetorical Parallelism Detection: A New Task with Datasets,   Metrics, and Baselines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00100)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rhetorical parallelism is a common and impactful stylistic device where phrases with similar linguistic features are juxtaposed. However, it has been rarely studied in NLP.

- Modeling parallelism could help with syntactic disambiguation, disfluency detection, style analysis, etc. But automatically detecting parallelism is challenging due to the diverse linguistic features involved. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the task of rhetorical parallelism detection (RPD). It provides a formal definition - parallel structures should be locally proximate and share linguistic features.

- Two datasets are introduced - one new (Augustinian Sermon Parallelisms) and one adapted from prior work (Paibi Student Essays). Detailed statistics and analyses are provided.

- A family of evaluation metrics is proposed, allowing assessment at different granularities of linguistic structure. An exact parallelism match metric is specified.

- Baseline sequence labeling models are developed using conditional random fields with neural network encoders. Novel BIO tagging schemes are introduced to capture parallel branches and their relationships.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the novel task of rhetorical parallelism detection
- Constructs a new Latin parallelism dataset and adapts a Chinese essay dataset  
- Develops flexible evaluation metrics at multiple linguistic levels
- Establishes baseline systems using modified sequence labeling architectures
- Achieves F1 scores around 0.4 on the strict exact match metric, showing promise

The paper makes an important first step toward studying parallelism and provides data, metrics and models to enable further research. Key limitations are the restricted language data and the simplicity of models. But overall it clearly defines a new NLP task and offers solid initial progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the task of rhetorical parallelism detection, providing new datasets, evaluation metrics, baseline sequence labeling models, and results showing F1 scores of around 0.4 on Latin and Chinese rhetorical parallelism detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is introducing the task of rhetorical parallelism detection. Specifically, the paper:

- Provides a formal definition of the task of detecting parallel structures (parallelisms) in text, including criteria like locality and linguistic correspondence. 

- Constructs two new datasets for this task - the Augustinian Sermon Parallelism (ASP) dataset of Latin texts, and an adapted version of the Paibi Student Essay (PSE) dataset of Chinese essays.

- Establishes a family of evaluation metrics for the task, including exact parallelism match and variants that provide partial credit.

- Proposes baseline neural sequence labeling models using LSTM, Transformer, and BERT architectures with novel BIO tagging schemes to capture parallelisms.

- Reports baseline results on the datasets, achieving F1 scores of around 0.4 on the strictest metric, showing the promise of the task and models.

In summary, the key contribution is formally introducing and establishing the task of rhetorical parallelism detection, including datasets, metrics, and models to enable further research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Rhetorical parallelism detection (RPD): The main task introduced in the paper, which involves identifying parallel structures in text that use repetition of linguistic features to achieve a rhetorical effect.

- Parallelism: The linguistic phenomenon of juxtaposing phrases or clauses that have the same sequence of features, used as a rhetorical device. Key aspects are locality and linguistic correspondence. 

- Branches: The individual spans of text that make up the parallel components. Parallelisms are sets of branches.

- Sequence labeling: The paper frames RPD as a sequence labeling task and explores variants of BIO tagging schemes to label branches.

- Datasets: The paper introduces the Augustinian Sermon Parallelism (ASP) dataset of Latin sermons, as well as the adapted Paibi Student Essay (PSE) dataset of Chinese essays.

- Metrics: A family of metrics is proposed to evaluate parallelism detection based on bipartite matching, with a focus on the Exact Parallelism Match (EPM) metric.

- Encoder-CRF models: The baseline systems use neural encoders like LSTMs and Transformers paired with a Conditional Random Field output layer.

- Results: The best models achieve approx. 40% EPM F1 score on the ASP and PSE test sets. Factors improving performance include BERT embeddings, BiLSTM encoders, and certain tagging schemes.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new task called "rhetorical parallelism detection" (RPD). What is the definition and goal of this task? What key elements make up parallel structures according to the authors?

2. The paper provides two new datasets for RPD: the Augustinian Sermon Parallelism (ASP) dataset and an adapted version of the Paibi Student Essay (PSE) dataset. How were these datasets constructed and annotated? What statistics describe their key properties? 

3. The paper establishes a general framework for evaluation metrics in RPD based on bipartite matching. Can you explain the key ideas behind this framework? What specific metrics are proposed and how do they differ in terms of granularity?

4. What tagging schemes does the paper explore for framing RPD as a sequence labeling task? How do they build off of prior work in named entity recognition and disfluency detection? What is the motivation behind additions like the M, E, and J tags?

5. Can you walk through the overall encoder-CRF model architecture proposed in the paper? What are the key steps and modular components? What design choices were made for things like unknown word handling and incorporating subwords?

6. What variations were explored in the architecture during the hyperparameter search experiments? What embedding, encoder, and tagging scheme options were found to work best on the two datasets? Were there noticeable performance differences between component choices?

7. The paper highlights parallelism-level errors as the biggest source of mistakes in the error analysis. What might be some reasons that detecting entire parallel structures correctly proved difficult? How could the model potentially be improved to address this?

8. One finding was that BiLSTM encoders outperformed Transformers on average. Why might LSTMs have been better suited for aspects of this task like predicting distance-based links between branches? How was the Transformer modified slightly from common implementations?

9. How was the data split among training, validation, optimization, and test sets? What heuristics and statistical tests were used to balance tag distributions across splits and verify their similarity?

10. What limitations or opportunities for future improvement does the paper acknowledge about the datasets, modeling decisions, incorporated linguistic phenomena, integration of related tasks, etc.? What enhancements or research directions are identified?
