# [Policy Space Response Oracles: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02227)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Policy Space Response Oracles: A Survey":

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of reasoning about and solving extremely large games, where traditional game-theoretic equilibrium computation methods are infeasible. These games arise in many real-world multiagent domains. To tackle such games, the paper surveys recent research on a framework called Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO).

Proposed Solution - PSRO Framework:
The PSRO framework combines ideas from game theory, reinforcement learning, and co-evolutionary algorithms. It maintains an empirical game model induced from simulations over a restricted space of strategies. This empirical game model is analyzed to obtain a meta-strategy profile. Each player then independently learns a best response against this meta-strategy profile, adding the new strategy to the empirical game model. This iterates until convergence.

Main Contributions:

1. Provides a historical context and genesis of PSRO, unifying ideas from planning, co-evolutionary algorithms and empirical game-theoretic analysis.

2. Identifies the strategy exploration problem as a core challenge in PSRO - how to assemble an effective and compact strategy portfolio to construct the empirical game model.

3. Discusses two main approaches to address this - by designing novel meta-strategy solvers (MSS) that compute the meta-strategy profile and by modifying the response objective (RO) function for the learners.

4. Highlights recent works that investigate the coupling between MSS and RO choices.

5. Discusses methodological considerations and new evaluation methods for comparing PSRO variants.

6. Surveys techniques to improve computational efficiency of PSRO.

7. Summarizes diverse applications of PSRO across security games, robust reinforcement learning, computer vision and more.

8. Lays out open questions around scalability, parallelization, equilibrium refinements, combining with subgame solving methods and large language models.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the PSRO framework, highlighting key research directions and open problems in this rapidly developing area.

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO): The main game-reasoning framework that is the focus of this survey paper.

- Strategy exploration: The key challenge in PSRO of assembling an effective portfolio of strategies to construct the empirical game model. Controlled via the choice of meta-strategy solver (MSS) and response objective (RO).

- Nash equilibrium (NE): A common MSS target used in PSRO. Can suffer from overfitting issues.

- Regularization: Techniques such as projected replicator dynamics that mix NE with exploration to prevent overfitting.

- Meta-strategy solver (MSS): Component of PSRO that extracts a target profile from the empirical game to guide strategy exploration. Choices include NE, correlated equilibrium, minimum regret profiles, etc.

- Response objective (RO): Objective that each player responds to/learns in PSRO. Can incorporate diversity metrics. 

- Regret: Measure of how much a player can gain by unilaterally deviating. Used to evaluate PSRO performance.

- Empirical game-theoretic analysis (EGTA): Analysis paradigm that underpins PSRO, combining game-theoretic reasoning with simulation.

So in summary, key terms revolve around the PSRO framework itself, the components that control strategy exploration, and measures for evaluating the exploration process.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper "Policy Space Response Oracles: A Survey":

1. The paper discusses using Nash equilibrium and its variants as meta-strategy solvers (MSS) in PSRO. What are some of the key challenges and limitations of using Nash equilibrium in large games? How do methods like projected replicator dynamics and regularized replicator dynamics address these limitations?

2. The paper talks about using minimum regret constrained profiles (MRCP) as MSS in PSRO to enable anytime performance. What are the specific properties of two-player zero-sum games that allow the computation of MRCP through regret minimization against a best response? Can similar ideas be extended to general-sum games? 

3. Rectified Nash is proposed in the paper as an MSS to expand the gamescape and enhance effective diversity. How does rectified Nash specifically work? What modifications need to be made for it to be applicable in general-sum games?

4. The paper argues that using the same MSS for both strategy generation and evaluation in PSRO can be misleading. It proposes using a fixed MSS like MRCP for evaluation across different PSRO variants. What is the rationale behind this proposed change? What are its limitations?

5. Parallel methods like deep cognitive hierarchy (DCH) model and pipeline PSRO are discussed for improving the efficiency of PSRO. How do these methods utilize parallelism? What are the key differences between them in terms of parallelization strategies? 

6. Transfer learning methods are mentioned in the paper for warm-starting the training of new best responses. What are the different ways transfer learning has been utilized in existing literature to reduce simulation costs? What factors affect the practical viability of these approaches?

7. The paper talks about usage of extensive-form games and mean field games as alternatives to normal form games in some PSRO variants. What are the key strengths and limitations of using extensive-form and mean field representations over normal form?

8. Alpha-rank is discussed as an MSS in the paper along with the need for a compatible preference-based best response oracle. What specific modifications need to be made in the standard PSRO framework to ensure convergence when using alpha-rank as MSS?

9. Evaluating the quality of meta-strategy approximation is an important challenge discussed in the paper. How exactly does the policy hull based population exploitability measure try to address this? What are its limitations?

10. The paper identifies scalability in number of players as an open challenge for PSRO. What specific issues arise from using a normal form representation when number of players is large? How can polymatrix games and game model learning potentially help address these?
