# [Policy Space Response Oracles: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02227)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Policy Space Response Oracles: A Survey":

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of reasoning about and solving extremely large games, where traditional game-theoretic equilibrium computation methods are infeasible. These games arise in many real-world multiagent domains. To tackle such games, the paper surveys recent research on a framework called Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO).

Proposed Solution - PSRO Framework:
The PSRO framework combines ideas from game theory, reinforcement learning, and co-evolutionary algorithms. It maintains an empirical game model induced from simulations over a restricted space of strategies. This empirical game model is analyzed to obtain a meta-strategy profile. Each player then independently learns a best response against this meta-strategy profile, adding the new strategy to the empirical game model. This iterates until convergence.

Main Contributions:

1. Provides a historical context and genesis of PSRO, unifying ideas from planning, co-evolutionary algorithms and empirical game-theoretic analysis.

2. Identifies the strategy exploration problem as a core challenge in PSRO - how to assemble an effective and compact strategy portfolio to construct the empirical game model.

3. Discusses two main approaches to address this - by designing novel meta-strategy solvers (MSS) that compute the meta-strategy profile and by modifying the response objective (RO) function for the learners.

4. Highlights recent works that investigate the coupling between MSS and RO choices.

5. Discusses methodological considerations and new evaluation methods for comparing PSRO variants.

6. Surveys techniques to improve computational efficiency of PSRO.

7. Summarizes diverse applications of PSRO across security games, robust reinforcement learning, computer vision and more.

8. Lays out open questions around scalability, parallelization, equilibrium refinements, combining with subgame solving methods and large language models.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the PSRO framework, highlighting key research directions and open problems in this rapidly developing area.
