# [Komodo: A Linguistic Expedition into Indonesia's Regional Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09362)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- There is a gap in large language models (LLMs) tailored for specific regional languages, with most advancements focused on English or languages with abundant resources. This is especially true for Indonesian and its diverse regional languages which lack linguistic resources.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces Komodo-7B, a family of 7 billion parameter LLMs designed to address this gap by excelling in Indonesian, English and 11 regional Indonesian languages. It consists of Komodo-7B-Base and Komodo-7B-Instruct models.

Key Contributions:
- Komodo-7B-Instruct achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and languages, outperforming GPT-3.5, Aya-101, Llama-2, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct and others.
- It demonstrates superior linguistic diversity, covering 11 regional languages not supported by models like Google Translate. This can help bridge educational gaps.
- The model is trained on a judiciously selected high-quality dataset spanning textbooks, colloquial language, translated data etc. Unique strategies like alternate parallelism are employed.  
- The vocabulary is expanded by 3000 words and efficiency optimizations like multiple-of-64 tokens are implemented.
- Extensive evaluations show Komodo-7B-Instruct excels in both generative and discriminative tasks across English and Indonesian languages.

In summary, Komodo-7B represents a crucial advancement in developing specialized, high-performing LLMs for diverse linguistic contexts, specifically focused on the Indonesian landscape.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Komodo-7B is a 7 billion parameter language model tailored for Indonesian and 11 regional languages, outperforming models like GPT-3.5, Llama-2, Aya-101, and Mixtral-8x7B in various language tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of Komodo-7B, a family of large language models tailored for Indonesian, English, and 11 regional languages in Indonesia. Specifically:

- Komodo-7B consists of two models - Komodo-7B-Base and Komodo-7B-Instruct. Komodo-7B-Instruct demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various tasks across multiple languages, outperforming models like GPT-3.5, Aya-101, Llama-2, and others.

- The model shows superior cross-language understanding between Indonesian, English, and regional languages. This can help bridge educational gaps by enabling direct translation from English to 11 regional languages. 

- The model supports more regional languages compared to Google Translate, which is currently limited to Indonesian, Javanese and Sundanese. This expands accessibility to diverse linguistic communities across Indonesia.

- The paper introduces optimized training techniques like vocabulary expansion, efficiency optimizations, and incremental pretraining that contribute to the strong performance of Komodo-7B.

In summary, the main contribution is the development of Komodo-7B - a family of specialized large language models that advance state-of-the-art capabilities for Indonesian and regional languages in Indonesia.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using alternate parallelism for teaching cross-lingual understanding, involving bilingual next-token prediction between English, Indonesian, and 11 regional languages. Could you expand more on how this bilingual approach specifically helps increase alignment between languages compared to traditional monolingual next-token prediction?

2. When expanding the vocabulary, the paper tested both developing a new tokenizer and simply including the top n words from the Indonesian vocabulary. Could you explain in more detail the differences you found between these two approaches and why the second method provided better fertility scores? 

3. The paper optimized the total number of tokens to be a multiple of 64, following recent work on efficient transformers. Could you walk through the technical reasons why this architectural decision improves computational efficiency during inference?

4. Figure 2 shows a noticeable grouping of words from the same class after 3 epochs of pretraining. What modifications were made to the loss function or training process to achieve this effective organization of semantic relationships?

5. When benchmarking English tasks, Komodo-7B-Base underperformed only on the GSM8k math dataset. Given that mathematical data was lacking in the pretraining corpus, what steps could be taken to improve performance on mathematical reasoning going forward?

6. The paper emphasizes Komodo-7B's specialized strength in Indonesian and regional languages. But could the model's techniques like alternate parallelism be applied to improve multilingual models for other language families as well? 

7. What quality control and filtering approaches were found to be most effective when curating the supervised fine-tuning dataset? Were certain methods like deduplication more impactful than others?

8. How exactly was the translation engine leveraged during dataset creation? Did it mainly provide Indonesian translations of English web text? Or were there other use cases as well?

9. The SFT dataset incorporates responses from ChatGPT. What value did you find in adding these synthetic responses, compared to solely using human-generated text?

10. Looking toward future work, what types of architectural modifications or training improvements do you hypothesize could push Komodo-13B-Instruct to surpass performance of models like GPT-4 across both generative and discriminative tasks?
