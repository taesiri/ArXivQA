# [Komodo: A Linguistic Expedition into Indonesia's Regional Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09362)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- There is a gap in large language models (LLMs) tailored for specific regional languages, with most advancements focused on English or languages with abundant resources. This is especially true for Indonesian and its diverse regional languages which lack linguistic resources.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces Komodo-7B, a family of 7 billion parameter LLMs designed to address this gap by excelling in Indonesian, English and 11 regional Indonesian languages. It consists of Komodo-7B-Base and Komodo-7B-Instruct models.

Key Contributions:
- Komodo-7B-Instruct achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and languages, outperforming GPT-3.5, Aya-101, Llama-2, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct and others.
- It demonstrates superior linguistic diversity, covering 11 regional languages not supported by models like Google Translate. This can help bridge educational gaps.
- The model is trained on a judiciously selected high-quality dataset spanning textbooks, colloquial language, translated data etc. Unique strategies like alternate parallelism are employed.  
- The vocabulary is expanded by 3000 words and efficiency optimizations like multiple-of-64 tokens are implemented.
- Extensive evaluations show Komodo-7B-Instruct excels in both generative and discriminative tasks across English and Indonesian languages.

In summary, Komodo-7B represents a crucial advancement in developing specialized, high-performing LLMs for diverse linguistic contexts, specifically focused on the Indonesian landscape.
