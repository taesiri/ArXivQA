# [Over-The-Air Double-Threshold Deep Learner for Jamming Detection in 5G   RF domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02645)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for detecting jamming attacks in 5G networks, with a specific focus on attacks targeting the 5G Synchronization Signal Block (SSB). The SSB is a critical component in 5G that enables device synchronization and access to network services. However, due to its predictable transmission pattern, the SSB is vulnerable to jamming attacks using even low-power equipment. Existing jamming detection methods rely on network metrics or received signal power, making them ineffective against "smart" jammers. 

To address this gap, the authors propose a double threshold double Deep Neural Network (DT-DDNN) model that operates solely in the RF domain for SSB jamming detection, without needing integration with the 5G network. The key contributions are:

1) A preprocessing stage that extracts salient RF features - PSS correlation peaks and energy per null resource elements in the SSB - to distinguish jammed signals. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to magnify these features and reduce training time.

2) A double DNN architecture with optimized double thresholds to accurately classify jammed cases even under high signal-to-jamming noise ratio. This significantly improves upon regular single threshold DNNs. 

3) Deep cascade learning in the second DNN to increase detection sensitivity by overcoming vanishing gradients during training.

Extensive simulations demonstrate a 96.4% jamming detection rate under very low jamming power (15-30 dB SJNR) compared to 86.0% for single threshold DNNs. The model generalizes well to different channel models, jamming types and test data from a practical 5G testbed. By operating solely in the RF domain without need for higher layer network data, the proposed detection system is readily deployable.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a deep learning-based approach using a double threshold double DNN architecture along with signal preprocessing to accurately detect jamming attacks targeting the 5G synchronization signal block by analyzing RF signal features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It utilizes over-the-air 5G signal features and does not need higher layer KPIs such as Block Error Rate (BLER), Bad Packet Ratio (BPR), throughput, etc. This enables the jamming detection module to be implemented independently in 5G networks.

2. It exploits salient features in the 5G Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) that are relevant to jamming signals through preprocessing of the received 5G waveform. Specifically, it employs PSS correlation, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and energy per null subcarriers in SSB. Log transformation is also applied to the extracted energy to better distinguish jamming signals from noise.

3. It implements a double-threshold deep learning structure to improve detection performance in high signal-to-jamming-noise ratio (SJNR) regimes and optimizes the thresholds. In particular, a double deep learning structure is proposed where the first DNN uses two thresholds at its output to determine uncertainties. A second DNN with deep cascade structure then decides on observations with high uncertainty where the UE experiences very low jamming power.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel double-threshold double DNN (DT-DDNN) jamming detection method that focuses on 5G SSB and works directly with over-the-air signals to improve robustness without needing integration with the 5G network infrastructure.
