# [Local Causal Discovery with Linear non-Gaussian Cyclic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14843)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing methods for local causal discovery rely on conditional independence relations and can only estimate a partially directed graph. They also assume acyclicity in the ground truth structure. However, real-world systems often involve feedback cycles. This paper tackles the problem of local causal discovery in the presence of cycles.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a unified framework for local causal discovery in linear non-Gaussian models, whether the underlying structure is cyclic or acyclic. The key idea is to leverage independent subspace analysis (ISA) to identify the equivalent local directed structures and strengths from the Markov blanket of the target variable. 

For cyclic models, the paper generalizes the ICA-LiNG method to the local context using ISA. It characterizes one specific ISA solution corresponding to the local mixing process. To address the indeterminacy of ISA, it defines appropriate "admissible" permutations and shows this leads to identification of the equivalence class of local cyclic structures.  

For acyclic models, the paper proposes an alternative regression-based approach inspired by DirectLiNGAM. The idea is to recursively identify local "leaves" from independent residuals. This enables unique identification of the local DAG structure.

Main Contributions:

- First work to tackle local causal discovery in cyclic graphs, with theoretical guarantees even in the presence of intersecting cycles  

- Unified perspective and analysis of acyclic and cyclic cases for local causal search

- Exact identification of local causal directions and strengths leveraging non-Gaussianity, in contrast to the partially directed graphs estimated by prior work

- Careful characterization and appropriate post-processing of ISA solutions for identification

- Regression-based alternative method for acyclic cases, with ordering idea similar to the ISA permutation  

- Empirical validation on synthetic data and real-world gene expression dataset


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for local causal discovery that can handle both cyclic and acyclic causal models by exploiting independence relations and non-Gaussianity, and establishes theoretical guarantees on the identifiability of the local causal structure surrounding a target variable.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the field of local causal discovery:

1. It proposes the first method to tackle local causal discovery in cyclic models, which are important for capturing feedback mechanisms but have been largely overlooked in prior local search literature. The method leverages non-Gaussianity and independent subspace analysis to identify equivalent local directed structures and causal strengths.

2. It provides a unified perspective and framework that encompasses both acyclic and cyclic cases for local causal discovery. The method offers identifiability guarantees for both settings.  

3. It introduces an efficient way to estimate the Markov blanket of a target variable, which serves as a starting point for subsequent local search. This is done by generalizing an approach based on inverse covariance matrices to allow cycles.

4. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic and real-world data, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed local causal discovery techniques. It is shown to accurately recover local causal structures with more precision in edge orientations than existing methods.

In summary, the main contribution is a principled and generalizable approach to local causal discovery that relaxes assumptions, allows cycles, and offers strong theoretical guarantees. This helps address limitations of prior work and expands the applicability of local search to broader contexts.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Local causal discovery - Discovering causal relationships related to a target variable and its Markov blanket, instead of the full global causal structure.

- Cyclic models - Causal models that contain feedback loops and cycles, as opposed to acyclic causal graphs. The paper develops methods that can handle both cyclic and acyclic cases. 

- Linear non-Gaussian models (LiNGAM) - Causal discovery methods that make use of linear relationships and non-Gaussianity assumptions for identification. This includes models like ICA-LiNGAM.

- Independent subspace analysis (ISA) - A generalization of independent component analysis (ICA) that relaxes assumptions and finds independent subspaces instead of completely independent components. A key technique used in this work. 

- Markov blanket - The set of parents, children, and spouses of a target variable that renders it independent of all other variables. A key concept for local causal discovery.

- Identifiability - Whether the true causal relationships can be uniquely recovered from observed data distribution under a set of assumptions. An important theoretical concept discussed.

- Stability - In dynamical systems or cyclic graphs, whether effects of initial shocks dissipate over time. The notion is used to characterize stable cyclic models.

The paper connects these concepts to develop the local ISA-LiNG method for accurately discovering cyclic and acyclic structures in a target's local neighborhood.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes both an ISA-based method (Local ISA-LiNG) and a regression-based method (Inverse Direct-LiNGAM). What are the key advantages and disadvantages of each method? When would you choose one over the other?

2. The Local ISA-LiNG method involves finding "admissible" permutations of the rows of the ISA solution matrix. Explain why this step is necessary and what makes a permutation admissible. 

3. How does the paper address the issue of causal insufficiency when only local variables are available? Explain the difference between ICA and ISA in this context.

4. The paper claims the proposed Local ISA-LiNG method can handle both cyclic and acyclic graphs. Walk through the identifiability results and explain how cycles are handled.

5. Explain the stability assumption made in Corollary 1 and why it enables unique identification of the stable adjacency matrix locally. What happens when there are intersecting cycles?

6. Compare and contrast the theoretical guarantees provided for the ISA-based and regression-based methods. What can each method uniquely identify?

7. The Inverse Direct-LiNGAM method involves an "inverse causal ordering" idea. Explain this concept and how it differs from the causal ordering used in Direct-LiNGAM.

8. Discuss the Markov blanket estimation procedure described in Section 3. How does it differ from existing methods and why is it applicable for cyclic graphs?

9. The paper defines an equivalence class for LiNG models. Explain what this means and why the class contains multiple members in the cyclic case but only one in the acyclic case.

10. One experiment involves a real biological dataset. Discuss how the proposed local causal discovery methods might be particularly useful in this application context. What are some limitations?
