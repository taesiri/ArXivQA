# [Making Large Multimodal Models Understand Arbitrary Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00784)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

In this paper, the authors propose a novel large multimodal model called ViP-LLaVA that is capable of decoding arbitrary visual prompts overlaid on images, allowing more intuitive human-AI interaction. The key idea is to directly composite visual markers like boxes, arrows, and scribbles onto the RGB image which is then fed into the model, eliminating the need for complex region encodings. Through this simple yet effective approach, ViP-LLaVA sets new state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring precise region understanding like Visual7W and PointQA, surpassing even models with specialized region modules. To spur research, the authors also introduce ViP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark assessing region reasoning across recognition, OCR, knowledge, relationships, math, and language. Overall, by enhancing model flexibility through visual prompting, this work enables more natural dialogue while advancing multimodal comprehension, instantiated by ViP-LLaVA's strong quantitative results and intuitive qualitative responses. Code, data, and models are publicly released.
