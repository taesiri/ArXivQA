# [Trajectory Planning of Robotic Manipulator in Dynamic Environment   Exploiting DRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16652)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on trajectory planning for robotic manipulators operating in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. The key challenges are dealing with unknown dynamics and unpredictable movement of obstacles within the robot's operative space. The goal is to accomplish pick-and-place tasks collision-free while minimizing joint velocities/positions.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), specifically the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, to learn optimal trajectories. The method is evaluated on a simulated 7-DOF Fetch robotic arm in two scenarios: 1) reaching randomly placed targets with no obstacles, and 2) reaching randomly placed targets while avoiding randomly moving obstacles and collisions. 

The DDPG agent receives the robot's sensor states like end-effector position and obstacle position. It controls the robot by outputting incremental displacements in end-effector Cartesian coordinates, which are converted to joint positions. Reward functions for both sparse (binary) and dense (based on distance metrics) formulations are tested. The underlying optimization objective is to minimize velocity while satisfying constraints.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of trajectory planning for manipulators as a reinforcement learning problem with constraints 
- Testing of DDPG with sparse and dense rewards in complex obstacle avoidance scenarios
- Demonstration of faster convergence and better test performance with sparse rewards
- Analysis of training loss curves providing insights into model learning under different reward formulations
- Simulation-based evaluation confirming the capability to learn optimal and collision-free trajectories in dynamic environments

The work shows promise for using DRL in complex trajectory planning problems for robots operating alongside humans, with applications such as manufacturing and surgery. Key future work is to address dynamically appearing obstacles and combine DRL with graph neural networks or model predictive control.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning based approach for trajectory planning of a 7-DOF robotic manipulator to pick and place objects while avoiding randomly moving obstacles in an unknown environment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for trajectory planning of a robotic manipulator in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. Specifically:

- They apply the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for trajectory planning to pick and place a block while avoiding randomly moving obstacles. 

- They compare the efficiency of models trained with sparse and dense rewards in scenarios with and without obstacles. 

- Key results show that with sparse rewards, the DDPG agent is able to effectively learn to accomplish the task with fewer episodes and outperforms the model trained with dense rewards. 

- In the obstacle scenario, the model with sparse rewards converges better and achieves a 71.8% success rate in picking the block and avoiding collisions over 100,000 test cases.

So in summary, the main contribution is using DRL/DDPG for robotic trajectory planning and demonstrating that sparse rewards allow more efficient training to accomplish complex manipulation tasks in dynamic environments compared to dense reward formulations.
