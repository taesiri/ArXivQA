## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of techniques for visualizing trust in machine learning systems from 2007 up until early 2023. Specifically, it summarizes 420 papers on this topic published over the past 15+ years, highlighting trends and providing quantitative analysis across various categories related to domains of application, machine learning methods, visualization and interaction techniques, evaluation methods, and intended audiences. The paper provides a structured taxonomy for classifying trust visualization techniques and uses this to systematically analyze the literature. It also identifies opportunities and challenges for future research in this area. Overall, the survey aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview to support advancements in techniques for visualizing trust in machine learning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The survey summarizes hundreds of visualization techniques for machine learning interpretability and trustworthiness. What were the key criteria and methodology used to select which techniques to include in the survey? How was the categorization scheme devised?

2) The survey uses an extensive coding scheme with dozens of categories spanning domains, algorithms, visualization types, interaction mechanisms, and evaluation methods. What was the process for developing this scheme and ensuring consistent coding across techniques? 

3) One interesting finding is the lack of techniques focusing on fairness, accountability, and transparency compared to performance-related goals. Why do you think this discrepancy exists and how can researchers address it going forward?

4) The survey highlights a number of research gaps and open challenges in visualization for ML interpretability and trust. Which of those gaps seem most pressing and how can the field make progress on them?

5) The survey structure allows for temporal analysis of publication trends. What key patterns emerge over time and what hypotheses might explain the evolution of this research area? 

6) The survey cites over 500 papers spanning many venues and disciplines. What methodology was used for the literature search, screening, and selection process? What inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied?

7) What are some key limitations of the survey methodology and how might future work address them to enable an updated analysis?

8) The survey focuses specifically on visualization techniques. How well do you think the current state of visualization research maps to the broader ecosystem of techniques for ML interpretability and trust? 

9) What barriers exist to real-world deployment of these visualization tools and how can researchers and practitioners overcome them through human-centered design?

10) The survey highlights the importance of benchmark task and usage evaluations. What specific benchmarks and evaluation protocols would you recommend researchers prioritize to advance visualization capabilities and adoption?
