# [Convergence Analysis of Mean Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08463)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The mean shift (MS) algorithm is used in applications like clustering and mode estimation, but its convergence properties are not well understood for many commonly used kernels beyond the Epanechnikov kernel or analytic kernels. 
- Specifically, there is limited theory on whether the mode estimate sequence generated by the MS algorithm converges, and if so, what convergence rate it achieves. This is an important theoretical gap since the algorithm's performance depends on its convergence properties.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides a novel convergence analysis that applies to MS algorithms using a wider class of kernels, including important piecewise polynomial kernels like the biweight kernel. 
- The analysis relies on the Łojasiewicz inequality and arguments involving subanalytic functions to quantify the flatness of the kernel density estimate (KDE) near critical points. This allows transferring convergence results of the KDE value sequence to the mode estimate sequence.

Main Contributions:
- Provides first convergence guarantee for MS algorithm with useful non-analytic kernels like biweight kernel, without assumptions on bandwidth, Hessian non-degeneracy or number of critical points (Theorem 3).
- Establishes convergence rate bounds linked to the Łojasiewicz exponent that apply even when KDE Hessian at convergence point is degenerate (Theorem 4). 
- For piecewise polynomial kernels, gives an upper bound on Łojasiewicz exponent and thereby a worst-case convergence rate estimate (Theorem 5).
- Results significantly expand the applicability of theoretical performance guarantees for the MS algorithm.

In summary, the paper addresses an important gap in understanding the convergence properties of the widely used MS algorithm by leveraging ideas from optimization theory and semialgebraic geometry. The theoretical results provided are useful both in applied settings and for further analysis of the algorithm.
