# [NoMIRACL: Knowing When You Don't Know for Robust Multilingual   Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11361)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) uses a retrieval system to ground an LLM's output in factual knowledge and reduce hallucinations. However, errors from the retrieval stage can mislead the LLM.
- Prior work lacks comprehensive LLM robustness evaluation across diverse languages when provided noisy retrieved passages.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce NoMIRACL, a dataset for evaluating LLM robustness across 18 typologically diverse languages when provided noisy retrieved Wikipedia passages.
- NoMIRACL contains a non-relevant subset (all passages manually labeled as non-relevant) and a relevant subset (at least one passage manually labeled as relevant).

Metrics:
- Hallucination rate - measures tendency to hallucinate an answer using non-relevant passages. 
- Error rate - measures failure to identify a relevant, answerable passage.

Contributions:
- Establish multilingual NoMIRACL dataset with non-relevant and relevant subsets.
- Provide GPT-4 baseline trained on NoMIRACL. GPT-4 struggles with high 33.2% hallucination rate on non-relevant subset.
- Observe positive correlation between hallucination rate and language resource size.
- Enable future research towards improving LLM robustness against noisy retrieved passages across languages.

In summary, the paper introduces NoMIRACL to evaluate and improve LLM robustness in handling errors from the retrieval stage across diverse languages. The analysis using GPT-4 reveals challenges for LLMs in reliably detecting non-relevant passages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces NoMIRACL, a new multilingual dataset for evaluating the robustness of large language models against errors in the retrieved passages provided to them in retrieval-augmented generation setups across 18 diverse languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of NoMIRACL, a new multilingual dataset for evaluating the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Specifically:

- NoMIRACL contains queries in 18 diverse languages, with two subsets: a "non-relevant" subset where all retrieved passages are judged non-relevant, and a "relevant" subset where at least one passage is relevant.

- The dataset enables evaluating two key robustness metrics: the hallucination rate (the rate at which the LLM wrongly answers queries that have no answer based on the retrieved passages) and the error rate (the rate at which the LLM fails to identify a relevant passage that contains the answer). 

- A GPT-4 baseline is provided that achieves a high 33.2% average hallucination rate on the non-relevant subset and a 14.9% error rate on the relevant subset, demonstrating the challenge for state-of-the-art LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is the new NoMIRACL dataset for evaluating and hopefully improving LLM robustness in handling incorrect or non-relevant retrieved passages across diverse languages in RAG systems.

The paper introduces NoMIRACL, a new multilingual dataset for evaluating the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. The goal is to assess whether LLMs can distinguish between relevant and non-relevant retrieved passages when generating answers. The dataset contains queries in 18 languages, split into "non-relevant" subsets where no passages contain the answer, and "relevant" subsets where at least one passage is relevant. Robustness is evaluated by calculating the model's hallucination rate (on non-relevant subsets) and error rate (on relevant subsets). The authors provide a GPT-4 baseline evaluated in a closed-book, zero-shot prompting setup. Key goals are reducing hallucination rates and errors in determining passage relevance across languages.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called NoMIRACL to evaluate the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). How is the dataset constructed and what are its key characteristics?

2. NoMIRACL contains a non-relevant and a relevant subset. What is the difference between these two subsets and what is the rationale behind having two separate subsets?

3. The paper proposes two metrics - hallucination rate and error rate - to evaluate LLM robustness. Explain these metrics in detail and how they capture different aspects of robustness. 

4. What is the prompting strategy used to evaluate the GPT-4 baseline model on NoMIRACL? Discuss the rationale behind using a simple zero-shot prompting approach.

5. The GPT-4 model shows higher hallucination rates on high-resource languages in the non-relevant subset. What underlying reasons could explain this correlation between hallucination rate and language resource size?

6. Error rates are lower than hallucination rates for GPT-4 on the NoMIRACL dataset. What does this indicate about the model's ability to identify relevant versus non-relevant passages?

7. How exactly is the first-stage retrieval performed to obtain passages for the queries in NoMIRACL? Explain the hybrid retrieval setup used.

8. What measures are taken in the paper to reduce the cost of running experiments with the GPT-4 model API? Discuss the tradeoffs. 

9. Beyond the GPT-4 baseline, what other types of models or prompting strategies could be evaluated on NoMIRACL as future work?

10. How does the goal of NoMIRACL differ from existing unanswerable question datasets in question answering? What unique challenges does it aim to capture?
