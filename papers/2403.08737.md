# [ILCiteR: Evidence-grounded Interpretable Local Citation Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08737)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing machine learning approaches for local citation recommendation directly map a query (typically a claim or entity mention) to citation-worthy papers. This makes it difficult to explain why a specific paper should be cited for the query, limiting interpretability. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors introduce a new task called "evidence-grounded local citation recommendation". The key idea is to retrieve evidence spans from existing literature that are similar to the query and cite relevant papers. This provides an explanation for each recommended paper. 

The proposed system, ILCiteR, works as follows:
1) Build an evidence database mapping evidence spans to cited papers and their citation counts. 
2) For a query, retrieve candidate evidence spans using lexical similarity.
3) Re-rank evidence spans using a conditional neural rank ensemble technique that utilizes semantic similarity for longer queries.  
4) Recommend papers grounded in the re-ranked evidence spans, considering span relevance, paper citations and recency.

Thus each recommended paper is paired with an evidence span to explain why it is relevant for the query. ILCiteR uses no explicit training, relying on pre-trained language models and distant supervision from the dynamic evidence database.

Contributions:
1) Introduce evidence-grounded citation recommendation task for interpretability
2) Release dataset with 200K evidence spans, cited papers and citation counts
3) Propose distantly supervised system ILCiteR needing no training
4) Demonstrate improved performance with conditional neural rank ensembling approach

In summary, the paper focuses on improving the interpretability of local citation recommendation by grounding recommendations in evidence spans. The proposed approach and dataset advance machine understanding of scientific literature.
