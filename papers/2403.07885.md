# [MOD-CL: Multi-label Object Detection with Constrained Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07885)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Object detection is critical for autonomous driving systems, but needs to identify object actions and satisfy requirements on outputs. 
- Existing object detection models like YOLOv8 only support single labels per bounding box. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce MOD-CL, a multi-label object detection framework that utilizes constrained losses to produce outputs satisfying given requirements.  
- Develop MOD_YOLO based on YOLOv8 to support multiple labels per bounding box using one-hot encodings and modifications to NMS algorithm focusing on agent labels.

Main Contributions:

Task 1 (Limited Labeled Data)
- Propose semi-supervised learning method with Corrector and Blender models. 
- Corrector model trained unsupervised on unlabeled data to satisfy requirements. Blender model combines predictions.
- Achieves improved frame mAP demonstrating effectiveness for utilizing unlabeled data.

Task 2 (Constrained Output Labels)
- Incorporate constrained loss into MOD_YOLO architecture using Product T-Norm.
- Use MaxSAT solver post training to guarantee output labels satisfy requirements.
- Significantly boosts precision, recall and F1 score, showing importance of learning constraints for constrained outputs.

Overall, the paper introduces an effective framework MOD-CL for multi-label detection that can handle constrained outputs, using modifications to state-of-the-art YOLOv8 with constrained losses and semi-supervised learning. Key results demonstrate improved satisfaction of requirements and metrics on object detection.
