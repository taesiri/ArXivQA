# [General Phrase Debiaser: Debiasing Masked Language Models at a   Multi-Token Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13892)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new automatic multi-token debiasing pipeline called General Phrase Debiaser to mitigate gender biases in masked language models (MLMs) like BERT at the phrase level. The method has two main stages - a Phrase Filter Stage that extracts likely biased phrases from Wikipedia using the MLM itself along with some seed stereotypical terms, and a Model Debias Stage. The latter finds cloze-style prompts that trigger high disagreement between genders in generating stereotypical phrases using a novel multi-token Jensen-Shannon divergence loss. It then fine-tunes the entire MLM on only these biased prompts and phrases to reduce distribution discrepancy. Experiments on BERT, ALBERT and DistilBERT models demonstrate state-of-the-art debiasing on the Sentence Embedding Association Test (SEAT) benchmark, reducing scores from 0.35, 0.72 and 0.79 originally to 0.12, 0.16 and 0.52 respectively. The strengths are debiasing simultaneously on multiple domains like career and disciplines, operating at the more challenging phrase level, and maintaining language capabilities as measured by GLUE tests. The concept of automatically extracting biases and prompts from the model itself, followed by targeted fine-tuning shows promise for reducing social biases.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an automatic multi-token debiasing pipeline called General Phrase Debiaser that mitigates phrase-level biases in masked language models by generating stereotypical phrases from Wikipedia, searching for biased prompts that trigger the model's biases, and fine-tuning the model using those prompts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of their work on the proposed General Phrase Debiaser method are:

1) Unlike existing methods, they debias masked language models (MLMs) at the phrase granularity instead of just the word level. They automatically extract stereotypical phrases from Wikipedia pages to reduce the cost of manually constructing phrase lists.

2) They propose a multi-token debias head that can search for "discriminative" prompts that have the highest disagreement in generating stereotypical phrases across demographic groups. These prompts are then used to fine-tune the MLM. 

3) Compared to prior work, their debiasing approach derives loss from the stereotypical phrases rather than the entire vocabulary. This allows their method to adjust model parameters more specifically without affecting gender-independent words or knowledge.

4) They achieve state-of-the-art performance on debiasing MLMs like BERT, ALBERT and DistilBERT on standard datasets and metrics like the Sentence Embedding Association Test. Their method significantly reduces gender biases in careers and multiple disciplines while maintaining language modeling performance.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of an automatic multi-token debiasing pipeline that can mitigate phrase-level biases in masked language models across multiple domains, outperforming prior debiasing approaches.

The paper proposes an automatic multi-token debiasing pipeline called "General Phrase Debiaser" that aims to mitigate phrase-level biases in masked language models like BERT. It uses Wikipedia to filter out stereotypical phrases and then searches for biased prompts to fine-tune the models. The method is evaluated on debiasing benchmarks like SEAT and on language capability benchmarks like GLUE. So the key terms reflect this focus on phrase-level and multi-token debiasing of language models using automatic methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage pipeline consisting of a phrase filter stage and a model debias stage. What is the motivation behind having these two separate stages instead of a single end-to-end debiasing approach? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this two-stage design?

2. In the phrase filter stage, hyperlinks from Wikipedia pages are used to extract stereotypical phrases. What properties of Wikipedia hyperlinks make this a reasonable data source? What potential issues or limitations might arise from using Wikipedia hyperlinks in this way? 

3. The paper computes phrase embeddings by averaging token embeddings obtained using sentence templates from the SEAT benchmark. What is the rationale behind using sentence templates rather than computing embeddings directly on the phrases? What impact could the choice of templates have?

4. In finding biased prompts, the paper uses beam search to maximize a multi-token Jensen-Shannon divergence loss. Walk through the details of how this loss is computed. What are the benefits of using JSD over other distribution divergence measures?

5. During debiasing fine-tuning, the paper derives loss only from the extracted stereotypical phrases rather than the entire model vocabulary. Explain the motivation for this and its advantages and disadvantages compared to debiasing the entire vocabulary.

6. The beam search prompt search is limited to the 5,000 most frequent Wikipedia words. Discuss the rationale behind this design choice and its implications. What impact could expanding or restricting the search space have? 

7. Why does the paper use different phrase sets $S_{unweighted}$ and $S_{weighted}$ in the prompt search and debiasing stages respectively? Explain the motivation and tradeoffs.

8. The paper demonstrates debiasing on three model sizes. Analyze and discuss any differences you observe in debiasing efficacy or efficiency between model sizes.

9. The GLUE evaluation shows minimal impact on broader language capabilities after debiasing. Critically analyze what aspects of language capability may or may not be captured by GLUE. What additional evaluations could complement this?

10. The paper targets simultaneous debiasing on multiple attribute types and domains. Discuss any challenges that might arise in scaling this approach to handle substantially more attributes and domains compared to what was demonstrated.
