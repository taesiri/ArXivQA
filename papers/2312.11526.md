# [ABiMed: An intelligent and visual clinical decision support system for   medication reviews and polypharmacy management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11526)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Polypharmacy (taking 5+ medications) is a major public health issue, increasing risks of adverse events and being costly. Medication reviews (MRs) by pharmacists aim to optimize treatments by stopping unnecessary drugs and adding missing ones, but MRs remain difficult to perform in practice. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) could facilitate MRs, but most existing CDSSs just implement clinical guidelines, and do not provide easy access to contextualized drug knowledge. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose ABiMed, an innovative CDSS that combines guideline-based alerts with visual presentation of drug knowledge. It implements the STOPP/START rules to detect potentially inappropriate medications. It also extracts patient data from the GP's electronic health record and transfers it to the pharmacist performing the MR. Then it provides various visual tools to present drug knowledge (interactions, adverse effects) in the context of the patient's conditions and treatment. Views are proposed to compare the treatment before and after modifications from the MR.

Main Contributions:
- Architecture permitting automatic patient data transfer from the GP to the pharmacist
- Ontology-based implementation of the STOPP/START v2 guidelines  
- Innovative visual interfaces to explore adverse effects (flower glyphs, bar charts) and interactions (radial graphs)
- Ability to compare the pre and post-MR treatments 
- Qualitative evaluation showing healthcare professionals are highly interested in the system

In conclusion, ABiMed goes beyond previous CDSSs by combining intelligent methods (guidelines) and visual presentation of contextualized drug knowledge, to effectively support medication reviews for polypharmacy management.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper describes the design of ABiMed, a clinical decision support system for medication reviews and polypharmacy management that combines rule-based guidelines implementation with visual presentation of drug knowledge and supports data exchange between pharmacists and general practitioners.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The association of several approaches in one clinical decision support system for medication reviews and polypharmacy management: 

1) Implementation of guidelines (STOPP/START v2)
2) Visual presentation of contextualized drug knowledge using visual analytics
3) Automatic extraction of patient data from the GP's electronic health records and transfer to the pharmacist

The paper focuses on describing the design of this innovative system rather than evaluating it quantitatively. It also includes initial qualitative evaluations showing that health professionals are interested in such a system.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that ABiMed associates several approaches including guidelines implementation and visual presentation of drug knowledge. Can you expand on how these two approaches are integrated in the system architecture and workflow? 

2. One principle of ABiMed is to provide automatic patient data extraction to prevent tedious data entry. Can you explain in more detail the standards and methods used for exchanging and extracting patient data from the GP's EHR?

3. The paper states that ABiMed relies on an ontology-based patient data model. What ontology is used as the basis and how is it extended for the specifics of polypharmacy management?

4. For extracting patient data from free text, the Multi-Terminological Concept Extractor (MTCE) is utilized. What updates were made to MTCE for improved performance in the context of ABiMed? 

5. How exactly are the 114 STOPP/START v2 rules formalized and implemented as an automated rule-based system? Walk through the substeps involved.  

6. The visual presentation of adverse effects uses innovative flower glyphs. What is the rationale behind the visual encoding choices made in the design of these glyphs?

7. The radial graph visualization for drug interactions seems potentially complex. How is visual clutter controlled and what interactive features allow detailed inspection?

8. What client-server architecture and implementation technologies were chosen for ABiMed and why?

9. The cooperative multi-user usage is an important principle. Technically, how is concurrent access and modification of patient data handled?

10. Three types of qualitative evaluation were conducted. Can you compare the purpose, methods and results for the ergonomic assessment, focus groups, and practitioner workshop? What further evaluations are planned?
