# [Positional Information is All You Need: A Novel Pipeline for   Self-Supervised SVDE from Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08851)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The authors propose a novel method to compute robust moving object masks, called SPIMO masks, by exploiting the implicit learning of moving objects by CNNs trained for monocular depth estimation. They show these masks are more effective at removing moving objects compared to prior auto-masking techniques. 2. They present a new training pipeline that utilizes random image resizing/cropping and forward warping losses to allow learning depth from high-resolution videos using cropped patches. This makes training more efficient.3. They introduce adaptive per-pixel quantization of depth/disparity values, which helps dedicate more sampling levels to the appropriate depth ranges per pixel. 4. They employ a two-stage training strategy, where the first stage learns on all pixels, and the second stage uses the SPIMO masks to ignore moving objects during training. A boosting technique further refines depths of moving objects.5. Their complete pipeline with the above contributions achieves state-of-the-art results for self-supervised monocular depth estimation on KITTI and CityScapes datasets, using much fewer parameters than prior work.In summary, the key novelty is in exploiting positional information to generate robust masks for removing moving objects, along with the new training strategy, to advance self-supervised depth learning from monocular videos. The adaptive quantization also helps produce more accurate depth maps.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel pipeline for learning self-supervised single view depth estimation (SVDE) from videos that relies on pixel positional information instead of full images to compute robust moving object masks. These "SPIMO" masks can effectively remove independently moving objects to handle violations of the rigid scene assumption.2. Introducing an adaptive quantization scheme for the network's disparity estimation that assigns a per-pixel quantization curve, allowing more accurate discretization by allocating more bins to the relevant depth range for each pixel. 3. A training strategy involving random resizing and cropping of image patches that encourages the network to learn depth maps that scale proportionally with image size, preserving the depth cue of relative object size.4. A two-stage training procedure where the network is first trained on all pixels, then retrained from scratch using the SPIMO masks to exclude moving objects. A boosting technique is also proposed to refine depth estimates of moving objects.5. Achieving state-of-the-art results for self-supervised video-based SVDE on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets while using much fewer parameters than prior works, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline and components.In summary, the key novelty seems to be the use of positional information to obtain high quality moving object masks in a self-supervised manner, enabling more robust SVDE learning from video in an efficient pipeline. The adaptive per-pixel quantization and training strategy are also presented as important contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel pipeline for self-supervised learning of single view depth estimation from monocular videos that utilizes positional information to compute robust moving object masks, adaptive quantization for improved depth discretization, and data augmentation strategies that preserve relative depth cues when training on random crops.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper proposes a novel self-supervised method for learning single view depth estimation (SVDE) from monocular videos. Here are some key ways it compares to prior work:- Most existing self-supervised video-based SVDE methods rely on learning depths and poses from full images using backward warping losses. This paper instead uses forward warping on randomly cropped patches for more efficient learning, especially at higher resolutions.- The paper introduces a new way to compute robust "moving object" masks by analyzing depth estimate dispersion under shifted positional information. This avoids the need for extra segmentation or optical flow data. - An adaptive per-pixel depth discretization method is proposed rather than fixed quantization schemes used in other works. This allows more optimal sampling based on estimated distance.- Many recent video-based methods use explainability masks to handle moving objects. This paper shows improved masks can be obtained from positional information alone, avoiding the difficulty of learning to predict masks.- The method achieves state-of-the-art results on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets compared to previous self-supervised video approaches. It does so with far fewer parameters than recent top methods like PackNet.- The robust moving object handling and patch-based training with forward warping seem better suited for high resolution depth learning than prior video-based techniques.In summary, this paper introduces several innovative components that advance self-supervised monocular video-based depth learning. The moving object masking via positional information analysis and adaptive depth discretization are particularly unique ideas not explored before. The strong results validate the benefits of the proposed pipeline.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Explore other methods for estimating robust moving object masks besides their proposed shifted positional information approach. The authors state their SPIMO masks are simple yet effective, but other techniques could potentially further improve moving object handling.- Investigate different network architectures and self-attention mechanisms for the depth estimation network. The authors use a simple encoder-decoder with skip connections, but more sophisticated networks may improve results. - Extend the adaptive quantization scheme to have the network learn to assign different quantization parameters spatially within the image, not just per-pixel. This could allow allocating more bins in certain image regions.- Apply the proposed pipeline to other monocular depth estimation tasks like depth completion, which also relies on masked regions. The robust masks and boosting approach could benefit depth completion.- Explore the integration of semantic information to further aid in identifying movable vs static objects and estimating their depths. Semantics have proven useful in other depth works.- Test the generalizability of the approach on more diverse datasets like indoor scenes. The current experiments are on driving datasets.- Investigate the use of temporally adjacent frames at test time to filter and refine the depth predictions. The current method only uses single images.- Apply the pipeline to related view synthesis tasks like novel view generation. The adaptive quantization could also benefit novel view synthesis quality.In summary, the main future directions focus on improving the robustness of the moving object masking, exploring more advanced network architectures, and testing the generalizability and extensions of the method to related tasks and datasets. The core ideas show promise for monocular depth estimation.
