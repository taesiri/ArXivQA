# Situated Dialogue Learning through Procedural Environment Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we improve the zero-shot generalization abilities of goal-driven reinforcement learning agents to act and speak in text-based environments through procedural generation of training curriculums?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Training reinforcement learning agents on procedurally generated environments can improve generalization compared to training on singular environments, by expanding the state-action space.2) Measuring curriculum difficulty in terms of the rarity of quest types can be an effective way to generate curriculums of increasing difficulty. Rarer quest types are harder to generalize to. 3) Training agents on a curriculum of procedurally generated environments from easy to difficult will enable better generalization compared to training without a curriculum.The paper presents a method for procedurally generating text-based quest environments in the LIGHT framework, and generating curriculums of increasing difficulty as measured by the rarity of quest types. It then provides experimental results showing that agents trained on these curriculums achieve significantly higher generalization performance on unseen quests compared to various baselines.In summary, the key research question is how procedural generation of training curriculums can improve generalization of goal-driven dialogue agents, with the hypothesis that rarity-based difficulty can enable effective curriculum training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a method to procedurally generate curriculums of text-based fantasy environments of increasing difficulty in order to improve goal-driven dialogue agents' ability to generalize to novel scenarios. Specifically, the key contributions are:- A pipeline to procedurally generate fantasy text-adventure game instances, including worlds and character-based quests, by retrieving and generating various components like locations, characters, objects, motivations, and goals.- A technique to create curriculums of these generated environments by tuning the distribution of quest types to be increasingly flat and cover rarer types. Quest difficulty is parameterized by the rarity of the quest type.- Training goal-driven dialogue agents with reinforcement learning on these procedurally generated curriculums of steadily increasing difficulty. - Demonstrating through experiments that agents trained on these curriculums exhibit significantly improved zero-shot generalization ability on held-out quests compared to agents trained on static datasets or curriculums without procedural generation.The core idea is that procedural generation of diverse and novel yet coherent environments, organized into a curriculum of increasing difficulty, helps agents learn more generalizable policies instead of memorizing trajectories, thus improving their ability to operate in unfamiliar scenarios during evaluation.
