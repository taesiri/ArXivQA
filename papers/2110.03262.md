# [Situated Dialogue Learning through Procedural Environment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03262)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we improve the zero-shot generalization abilities of goal-driven reinforcement learning agents to act and speak in text-based environments through procedural generation of training curriculums?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Training reinforcement learning agents on procedurally generated environments can improve generalization compared to training on singular environments, by expanding the state-action space.

2) Measuring curriculum difficulty in terms of the rarity of quest types can be an effective way to generate curriculums of increasing difficulty. Rarer quest types are harder to generalize to. 

3) Training agents on a curriculum of procedurally generated environments from easy to difficult will enable better generalization compared to training without a curriculum.

The paper presents a method for procedurally generating text-based quest environments in the LIGHT framework, and generating curriculums of increasing difficulty as measured by the rarity of quest types. It then provides experimental results showing that agents trained on these curriculums achieve significantly higher generalization performance on unseen quests compared to various baselines.

In summary, the key research question is how procedural generation of training curriculums can improve generalization of goal-driven dialogue agents, with the hypothesis that rarity-based difficulty can enable effective curriculum training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a method to procedurally generate curriculums of text-based fantasy environments of increasing difficulty in order to improve goal-driven dialogue agents' ability to generalize to novel scenarios. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- A pipeline to procedurally generate fantasy text-adventure game instances, including worlds and character-based quests, by retrieving and generating various components like locations, characters, objects, motivations, and goals.

- A technique to create curriculums of these generated environments by tuning the distribution of quest types to be increasingly flat and cover rarer types. Quest difficulty is parameterized by the rarity of the quest type.

- Training goal-driven dialogue agents with reinforcement learning on these procedurally generated curriculums of steadily increasing difficulty. 

- Demonstrating through experiments that agents trained on these curriculums exhibit significantly improved zero-shot generalization ability on held-out quests compared to agents trained on static datasets or curriculums without procedural generation.

The core idea is that procedural generation of diverse and novel yet coherent environments, organized into a curriculum of increasing difficulty, helps agents learn more generalizable policies instead of memorizing trajectories, thus improving their ability to operate in unfamiliar scenarios during evaluation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method for teaching goal-driven agents to interactively act and speak in fantasy text environments by training them on procedurally generated curriculums of novel worlds and quests of increasing difficulty.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on training goal-driven agents in situated environments:

- The focus on using procedural generation to create a curriculum of environments is novel. Most prior work trains reinforcement learning agents on a single environment. Using procedurally generated environments provides more diversity during training.

- Measuring curriculum difficulty in terms of the rarity of quest types is a unique way of parametrizing the curriculum. Rather than using task success as a proxy for difficulty, the authors look directly at the distribution of quests.

- Grounding the research in the LIGHT text adventure environment follows recent trends in using interactive fiction games to study language learning. However, the fantasy genre and character-driven nature of LIGHT distinguishes it from some other text game environments.

- The study rigourously ablates various factors like curriculum difficulty, diversity, and pre-training. This provides insights into what factors contribute most to improving generalization.

- The agent architecture builds on prior work on training dialogue agents with RL in text games. However, the focus here is on generalizing to new goals rather than producing human-like dialogue.

Overall, the use of procedural generation to create goal-driven curriculums and the systematic ablation studies are significant innovations compared to prior work. The research also makes good use of the rich LIGHT environment and builds on recent trends in language learning through text games. The focus on generalization is important for developing capable real-world agents.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating more complex methods for measuring curriculum difficulty beyond just verb frequency. They suggest looking at other linguistic features and possibly even learning models to predict difficulty. 

- Exploring more sophisticated methods for aligning generated worlds and quests, beyond just retrieving relevant entities. This could involve enforcing more global coherence and causality.

- Training agents directly on the procedural generation process, instead of just the outputs. This could allow for more adaptive and efficient curriculum learning.

- Applying similar procedural generation and curriculum learning approaches to other interactive environments beyond just text games. The concepts could likely transfer to more complex 3D environments.

- Leveraging more advanced models like large language models to improve generation quality and coherence. Scaling up model size and training data could lead to more robust agents.

- Studying social aspects like collaboration, emergent communication, and theory of mind. The multi-agent nature of some text game settings provides opportunities here.

- Investigating ways to mitigate biases and other issues around generating freeform language and content. This is important as systems scale up.

- Analysis of agent behavior after curriculum training to better understand emergence of skills and strategies. This could further improve curriculum design.

So in summary, the authors point to several interesting directions around improving generation, adapting curricula, applying to new domains, scaling up models, studying social interaction, and analyzing agent capabilities. Overall the paper lays out a promising research agenda at the intersection of procedural generation and interactive AI.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method for teaching goal-driven agents to interactively act and speak in situated environments by training them on generated curriculums. The agents operate in LIGHT, a large-scale fantasy text adventure game where they perceive and interact with the world through natural language. Goals take the form of character quests with personas and motivations. The authors augment LIGHT by learning to procedurally generate additional novel textual worlds and quests to create curriculums of increasing difficulty for training the agents. Curriculum difficulty is measured by the rarity of the quest in the original training distribution - easier environments are more likely to have been in the unaugmented dataset. Through an ablation study, they show this method of learning from the tail of a distribution results in significantly higher generalization ability on never-before-seen quests. The key ideas are procedural generation of training curriculums, measuring curriculum difficulty by quest rarity, and improved generalization from learning on the tail.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method for teaching goal-driven agents to interactively act and speak in situated environments by training them on procedurally generated curriculums. The agents operate in LIGHT, a large-scale fantasy text adventure game where they perceive and interact with the world through natural language. Goals take the form of character quests with personas and motivations. The authors augment LIGHT by learning to procedurally generate additional novel textual worlds and quests to create curriculums of increasing difficulty for training the agents. Difficulty is measured by the rarity of the quest type in the original training distribution - easier environments are more likely to have been seen before. Through an ablation study, this curriculum learning approach is shown to significantly improve generalization ability on never-before-seen quests compared to training without curriculums.

The procedural generation pipeline involves first retrieving a character and corresponding location, then generating a quest conditioned on them. The world is then fleshed out by retrieving additional required characters, locations, and objects to ensure the quest is achievable. Curriculums are generated by iteratively running this pipeline, flattening the distribution of quest types in each new pool to steadily increase difficulty. Agents are trained using A2C reinforcement learning on these curriculums. Experiments show training on procedurally generated curriculums results in higher zero-shot goal achievement versus training on curriculums created through sampling or random generation. The authors conclude that their method of learning from the tail of the training distribution enables greater generalization.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a method for training goal-driven agents to interactively act and speak in situated environments by having them learn on generated curriculums. The curriculums consist of procedurally generated novel textual worlds and quests in the LIGHT fantasy text adventure game. The procedural generation pipeline involves first retrieving an initial character and location, then generating a quest for that character, and finally aligning the world by retrieving additional required characters, locations, and objects to ensure the quest is achievable. The difficulty of the curriculum is measured based on the rarity of the quest verb in the original training distribution, with rarer quest types being more difficult. Agents are trained using reinforcement learning on curriculums of steadily increasing difficulty. This curriculum learning approach enables the agents to achieve significantly higher generalization performance on unseen quests compared to training without curriculums.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is addressing the problem of improving the generalization abilities of goal-driven reinforcement learning (RL) agents that can act and speak via natural language in text-based game environments. 

- Specifically, the authors aim to increase the zero-shot generalization performance of agents trained on goal-oriented quests in the LIGHT environment. Generalization is challenging in this setting as agents can simply memorize trajectories during training rather than learning robust policies.

- The main question is how to create a training curriculum of novel procedurally generated environments that enables agents to generalize better to unseen test scenarios. The key idea is to learn to generate environments where the goal-verbs have a flatter, more uniform distribution compared to the original LIGHT dataset.

- This curriculum learning approach exposes the agent to a more diverse distribution of goals during training. The hypothesis is that learning on a curriculum of increasingly rare/unseen goals will improve generalization on new goals at test time.

- The paper presents a pipeline for procedural generation of worlds and quests in LIGHT, and shows how to parametrize curriculum difficulty based on the goal-verb distribution. Experiments demonstrate significantly improved zero-shot generalization from training on the generated curriculums.

In summary, the key research question is how to create effective training curriculums via procedural generation to improve generalization of situated dialogue agents to new goals and environments. The paper aims to address the generalization challenge in goal-driven language learning.
