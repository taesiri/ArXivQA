# [Uncertainty Propagation on Unimodular Matrix Lie Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03348)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper develops methods to propagate the mean and covariance of uncertainty distributions on matrix Lie groups. They derive an exact propagation formula from the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to a stochastic differential equation on the group. This formula is approximated in two ways: using numerical quadrature methods like the unscented transform, and by expansion of moments to get closed-form approximations. These techniques are applied to propagate the attitude and angular momentum uncertainty of a rotating rigid body modeled by Euler's equations. Both a quadrature formula and a second-order closed-form propagation formula are derived for this system on the direct product group of rotations and vectors. Numerically, these formulas achieve higher accuracy and computational efficiency compared to baseline Kalman filtering methods in estimating the mean. The proposed techniques provide effective ways to propagate uncertainty on matrix Lie groups arising in robotics and control systems.
