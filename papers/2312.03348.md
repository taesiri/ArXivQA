# [Uncertainty Propagation on Unimodular Matrix Lie Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03348)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper develops methods to propagate the mean and covariance of uncertainty distributions on matrix Lie groups. They derive an exact propagation formula from the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to a stochastic differential equation on the group. This formula is approximated in two ways: using numerical quadrature methods like the unscented transform, and by expansion of moments to get closed-form approximations. These techniques are applied to propagate the attitude and angular momentum uncertainty of a rotating rigid body modeled by Euler's equations. Both a quadrature formula and a second-order closed-form propagation formula are derived for this system on the direct product group of rotations and vectors. Numerically, these formulas achieve higher accuracy and computational efficiency compared to baseline Kalman filtering methods in estimating the mean. The proposed techniques provide effective ways to propagate uncertainty on matrix Lie groups arising in robotics and control systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper derives a general formula for propagating mean and covariance on unimodular matrix Lie groups with surjective exponential maps, approximates it using numerical quadrature and moment expansion, provides a second-order closed-form formula, and applies the theory to propagate attitude and angular momentum uncertainty for a rotating rigid body.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to propagate the mean and covariance of a probability distribution evolving according to a Fokker-Planck equation on certain matrix Lie groups. Specifically:

1) The paper derives an exact formula for propagating the mean and covariance by recentering the distribution, performing integration by parts on the Fokker-Planck equation, and extracting the resulting ordinary differential equations. 

2) Two approximate propagation methods are proposed based on the exact formula - one using numerical quadrature assuming a Gaussian distribution, and another based on moment expansion to get a closed-form second-order propagation formula.

3) The general theory is applied to the problem of propagating uncertainty in the attitude and angular momentum of a rotating rigid body. Both a numerical quadrature formula and a closed-form second-order formula are derived for this problem.

4) Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed formulas achieve higher accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing methods for uncertainty propagation on Lie groups.

In summary, the key contribution is a general framework and methodology for uncertainty propagation on matrix Lie groups, with theoretically sound derivations, practically useful approximate formulas, and demonstration on a attitude estimation problem.

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of propagating uncertainty (mean and covariance) for stochastic dynamical systems evolving on matrix Lie groups. This is challenging due to the non-Euclidean structure of Lie groups.

- It introduces two approximation methods - numerical quadrature based on the unscented transform, and expansion of moments by truncating higher order terms.

- For the expansion of moments, a closed-form second-order propagation formula is provided for mean and covariance.

- These propagation techniques are applied to the dynamics of a rotating rigid body to propagate uncertainty in its attitude (rotation) and angular momentum states.

Main Contributions:

- An exact uncertainty propagation formula from the Fokker-Planck equation, that works for a class of unimodular matrix Lie groups.

- Two approximation techniques - unscented transform and second-order expansion of moments - that build on this to give computationally efficient propagation. 

- A closed-form second-order propagation formula for mean and covariance.

- Application of these techniques for uncertainty propagation in the attitude and angular momentum states of a rotating rigid body.

- Numerical experiments demonstrating the improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing methods like the unscented Kalman filter on Lie groups.

In summary, the paper provides a principled way to propagate uncertainty on Lie groups, with applications in attitude estimation and related problems evolving on matrix Lie groups. The proposed computational techniques outperform previous approaches.
