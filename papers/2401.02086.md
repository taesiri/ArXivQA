# [View-based Explanations for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02086)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great potential for graph classification tasks. However, explaining their predictions to gain interpretability remains challenging. 
- Existing GNN explanation methods have limitations in generating explanations that are class label-specific, configurable, concise, queryable, and model-agnostic.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel paradigm called GVEX that generates "graph views" as two-tier explanations for GNNs to address the limitations.

- An explanation view contains a set of graph patterns (higher tier) and a set of explanation subgraphs (lower tier) for a specific class label. The subgraphs are responsible for that label and the patterns summarize them.

- The paper formulates an optimization problem for generating optimal explanation views under explicit quality measures like explainability, coverage constraints, etc.

- Two algorithms are presented - an approximation algorithm with 12-approximation guarantee and a streaming algorithm with 14-approximation.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the notion of explanation views as two-tier structures for explaining GNN predictions.

- Proposes configurable coverage constraints and quality metrics tailored for explanation views.

- Shows the problem is Σ2P-hard and that explainability is a monotone submodular function.

- Provides two algorithms with approximation guarantees - one follows explain-summarize strategy and another is incremental.

- Experimentally demonstrates effectiveness, efficiency and scalability on real-world graphs and GNN models.

- Showcases practical applications in domains like drug discovery and social network analysis via case studies.

The paper makes significant contributions towards model-agnostic, class label-specific, configurable and queryable explanations for GNN-based graph classification.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel paradigm called Graph Views for Explanation (GVEX) to generate two-tier explanation structures consisting of graph patterns and explanation subgraphs for interpreting graph neural network models in a queryable, configurable, and efficient manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel graph view-based two-tier structure called explanation views to explain graph neural network (GNN)-based graph classification. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Introducing the concept of explanation views, which contain a "lower-tier" of explanation subgraphs and a "higher-tier" of graph patterns. The explanation subgraphs capture the fractions of input graphs responsible for GNN predictions, while the patterns summarize common substructures to enable querying and inspection. 

2) Formulating an optimization problem for generating optimal explanation views under quality measures like explainability and coverage. The problem is shown to be Σ2P-hard.

3) Presenting two approximation algorithms with guarantees - one follows an "explain-and-summarize" strategy for static graphs, while the other incrementally maintains explanation views over graph streams.

4) Conducting extensive experiments on real datasets to demonstrate the efficiency, effectiveness and scalability of the proposed techniques over state-of-the-art methods. Case studies also showcase potential applications.

In summary, the key innovation is a queryable and configurable two-tier explanation structure tailored for GNN graph classification, supported by both scalable view generation algorithms and theoretical analysis. The techniques help bridge the gap between GNN model predictions and human understanding.
