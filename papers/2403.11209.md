# [Creating an African American-Sounding TTS: Guidelines, Technical   Challenges,and Surprising Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11209)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI agents and synthetic voices predominantly use white representations, lacking diversity. 
- Goal is to create a high-quality African American-sounding female text-to-speech (TTS) voice that is recognized as such.

Solution:
- Conducted focus groups with African Americans to establish ethical guidelines and criteria for selecting an appropriate voice talent. 
- Recorded an African American female voice talent reading texts.
- Developed a neural TTS system using the recordings to synthesize the African American (AA) voice.
- Evaluated whether the AA voice is recognized as African American through two studies with US crowdworkers and one focus group with African Americans.

Key Findings:  
- Focus groups yielded 5 key ethical guidelines including avoiding stereotypes and ensuring African American participation.
- The AA voice was unanimously recognized as African American by the focus group participants.
- However, in the crowdworker studies, the AA voice was overwhelmingly attributed to a white speaker, while a baseline white TTS voice was correctly identified.
- The African American focus group suggested this mismatch is due to prejudices causing crowdworkers to expect African Americans to have poorer grammar/vocabulary.

Main Contributions:
- Documentation of the inherent tensions between inclusive representation and avoiding negative stereotypes.
- Evidence that vocal representations recognized positively by the African American community may not be identifiable as such by the broader US population due to prejudices.
- Highlights need to consider multiple audiences in evaluations to avoid bias and misconceptions related to race and identity.
