# [Creating an African American-Sounding TTS: Guidelines, Technical   Challenges,and Surprising Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11209)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI agents and synthetic voices predominantly use white representations, lacking diversity. 
- Goal is to create a high-quality African American-sounding female text-to-speech (TTS) voice that is recognized as such.

Solution:
- Conducted focus groups with African Americans to establish ethical guidelines and criteria for selecting an appropriate voice talent. 
- Recorded an African American female voice talent reading texts.
- Developed a neural TTS system using the recordings to synthesize the African American (AA) voice.
- Evaluated whether the AA voice is recognized as African American through two studies with US crowdworkers and one focus group with African Americans.

Key Findings:  
- Focus groups yielded 5 key ethical guidelines including avoiding stereotypes and ensuring African American participation.
- The AA voice was unanimously recognized as African American by the focus group participants.
- However, in the crowdworker studies, the AA voice was overwhelmingly attributed to a white speaker, while a baseline white TTS voice was correctly identified.
- The African American focus group suggested this mismatch is due to prejudices causing crowdworkers to expect African Americans to have poorer grammar/vocabulary.

Main Contributions:
- Documentation of the inherent tensions between inclusive representation and avoiding negative stereotypes.
- Evidence that vocal representations recognized positively by the African American community may not be identifiable as such by the broader US population due to prejudices.
- Highlights need to consider multiple audiences in evaluations to avoid bias and misconceptions related to race and identity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper describes the development and evaluation of a text-to-speech system aimed at sounding like an educated, professional African American woman, including studies exploring ethical considerations, technical challenges, and surprising difficulty for non-African Americans to recognize the voice as African American due to possible misconceptions or prejudice about how African Americans sound.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

The paper documents and discusses the inherent tension between using inclusive human representations in AI systems while avoiding negative stereotypes. The authors present a case study where a text-to-speech voice recognized by African Americans as sounding African American was not recognized as such by non-African Americans. The paper suggests this may be due to stereotypical expectations of how African Americans sound. The authors discuss the ethical dilemma of whether to use negative stereotypes to achieve inclusiveness versus following positive representations expected by the community at the risk of contributing to exclusion. Overall, the paper highlights how bias and prejudice can permeate all levels of AI system development.

The key contribution is exposing the ethical conflicts in addressing inclusiveness in AI human representations, using a case study of developing an African American sounding text-to-speech voice.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- African American Text-to-Speech (TTS) system
- Synthetic voices
- Voice representations
- Whiteness of AI
- Racialization of AI
- African American Vernacular English (AAVE) 
- Stereotyping
- Prejudice
- Ethics
- Inclusiveness
- User studies
- Focus groups
- Crowdsourcing evaluations

The paper discusses the process of creating a synthetic Text-to-Speech voice that sounds African American, including conducting focus groups to gather guidelines and select an appropriate voice talent, developing the technical system, and evaluating whether the voice is recognized as African American by various audiences. Key themes explored are racial bias, stereotypes, inclusiveness, and ethical considerations around synthetic voice identities. The studies involve crowdsourced participants as well as focus groups, evaluating the attribution of ethnicity to the synthetic voice. So those are some of the central keywords and terminology highlighted in this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using focus groups to gather ethical guidelines and selection criteria for the African American voice. Could you expand more on the methodology used in those focus groups? What specific activities or prompts were used to elicit that type of feedback?

2. When recording the voice talent, it seems a balance was struck between having a fully scripted dataset while still allowing some spontaneity and naturalness. Can you elaborate more on this process and approach? How was the script developed and annotated to achieve that?

3. The multi-speaker vs single-speaker model training is an interesting aspect. What specifically does the multi-speaker data add in this case even though the end goal is a single speaker? How does the model architecture allow properly conditioning on speaker ID?

4. Regarding the two large scale evaluation studies, what steps were taken to ensure participant diversity and representativeness beyond using a crowdworking platform? Was geography/location considered? 

5. For the face selection and validation study described in the appendix, what other criteria beyond race were used to narrow down the faces? There is a balance to strike between diversity and stereotypicality.

6. What analysis was done to determine the sufficiency of the size of the evaluation studies? Power analysis methods for example. Relatedly, what compromises were made due to budget or time constraints?

7. The discussion section mentions possible bias arising from the particular demographic recruited for the focus groups and study 3. What impact might a broader cross-section of African Americans have had on the findings?  

8. Can you expand more on the motivation for "disguising" the direct race attribution questions as voice quality evaluations in studies 1 and 2? Would directly asking have significantly skewed the results?

9. Regarding future work, what are some ideas on better characterizing what constitutes an African American voice in a way that avoids negative stereotypes but improves recognition?

10. If this work was to be extended to other marginalized racial/ethnic groups and their corresponding synthetic voices, what methodology adaptations might be required given different cultural needs and sensitivities?
