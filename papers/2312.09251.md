# [VL-GPT: A Generative Pre-trained Transformer for Vision and Language   Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09251)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces VL-GPT, a generative pre-trained transformer model for both understanding and generating vision and language data in a unified manner. The key innovation is an image tokenizer-detokenizer framework that can convert images to and from a sequence of continuous embeddings, allowing the model to process images similarly to text data. VL-GPT incorporates this framework along with a text tokenizer/detokenizer into a transformer architecture. It is pre-trained using an auto-regressive objective to predict the next token/embedding on large-scale multimodal data. This unified modeling approach allows VL-GPT to achieve strong performance on image captioning, visual QA, text-to-image generation, and other tasks with zero-shot or few-shot prompting. Additionally, the model exhibits impressive multimodal in-context learning abilities when provided new tasks described in multimodal prompts. The authors also perform further instruction tuning on VL-GPT to align it better with human preferences. In summary, VL-GPT demonstrates unified and strong vision-language generative capabilities and has potential to serve as an impactful foundation model for multimodal AI.
