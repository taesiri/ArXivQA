# [Exploring Graph Based Approaches for Author Name Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08388)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of author name disambiguation. This involves associating research publications to their correct author profiles when multiple authors share the same name. This is an important problem for academic search systems and analyzing researcher networks. It is challenging due to the large scale of academic data and complexity of name ambiguity.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors formulate the problem as a graph-based clustering task on a bipartite graph of author nodes and publication nodes. The goal is to cluster author nodes with the same name based on a similarity function. They analyze several similarity functions:

1) Text-based similarity using author name and affiliation
2) Random walk based similarity 
3) Transductive node embedding similarity using Node2Vec
4) Graph neural network based similarity in both supervised and unsupervised settings

The graph neural networks incorporate both graph structure as well as publication metadata features like titles, abstracts, organizations and years.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of name disambiguation as a graph based clustering problem 
- Analysis of multiple graph-based similarity functions
- Use of publication content features in graph neural networks
- Extensive data analysis and experiments comparing performance of different methods
- Identification of tradeoffs - random walk methods have high precision, embedding methods have high recall

The authors do extensive quantitative analysis on a dataset from an academic graph challenge. They highlight interesting statistics about author affiliations, publication venues, keywords etc. They also perform detailed error analysis on the different methods, studying what works and limitations.
