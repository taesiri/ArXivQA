# [PrivateLoRA For Efficient Privacy Preserving LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14030)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes PrivateLoRA, a novel method for efficient and privacy-preserving deployment of large language models (LLMs) using a heterogeneous architecture with a central cloud and edge devices. The key innovation is exploiting the low rank of residual activations for communication and workload distribution. Specifically, model parameters are split across the cloud and edge devices, with only activations transmitted between them to ensure data locality. PrivateLoRA adapts weights by adding three sequential low rank matrices - non-trainable matrices A and B on the cloud encode and decode activations to significantly reduce communication overhead, while trainable matrix M on edge devices steers the model's outputs. This approach provides over 95% communication reduction. Based on PrivateLoRA, the authors propose a new LLM service paradigm that achieves data locality while leveraging powerful cloud computation, outperforming device-only solutions in throughput by over 300% for 7B models and 80% for 33B models under 5G networks. The reduced compute on edge devices also enables energy efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate PrivateLoRA's effectiveness for tuning performance, integrity, and scalability. By enabling performant and tailored LLM experiences on edge devices in a privacy-preserving manner, this work paves the way for democratized access to state-of-the-art generative AI.
