# [Enhancing selectivity using Wasserstein distance based reweighing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11562)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper considers the problem of training neural networks on multiple labeled datasets representing different classification tasks. Directly training on the combined labeled data may require impractically large amounts of data. The goal is to reweight the examples from one dataset (S) to tilt its distribution towards a second dataset (T), so a network trained on the reweighted S will behave similarly to a network trained on T.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an efficient greedy algorithm using random sampling (Alg 1) to reweigh dataset S to tilt it towards dataset T by Î±. It uses the 1-Wasserstein distance between the datasets' distributions as the metric to minimize under reweighing. Theoretical results show the algorithm provides a near-optimal reweighing efficiently for large datasets. 

Key Contributions:
1) Theorem 1 shows the 1-Wasserstein distance between training distributions upper bounds the difference in networks trained with stochastic gradient descent. So minimizing Wasserstein distance suffices for tilting behavior.

2) Theorem 4 proves the greedy matching algorithm run on small random samples provides a good approximation to the Wasserstein distance between distributions for datasets with bounded "metric entropy". This enables efficient near-optimal reweighing.  

3) Experiments in drug discovery increased selectivity of a network's top predictions from 54% to 95% with negligible loss increase. 2 reweighted selective predictions were experimentally validated.

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient algorithm with theoretical guarantees to reweight the examples in one dataset to tilt training towards a second dataset. This allows training networks that combine objectives from multiple datasets without needing joint labeling. An application to computational drug discovery is demonstrated.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point in the paper:

The paper presents a computationally efficient algorithm for reweighting data sets to converge neural network weights towards a distribution closer to one that would result from training on a different target data set, with provable guarantees on performance under the assumption of low metric entropy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A theoretical explanation for why the Wasserstein distance is an appropriate choice of metric in the reweighing algorithm (Algorithm 1). Specifically, Theorem 1 shows that the Wasserstein distance between two measures upper bounds the total variation distance between the invariant measures underlying the stochastic gradient descent algorithms. This justifies using the Wasserstein distance to measure the closeness of distributions.

2) Efficiency results for the greedy bipartite matching algorithm used in the reweighing procedure. In particular, Theorem 3 shows that under the assumption of bounded metric entropy, the greedy algorithm achieves much better approximation guarantees compared to known lower bounds. 

3) Theorem 4 shows that under the bounded metric entropy assumption, random samples preserve the Wasserstein distance between distributions. This allows the algorithm to work efficiently with small samples of large datasets. 

4) Theorem 5 puts these results together to state that under the assumptions of small covering and sufficiently different distributions, the greedy algorithm on a small random sample can approximate the Wasserstein distance between distributions, allowing the overall reweighing algorithm (Algorithm 1) to scale efficiently.

In summary, the main contribution is providing a scalable algorithm for reweighing distributions to bring neural network weights closer together, with supporting theory justifying the algorithmic choices and proving efficiency guarantees.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Wasserstein distance - A metric used to measure the distance between probability distributions. Central to the algorithms and analysis in the paper.

- Metric entropy - A measure of the "complexity" of a dataset. Low metric entropy means the data can be covered with a small number of balls. Assumed to be small for the datasets in this paper.

- Greedy bipartite matching - An efficient but potentially inaccurate algorithm for approximating solutions to matching problems, which are connected to computing Wasserstein distance.

- Random sampling - Taking a small random subset of a larger dataset. Shown in the paper to approximately preserve key properties like Wasserstein distance under certain assumptions.

- Distribution shift/reweighing - Deliberately changing the distribution of a dataset, e.g. to optimize multiple criteria. One of the motivating applications explored. 

- Drug discovery - An application area explored in the paper involving predicting drug compounds that bind to certain proteins. Used as a case study for the algorithms developed.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes using a greedy bipartite matching algorithm to approximate the Wasserstein distance between distributions. Can you explain why approximating the Wasserstein distance is important for the overall goal of reweighting one distribution to be closer to another?

2) Theorem 1 shows that bounding the Wasserstein distance between distributions is sufficient to bound the difference in stochastic gradient descent outcomes. What assumptions are made in this theorem and can you give some intuition for why bounding Wasserstein distance is enough under those assumptions? 

3) The greedy bipartite matching algorithm is known to perform poorly in general. What key assumption about the structure of the data distributions allows the authors to prove stronger approximation guarantees for this algorithm? Expand on why having small metric entropy leads to better performance.

4) Explain the connection shown in Lemma 1 between the existence of long alternating cycles in the greedy matching and the metric entropy of the data. Why does lower metric entropy constrain the lengths of such cycles?

5) Walk through how Theorem 3 formally argues that small random samples preserve the Wasserstein distance between distributions. What property of the distributions is used to enable concentration results for the empirical Wasserstein distance?

6) Theorem 4 is the main efficiency result. Outline how the approximation guarantee shown builds upon the previous results, especially in using properties of random sampling and the better guarantees for greedy matching under bounded metric entropy assumptions.

7) The drug discovery application relies on the assumption that chemical datasets have small metric entropy. Provide some intuition for why this structuredness assumption may hold and how it relates to the structure of combinatorial chemistry libraries.

8) What modification would be needed to handle anisotropic noise in the stochastic gradient descent process under the proposed analysis? How does that impact the approximation bounds?

9) Can you compare the guarantees obtained using the Wasserstein distance versus other probability metrics like total variation or Levy distance? What benefits does Wasserstein provide?

10) A key limitation is the reliance on bounded metric entropy of the datasets. Can you propose methods to reduce this assumption or argue that structured datasets arise frequently in applications like drug discovery?
