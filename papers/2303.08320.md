# [VideoFusion: Decomposed Diffusion Models for High-Quality Video   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08320)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method for high-quality video generation using diffusion probabilistic models. The central hypothesis is that decomposing the diffusion process into a shared base noise and independent residual noises will make it easier for the model to learn coherent video sequences. Specifically:

- The key research question is how to design an effective diffusion probabilistic model for high-quality video generation that can capture both spatial details within each frame as well as temporal coherence across frames. 

- The central hypothesis is that decomposing the diffusion process into a shared base noise and independent residual noises will allow the model to better exploit similarities across frames while still modeling frame-specific details. The shared base noise captures common information across frames while the residual noises model frame-specific details.

- The proposed method, VideoFusion, implements this idea by using a pretrained image diffusion model to predict the shared base noise from a center frame, and then uses a video-specific residual generator to predict the residual noises. 

- Experiments confirm the hypothesis, showing VideoFusion can generate higher quality and more coherent videos compared to prior diffusion-based and GAN-based video generation methods. The decomposed diffusion process allows efficiently leveraging powerful pretrained image models while focusing the video-specific model on learning residuals.

In summary, the key innovation is the decomposed diffusion modeling approach and the central hypothesis is that it will lead to improved coherent video generation compared to prior diffusion or GAN models that lack such decomposition. The paper presents VideoFusion as a way to implement and validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing a decomposed diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) for video generation, termed VideoFusion, that decomposes the standard diffusion process into adding a shared base noise and independent residual noises. This allows the model to better exploit temporal correlations. 

- Using a pretrained image DPM as the base generator to efficiently leverage its knowledge and image priors. The base generator predicts the shared base noise for all frames with one forward pass.

- Showing that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results on UCF101, Sky Time-lapse and TaiChi-HD datasets. It also generates high-quality videos from text descriptions.

- Demonstrating that the shared base noise can help generate longer coherent videos. And with proper training, the model can relate the base noise to video content and residual noise to motions.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a decomposed diffusion process and model architecture that can better exploit spatial-temporal correlations for high-quality video generation. The decomposed formulation also brings benefits like efficiently using a pretrained image DPM and controlling content/motions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a decomposed diffusion probabilistic model for video generation called VideoFusion, which splits the noise added during diffusion into a shared base noise and independent residual noises to better capture temporal coherence.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of video generation using diffusion probabilistic models:

- This paper proposes a novel decomposed diffusion process for video generation, where the noise added during diffusion is split into a shared base noise and independent residual noises. This allows consecutive frames to be encoded into correlated latent variables, making it easier for the model to learn coherent videos. Most prior DPM-based video generation methods use a standard diffusion process with independent noise for each frame.

- The proposed model VideoFusion employs two jointly trained neural networks - a base generator to remove the shared base noise and a residual generator for the residual noises. This allows efficient use of a powerful pretrained image diffusion model as the base generator to provide strong image priors. Other DPM video generation models typically extend a 2D diffusion model to 3D or process each frame independently.

- Experiments show VideoFusion achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results on benchmark datasets compared to prior GAN and DPM-based video generation models. It also generates higher visual quality and longer coherent videos.

- The decomposed formulation makes it straightforward to control video content vs motions by keeping base or residual noises fixed. This level of control is difficult in standard DPM models that use a single combined noise.

- VideoFusion is more computationally efficient than naively extending a 2D DPM to 3D since the base generator runs only once per diffusion step. It also allows using a smaller residual generator by leveraging a pretrained base generator.

Overall, the decomposed diffusion process andjoint training framework in VideoFusion represent important innovations over prior work for high-quality coherent video generation using diffusion models. The proposed techniques help address key challenges in extending these powerful models to video generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing adaptive methods to generate the lambda coefficients for each video or frame, rather than using fixed lambdas. This could better capture variations in motion and differences between frames for different videos.

- Conditioning the residual generator directly on long text captions rather than just the latent embedding from the prior. This could improve video generation from long text descriptions, but requires overcoming issues with modality gap and convergence. 

- Exploring ways to decompose the latent space into interpretable directions like content and motion more automatically, rather than needing explicit supervision.

- Applying the video decomposition ideas to other generation tasks like text-to-video generation, video prediction, etc.

- Exploring unconditional video generation without using the CLIP embeddings as conditioning.

- Improving video generation metrics and datasets to better evaluate long-term coherence and motions.

- Scaling up the model size and data to generate higher resolution and longer videos.

- Reducing memory usage and computational requirements to make the models more practical.

Overall, the main future directions are developing more adaptive and controllable video decomposition, improving conditioning on long text, scaling up the models, and applying the framework to other tasks. The key challenges are modality gaps, interpreting the latent spaces, and evaluation metrics.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a decomposed diffusion probabilistic model called VideoFusion for high-quality video generation. Previous diffusion models for video treat each frame independently during the diffusion process, making it difficult to generate coherent videos during denoising. VideoFusion decomposes the noise added during diffusion into a shared base noise and independent residual noises. The shared base noise helps exploit similarities between frames, while the residual noises model frame differences. VideoFusion employs two jointly trained neural networks for denoising: a base generator leverages a pretrained image diffusion model to denoise the shared base noise, and a residual generator removes the residual noises. Experiments demonstrate that VideoFusion can generate higher quality and more coherent videos compared to prior GAN and diffusion models. Key benefits are efficiently incorporating priors from pretrained image models, and relating the shared base noise to video content and residual noises to motions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a decomposed diffusion probabilistic model called VideoFusion for high-quality video generation. Previous diffusion-based video generation methods use a standard diffusion process where frames in a video clip are destroyed with independent noises, ignoring content redundancy and temporal correlation. VideoFusion proposes a decomposed diffusion process that splits the per-frame noise into a shared base noise and varying residual noise. The base noise captures content shared across frames while the residual noise models frame differences. 

VideoFusion consists of a base generator network that removes the shared base noise and a residual generator network that removes the varying residual noise. By sharing base noise extraction across frames, VideoFusion can leverage powerful pretrained image diffusion models as the base generator. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate VideoFusion generates higher quality and more coherent videos compared to GAN and diffusion baselines. Benefits include efficient use of pretrained models, controllable video content and motion, and extendable long video generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a decomposed diffusion probabilistic model for high-quality video generation, termed VideoFusion. The key idea is to decompose the standard diffusion process by adding base noise and residual noise, where the base noise is shared across frames in a video while the residual noise varies. In this way, the latent representations of video frames are correlated through the shared base noise. VideoFusion consists of a base generator to remove the shared base noise and a residual generator to remove the varying residual noise. The base generator leverages a pretrained image diffusion model to exploit powerful image priors. Experiments show VideoFusion can generate high-quality and coherent videos, and also support controllable generation by decomposing motions and content. The decomposed formulation brings superior performance compared to standard diffusion models and GAN methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem and contributions of this paper are:

- It aims to develop an effective diffusion probabilistic model for high-quality video generation. Previous diffusion models for images have shown impressive results, but applying them to video generation is still challenging due to the high dimensionality and complex spatio-temporal correlations in video data.

- Existing video diffusion models treat each frame independently during the diffusion process, adding independent noise to each frame. This makes it difficult for the model to learn the temporal correlations between frames. 

- This paper proposes a decomposed diffusion process that splits the noise added to each frame into a "base noise" shared across frames and a "residual noise" that varies between frames. 

- Sharing the base noise helps the model better exploit similarities between frames and makes it easier to generate coherent videos during the reverse denoising process.

- The proposed model, called VideoFusion, uses two jointly trained networks - a base generator and residual generator that match the noise decomposition.

- It can efficiently leverage powerful pretrained image diffusion models for the base generator to reconstruct per-frame details. The residual generator then models inter-frame differences.

- Experiments show VideoFusion can generate higher quality and more coherent videos compared to previous GAN and diffusion models. It also supports controllable video generation by decomposing content and motion.

In summary, the key idea is decomposing the diffusion process to better utilize inter-frame similarities, allowing more effective learning of temporal correlations for high-quality video generation. The proposed VideoFusion model demonstrates superior results by adopting this decomposed formulation.
