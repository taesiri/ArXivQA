# [Learning To Retrieve Prompts for In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08633)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the key research question this paper addresses is:

How can we develop an efficient method for retrieving good prompts (training examples) for in-context learning in large language models?

The main hypothesis seems to be:

Using language models themselves to label which training examples will be good prompts, and training a prompt retriever from this signal, will result in better performance compared to prior prompt retrieval methods.

In summary, the paper proposes a method called EPR (Efficient Prompt Retrieval) that uses a scoring LM to label training examples as good or bad prompts. It then trains a prompt retriever using this labeled data. The authors hypothesize and show that this approach substantially outperforms prior prompt retrieval methods across several language understanding tasks. The main research contribution is developing an effective technique to retrieve high-quality prompts to guide in-context learning in large LMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing an efficient method for retrieving good prompts (training examples) for in-context learning in large language models. Specifically:

- The paper proposes using the language model itself to label which training examples will be useful prompts. For each training input-output pair (x,y), they estimate the probability of y given x and candidate prompt examples, and label high probability examples as positive and low probability ones as negative. 

- They then train a dense retriever using these labeled prompts with a contrastive loss. The retriever learns a similarity function between a test input and candidate prompts. 

- At test time, for a given input, the retriever efficiently retrieves the most similar prompts from the training set, which are then provided along with the input to the language model for in-context prediction.

- They show this approach substantially outperforms various unsupervised and supervised baselines on semantic parsing tasks using GPT-Neo. It also works well as a proxy method when using larger LMs like GPT-3 for inference.

In summary, the key contribution is using the language model itself to train an efficient prompt retriever, which helps improve in-context learning performance across models. The method provides an effective way to interface with and harness large language models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient method to retrieve good training examples (prompts) for in-context learning in large language models, where the language models themselves are used to label which training examples will be useful.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related work:

- The paper proposes using language models themselves to label training data for prompt retrieval, rather than relying on surface-level heuristic similarity metrics. This is a novel way to leverage the knowledge within large pretrained LMs to train prompt retrievers. Other work has focused more on unsupervised similarity or rule-based supervision.

- For training the prompt retriever, the paper employs a contrastive learning approach using hard negatives mined from candidates ranked by the scoring LM. This follows recent trends in using contrastive methods to train dense retrievers, but tailors the negative sampling strategy to the prompt retrieval setting.

- The paper shows substantial gains from their proposed Efficient Prompt Retrieval (EPR) method across three semantic parsing datasets, outperforming both unsupervised and supervised baselines. The improvements are demonstrated using GPT-Neo and as a proxy model for larger LMs like GPT-3. This provides strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness of their approach.

- EPR is model-agnostic and can work without access to model parameters, making it suitable even when using LMs in a blackbox manner. This contrasts with some other prompt engineering methods that require model fine-tuning or access. The authors position EPR as an approach to efficiently interface with ever-larger LMs.

- While focused on in-context learning for semantic parsing, the idea of using the LM itself for prompt retrieval training supervision could potentially extend more broadly. However, the paper does not explore wider applications.

In summary, the key novelty of this paper is using LMs for prompt retrieval supervision, combined with contrastive learning. This achieves substantial gains over baselines, providing a generalizable way to improve in-context learning through efficient retrieval. The model-agnostic nature also suits growing LM scales.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing methods to model the dependencies between different training examples in a prompt. The current approach scores and retrieves each training example independently, but at test time the model sees them jointly as a sequence. Modeling dependencies during training could better match test conditions.

- Exploring different scoring functions beyond the likelihood of the target sequence. The authors mention this could lead to even stronger supervision for training the retriever.

- Applying EPR to other modalities beyond text, such as image-text pairs. The overall framework of scoring training examples based on an alignment model could extend to other data types.

- Exploring whether EPR could be used to improve supervised models by augmenting their inputs with retrieved examples during training. The authors suggest this is a promising direction.

- Developing methods to constrain or bias the model's decoding when given a prompt, which could further enhance in-context learning. The authors mention combining retrieval with constrained decoding.

- Scaling up EPR with increasing model size. As models continue to grow, developing efficient methods to interface with them will be important. The authors position EPR as a step in this direction.

In summary, the main suggestions are around improving prompt modeling, exploring different training signals, extending to new modalities and tasks, and developing methods to scale up interfacing with large language models. The overall theme is continuing to improve in-context learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient method for retrieving good prompts (training examples) for in-context learning in large language models. In-context learning is a technique where a language model is given a few training examples (a prompt) and a test instance as input, and generates an output for the test instance without updating its parameters. The paper shows that performance depends heavily on the selected prompt examples. To address this, they propose a method called Efficient Prompt Retrieval (EPR) which uses a scoring language model to label how useful each training example is as a prompt for other examples. They use this to train a dense retriever, which at test time efficiently retrieves useful prompts. The method is evaluated on semantic parsing tasks, substantially outperforming baselines. Using a smaller language model as a proxy to train the retriever is shown to work well even when applied to larger models. The work provides an effective approach for interfacing with large language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for retrieving good prompts for in-context learning in large language models. In-context learning is a technique where a language model is given a test instance along with a few training examples (termed a "prompt") as input, and directly generates the output for the test instance without updating its parameters. However, performance strongly depends on the selected prompt examples. 

The proposed approach trains an efficient prompt retriever using the language model itself to label which training examples will be good prompts. Specifically, for a training input-output pair, candidate training examples are scored by estimating the probability of the output conditioned on the input and candidate prompt using the language model. Examples with high probability are labeled as positive prompts and those with low probability as negatives. A retriever is then trained with contrastive learning on this labeled data. Experiments on semantic parsing datasets show the approach substantially outperforms baselines, including when using a smaller language model to train the retriever applied to larger models. The work provides an effective method for retrieving useful prompts to interface with large pre-trained language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient method for retrieving good prompts (training examples) for in-context learning with large language models. The key idea is to use a scoring language model to label which training examples will be useful prompts for other examples. Specifically, for each training example, they retrieve a set of candidate prompts using an unsupervised method like BM25. They then score each candidate by using the scoring LM to estimate the probability of the original example's output given its input concatenated with the candidate prompt. Candidates with high probability are labeled as positive examples and low probability ones as negatives. They then train a dense retriever using these labeled prompts with a contrastive loss, so at test time it can efficiently retrieve useful prompts. The main advantage is that the scoring LM provides a better training signal than surface form heuristics used in prior work. This allows training an efficient retriever even when the full LM is not accessible.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, this paper is addressing the problem of how to select good training examples (prompts) for in-context learning using large pre-trained language models. 

Specifically, it talks about how performance of in-context learning depends a lot on the choice of training examples provided as input. So the main question is how to retrieve good training examples to use as prompts when doing in-context learning with a large language model.

The key points from the abstract are:

- In-context learning is a new paradigm where a large pre-trained language model observes a test instance and a few training examples (prompts) as input and directly generates the output.

- Performance depends strongly on the selected prompts. 

- They propose an efficient method to retrieve good prompts using annotated data and a language model.

- The idea is to estimate the probability of the output given the input and candidate prompt using the language model. Then label prompts as positive/negative based on this probability.

- Train a prompt retriever on this labeled data using contrastive learning.

- Evaluate on 3 sequence-to-sequence semantic parsing tasks and show their method substantially outperforms prior approaches.

So in summary, it is trying to address the problem of how to automatically select good training examples to use as prompts for in-context learning in large language models.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a one-paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Efficient Prompt Retrieval (EPR), a method for retrieving good training examples to serve as prompts for in-context learning in large language models. EPR trains a prompt retriever by using a scoring language model to label training examples as positive or negative prompts for other training examples. Specifically, for each input-output training pair, candidate prompts are retrieved and scored by estimating the probability of the output given the input and candidate prompt. The top-scoring candidates are labeled as positive prompts and the bottom-scoring ones as negatives. From this labeled data, a dense retriever is trained with a contrastive loss. EPR is evaluated on semantic parsing tasks where natural language utterances are mapped to meaning representations. Experiments show it substantially outperforms prior prompt retrieval methods when the scoring and inference language models are the same or when the scoring model acts as a proxy for a larger inference model. The results demonstrate that training a retriever using language model scores is an effective approach for retrieving high-quality prompts, leading to improved in-context learning performance.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an efficient method for retrieving training examples, called prompts, to provide as context to large pre-trained language models when performing in-context learning. The key idea is to use a scoring language model, which can be smaller than the inference model, to label training examples as good or bad prompts for other examples based on the probability the scoring model assigns to generating the target output. These labeled examples are used to train an efficient dense retriever using contrastive learning. At test time, the retriever identifies similar examples from the training set to provide as prompts along with the test instance to the large inference language model. This allows prompting the inference model efficiently without expensive scoring of all training examples at runtime. The method, called Efficient Prompt Retrieval (EPR), is evaluated on semantic parsing tasks and substantially outperforms prior work on prompt retrieval, including when using the scoring model as a proxy for larger inference models like GPT-3.
