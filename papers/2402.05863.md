# [How Well Can LLMs Negotiate? NegotiationArena Platform and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05863)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Negotiation plays a key role in human interactions and will be an important capability for AI agents acting on behalf of humans. However, it is not well understood how well large language models (LLMs) can negotiate.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop NegotiationArena, an open-source platform to evaluate and probe the negotiation abilities of LLM agents. 
- They implement 3 types of negotiation scenarios: resource allocation games, trading games, and buyer/seller games. The scenarios allow for multi-turn dialogues between agents.

Key Contributions:

1) NegotiationArena Platform:
- Flexible framework to create negotiation games between LLMs with customizable settings.
- Logs entire conversations and negotiation outcomes.

2) Benchmarking LLMs: 
- Compare negotiation performance of GPT-3, GPT-3.5, Claude 2, Claude 2.1, and GPT-4.
- Find GPT-4 performs the best overall, but other models can boost performance through tactics like pretending to be desperate.

3) Analysis of Behaviors:
- LLMs exhibit social negotiation tactics similar to humans like using insults or pleading.
- Models display irrational biases like anchoring on initial prices and split-the-difference heuristics.  
- General limitations in understanding games and math.

Overall, the work introduces a valuable platform for the community while providing insights into strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in strategic interactions. Evaluating agent negotiation abilities aids progress in developing more robust and helpful AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces NegotiationArena, an open-source platform for evaluating and probing the negotiation abilities of large language model agents across different scenarios, and uses it to benchmark current LLMs, identify their capabilities and limitations, and uncover interesting behaviors like the use of social tactics and manifestations of irrational biases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of NegotiationArena, an open-source framework to evaluate and probe the negotiation abilities of large language model (LLM) agents. Specifically:

1) The paper develops NegotiationArena, a flexible platform to study negotiation behavior between LLMs across different scenarios like resource allocation, trading, and buying/selling. 

2) It provides quantitative evaluations showing how well current LLMs like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude 2.1, and Claude 2 perform when negotiating against each other in the scenarios enabled by NegotiationArena.

3) It offers new insights into the social and irrational behaviors exhibited by LLM agents during negotiations, including the effects of pretending desperation, aggression, anchoring bias, and sensitivity to numeric scales.

4) NegotiationArena offers a new way to assess LLMs beyond static question-answering benchmarks, enabling the study of more complex and dynamic LLM interactions.

In summary, the main contribution is NegotiationArena itself as an open platform for the community to advance research into LLM negotiations and interactions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper are:

- NegotiationArena - The name of the open-source framework developed to evaluate and probe the negotiation abilities of LLM agents.

- Large language models (LLMs) - The types of models studied, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude 2.1, and Claude 2.

- Negotiation - The key capability studied in interactions between LLM agents across different scenarios like resource allocation, trading, and buying/selling.

- Game theory - Concepts from game theory like the ultimatum game are used to design negotiation scenarios and analyze rational vs irrational behaviors. 

- Irrationality - Evidence of irrational biases like anchoring bias and numerosity effects are studied in LLM agent interactions.

- Social behavior - Effects of hostile, desperate, aggressive social behavior prompts on negotiation outcomes are analyzed. 

- Theory of mind - Negotiation requires agents to understand and reason about other agents, assessing LLM capabilities.

- Flexible dialogues - Multi-turn negotiations with flexible proposals and counterproposals between agents.

So in summary, key terms cover negotiation, game theory, irrational biases, social factors, theory of mind, and flexible dialogues between LLM agents.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper "How Well Can LLMs Negotiate? NegotiationArena Platform and Analysis":

1. The paper introduces a new platform called NegotiationArena for evaluating the negotiation abilities of large language models (LLMs). What were some of the key design considerations and challenges in developing a platform to facilitate negotiations between LLMs? How flexible and extensible is the platform to incorporate new scenarios or agents?

2. The paper evaluates negotiation behaviors of LLM agents in 3 types of scenarios - resource exchange, multi-turn ultimatum games, and buyer-seller negotiations. What are some other real-world negotiation scenarios that could be implemented in NegotiationArena to further probe LLM capabilities? What modifications would need to be made?

3. Social behaviors like pretending desperation or aggression gave LLMs tactical advantages in negotiations. However, the paper notes cunning behaviors can be high risk. What metrics could be used to quantify the risk vs. reward tradeoff? How could the platform be enhanced to study emerging long-term social dynamics?  

4. The analysis reveals irrational behaviors in LLM negotiators like anchoring bias and sensitivity to numerical scales. How prevalent were heuristics vs. optimal strategies? What tests could isolate memorization of negotiation tactics vs. generalized intelligence?

5. The paper contrasts negotiation games with fixed question answering benchmarks for evaluating LLMs. What unique insights did the NegotiationArena games surface over existing benchmarks? What cognitive capabilities were directly tested through negotiations that may be obscured in static evaluations?

6. How scalable is the NegotiationArena platform to facilitate negotiations with large numbers of agents? What architectural changes would need to be made to transition from simultaneous paired negotiations to complex multi-agent deals?

7. Could adversarial negotiation scenarios like good cop/bad cop be implemented to surface sophisticated manipulation capabilities in LLMs? What challenges would arise in prompting more nuanced social motivations? How could agent objectives evolve over time?

8. The LLM agents relied primarily on pretrained capabilities. Could NegotiationArena be used as an environment for reinforcement learning or self-play to cultivate more advanced negotiation skills over time? What policy architecture would you propose as a starting point?

9. The paper focuses on competitive negotiations with independent agent interests. How suitable would cooperative negotiation scenarios be for evaluating social intelligence and theory of mind in LLMs? What implementation challenges might arise?

10. What lessons has the NegotiationArena work provided regarding real-world deployment of LLMs as automated agents representing human users? What additional testing would be prudent before granting high-stakes negotiation responsibilities?
