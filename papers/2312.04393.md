# [PhysHOI: Physics-Based Imitation of Dynamic Human-Object Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04393)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents PhysHOI, the first physics-based whole-body human-object interaction (HOI) imitation framework that can learn various dynamic interaction skills from kinematic HOI demonstrations without needing task-specific rewards. A key innovation is the introduction of a general-purpose contact graph to explicitly model the contact relations between body parts and objects, enhancing the common kinematic HOI representation. Based on this, a contact graph reward is proposed which, when multiplied with standard kinematic rewards, can effectively guide precise object manipulation without local optima. To facilitate research, the authors contribute the BallPlay dataset with 8 whole-body basketball skill demonstrations. Experiments on diverse skills like basketball dribbling and whole-body grasping demonstrate PhysHOI's ability to reproduce complex dynamic HOI, significantly improving upon previous state-of-the-art in terms of success rate and trajectory accuracy. By removing the need for tedious task-specific reward engineering, PhysHOI provides a simple yet effective approach to mimic a wide variety of realistic human-object interactions in simulation.
