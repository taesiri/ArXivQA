# [Soft Frequency Capping for Improved Ad Click Prediction in Yahoo Gemini   Native](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05052)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from this paper:

This paper discusses incorporating a "soft frequency capping" feature into Yahoo's OLSET click prediction algorithm for their Gemini native ad platform. The goal is to better model user fatigue from repeatedly seeing the same ads, instead of just applying hard frequency capping rules that block over-shown ads. They treat frequency as a user-ad feature, learn frequency weight vectors via logistic regression in OLSET's stochastic gradient descent training, and add the appropriate weight during serving to adjust predicted click-through rate (pCTR). Comprehensive stats on ad frequencies show CTR substantially drops with more views, especially for older users. Offline and online experiments demonstrate significant gains from using their soft frequency capping approach over hard caps, including over 7% higher revenue online. The enhanced OLSET model has been running in Yahoo Gemini production for over a year. Key contributions are the stats and observations of user ad fatigue, the simplicity yet effectiveness of their modeling approach to capture fatigue via this frequency feature, and demonstrated major performance gains in large-scale real-world experiments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

Yahoo incorporates a soft frequency capping approach into its user-less click prediction model by treating frequency as a user-ad feature, achieving a 7.3% revenue lift in online experiments and pushing the enhanced model to production.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Comprehensive statistics and observations regarding the frequency feature (i.e., number of times a user views an ad) and its significant impact on click-through rate (CTR) in an online advertising system. It shows how different user groups are affected by ad repetition.

2. A soft frequency capping (SFC) approach to incorporate the frequency feature into the Offset click prediction model by treating it as a user-ad feature. This allows the model to learn frequency weight vectors via logistic regression as part of the overall model training.

3. Extensive offline and online performance evaluation showing significant lifts in accuracy metrics and revenue compared to the previous hard frequency capping rules. The online evaluation serving real Yahoo Gemini users showed a 7.3% revenue lift.

4. The SFC enhanced Offset model was deployed in production for over a year, generating substantial additional revenue for Yahoo's Gemini native advertising platform.

In summary, the key contribution is a simple yet very effective soft frequency capping method to account for user ad fatigue in click prediction, along with supporting statistics and superior online performance over rules-based frequency capping.

The paper proposes a soft frequency capping approach to incorporate a frequency feature into the OFFSET click prediction model used by Yahoo's Gemini native advertising platform. Key aspects include handling frequency as a user-ad feature, comparison to a rule-based hard frequency capping approach, offline and online evaluation showing significant revenue lifts, and analysis of how ad fatigue differs across user demographics. So the main technical themes relate to recommendation systems, ad prediction, frequency capping, and evaluation of a deployed system.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the soft frequency capping method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using campaign as the ad feature ($A_f$) and last week as the time window ($T_f$) provided the best performance. What is the intuition behind these choices and how might other options like creative or last month impact the effectiveness of the method?

2. The concept of "user fatigue" is central to this work. How precisely is user fatigue characterized in this paper, both through the statistics presented and the modeling approach taken? What other ways could user fatigue be represented?  

3. Soft frequency capping is treated as a user-ad feature in the Offset model. What is the reasoning behind this choice and what are the implications of handling frequency like other user-ad features? How does this differ from a rule-based or external frequency capping method?

4. Explain the offline evaluation approach in detail - what metrics are used and why, how are the models trained, and what results indicate the superiority of soft frequency capping? What potential limitations exist in the offline evaluation?

5. The online evaluation shows significant revenue lift from soft frequency capping. Discuss the details of the experimental setup. Why start with a hybrid model before switching fully to soft frequency capping? What explains the scale of the measured improvements?

6. How precisely does user fatigue vary across different crowds like age groups and genders according to the statistics presented? What explanations are offered for the observations made? Can you think of alternative hypotheses? 

7. The concept of "verticals" is mentioned as a way of segmenting Yahoo's properties. Discuss what a vertical encapsulates in this context and why frequency capping may need to be handled differently for some verticals.

8. The choice of binning is justified in the paper to avoid making assumptions about the functional dependency between frequency and CTR. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of binning relative to using a parameterized model. How could the binning approach be refined?

9. What changes would need to be made to the soft frequency capping method to incorporate other features like recency (time since last ad view)? What statistics would need to be collected and why?

10. How would you evaluate the real-world business impact of implementing soft frequency capping beyond the online metrics discussed in the paper? What other experiments could confirm the effectiveness of this approach?
