# [Soft Frequency Capping for Improved Ad Click Prediction in Yahoo Gemini   Native](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05052)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from this paper:

This paper discusses incorporating a "soft frequency capping" feature into Yahoo's OLSET click prediction algorithm for their Gemini native ad platform. The goal is to better model user fatigue from repeatedly seeing the same ads, instead of just applying hard frequency capping rules that block over-shown ads. They treat frequency as a user-ad feature, learn frequency weight vectors via logistic regression in OLSET's stochastic gradient descent training, and add the appropriate weight during serving to adjust predicted click-through rate (pCTR). Comprehensive stats on ad frequencies show CTR substantially drops with more views, especially for older users. Offline and online experiments demonstrate significant gains from using their soft frequency capping approach over hard caps, including over 7% higher revenue online. The enhanced OLSET model has been running in Yahoo Gemini production for over a year. Key contributions are the stats and observations of user ad fatigue, the simplicity yet effectiveness of their modeling approach to capture fatigue via this frequency feature, and demonstrated major performance gains in large-scale real-world experiments.
