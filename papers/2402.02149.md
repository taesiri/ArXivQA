# [Improving Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems Using Optimal Posterior   Covariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02149)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper focuses on zero-shot diffusion models for solving inverse problems like image denoising, inpainting, deblurring and super-resolution. Recent works have proposed different techniques to guide the sampling process of pre-trained unconditional diffusion models using the measurement data, to solve inverse problems without requiring retraining. This paper provides a unified interpretation that these techniques make isotropic Gaussian approximations to the intractable posterior distribution over clean images to estimate the conditional posterior mean. It then proposes to optimize the posterior covariance to improve upon these approximations.

Key Ideas and Contributions:

1) Unified Interpretation: The paper shows that existing zero-shot diffusion solvers can be viewed as making isotropic Gaussian approximations with different covariance values to approximate the intractable posterior distribution over clean images given noisy images.

2) Limitations of Handcrafted Covariance: The heuristically designed covariance in prior works is suboptimal. The paper proposes to optimize the posterior covariance based on maximum likelihood estimation to improve recent zero-shot diffusion solvers.

3) Plug-and-Play Optimization: Two approaches are developed to obtain optimal diagonal posterior covariance from pre-trained models without retraining - (i) converting available reverse covariance predictions, (ii) Monte Carlo estimation when reverse prediction is unavailable. 

4) Significantly Enhances Performance: Experiments show that simply replacing the heuristic covariance with the proposed optimized covariance during the last steps of sampling leads to notable gain over state-of-the-art across various inverse problems and datasets.

5) Enhances Robustness: The optimized covariance also makes recent diffusion solvers more robust to hyperparameters.

In summary, the key contribution is a simple yet effective plugin that enhances existing diffusion solvers by optimizing their posterior covariance approximation using available pre-trained models, without needing retraining. Experiments demonstrate clear improvements in accuracy and robustness.
