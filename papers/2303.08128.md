# ViperGPT: Visual Inference via Python Execution for Reasoning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we create an interpretable and generalizable approach for answering complex visual queries that requires both visual processing and reasoning? The authors argue that the dominant end-to-end deep learning models for visual tasks do not differentiate between visual processing and logical reasoning steps. This limits their interpretability and generalization capabilities. Their proposed solution is a framework called Viper that leverages code generation models to flexibly compose specialized vision and language models into modular programs based on textual queries. The key ideas are:- Using an API to specify available vision and language modules (object detection, depth estimation etc).- Getting a code generation model (Codex) to produce Python code that calls these modules to answer the query. - Executing this generated code to produce the final output.The central hypothesis seems to be that this program synthesis approach will lead to systems that are more interpretable, logical, flexible and generalizable for answering complex visual queries, compared to end-to-end models. The results on various visual reasoning tasks appear to confirm this hypothesis.In summary, the core research question is how to create systems that can understand the visual world and answer queries about it in a more human-like compositional way, by explicitly differentiating between visual processing and logical reasoning. Viper explores program synthesis as a promising approach for this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a framework called Viper that leverages code generation models to compose vision and language models into subroutines to answer complex visual queries. The key idea is to generate Python code using a large language model like Codex, provide it an API to available visual modules, and execute the generated code to produce an output for the query.2. Achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot results on visual grounding, compositional image question answering, knowledge-based image QA, and video QA tasks. The paper shows Viper can effectively compose modules to perform well on these tasks without any training on the task datasets. 3. Developing a Python library to enable rapid research and development of program synthesis methods for visual tasks. The code and framework will be open-sourced to promote further work in this direction.4. Demonstrating various benefits of the Viper framework like interpretability, logical reasoning, flexibility, compositionality, and adaptability to advances in vision/language models. The modular structure and explicit reasoning steps provide transparency compared to end-to-end models.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and evaluating a novel framework for synthesizing programs that combine vision and language modules to answer complex visual queries in a zero-shot, interpretable manner. The model achieves strong performance without task-specific training by leveraging code generation and execution.
