# [PIRB: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Polish Dense and Hybrid Text   Retrieval Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text information retrieval is important for search engines, QA systems, etc. but most research has focused on high-resource languages like English. There has been little work in this area for Polish.
- There are not many standardized Polish datasets or benchmarks to evaluate retrieval methods, limiting research progress.
- There is a lack of high-quality retrieval models for Polish that leverage recent advances like transformer encoders.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new comprehensive benchmark for Polish text retrieval called PIRB, consisting of 41 diverse tasks including 10 new datasets covering topics like medicine, law, physics etc.  
- Evaluate over 20 existing sparse and dense retrieval methods for Polish using PIRB, including strong baseline models trained by the authors.
- Propose a 3-step process to train state-of-the-art dense retrievers for a target language:
   1) Knowledge distillation from an English teacher encoder
   2) Supervised fine-tuning on a retrieval dataset 
   3) Creating lightweight hybrid retrieval system combining dense and sparse methods using learning-to-rank.
- Validate the solution by training new Polish encoders using this method which outperform prior approaches on PIRB.


Main Contributions:
- First standardized and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Polish text retrieval covering 41 diverse tasks
- Detailed evaluation of over 20 existing methods with PIRB, establishing strong baselines
- Effective 3-step approach to train high-quality dense retrievers for a target language with limited data  
- State-of-the-art Polish text encoders significantly outperforming prior methods when evaluated on PIRB

The paper introduces an important benchmark to drive progress for Polish retrieval and proposes an end-to-end solution to train well-performing models.
