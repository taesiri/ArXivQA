# [Unified Visual Transformer Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08243)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to effectively compress Vision Transformer (ViT) models to reduce their computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. The paper proposes a unified framework called UVC that integrates three compression techniques - pruning, layer skipping, and knowledge distillation - and jointly optimizes them under an overall budget constraint. The key hypothesis is that jointly optimizing these techniques in an end-to-end manner will allow more aggressive compression of ViTs compared to applying the techniques individually or sequentially.Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:- Enforcing mixed-level group sparsity via pruning (head dimension, head number, block level) is more flexible for trading off accuracy and efficiency compared to uniform coarse- or fine-grained pruning.- Strategically adjusting skip connections can effectively prune Transformer blocks without compromising accuracy.- Incorporating knowledge distillation further improves the accuracy of the compressed model.- Jointly optimizing pruning, skipping, and distillation under a unified constrained optimization framework can achieve better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs than applying the techniques individually or sequentially.Through experiments on DeiT and T2T-ViT models, the paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UVC framework and show that it consistently outperforms other compression methods, especially at high compression rates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a unified vision transformer compression (UVC) framework that integrates three different compression strategies - pruning, block skipping, and knowledge distillation - into one joint optimization framework. Some key points:- The paper notes that existing works on vision transformer (ViT) compression have focused on individual techniques like pruning or distillation, but not systematically compared or combined multiple techniques. - The proposed UVC framework allows jointly optimizing model weights, layer-wise pruning ratios/masks, and skip connections under one unified formulation and overall budget constraint. - This is the first framework to leverage block skipping as a way to compress ViTs by removing redundant blocks. The paper argues ViTs are uniquely suited for this due to their uniform block structure.- UVC is formulated as a constrained optimization problem and solved end-to-end using a primal-dual algorithm.- Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT and T2T-ViT backbones demonstrate UVC consistently outperforms recent compression methods. For example, DeiT-Tiny is compressed to 50% FLOPs with only 0.3% accuracy drop.In summary, the main contribution is presenting the first all-in-one ViT compression framework that can jointly optimize and automate the composition of multiple complementary techniques under a single resource budget constraint. This is shown to achieve better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs than prior works.
