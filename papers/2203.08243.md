# [Unified Visual Transformer Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08243)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to effectively compress Vision Transformer (ViT) models to reduce their computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. The paper proposes a unified framework called UVC that integrates three compression techniques - pruning, layer skipping, and knowledge distillation - and jointly optimizes them under an overall budget constraint. The key hypothesis is that jointly optimizing these techniques in an end-to-end manner will allow more aggressive compression of ViTs compared to applying the techniques individually or sequentially.Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:- Enforcing mixed-level group sparsity via pruning (head dimension, head number, block level) is more flexible for trading off accuracy and efficiency compared to uniform coarse- or fine-grained pruning.- Strategically adjusting skip connections can effectively prune Transformer blocks without compromising accuracy.- Incorporating knowledge distillation further improves the accuracy of the compressed model.- Jointly optimizing pruning, skipping, and distillation under a unified constrained optimization framework can achieve better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs than applying the techniques individually or sequentially.Through experiments on DeiT and T2T-ViT models, the paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UVC framework and show that it consistently outperforms other compression methods, especially at high compression rates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a unified vision transformer compression (UVC) framework that integrates three different compression strategies - pruning, block skipping, and knowledge distillation - into one joint optimization framework. Some key points:- The paper notes that existing works on vision transformer (ViT) compression have focused on individual techniques like pruning or distillation, but not systematically compared or combined multiple techniques. - The proposed UVC framework allows jointly optimizing model weights, layer-wise pruning ratios/masks, and skip connections under one unified formulation and overall budget constraint. - This is the first framework to leverage block skipping as a way to compress ViTs by removing redundant blocks. The paper argues ViTs are uniquely suited for this due to their uniform block structure.- UVC is formulated as a constrained optimization problem and solved end-to-end using a primal-dual algorithm.- Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT and T2T-ViT backbones demonstrate UVC consistently outperforms recent compression methods. For example, DeiT-Tiny is compressed to 50% FLOPs with only 0.3% accuracy drop.In summary, the main contribution is presenting the first all-in-one ViT compression framework that can jointly optimize and automate the composition of multiple complementary techniques under a single resource budget constraint. This is shown to achieve better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs than prior works.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a 1 sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a unified vision transformer compression framework called UVC that jointly optimizes three compression techniques - pruning, layer skipping, and knowledge distillation - in an end-to-end manner under a budget constraint to aggressively reduce computational costs of vision transformers without losing much accuracy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:- The paper introduces a unified vision transformer compression (UVC) framework that integrates pruning, layer skipping, and knowledge distillation. This is novel compared to prior work that typically focuses on only one or two compression techniques in isolation. The joint optimization approach in UVC seems more advanced than simply cascading individual techniques.- The results demonstrate UVC can achieve much higher compression rates (e.g. 50-60% FLOPs reduction) for vision transformers with minimal accuracy loss compared to state-of-the-art methods like SViTE. This suggests UVC more fully exploits the compression potential.- UVC is evaluated on popular ViT models like DeiT and T2T-ViT on ImageNet. This follows conventions in the field, though some recent papers have also benchmarked on other datasets. The code release will facilitate direct comparisons.- For pruning, UVC introduces mixed-level group sparsity (head and neuron level) which is more flexible than techniques applied only at one granularity. The block-dropping via skip connections is also a unique aspect not explored before for ViTs.- The ablation studies provide useful insights on the contribution of the different components in UVC. The visualizations of the learned connectivity patterns also offer some interpretability.Overall, UVC seems to advance the state-of-the-art by more thoroughly investigating joint optimization of multiple compression techniques tailored for vision transformers. The efficiency gains over other methods are noteworthy. Some interesting future directions could be extending UVC to other ViT models and tasks, dynamically optimizing the compressed models, and incorporating additional compression approaches like quantization.
