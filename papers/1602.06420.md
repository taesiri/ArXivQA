# [A Probabilistic Dependent Type System based on Non-Deterministic Beta   Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06420)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research goals of this paper appear to be:

1. To introduce the notion of Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems (PDTS) by developing a functional language called λPρ^{ΣBOOL} that combines dependent types with probabilistic semantics based on non-deterministic beta reduction. 

2. To show that a probabilistic logic can be derived from the PDTS framework using the Curry-Howard isomorphism. This logic is claimed to provide a universal representation for finite discrete distributions.

3. To demonstrate an equivalence between a subclass of PDTS called Dependent Type Networks (DTNs) and Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). This establishes that both DTNs and MLNs have equivalent expressive power in terms of the distributions they can represent.

So in summary, the central goals seem to be introducing the PDTS framework, deriving a probabilistic logic from it, and showing the expressive equivalence with MLNs for the DTN subclass of PDTS. The main research contributions appear to be the formulation of PDTS itself, the associated probabilistic logic, and the equivalence result connecting PDTS/DTNs to the well-established framework of MLNs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. The introduction of Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems (PDTS), which combine dependent types with probabilistic/stochastic functions. This extends previous work combining simple types and probabilities.

2. A specific PDTS called λP ρ^{ΣBOOL} is presented, which includes dependent sums and products, stochastic functions based on non-deterministic beta reduction, and base types like BOOL. It has a sampling-based semantics.

3. The relationship between a subset of PDTS called Dependent Type Networks (DTNs) and Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) is analyzed. A probabilistic Curry-Howard isomorphism is shown, proving that DTNs and MLNs have equivalent expressive power for finite discrete distributions. 

4. Through this equivalence, a probabilistic logic is derived from the DTN framework, providing an alternative approach to existing probabilistic logics.

In summary, the key innovation seems to be the development of Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems, along with the specific instantiation λP ρ^{ΣBOOL}, and showing the connection to Markov Logic Networks via a probabilistic Curry-Howard isomorphism for the DTN subset. This provides a new way to represent and reason about probabilistic information in rich dependent type systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper introduces a new framework called Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems (PDTS) which combines dependent types with probabilistic functions, provides a probabilistic semantics based on non-deterministic beta reduction, and shows how a probabilistic logic can be derived from this framework via the Curry-Howard isomorphism which is equivalent in expressive power to Markov Logic Networks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is how I see it comparing to other related work:

- This paper introduces the idea of Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems (PDTS). As far as I can tell, this is a novel framework not explored in other literature. It combines ideas from dependent type theory and probabilistic programming to create a typed lambda calculus that can represent probabilistic computations.

- Most prior work on probabilistic programming languages like Church and Anglican are based on simply typed lambda calculus rather than dependent types. The use of dependent types allows reasoning about distributions where the return type itself may be probabilistic. This provides additional expressiveness.

- There has been some prior work combining probability and types, such as using probabilistic type judgements. However, these do not provide a full language and semantics for probabilistic dependent types like this paper does. The PDTS seems to be a more comprehensive framework.

- The relationships shown between PDTS and probabilistic logic connect this work to that area. However, the probabilistic logic derived from the Curry-Howard correspondence seems different than existing probabilistic logics. It provides an alternative formulation.

- The equivalence result between a class of PDTS and Markov logic networks is novel. It connects PDTS to a well-studied probabilistic representation. This helps establish the semantics and capabilities of the PDTS framework.

In summary, the paper introduces a new framework (PDTS) that combines several ideas in a novel way. It relates this framework to other representations like probabilistic logic and Markov networks. The dependencies, typing semantics, and equivalence results seem to be unique contributions not found in other literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the probabilistic dependent type system to include more general base types beyond booleans and units. The authors suggest this could allow for factor graph message passing algorithms to be used for evaluating expressions.

- Investigating algorithmic possibilities for performing inference that arise from the equivalence shown between dependent type networks and Markov logic networks. Specifically, algorithms for inference in one representation could potentially be transformed to perform inference in the other. 

- Exploring more semantic possibilities for probabilistic dependent type systems, beyond the sampling semantics given in the paper. For example, a measure transformer semantics could be an interesting avenue to explore.

- Applying probabilistic dependent type systems to real-world problems and domains to demonstrate their usefulness. The authors suggest the framework could be well-suited for representing distributions relevant to particular application areas.

- Comparing probabilistic dependent type systems to other representations of probabilistic logic, such as those based on simply-typed languages. This could reveal relative strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches.

- Investigating properties of probabilistic dependent type systems, such as correctness, complexity, expressiveness and learnability of models. This could help understand their theoretical capabilities and limitations.

In summary, the main directions seem to focus on expanding the theoretical development of probabilistic dependent type systems, exploring their applications, and comparing them to other probabilistic logic frameworks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems (PDTS) which combine features of dependent type systems from intuitionistic type theory with probabilistic semantics based on non-deterministic beta reduction. The authors present a lambda calculus called λPρΣBOOL which includes dependent products and sums as well as primitives for sampling distributions. They provide a sampling-based semantics for this language using weighted beta reduction relations. They show how this framework gives rise to a probabilistic logic using the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs. They prove properties about preservation and progress in the type system. Finally, they demonstrate an equivalence between a subclass of PDTS called Dependent Type Networks and Markov Logic Networks, showing they can represent the same class of probability distributions. The key contribution is presenting a framework that unifies dependent types with probabilistic reasoning in a principled way based on type theory.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems (PDTS) as an expansion of intuitionistic type theory to include stochastic functions. It defines a functional language called λPρΣBOOL which includes dependent sums and products. The language is given a sampling-based semantics using non-deterministic beta reduction, where each reduction step occurs with an associated probability. 

The paper then shows how a probabilistic logic can be derived from the PDTS framework using the Curry-Howard isomorphism between proofs and programs. This logic is shown to provide a universal representation for finite discrete distributions, like Markov Logic Networks. An equivalence is demonstrated between a class of PDTS called Dependent Type Networks and Markov Logic Networks through mutual canonical translations. This establishes the expressive power of PDTS and provides additional semantics through the equivalence to factor graph models. Overall, the work develops PDTS as an approach to probabilistic programming with dependent types.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems (PDTS) by starting with a deterministic dependent type system based on intuitionistic type theory, including dependent sums and products. This is expanded to include stochastic functions to form the language λPρ^{ΣΒΟΟL}, which allows probabilistic reasoning. The semantics of this language is given by non-deterministic beta reduction, where reduction corresponds to sampling. This provides a framework to derive a probabilistic logic via the Curry-Howard isomorphism. The probabilistic logic is shown to be expressively equivalent to Markov Logic Networks, providing a way to represent arbitrary discrete distributions. Overall, the PDTS framework allows probabilistic inference through sampling reduction sequences in the type system.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It introduces the notion of Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems (PDTS). This extends previous work on probabilistic type systems based on the simply-typed lambda calculus to include dependent types.

- It provides a semantics for PDTS based on non-deterministic beta reduction, where reduction corresponds to sampling. Expressions can denote distributions across terms or types.

- It focuses on a particular class of PDTS called Dependent Type Networks (DTNs) and shows these are equivalent to Markov Logic Networks. This demonstrates that PDTS and the sampling semantics are reasonable, since Markov Logic Networks are known to be expressive probabilistic models. 

- The equivalence arises through a probabilistic version of the Curry-Howard isomorphism, where probabilistic logical formulas are represented as types. This suggests new probabilistic logic formulations can emerge naturally from PDTS.

- Since MLNs and DTNs are shown to be equivalent and universally expressive for finite discrete distributions, this also demonstrates the expressive power of PDTS in general.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing PDTS and providing a semantics via sampling, as well as demonstrating expressiveness and connections to logical inference by establishing equivalence with Markov Logic Networks. The Curry-Howard correspondence provides justification for the PDTS formulation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on skimming through the paper, some of the key terms and concepts that appear central to this work include:

- Probabilistic dependent type systems (PDTS) - The paper introduces this notion by expanding intuitionistic type theory to include stochastic functions and providing semantics based on non-deterministic beta reduction. 

- Sampling semantics - The probabilistic type system is given a semantics based on sampling, where beta-rho reduction corresponds to sampling from a distribution over terms and types.

- Curry-Howard isomorphism - A probabilistic logic is derived from the PDTS using the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs. 

- Dependent type networks (DTNs) - A subclass of PDTS studied in the paper which is shown to be equivalent to Markov logic networks.

- Formulae as types - The equivalence between DTNs and Markov logic networks relies on a probabilistic analogue of the formulae as types interpretation that relates proofs and formulae in the type system.

- Discrete distributions - Both DTNs and Markov logic networks are shown to provide universal representations for finite discrete distributions.

So in summary, the key themes seem to be introducing probabilistic dependent type systems, providing a sampling semantics for them, deriving a probabilistic logic via Curry-Howard, and establishing connections to Markov logic networks and discrete distributions. The notions of PDTS, sampling semantics, Curry-Howard correspondence, and DTNs appear most central.
