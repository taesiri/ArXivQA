# [A Probabilistic Dependent Type System based on Non-Deterministic Beta   Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06420)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research goals of this paper appear to be:1. To introduce the notion of Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems (PDTS) by developing a functional language called λPρ^{ΣBOOL} that combines dependent types with probabilistic semantics based on non-deterministic beta reduction. 2. To show that a probabilistic logic can be derived from the PDTS framework using the Curry-Howard isomorphism. This logic is claimed to provide a universal representation for finite discrete distributions.3. To demonstrate an equivalence between a subclass of PDTS called Dependent Type Networks (DTNs) and Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). This establishes that both DTNs and MLNs have equivalent expressive power in terms of the distributions they can represent.So in summary, the central goals seem to be introducing the PDTS framework, deriving a probabilistic logic from it, and showing the expressive equivalence with MLNs for the DTN subclass of PDTS. The main research contributions appear to be the formulation of PDTS itself, the associated probabilistic logic, and the equivalence result connecting PDTS/DTNs to the well-established framework of MLNs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The introduction of Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems (PDTS), which combine dependent types with probabilistic/stochastic functions. This extends previous work combining simple types and probabilities.2. A specific PDTS called λP ρ^{ΣBOOL} is presented, which includes dependent sums and products, stochastic functions based on non-deterministic beta reduction, and base types like BOOL. It has a sampling-based semantics.3. The relationship between a subset of PDTS called Dependent Type Networks (DTNs) and Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) is analyzed. A probabilistic Curry-Howard isomorphism is shown, proving that DTNs and MLNs have equivalent expressive power for finite discrete distributions. 4. Through this equivalence, a probabilistic logic is derived from the DTN framework, providing an alternative approach to existing probabilistic logics.In summary, the key innovation seems to be the development of Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems, along with the specific instantiation λP ρ^{ΣBOOL}, and showing the connection to Markov Logic Networks via a probabilistic Curry-Howard isomorphism for the DTN subset. This provides a new way to represent and reason about probabilistic information in rich dependent type systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper introduces a new framework called Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems (PDTS) which combines dependent types with probabilistic functions, provides a probabilistic semantics based on non-deterministic beta reduction, and shows how a probabilistic logic can be derived from this framework via the Curry-Howard isomorphism which is equivalent in expressive power to Markov Logic Networks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is how I see it comparing to other related work:- This paper introduces the idea of Probabilistic Dependent Type Systems (PDTS). As far as I can tell, this is a novel framework not explored in other literature. It combines ideas from dependent type theory and probabilistic programming to create a typed lambda calculus that can represent probabilistic computations.- Most prior work on probabilistic programming languages like Church and Anglican are based on simply typed lambda calculus rather than dependent types. The use of dependent types allows reasoning about distributions where the return type itself may be probabilistic. This provides additional expressiveness.- There has been some prior work combining probability and types, such as using probabilistic type judgements. However, these do not provide a full language and semantics for probabilistic dependent types like this paper does. The PDTS seems to be a more comprehensive framework.- The relationships shown between PDTS and probabilistic logic connect this work to that area. However, the probabilistic logic derived from the Curry-Howard correspondence seems different than existing probabilistic logics. It provides an alternative formulation.- The equivalence result between a class of PDTS and Markov logic networks is novel. It connects PDTS to a well-studied probabilistic representation. This helps establish the semantics and capabilities of the PDTS framework.In summary, the paper introduces a new framework (PDTS) that combines several ideas in a novel way. It relates this framework to other representations like probabilistic logic and Markov networks. The dependencies, typing semantics, and equivalence results seem to be unique contributions not found in other literature.
