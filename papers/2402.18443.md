# [LeMo-NADe: Multi-Parameter Neural Architecture Discovery with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18443)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Designing efficient neural network architectures is time-consuming, requiring extensive expert knowledge. This becomes more challenging for resource-constrained edge devices where parameters like power consumption, model size, inference speed and CO2 emissions need to be considered. Traditional neural architecture search (NAS) methods rely on pre-defined search spaces, fail to innovate, and focus primarily on accuracy over other relevant metrics.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose LeMo-NADe, a large language model (LLM) guided neural architecture discovery framework that can generate novel architectures without a pre-defined search space. It uses an iterative approach with an expert system that generates instructions for the LLM based on user-defined metrics and thresholds. The LLM progressively refines the neural architecture over multiple iterations. Metrics considered include accuracy, model parameters, runtime, energy consumption, FPS and CO2 emissions.

Key Contributions:
1) Formulate and design a search-space agnostic neural architecture discovery framework using LLMs 
2) Propose an expert system with associated rules and metrics to drive the LLM towards discovering architectures
3) Implement LeMo-NADe as an efficient, configurable tool for immediate use and future extensions
4) Evaluate LeMo-NADe thoroughly on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet16-120 datasets for diverse settings, showing ability to generate high-performing architectures in only a few hours that meet user-defined constraints

In summary, LeMo-NADe is a novel framework that leverages LLMs to automatically generate tailored neural networks for edge devices based on various user-defined metrics beyond just accuracy. It discovers innovative architectures from scratch without relying on predefined search spaces.
