## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
This paper addresses the problem of energy-efficient data offloading for edge learning. IoT devices need to offload their data to an edge server for real-time machine learning model training. However, high-dimensional sensor data with heavy volumes incur significant energy consumption during offloading for resource-constrained IoT devices. Existing works define data importance to selectively offload data, but they have high communication overhead when handling complex high-dimensional data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel architecture called Joint Data Deepening and Prefetching (JD2P) for feature-by-feature offloading control. It comprises two key techniques:

1) Data Deepening: Features of each data sample are sequentially offloaded based on their importance determined by data embedding techniques like PCA. Offloading stops when the features sent so far are enough to classify the sample correctly. This reduces total offloaded data.  

2) Data Prefetching: Some potential future features of data samples are proactively offloaded during model training time to extend the offloading duration and improve energy efficiency. Optimal prefetching control is designed by formulating a stochastic optimization problem.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of JD2P architecture for energy-efficient edge learning through joint data deepening and prefetching
- Design of data deepening technique to reduce offloaded data amount without degrading learning accuracy
- Development of data prefetching method to improve energy efficiency by optimizing prefetched data size 
- Performance evaluation demonstrating significant gains of JD2P over benchmarks in terms of expected energy consumption reduction with marginal accuracy loss

The effectiveness of JD2P is validated through simulations using MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Results show JD2P can reduce expected energy consumption by 20-23 dB compared to full data offloading, with only a small increase in error rate.
