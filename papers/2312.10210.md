# [VK-G2T: Vision and Context Knowledge enhanced Gloss2Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10210)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing sign language translation (SLT) methods follow a two-stage pipeline - first converting the sign language video to a gloss sequence (Sign2Gloss) and then translating the gloss sequence to spoken language text (Gloss2Text). Prior work has focused more on improving the Sign2Gloss stage while overlooking two key challenges in Gloss2Text: (1) Isolated gloss input lacking punctuation, which makes predicting sentence properties like type and structure difficult. (2) Low-capacity gloss vocabulary that cannot cover all spoken words, making gloss adaptation challenging.

Proposed Solution - VK-G2T:
This paper proposes a Vision and Context Knowledge enhanced Gloss2Text (VK-G2T) model to address the above challenges. It has three components:

1) Vision-based Sentence Property Learning: Uses the original sign video to predict sentence type (interrogative vs non-interrogative) and structure (compound vs non-compound). A Transformer encoder takes frame-level visual features along with special tokens indicating sentence type and structure. Cross-entropy losses supervise the property predictions.

2) Context Knowledge-enhanced Gloss Embedding: Retrieves top-K similar gloss sequences and their target sentences from training data as context knowledge to enhance embedding of the input gloss via BART.

3) Spoken Language Generation: BART decoder takes the enhanced gloss embedding, predicted sentence properties and generates the target spoken sentence in an autoregressive manner.

Main Contributions:
1) Identifies overlooked challenges of isolated gloss input and low-capacity vocabulary in Gloss2Text.
2) Proposes to leverage visual modality of sign video and dataset context knowledge to enhance Gloss2Text.
3) Achieves new state-of-the-art on a public Chinese SLT benchmark.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards improving sign language translation by enhancing the relatively under-explored Gloss2Text stage using multimodal and context-aware modeling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a vision and context knowledge enhanced gloss-to-text model for sign language translation that leverages visual content to learn sentence properties and incorporates context knowledge from similar gloss sequences to facilitate adaptive translation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a vision and context knowledge enhanced Gloss2Text model (VK-G2T) to improve sign language translation. Specifically, this model has the following key contributions:

1) It incorporates visual information from the original sign language video to learn crucial sentence properties such as sentence type and sentence structure. This compensates for the information loss during the Sign2Gloss stage and helps generate better spoken language translations. 

2) It utilizes context knowledge, in the form of similar gloss sequences and their ground truth translations from the training set, to enhance the semantic understanding and adaptive translation of gloss words. This addresses the limitation of low-capacity gloss vocabularies.

3) Extensive experiments conducted on a Chinese sign language translation benchmark validate the superiority of the proposed VK-G2T model over existing state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of the model.

In summary, the key novelty lies in exploiting visual content and context knowledge to enhance the Gloss2Text translation, which has been relatively less studied compared to the Sign2Gloss stage in prior sign language translation research.
