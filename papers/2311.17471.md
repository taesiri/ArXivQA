# [Distributed AI in Zero-touch Provisioning for Edge Networks: Challenges   and Research Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17471)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes combining Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) with Zero-touch Provisioning (ZTP) for edge networks to enable intelligent and automated management of network devices with minimal human intervention. The authors present a novel edge computing architecture integrating DAI, edge resource federation, and ZTP to achieve low latency, scalability, and cost efficiency. DAI allows distributed decision-making while edge resource federation enables different edge providers to collaboratively offer resources. ZTP automates device configuration and management. Benefits highlighted include optimized resource utilization, faster deployment, lower costs, and reduced errors. Challenges exist in areas like cascading failures, anomaly detection, heterogeneity, orchestration limits, and security. Proposed future research directions focus on lightweight AI/ML models, semantic interoperability, privacy preservation, low latency techniques, intelligent protocols leveraging ZTP, causality-based explainability, and generative AI to identify unpredictable issues. Overall, the combination of DAI and ZTP promises more autonomous and intelligent edge network management.
