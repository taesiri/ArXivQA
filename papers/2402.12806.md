# [SymBa: Symbolic Backward Chaining for Multi-step Natural Language   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning abilities recently, but still struggle with faithful multi-step reasoning where one has to provide an interpretable step-by-step proof to answer a query based on context. 
- Existing LLM-based backward chaining methods have limitations:
    - Least-to-most prompting has to predict the full decomposition in one shot, often failing and leading to unfaithful proofs
    - LAMBADA cannot perform key functions like binding propagation, making it incapable of addressing tasks like multi-hop reasoning

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes SymBa (Symbolic Backward Chaining), a novel integration of a symbolic top-down solver and LLM
- The symbolic solver controls the entire proof process. When it cannot prove a subgoal, the LLM generates a single reasoning step (fact or rule) that allows the solver to proceed.
- This allows leveraging the reliability and efficiency of symbolic solvers, while utilizing LLM's reasoning ability when needed.

Main Contributions:
- Novel and effective integration of symbolic solvers and LLM for interpretable and reliable backward chaining
- Outperforms prior LLM-based backward chaining methods in diverse reasoning tasks on performance, proof faithfulness and efficiency
- Provides structured proofs with step-by-step natural language descriptions and logic programs
- Naturally compatible with integrating expert systems to inject human knowledge

In summary, the paper presents SymBa, a novel approach that combines symbolic solvers and LLM to significantly push the capability of interpretable multi-step reasoning based on backward chaining. By effectively utilizing both components, SymBa outperforms prior arts in various metrics and benchmarks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel backward chaining reasoning framework called SymBa that integrates a symbolic top-down solver with a large language model, allowing it to achieve strong performance across diverse reasoning tasks while also providing interpretable structured proofs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called SymBa (Symbolic Backward Chaining) that integrates a symbolic top-down solver with large language models (LLMs) for multi-step natural language reasoning. Specifically, in SymBa the symbolic solver controls the entire reasoning process and only calls the LLM to generate a single reasoning step when it encounters a dead end. This allows SymBa to produce an interpretable, structured proof while achieving significant improvements in performance, proof faithfulness, and efficiency on diverse reasoning benchmarks compared to prior LLM-based backward chaining methods. The key innovation is the integration of the reliability and efficiency of symbolic solvers with the reasoning ability of LLMs through a modular approach.

In summary, key terms revolve around backward chaining, symbolic solvers, multi-step reasoning, logic programming, expert systems, modular approaches, proof faithfulness, and efficiency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel integration of a symbolic solver and a large language model (LLM). What are the key benefits of this integration compared to using just an LLM? How does it lead to performance improvements?

2. The paper focuses specifically on backward chaining for multi-step reasoning. Why is backward chaining better suited for this task compared to forward chaining? What are some of the weaknesses it aims to address?

3. The paper mentions integrating expert systems with the proposed method. How can expert systems be leveraged in this framework? What modifications would need to be made to support expert system integration? 

4. One of the key ideas is to only call the LLM when the symbolic solver encounters a dead end. Why is this more efficient? Are there any risks or downsides to this selective LLM querying approach?

5. The single-step statement generation module uses a pipeline of fact/rule search, fact/rule translation and validation. What is the purpose of each sub-module? How do they work together?

6. The results show improvements across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Which benchmark posed the biggest challenge? What kinds of errors were most prevalent and why?

7. The analysis reveals higher recall of rule search for bound vs unbound rules. Why would this be the case? How can it be addressed?

8. Could the proposed architecture support higher-order logic reasoning as well? What modifications or extensions would need to be made? What are the limitations?

9. One limitation mentioned is the reliance on LLM accuracy. How can the system be made more robust to potential LLM errors or inconsistencies? Are there any monitoring or validation techniques that could help?

10. The method is focused on improving backward chaining for multi-step reasoning. What other potential applications could this approach be useful for? How do you see work in this direction evolving?
