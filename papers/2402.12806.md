# [SymBa: Symbolic Backward Chaining for Multi-step Natural Language   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning abilities recently, but still struggle with faithful multi-step reasoning where one has to provide an interpretable step-by-step proof to answer a query based on context. 
- Existing LLM-based backward chaining methods have limitations:
    - Least-to-most prompting has to predict the full decomposition in one shot, often failing and leading to unfaithful proofs
    - LAMBADA cannot perform key functions like binding propagation, making it incapable of addressing tasks like multi-hop reasoning

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes SymBa (Symbolic Backward Chaining), a novel integration of a symbolic top-down solver and LLM
- The symbolic solver controls the entire proof process. When it cannot prove a subgoal, the LLM generates a single reasoning step (fact or rule) that allows the solver to proceed.
- This allows leveraging the reliability and efficiency of symbolic solvers, while utilizing LLM's reasoning ability when needed.

Main Contributions:
- Novel and effective integration of symbolic solvers and LLM for interpretable and reliable backward chaining
- Outperforms prior LLM-based backward chaining methods in diverse reasoning tasks on performance, proof faithfulness and efficiency
- Provides structured proofs with step-by-step natural language descriptions and logic programs
- Naturally compatible with integrating expert systems to inject human knowledge

In summary, the paper presents SymBa, a novel approach that combines symbolic solvers and LLM to significantly push the capability of interpretable multi-step reasoning based on backward chaining. By effectively utilizing both components, SymBa outperforms prior arts in various metrics and benchmarks.
