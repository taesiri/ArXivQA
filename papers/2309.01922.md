# [Regret Analysis of Policy Gradient Algorithm for Infinite Horizon   Average Reward Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01922)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper considers an infinite horizon average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP) for reinforcement learning. The goal is to find a policy parameterization that maximizes the expected average reward.

- Prior works have studied this problem for tabular and linear MDP settings. But the analysis for general parameterized policy gradient algorithms has been lacking. 

- Key challenge is that value function estimators can become unbounded in the average reward setup unlike in discounted reward setups. So getting an asymptotically unbiased estimate of the policy gradient is difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a policy gradient based algorithm with general parameterization for ergodic MDPs. 

- The algorithm runs in epochs. In each epoch, it collects a trajectory by following the current policy. It then estimates the value functions and advantage functions using appropriate sub-trajectories from this sample. These estimates are then used to compute the policy gradient estimate.

- The policy parameters get updated using this estimated gradient. The length of epochs and sub-trajectories are set judiciously so that the variance of gradient estimate decreases over time.

Main Contributions:

- First, the paper shows that the proposed algorithm converges globally to a neighborhood of the optimal parameter. Specifically, it achieves an average optimality error of Õ(T^-1/4).

- Using this convergence result, the paper proves a regret bound of Õ(T^3/4) for the algorithm. This is the first regret analysis for general parameterized policy gradients in average reward MDPs.

- The paper provides a detailed proof technique for analyzing policy gradient methods in the average reward setting by managing the correlations between value function estimates.

In summary, the paper pioneers the regret analysis for parameterized policy gradients in average reward MDPs which has been an open problem. The analysis framework can enable further research in this domain.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the abstract and introduction, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a policy gradient-based algorithm for infinite horizon average reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) with general parameterization of policies, and analyzing its regret bound. Specifically:

- The paper proposes a policy gradient algorithm that operates in epochs and estimates the value functions and policy gradients using sampled trajectories. 

- It shows that the proposed algorithm achieves an average optimality error (distance to the optimal average reward) of Õ(T^{-1/4}).

- Using this convergence result, the paper proves that the expected regret of the proposed algorithm is Õ(T^{3/4}). 

- The paper notes that this is the first regret analysis for a policy gradient method with general function approximation in the average reward setting. Prior works were limited to tabular or linear MDPs.

So in summary, the main contribution is presenting the first policy gradient algorithm along with its regret analysis for infinite horizon average reward MDPs with general parameterization of policies. The algorithm is shown to achieve a sublinear Õ(T^{3/4}) regret bound.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper assumes the MDP is ergodic. What challenges would arise in extending the analysis to general communicating MDPs? How could the variance of the gradient estimates be controlled without exponential convergence guarantees?

2. Could you explain more intuitively why controlling the growth rate of H and N is key to obtaining an asymptotically unbiased gradient estimator? What would happen if H and N grew too quickly or too slowly? 

3. The proof bounds the difference between the estimated and true advantage function. However, the value function estimates themselves may be poor. Does this cause any issues? If so, how could the analysis be strengthened?

4. Assumption 4 requires the Fisher information matrix to be positive definite. When might this assumption be violated? What modifications would need to be made to the algorithm if the Fisher matrix became singular?

5. How was the learning rate selected? Would it be possible to use a larger learning rate by using momentum or some form of adaptive learning rate scheme?

6. The regret bound contains a term that depends on the bias from the function approximation error. If this error was large, how could the regret be improved? Are there any parameterizations that would reduce this bias term?

7. The hitting time appears in several parts of the analysis. Intuitively, why does the frequency of visiting rare states impact the performance of this algorithm?  

8. The proof utilizes epochs and fixed length trajectories. What would be the challenges in analyzing a fully online stochastic gradient version of this algorithm?

9. Could you explain the high level proof approach for showing the gradient estimator has asymptotically decreasing variance? What are the key steps?

10. The regret bound scales with mixing time and hitting time. What structural properties of MDPs influence these quantities? And in what practical situations might these terms be problematic?
