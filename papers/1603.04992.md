# [Unsupervised CNN for Single View Depth Estimation: Geometry to the   Rescue](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04992)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:How can we train a convolutional neural network to estimate depth from a single image in an unsupervised manner, without requiring ground truth depth data? The key hypothesis is that an unsupervised training approach based on reconstructing one view of a stereo pair from the other view, using the predicted depth and known camera geometry, can enable training a CNN for single view depth estimation from scratch without manual labels.In summary, the main research focus is on developing an unsupervised learning approach for single view depth estimation using a convolutional neural network. The key idea is to use stereo image pairs during training, with a reconstruction loss between one image and a warped version of the other image based on the predicted depth. This avoids the need for ground truth depth data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is an unsupervised framework to learn a convolutional neural network (CNN) for single view depth prediction, without requiring any ground truth depth data or pre-training. The key ideas are:- They train the CNN in an "autoencoder" setup, where the encoder predicts a depth map from a single image, and the decoder uses this depth map along with the known camera motion between a source and target image to warp the target image and reconstruct the source image. The loss function is the difference between the reconstructed and original source images.- This allows them to train the depth prediction CNN in an end-to-end unsupervised manner using only stereo image pairs, without needing ground truth depth. The stereo pairs provide the source and target images, and the known baseline provides the camera motion.- They use a coarse-to-fine training approach, progressively increasing the resolution of the predicted depth maps. This helps deal with the limitation that the image warp needs to be locally linearized during backpropagation.- They show results on KITTI dataset comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of this unsupervised training approach.Key advantages are that it removes the need for costly ground truth depth data collection, and allows training on unlimited amounts of stereo imagery. This is a step towards in-situ and lifelong learning.
