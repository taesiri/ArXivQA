# [Neural Vector Fields: Implicit Representation by Explicit Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04341)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the key points and contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes a new 3D shape representation method called Neural Vector Fields (NVF) that combines the benefits of explicit mesh deformation with implicit function representation. 

- NVF represents shapes by learning to predict displacement vectors that move query points to the target surface. This allows it to handle complex topologies and be resolution-independent like implicit methods.

- Unlike previous unsigned distance field (UDF) methods, NVF directly predicts vectors instead of scalar distances. This avoids issues like ambiguity in gradient directions and removes the need to differentiate the function during inference.

- The vector field prediction allows NVF to deform meshes like an explicit deformation, while still enjoying the representation power of implicit functions.

- The differentiation-free design also enables introducing a vector quantized codebook in the feature space, which provides regularization and improves generalization across categories.

- Experiments show NVF outperforms previous methods on tasks like category-specific reconstruction, category-agnostic reconstruction, and cross-domain generalization. It also has faster training and inference than previous UDF methods.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the NVF shape representation that unifies explicit mesh manipulation with implicit function flexibility, while avoiding issues in previous UDF methods. This leads to both better representation power and efficiency.
