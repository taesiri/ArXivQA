# [Eulerian-Lagrangian particle-based model for diffusional growth for the   better parameterization of ISM clouds: A road map for improving climate model   through small-scale model using observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.0987)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. What is the role of dry aerosol size on diffusion growth of ISM cloud droplets and the relative dispersion?2. What is the role of relative humidity on diffusion growth and broadening spectra of ISM shallow (less humid) and convective (more humid) clouds? 3. What is the importance of relative dispersion for revisiting modified 'autoconversion' parameterization for climate model?4. How to parameterize effective radius from DNS experiments for radiation scheme in climate model?The paper investigates these questions through direct numerical simulations (DNS) of cloud droplet growth, using initial conditions guided by aircraft observations from the CAIPEEX field campaign over India. The goal is to better understand microphysical processes involved in ISM clouds and provide insights to improve the representation of cloud microphysics in climate models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Using a high-resolution Eulerian-Lagrangian particle-based small-scale model with in situ aircraft measurements to calculate diffusional growth rates and relative dispersion of cloud droplets during the Indian summer monsoon. 2. Calculating the coefficient of diffusional growth rate (cm) for different cloud conditions, finding values in the range of 0.25-1.5 x 10^-3 cm/s. The authors suggest this could help improve parameterization of droplet growth in climate models.3. Analyzing the role of dry aerosol size, relative humidity, and cloud type on droplet growth and spectral broadening. Finding linear relationships between relative dispersion and droplet concentration.4. Suggesting modifications to autoconversion schemes and effective radius parameterization in climate models based on dispersion and mean diameter from the model simulations and aircraft data. 5. Providing insights into microphysical processes influencing light and moderate rain during the Indian summer monsoon, which could help improve model simulations of monsoon rainfall.In summary, the key contributions seem to be using a high-resolution cloud model with observations to better understand microphysical processes for improving parameterizations and rainfall prediction in climate models, with a focus on the Indian summer monsoon.
