# [Learning Thresholds with Latent Values and Censored Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04653)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of actively learning an optimal threshold in a latent space, where the reward function $g(\gamma,v)$ depends on the proposed threshold $\gamma$ and an unknown latent value $v$. The key challenge is that the reward can only be observed if $\gamma \leq v$. This problem has applications like setting reserve prices in auctions, requirements in crowdsourcing tasks, or bars in hiring processes. The goal is to characterize the query complexity, which is the number of queries needed to learn a near optimal threshold.

Key Results:
- The paper first shows that even when $g(\gamma,v)$ is monotone in both $\gamma$ and $v$, the query complexity can be infinitely large. This is done by carefully constructing a "needle in the haystack" instance.

- For the case when $g$ is monotone and the CDF of the value distribution is Lipschitz, the paper provides a tight bound of $\tilde{\Theta}(1/\eps^3)$ on the query complexity. This is done using discretization and concentration inequalities.

- For the case when $g$ satisfies a right-Lipschitz property, the paper again provides a tight $\tilde{\Theta}(1/\eps^3)$ query complexity, using similar techniques. This provides a complete characterization.

- The paper also proves a lower bound of $\Omega(1/\eps^3)$ even when $g$ is both monotone and Lipschitz continuous, and the value CDF is Lipschitz. This novel construction perturbs a smooth distribution in an interval of size $O(\eps)$.

- Finally, the paper extends the setting to an online learning problem with bandit feedback and shows a tight regret bound of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$ by relating it to a continuous armed bandit problem.

To summarize, the paper provides a comprehensive study of the query complexity of learning thresholds in latent spaces under different assumptions. The tight upper and lower bounds demonstrate a clear characterization of when this active learning problem can be solved with a finite sample complexity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the problem of actively learning an optimal threshold in a latent space where rewards depend jointly on the proposed threshold and unknown latent values, proving tight query complexity bounds for different assumptions on the reward function and value distribution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides both positive and negative results on the query complexity of actively learning optimal thresholds in a latent space. Specifically:

- It shows that the query complexity can be infinitely large, even when the reward function is monotone, by carefully constructing an example with a "needle in the haystack" structure. 

- It provides tight upper and lower bounds of $\tilde{\Theta}(1/\epsilon^3)$ on the query complexity when either (a) the reward function is monotone and the CDF of the value distribution is Lipschitz or (b) the reward function satisfies right Lipschitzness. This completely characterizes the query complexity for this problem.

2. It extends the threshold learning problem to an online learning setting with a tight $\Theta(T^{2/3})$ regret bound, by relating it to a continuous-arm Lipschitz bandit problem and using the offline query complexity results.

In summary, the main contribution is providing a comprehensive set of possibility and impossibility results that fully characterize the query complexity of this threshold learning problem under different assumptions. The paper makes clever use of constructions and proof techniques to obtain matching upper and lower bounds.

The paper investigates the problem of actively learning optimal thresholds in a latent space, where rewards depend jointly on the proposed threshold and an unknown latent value. Only censored feedback is obtained based on whether the threshold exceeds the latent value. Key goals include characterizing the query complexity of this problem, providing positive and negative results under different assumptions, and extending the setting to an online learning problem with bandit algorithms. The key terms reflect concepts like thresholds, latent values, censored feedback, complexity bounds, and properties like Lipschitz continuity and monotonicity that are leveraged in the technical results.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proves that the query complexity can be infinitely large even when the reward function $g(\gamma, v)$ is monotone. Can you explain the key ideas behind constructing the "needle in the haystack" example that leads to this impossibility result?

2. In the positive results, the paper establishes tight query complexity bounds under Lipschitz assumptions. Can you walk through the details of the discretization argument used to prove the $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^3)$ upper bound? 

3. The lower bound construction perturbs a smooth base distribution in a careful way. Can you explain the intuition behind this construction and why it requires a more delicate argument than prior work?

4. How does the paper connect the offline query complexity results to the online learning setting? Explain how the discretization technique extends and how the lower bounds transfer over.  

5. The online learning regret bound of $O(T^{2/3})$ matches existing results for Lipschitz bandits. What modifications or extensions would be needed to improve the regret for this specific threshold learning problem?

6. How do the assumptions on the reward function $g$ and value distribution $F$ interact? Could you achieve similar positive results by assuming different conditions?

7. The model assumes the learner only observes censored feedback $b(\gamma, v)$. How would the results change if you provide additional information like the value $v$ when it exceeds the threshold?  

8. Can the analysis be tightened in certain cases by leveraging structure beyond Lipschitzness or monotonicity? Are there interesting subcases where improved query complexity is possible?  

9. The paper focuses on a single agent setting. How would the problem and results change in a multi-agent setting like an auction with multiple bidders?

10. Are there other interesting applications where a similar threshold learning problem arises but with different motivations? How might the techniques transfer or need to be adapted?
