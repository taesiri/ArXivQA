# [Learning Thresholds with Latent Values and Censored Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04653)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of actively learning an optimal threshold in a latent space, where the reward function $g(\gamma,v)$ depends on the proposed threshold $\gamma$ and an unknown latent value $v$. The key challenge is that the reward can only be observed if $\gamma \leq v$. This problem has applications like setting reserve prices in auctions, requirements in crowdsourcing tasks, or bars in hiring processes. The goal is to characterize the query complexity, which is the number of queries needed to learn a near optimal threshold.

Key Results:
- The paper first shows that even when $g(\gamma,v)$ is monotone in both $\gamma$ and $v$, the query complexity can be infinitely large. This is done by carefully constructing a "needle in the haystack" instance.

- For the case when $g$ is monotone and the CDF of the value distribution is Lipschitz, the paper provides a tight bound of $\tilde{\Theta}(1/\eps^3)$ on the query complexity. This is done using discretization and concentration inequalities.

- For the case when $g$ satisfies a right-Lipschitz property, the paper again provides a tight $\tilde{\Theta}(1/\eps^3)$ query complexity, using similar techniques. This provides a complete characterization.

- The paper also proves a lower bound of $\Omega(1/\eps^3)$ even when $g$ is both monotone and Lipschitz continuous, and the value CDF is Lipschitz. This novel construction perturbs a smooth distribution in an interval of size $O(\eps)$.

- Finally, the paper extends the setting to an online learning problem with bandit feedback and shows a tight regret bound of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$ by relating it to a continuous armed bandit problem.

To summarize, the paper provides a comprehensive study of the query complexity of learning thresholds in latent spaces under different assumptions. The tight upper and lower bounds demonstrate a clear characterization of when this active learning problem can be solved with a finite sample complexity.
