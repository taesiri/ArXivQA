# [PsyChat: A Client-Centric Dialogue System for Mental Health Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04262)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes PsyChat, a novel client-centric dialogue system for providing mental health support through online chat conversations. The system comprises five core modules - client behavior recognition, counselor strategy selection, input packing, response generation, and response selection. A key novelty is the client-centric approach that focuses on understanding and responding to the client's behaviors and states. The system first accurately identifies the client's behaviors using a classifier fine-tuned on richly annotated real counseling conversations. It then selects an appropriate counseling strategy by retrieving the most similar dialogue from a base set. The input packer formats the inputs for the response generator module, which is a large pre-trained chat model fine-tuned on both synthetic and real dialogues in a two-stage approach. Multiple generated responses are ranked using a trained cross-encoder based selector. Extensive automatic and human evaluations demonstrate PsyChat's effectiveness in simulating real-world counseling conversations. A case study highlights how it understands client behaviors and generates suitable counselor responses. The client-centric approach and integration of various natural language processing techniques make PsyChat a promising avenue for accessible and affordable mental health support.
