# [You Can Ground Earlier than See: An Effective and Efficient Pipeline for   Temporal Sentence Grounding in Compressed Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07863)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform effective and efficient temporal sentence grounding directly in the compressed video domain, without needing to fully decompress the videos into sequences of RGB frames. 

The key hypothesis is that by extracting and fusing features directly from compressed video (I-frames, motion vectors, residuals), the model can achieve strong grounding performance while being much more efficient than methods that operate on fully decompressed videos.

Specifically, the paper introduces the new task of "compressed-domain temporal sentence grounding" and proposes a novel model called Three-branch Compressed-domain Spatial-temporal Fusion (TCSF) to address this task. The key ideas are:

- Extract appearance features from I-frames, motion features from motion vectors, and residual features from residuals. This avoids needing to decompress the full videos.

- Generate "pseudo features" to enrich the partial appearance and motion information. 

- Apply spatial-temporal attention to model query-relevant activity content.

- Adaptively fuse motion and appearance information guided by the residuals.

- Integrate visual features with query features for final grounding.

The central hypothesis is that by effectively fusing these compressed domain features, the model can achieve strong grounding accuracy while being much faster and more efficient than existing methods that use fully decompressed videos. Experiments validate this hypothesis and show state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new compressed-domain temporal sentence grounding (TSG) task, which aims to directly leverage compressed videos instead of fully decompressed frames as input for grounding. This is a more practical but challenging setting compared to previous TSG works that rely on decompressed frames. 

2. It presents a novel framework called Three-branch Compressed-domain Spatial-temporal Fusion (TCSF) to address the compressed-domain TSG task. The key ideas are:

- Extract and utilize three types of low-level visual features from compressed video: I-frame features for appearance, motion vector and residual features from P-frames for motion. 

- Design spatial and temporal attention modules to focus on query-relevant regions and temporal dynamics.

- Adaptively fuse motion and appearance information guided by residual features.

- Integrate visual features with textual features for final grounding prediction.

3. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed TCSF framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods under both fully supervised and weakly supervised settings, showing its effectiveness and efficiency.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new compressed-domain setting for TSG and an effective framework TCSF to address this challenging task. The key advantage is efficiently leveraging compressed videos without needing full decomposition.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new compressed-domain temporal sentence grounding approach called TCSF that directly leverages compressed video features like I-frames, motion vectors, and residuals for efficient and effective grounding, outperforming prior methods that use fully decompressed videos.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few points comparing this paper to other research in temporal sentence grounding:

- This paper introduces a new setting called "compressed-domain TSG", which directly takes compressed video as input rather than fully decompressed frames. This is a novel and more practical setting compared to prior work, which relies on fully decoded frames. 

- To handle compressed video input, the paper proposes a three-branch model (TCSF) that extracts and fuses motion, residual, and I-frame features. This is a new technical approach compared to prior work that uses pretrained 3D ConvNets on RGB frames.

- The paper shows state-of-the-art performance compared to both fully supervised and weakly supervised methods on three datasets. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the compressed-domain approach and TCSF model. 

- The paper also analyzes the efficiency of the proposed model compared to prior work. It shows significantly faster runtime by avoiding full frame decompression and 3D ConvNet feature extraction.

- Overall, this paper makes both problem formulation and technical contributions for temporal grounding. The compressed-domain setting is more practical while still achieving strong results. The three-branch TCSF model is novel and tailored for compressed video input.

In summary, the key novelty is the compressed-domain focus, which is more practical but underexplored in prior work. The technical approach and experiments demonstrate this is a promising direction for efficient and effective temporal grounding.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few future research directions in the conclusion:

- Developing more advanced methods for extracting rich features directly from compressed video, as their proposed TCSF framework only extracts and aggregates three basic types of features (I-frame, motion vector, and residual features). They suggest exploring how to extract more high-level semantics from the compressed domain.

- Generalizing their framework to other compressed video formats besides MPEG-4, such as H.264, H.265, etc. Their current method is designed for MPEG-4 encoded videos.

- Extending their framework to other vision-language tasks beyond temporal sentence grounding, such as video captioning, video question answering, etc. They currently only focus on the task of temporal grounding.

- Designing more effective fusion methods to integrate the appearance and motion features, as they use a simple weighted fusion in their current work. More complex fusion methods could be explored.

- Applying their compressed-domain framework to other multimodal tasks like image-text matching where compressed images like JPEG can be used as input instead of raw pixels.

In summary, the main future directions are: 1) extracting richer semantics directly from compressed video, 2) generalizing to other video formats beyond MPEG-4, 3) applying to other vision-language tasks, 4) designing better fusion methods, and 5) extending to other compressed multimodal tasks. The key idea is leveraging compressed data for efficiency while still extracting informative features.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new temporal sentence grounding setting called compressed-domain TSG, which directly utilizes compressed videos instead of fully decompressed frames as input. The authors argue that existing methods rely on labor-intensive full frame decompression and annotation. To address this, they propose a Three-branch Compressed-domain Spatial-temporal Fusion (TCSF) framework to extract and fuse three low-level compressed video features - I-frame, motion vector, and residual features - for efficient and effective grounding. Specifically, I-frame features capture appearance, motion vector features capture motion, and residual features help balance their fusion. The framework includes modules for pseudo feature generation, spatial-temporal attention, and adaptive motion-appearance fusion. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TCSF outperforms state-of-the-art fully and weakly supervised methods, while being more efficient by operating directly on compressed video. The new compressed-domain setting enables practical TSG without full decompression and extensive annotation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new task called compressed-domain temporal sentence grounding (TSG), which aims to locate a target video segment corresponding to a sentence query directly from a compressed video rather than a fully decompressed video. Most prior TSG methods rely on fully decompressed videos as input, which is inefficient. To address this, the authors propose a Three-branch Compressed-domain Spatial-temporal Fusion (TCSF) framework. It extracts and aggregates three types of low-level visual features from the compressed video: I-frame features to represent appearance, motion vector features to capture motion, and residual features to model temporal changes. A spatial attention module focuses on query-relevant regions in each frame. A temporal attention module models the temporal relations between consecutive frames. An adaptive fusion module balances the importance of appearance and motion features based on the residual. Experiments on three datasets show the proposed TCSF framework outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and weakly-supervised methods, while being much more efficient by operating directly on the compressed video.

In summary, this paper introduces a new compressed-domain temporal sentence grounding task to avoid the inefficiency of using fully decompressed videos. The proposed TCSF framework effectively extracts and fuses low-level visual features from the compressed video input for the grounding task. Experiments validate its superiority over existing methods in accuracy and efficiency. The compressed-domain setting is more practical while posing new challenges, and the proposed TCSF framework offers an effective solution.
