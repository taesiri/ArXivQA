## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are inadequate for answering complex multi-hop queries that require retrieving and reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence. 
- No existing RAG benchmarking datasets focus specifically on evaluating systems for multi-hop queries.

Proposed Solution:

- The dataset contains a knowledge base of 609 English news articles, over 2,500 multi-hop questions categorized into inference, comparison, temporal, and null types, ground truth answers, and associated evidence sets.
- The data is created via a rigorous process using GPT-4 for generation and validation.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of one of the first publicly available RAG benchmarking datasets tailored to multi-hop queries.  
- Demonstration of dataset's utility through experiments comparing retrieval methods and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs.
- Identification of deficiencies in current RAG systems for handling multi-hop queries based on benchmarking results.
- Provision of a valuable resource to facilitate RAG advances for real-world adoption where multi-hop queries are common.

In summary, the paper presents MultiHop-RAG, a novel and challenging dataset to support benchmarking and development of more effective RAG systems for complex multi-hop queries.
