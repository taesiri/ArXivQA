# [Enhancement of High-definition Map Update Service Through Coverage-aware   and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14582)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- High-definition (HD) maps are critical for advancing autonomous vehicles, but creating them requires massive amounts of data that strains vehicular networks.
- High vehicle density in VANETs leads to network congestion and poor quality of service using the standard IEEE 802.11p protocol.
- Prior solutions require modifications to the standard or significant computing resources, limiting real-world applicability. 

Proposed Solution:
- A non-intrusive Q-learning algorithm that works at the application layer to enhance quality of service for HD map data transmission.
- Incorporates a discrete sojourn time formula using speed, location and coverage area to reduce state space complexity.
- Actions and rewards designed to mimic and improve the IEEE 802.11p EDCA mechanism for priority and fairness.

Key Contributions:
- Solution is tunable and compatible with any wireless technology since it operates at the application layer.
- Reduces latency for HD map data by 75%, 73% and 10% compared to 802.11p without QoS, with QoS, and with new HD map access category.  
- Validation shows improved performance over 802.11ac standard as well, demonstrating ability to overcome compatibility issues.
- Performance gains with low computing overhead since centralized learning approach avoids overloading vehicles' computational capacity.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative Q-learning algorithm leveraging sojourn time that works at the application layer to substantially improve quality of service for HD map transmission in vehicular networks. Key advantages include tunability, technology-agnostic compatibility and low computing requirements for real-world implementation.
