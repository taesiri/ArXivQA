# [BIVDiff: A Training-Free Framework for General-Purpose Video Synthesis   via Bridging Image and Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02813)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes BIVDiff, a training-free framework for general-purpose video synthesis by bridging image and video diffusion models. It first uses a task-specific image diffusion model (IDM) like ControlNet or InstructPix2Pix to generate a video frame-by-frame. Then it performs Mixed Inversion, mixing the latents from image and video DDIM inversion, to adjust the latent distribution. Finally, it inputs the inverted latents into a text-to-video diffusion foundation model (VDM) like VidRD for temporal smoothing. This decouples image and video models, allowing flexible IDM selection for different tasks. Experiments validate BIVDiff on controllable video generation, video editing, inpainting and outpainting. Quantitatively and qualitatively it compares well to baselines like Tune-A-Video and ControlVideo. Ablations study framework design choices like bridging strategies and the mixing ratio. The method is simple, efficient, and generalizable for various video synthesis tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a training-free video synthesis framework called BIVDiff that bridges downstream task-specific image diffusion models and general text-to-video diffusion models to generate temporally coherent videos for a wide range of video generation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing BIVDiff, a training-free general-purpose video synthesis framework via bridging downstream task-specific image diffusion models and text-to-video foundation diffusion models. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing a simple yet effective framework to bridge image and video diffusion models for flexible video synthesis. It first uses an image diffusion model for frame-wise generation, then performs Mixed Inversion on the generated frames, and finally feeds the inverted latents into a video diffusion model for temporal smoothing.

2) Introducing Mixed Inversion to adjust the latent distribution and trade off between temporal smoothing and open generation capability of the video diffusion model. 

3) Demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization ability of BIVDiff on a wide range of video synthesis tasks like controllable video generation, video editing, video inpainting and outpainting.

In summary, the main contribution is designing a training-free and general framework BIVDiff that can leverage both image and video diffusion models for high-quality and temporally consistent video synthesis.
