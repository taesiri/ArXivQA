# [GPT4Tools: Teaching Large Language Model to Use Tools via   Self-instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18752)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we efficiently enable large language models (LLMs) to use multimodal tools?

Specifically, the authors aim to teach open-source LLMs like LLaMA and OPT to use tools like image generators and visual AI models, without relying on massive datasets or computational resources. 

Their key hypothesis appears to be:

By generating a dataset of tool usage instructions from an advanced teacher model like ChatGPT, and fine-tuning a primitive LLM on this dataset, the primitive LLM can learn to successfully invoke tools for visual tasks like image generation and visual question answering.

So in summary, the paper is investigating whether an instructional dataset from ChatGPT can effectively teach cheaper, publicly available LLMs to utilize visual tools, which they evaluate through metrics on tool usage accuracy. The main goal is enabling LLMs to handle multimodal tasks efficiently.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an effective method called GPT4Tools to enable open-source large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA and OPT to use multimodal tools via self-instruction from an advanced teacher model. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- They construct a tool-related instruction dataset by prompting the advanced ChatGPT model with image content and tool descriptions, generating high-quality instructions. This allows transferring tool usage knowledge to other LLMs.

- They augment the instruction dataset with negative and contextual samples to enhance the model's ability to determine when to use tools and use them in conversational contexts.

- They employ Low-Rank Adaptation to efficiently adapt primitive LLMs like Vicuna and OPT on the constructed dataset, equipping them with the capacity to invoke tools to solve visual tasks. 

- They design a benchmark and metric to evaluate tool usage accuracy from multiple aspects like deciding when and which tools to use. Experiments show the adapted models achieve remarkable improvements.

- The adapted LLMs not only perform much better on seen tools, but also gain the zero-shot ability on unseen tools, comparable to advanced models like ChatGPT.

Overall, the key novelty is using self-instruction from ChatGPT to teach open-source LLMs to use multimodal tools, which provides an effective solution for tool usage. The constructed dataset, training method, and evaluation benchmark are also useful contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called GPT4Tools that uses an advanced teacher model like ChatGPT to generate a dataset of tool usage instructions, which is then used to train more widely available LMs like OPT and Vicuna to acquire the ability to invoke visual tools, enabling them to handle visual tasks like image generation and comprehension.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related works:

- This paper focuses on enabling large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA and OPT to use multimodal tools through self-instruction from an advanced teacher model. In contrast, prior works like VisualChatGPT and MMREACT rely solely on using large proprietary models like GPT-3.5 for tool usage via prompt engineering. 

- The proposed GPT4Tools method uses multi-modal contexts like image captions and bounding boxes to generate diverse and grounded instructions for teaching tool usage. Other methods like ToolFormer generate instructions without any visual grounding, leading to less variability.

- The paper introduces a new benchmark to evaluate tool usage capabilities across diverse tasks, considering decision-making, tool selection, and argument matching. Many prior works have not focused on rigorously evaluating tool usage skills.

- Experiments show GPT4Tools significantly improves tool usage accuracy in LLMs like Vicuna-13B, enabling even zero-shot generalization to unseen tools. Other methods have not demonstrated large gains on primitive LLMs or generalization abilities.

- Overall, GPT4Tools provides a novel self-instruction approach using multi-modal contexts to teach open-source LLMs efficient tool usage. The proposed benchmark also allows measuring these skills in a comprehensive way. The strong empirical results set this work apart from existing techniques that rely on large proprietary models or lack thorough evaluation.

In summary, the key innovations of this paper compared to related works are: 1) Self-instruction method for primitive LLMs using an advanced teacher, 2) Use of multi-modal contexts for diverse and grounded instructions, 3) New evaluation benchmark for tool skills, 4) Significant empirical gains in accuracy and generalization. These contributions advance research on enabling LLMs to effectively leverage tools.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring how to enable the model to implicitly invoke tools rather than using complex prompts. The paper notes that the current approach of explicitly invoking tools with verbose prompts is inefficient. Future work could explore how to make tool invocation more seamless and efficient.

- Developing methods to equip language models with even more diverse tools beyond just visual tasks. The current work focuses on enabling language models to use visual tools, but the authors suggest expanding to other types of tools as well.

- Improving the accuracy and robustness of tool usage. While the results are promising, there is still room to improve the reliability and correctness when invoking tools. More advances could make tool usage by language models more practical.

- Exploring cross-modal generalization and transfer learning. The paper focuses on adapting individual language models, but suggests exploring whether tool usage could transfer across modalities, like from visual tasks to audio.

- Developing benchmarks to systematically evaluate tool usage. The authors propose one benchmark, but suggest developing more comprehensive suites to test language models on diverse tools.

- Studying methods beyond self-instruction, such as learning from human feedback or exploration. Alternative techniques could complement or improve upon the self-instruction approach.

In summary, key directions include improving efficiency, expanding tool diversity, enhancing accuracy, enabling cross-modal transfer, and developing rigorous benchmarks to advance tool usage by language models. The authors propose self-instruction as one method, but suggest many avenues for future work in this emerging area.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called GPT4Tools to teach large language models (LLMs) to use multimodal tools via self-instruction. The key idea is to leverage advanced proprietary LLMs like ChatGPT as teachers to generate tool-related instructions conditioned on visual content. Specifically, the authors prompt ChatGPT with image descriptions and tool definitions to produce instruction-following data.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called GPT4Tools to efficiently enable open-source large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA and OPT to utilize multimodal tools. The key idea is to use an advanced proprietary LLM teacher model like ChatGPT to generate a dataset of tool-related instructions conditioned on visual content descriptions. Specifically, the teacher model is prompted with image captions, tool definitions, and prompts encouraging instruction generation. The resulting raw instruction dataset is filtered, augmented with negative and contextual samples, and converted into a standardized instruction-response format. This multi-modal instruction dataset is then used to fine-tune the open-source LLaMA and OPT models using Low-Rank Adaptation, which adapts the model without changing the base parameters. This allows tuning the models to invoke visual tools correctly based on textual input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the ability of LLMs like LLaMA and OPT to successfully utilize both seen and unseen tools across diverse visual tasks in a zero-shot manner.
