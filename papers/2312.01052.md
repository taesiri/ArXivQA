# [Structured, Complex and Time-complete Temporal Event Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01052)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing formulations of temporal events (TEs) are unstructured, atomic, or lack full temporal information, limiting their representation quality and forecasting ability. 
- No previous TE formulation satisfies the key properties of being structured, complex, and time-complete.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a new formulation called Structured, Complex, and Time-complete Temporal Events (SCTc-TE) which has all three key properties. 
- An SCTc-TE is a chronological list of timestamped graphs, each graph containing atomic events occurring at that timestamp and belonging to a complex event. 
- Atomic events are quintuples containing subject, relation, object, timestamp, and complex event ID. Relations indicate event type.
- Develops a fully automated pipeline using pre-trained language models and time-aware clustering to construct SCTc-TEs from news articles.
- Constructs two large-scale datasets from Middle East news: MidEast-TE and GDELT-TE.
- Proposes a TE forecasting model called LoGo that captures both local context (events belonging to the same complex event) and global context (all historical events).

Main Contributions:
- First formulation of TE satisfying properties of structured, complex, and time-complete. 
- Fully automated pipeline for constructing large-scale SCTc-TE datasets from news articles.
- Two new benchmark datasets for TE forecasting: MidEast-TE and GDELT-TE.
- LoGo model for SCTc-TE forecasting that outperforms state-of-the-art by capturing both local and global contexts.

The paper introduces an important new TE representation and methodology to automatically construct such TEs from text and perform forecasting while capturing different contexts. The constructed datasets and proposed model advance the capability for temporal event forecasting.
