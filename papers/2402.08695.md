# [Game of Trojans: Adaptive Adversaries Against Output-based   Trojaned-Model Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08695)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to Trojan attacks where a subset of inputs are embedded with triggers and misclassified to adversary-desired targets. 
- Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) Trojaned model detectors analyze outputs of DNNs to detect Trojans. However, they assume the adversary is static without knowledge of defenses.  
- The paper studies the effectiveness of SOTA output-based Trojaned model detectors against adaptive adversaries with knowledge of defenses who aim to bypass detection.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper models the interaction between an adaptive adversary and adaptive detector as an iterative game with two steps:
   1. The adversary uses trigger and detector parameters to enhance Trojaned model training.
   2. The adversary uses the enhanced Trojaned model to update detector parameters for maximizing detection performance.
- This game is solved using a Min-Max (MM) Trojan algorithm that iteratively updates Trojaned model and detector parameters.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the adversary-detector interaction as an iterative game and proves the game solution allows the adversary to bypass detection.
- Proposes a greedy algorithm for selecting minimum trigger-embedded inputs needed for effective Trojans. Provides theoretical guarantees on minimum required samples.
- Extensive experiments using MNIST, CIFAR, and Speech Command datasets show the adaptive adversary successfully evades four SOTA detectors - MNTD, NeuralCleanse, STRIP and TABOR.

In summary, the paper highlights limitations of existing static Trojaned model detectors against adaptive adversaries and provides an analysis backed by experiments to demonstrate how advanced adversaries can bypass defenses. The findings motivate development of more robust defenses in future.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an adaptive backdoor attack strategy against output-based Trojaned model detectors, models the interaction between the adaptive adversary and detectors as an iterative game, and shows experimentally that the adaptive adversary can effectively bypass state-of-the-art detection methods while maintaining high accuracy on both clean and Trojaned inputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes an adaptive backdoor attack strategy against output-based Trojaned model detectors, with convergence guarantees. Specifically, it models the interaction between an adaptive adversary and adaptive detectors as an iterative game and proves that the solution results in the adversary bypassing detection while maintaining high accuracy.

2) It provides a greedy algorithm for the adversary to select a minimum number of input samples for embedding triggers. When using cross-entropy or log-likelihood loss functions, this algorithm gives provable guarantees on the number of required trigger-embedded samples. 

3) It conducts extensive experiments on four datasets - MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SpeechCommand. The results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive attack strategy can effectively evade four state-of-the-art output-based Trojaned model detectors - MNTD, NeuralCleanse, STRIP and TABOR.

In summary, the key contribution is an adaptive attack that can bypass current defenses, modeled as an iterative game, along with a greedy trigger selection algorithm and empirical validation of the attack's effectiveness. The results highlight the need for more advanced defenses against adaptive adversaries.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Trojan attacks - Embedding triggers into inputs to cause models to misclassify those inputs.

- Output-based Trojaned model detectors - Methods to detect Trojaned models by analyzing their outputs on random/perturbed inputs.

- Adaptive adversaries - Attackers that evolve to evade defenses by learning about and adapting to the defenses. 

- Iterated game model - Formulation of the interaction between an adaptive adversary and adaptive detectors as a game with alternating updates.

- Greedy algorithm - Algorithm to select a minimal set of clean samples to embed triggers into. 

- Provable guarantees - Mathematical proofs showing the adversary can bypass detection or lower bound the number of poisoned samples needed.

- Extensive evaluations - Experiments across image, audio, and other datasets demonstrating effectiveness at evading multiple state-of-the-art detectors.

The key ideas focus on an adaptive adversary that can evade detection, modeled as a game, with guarantees on evading detection and minimizing the number of poisoned samples. The approach is then shown to be effective across diverse domains and against multiple defense methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an iterative game framework between an adaptive adversary and a detector. Can you expand more on the details of how this game is formulated, especially the objective functions of the adversary and detector? 

2. The paper shows that the adversary can evade detection through retraining a Trojaned DNN model. Can you explain more on how the retraining process allows the adversary to evade detection while maintaining accuracy?

3. The degree of freedom in DNN models is exploited by the adversary to evade detection. Elaborate more on why and how the high dimensionality of DNN parameters provides this degree of freedom.

4. The paper uses a greedy algorithm for selecting samples to embed Trojan triggers. Explain how this algorithm works and why it can minimize the number of triggers needed. Also discuss its optimality guarantees. 

5. The test loss function is shown to satisfy submodularity properties. Intuitively explain what this means and why it helps the adversary determine the sufficient number of Trojan triggers to embed.

6. The MM Trojan algorithm alternates between retraining the Trojaned DNN and updating the detector. Walk through the steps of how this algorithm works in detail.

7. The results show the adversary can evade multiple Trojan detection methods. Compare and contrast the detection mechanisms of MNTD, NeuralCleanse, STRIP and TABOR.

8. The adaptive adversary model assumes knowledge of the detector and its parameters. Discuss how reasonable this assumption is and how it affects the threat model.

9. The experiments are conducted on four datasets - MNIST, CIFAR10/100 and SpeechCommand. Explain if and why the type of data affects the performance of the adaptive attack.

10. The Discussion section mentions open questions for future work. What are some promising research directions to design better defenses against such adaptive attacks?
