# [OMGEval: An Open Multilingual Generative Evaluation Benchmark for Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13524)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most existing generative evaluation benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) focus on English, lacking multilingual and cross-cultural perspectives. This limits our ability to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs across diverse global users. 

- Existing multilingual datasets mainly target discriminative tasks like classification, which are not well suited to assess the open-ended generative abilities of LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces OMGEval, the first open-source, multilingual generative evaluation benchmark tailored for LLMs. 

- OMGEval provides over 800 open-ended questions in 5 languages - Chinese, Russian, French, Spanish, Arabic. The questions test 9 key capabilities like reasoning, knowledge, code comprehension etc.

- The questions are localized to fit the cultural context of each language. For example, names of people, places, foods are adapted to be culturally relevant. This helps better simulate real-world language usage.

- GPT-4 is used as an automated evaluator to score model outputs, showing high correlation with human judgments.

Key Contributions:  
- OMGEval enables standardized assessment of multilingual LLMs through localization, expanding generative evaluation beyond English.

- Analysis of models on OMGEval gives insights into current capabilities and gaps, especially for open-source models, in processing cultural nuances.

- The benchmark and analysis highlight the need to improve cultural awareness in LLMs to serve global users better.

Overall, the paper makes an important pioneering effort towards equitable, cross-cultural evaluation of LLMs through OMGEval.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces OMGEval, the first open-source multilingual generative evaluation benchmark for assessing the capabilities of large language models across diverse cultural contexts in 5 languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing OMGEval, an open multilingual generative evaluation benchmark for large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- OMGEval provides 804 open-ended questions in 5 languages (Chinese, Russian, French, Spanish, Arabic) to assess the capabilities of LLMs, covering areas like general knowledge, logical reasoning, etc.

- The questions are localized to reflect cultural backgrounds of different languages. For example, names of people, places, foods, festivals are adapted to be culturally relevant. 

- The benchmark employs GPT-4 as an automated adjudicator to score model outputs, which is shown to correlate well with human evaluation.

- The paper evaluates several multilingual LLMs on OMGEval and shows there is still a significant gap compared to GPT-4, indicating more work is needed to improve cultural competency of open-source models.

In summary, the key contribution is creating a new multilingual dataset that can quantitatively measure and compare generative capabilities of LLMs across diverse cultures.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the localization process for adapting the questions to different cultures work? What are some examples of changes made during localization? 

2. What criteria were used for categorizing the questions into different capability types? Why is the distribution across types currently uneven?

3. What was the process for translating the initial English questions into other languages? Were machine translation models used or human translators? 

4. What quality control and verification steps were taken after the translation and localization processes? What were the qualifications required for the human verifiers?

5. Why is GPT-4 used as the adjudicator model for automatic evaluation? What evidence supports that it correlates well with human judgment?

6. For the human evaluation conducted on Chinese and Spanish, what was the process for having humans judge which model's outputs were better? What measures were used?

7. How do the results analyzing the distribution of root verbs provide insights into the dataset? How does this distribution differ across languages?

8. Why does the performance on the localization subsets decline slightly for some models compared to the full sets? What does this indicate about cultural biases?

9. What are some limitations of existing multilingual evaluations that motivated designing an open-ended, generative benchmark? 

10. What steps could be taken to expand OMGEval in the future, such as including more languages or balancing the distribution of question types?
