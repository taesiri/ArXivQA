## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating 3D shapes with sharp features and precise parametric control remains challenging for current implicit 3D representations and generative models. However, it is crucial for applications like industrial design and manufacturing.

- Text-driven 3D object generation has made progress, but methods rely on implicit representations which struggle to retain sharp features during conversion to explicit forms. Directly generating meshes lacks parametric control.

- The potential of using large language models (LLMs) for precise 3D modeling via program synthesis is promising but underexplored.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a pipeline using LLMs to generate code that controls 3D software like Blender, producing compact 3D shapes adhering to parametric controls.  

- Code is an ideal medium for depicting industrial objects due to compactness, controllability and alignment with design intentions.

- Advanced LLMs show aptitude in programming and 3D reasoning, so they can effectively generate 3D modeling code from descriptions.

- Construct \dataset benchmark dataset focused on typical industrial objects to evaluate LLMs' performance.

Contributions:
- Propose a self-refining framework for text-driven 3D generation with parametric control via LLM program synthesis  

- Construct specialized benchmark dataset \dataset and conduct experiments to analyze cutting-edge LLM capacities

- Explore effective prompt and generation strategies, as well as self-correction abilities of LLMs using visual interfaces

The paper reveals capacities and limitations of LLMs for precise 3D parametric modeling, and provides insights into spatial reasoning, program synthesis and multimodal interaction of LLMs.
