# Kosmos-2: Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models to the World

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to endow multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with grounding capabilities to enable new ways of perceiving and interacting with visual content. Specifically, the paper aims to enable MLLMs to perceive spatial descriptions of objects (like bounding boxes) and ground text to the visual world. The key hypothesis is that by representing object descriptions as sequences of location tokens and training the model on a large corpus of grounded image-text pairs, the model can learn to associate text spans with spatial regions and generate grounded outputs. This grounding capability can unlock new applications like referring expression comprehension/generation and grounded question answering.In summary, the central research question is how to augment MLLMs with visual grounding abilities through a combination of grounded multimodal data and representing object regions as discrete tokens. The hypothesis is that this approach will enable more advanced vision-language understanding and generation compared to prior MLLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is developing Kosmos-2, a multimodal large language model with new capabilities for grounding text to the visual world. Specifically:- They construct a large-scale dataset called GrIT (Grounded Image-Text) by extracting noun phrases and referring expressions from image captions and linking them to bounding boxes in the image. This enables training the model to ground language. - They develop Kosmos-2, an extension of the Kosmos multimodal LLM, by training on GrIT data as well as other multimodal corpora. This endows the model with grounding capabilities.- They demonstrate new capabilities of Kosmos-2 for multimodal grounding (phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension) and referring (referring expression generation). The model can generate bounding boxes from text and vice versa.- They show Kosmos-2 achieves strong performance on not only grounding tasks but also language and vision-language tasks evaluated on the previous Kosmos model.- They discuss how grounding lays a foundation for developing embodied AI systems that can perceive and interact with the visual world based on language.In summary, the core contribution is developing a multimodal LLM with new grounding capabilities by constructing a grounded multimodal dataset and training an enhanced model on this data. This work moves towards language models that can perceive and ground themselves in the visual world.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper introduces Kosmos-2, a multimodal large language model with new capabilities for grounding text to visual regions via representing object descriptions as Markdown-style links, enabling stronger performance on vision-language tasks requiring pointing, comprehension, and generation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of multimodal large language models:- The key novel contribution of this paper is the introduction of the grounded multimodal large language model Kosmos-2, which has new capabilities for perceiving object descriptions (bounding boxes) and grounding text to visual images. This differentiates it from prior work like Kosmos-1, MetaLM, and others that do not have explicit grounding capabilities. - The paper demonstrates strong performance on a range of multimodal grounding tasks like phrase grounding and referring expression comprehension. This shows the model has acquired useful grounding abilities lacking in other MLLMs. However, the performance is still lower than state-of-the-art specialized models, suggesting room for improvement.- For vision-language tasks like VQA and image captioning, Kosmos-2 achieves competitive results compared to Kosmos-1, showing that adding grounding does not degrade performance on these tasks. However, the gains over Kosmos-1 are marginal, suggesting the grounding abilities have not yet translated into big gains on these tasks.- For language tasks, Kosmos-2 is comparable to Kosmos-1, indicating adding visual grounding did not negatively impact language understanding abilities. But the lack of clear gains suggests the grounding abilities are not yet benefiting language-only tasks.- The use of a large grounded image-text dataset to train grounding abilities is an interesting technique not explored much in prior MLLMs. This could be a promising direction for further research. However, engineering more structured grounding data could be beneficial.In summary, this paper makes good progress on enabling grounding in MLLMs, with strong results on direct grounding tasks. But more work is likely needed to realize bigger gains across vision-language, language, and reasoning tasks from the grounding abilities. The grounded training data technique seems promising to build upon in future work.
