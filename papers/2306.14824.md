# [Kosmos-2: Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models to the World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14824)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to endow multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with grounding capabilities to enable new ways of perceiving and interacting with visual content. Specifically, the paper aims to enable MLLMs to perceive spatial descriptions of objects (like bounding boxes) and ground text to the visual world. 

The key hypothesis is that by representing object descriptions as sequences of location tokens and training the model on a large corpus of grounded image-text pairs, the model can learn to associate text spans with spatial regions and generate grounded outputs. This grounding capability can unlock new applications like referring expression comprehension/generation and grounded question answering.

In summary, the central research question is how to augment MLLMs with visual grounding abilities through a combination of grounded multimodal data and representing object regions as discrete tokens. The hypothesis is that this approach will enable more advanced vision-language understanding and generation compared to prior MLLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is developing Kosmos-2, a multimodal large language model with new capabilities for grounding text to the visual world. Specifically:

- They construct a large-scale dataset called GrIT (Grounded Image-Text) by extracting noun phrases and referring expressions from image captions and linking them to bounding boxes in the image. This enables training the model to ground language. 

- They develop Kosmos-2, an extension of the Kosmos multimodal LLM, by training on GrIT data as well as other multimodal corpora. This endows the model with grounding capabilities.

- They demonstrate new capabilities of Kosmos-2 for multimodal grounding (phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension) and referring (referring expression generation). The model can generate bounding boxes from text and vice versa.

- They show Kosmos-2 achieves strong performance on not only grounding tasks but also language and vision-language tasks evaluated on the previous Kosmos model.

- They discuss how grounding lays a foundation for developing embodied AI systems that can perceive and interact with the visual world based on language.

In summary, the core contribution is developing a multimodal LLM with new grounding capabilities by constructing a grounded multimodal dataset and training an enhanced model on this data. This work moves towards language models that can perceive and ground themselves in the visual world.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Kosmos-2, a multimodal large language model with new capabilities for grounding text to visual regions via representing object descriptions as Markdown-style links, enabling stronger performance on vision-language tasks requiring pointing, comprehension, and generation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of multimodal large language models:

- The key novel contribution of this paper is the introduction of the grounded multimodal large language model Kosmos-2, which has new capabilities for perceiving object descriptions (bounding boxes) and grounding text to visual images. This differentiates it from prior work like Kosmos-1, MetaLM, and others that do not have explicit grounding capabilities. 

- The paper demonstrates strong performance on a range of multimodal grounding tasks like phrase grounding and referring expression comprehension. This shows the model has acquired useful grounding abilities lacking in other MLLMs. However, the performance is still lower than state-of-the-art specialized models, suggesting room for improvement.

- For vision-language tasks like VQA and image captioning, Kosmos-2 achieves competitive results compared to Kosmos-1, showing that adding grounding does not degrade performance on these tasks. However, the gains over Kosmos-1 are marginal, suggesting the grounding abilities have not yet translated into big gains on these tasks.

- For language tasks, Kosmos-2 is comparable to Kosmos-1, indicating adding visual grounding did not negatively impact language understanding abilities. But the lack of clear gains suggests the grounding abilities are not yet benefiting language-only tasks.

- The use of a large grounded image-text dataset to train grounding abilities is an interesting technique not explored much in prior MLLMs. This could be a promising direction for further research. However, engineering more structured grounding data could be beneficial.

In summary, this paper makes good progress on enabling grounding in MLLMs, with strong results on direct grounding tasks. But more work is likely needed to realize bigger gains across vision-language, language, and reasoning tasks from the grounding abilities. The grounded training data technique seems promising to build upon in future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more advanced grounding techniques to handle more complex linguistic constructs beyond noun phrases and referring expressions. The authors note that the current approach in Kosmos-2 still has limitations in accurately grounding certain types of human expressions.

- Exploring new model architectures and self-supervised objectives to better integrate multimodal grounding capabilities. The authors suggest investigating transformer variants and pretraining tasks tailored for visual grounding.

- Scaling up models with more data and parameters to further improve performance on vision-language tasks. The authors note the promising results achieved by Kosmos-2 and suggest scaling up as an important direction. 

- Enhancing embodiment capabilities to move beyond static images, such as grounding language in interactive environments and videos. The authors highlight the importance of embodiment for artificial general intelligence.

- Combining grounding with commonsense reasoning and world knowledge to achieve more human-like language understanding. The authors discuss the need to connect grounding with deeper reasoning abilities.

- Developing new evaluation benchmarks to assess multimodal grounding and embodiment skills, which remain relatively lacking. 

- Studying social grounding to ground language in physical worlds and social contexts during human-AI interaction.

- Investigating potential societal impacts and ethical issues related to grounded LLMs.

In summary, the key suggestions focus on scaling up grounding capabilities, connecting grounding with deeper reasoning, developing more advanced embodiment in dynamic environments, and assessing societal impacts. Advancing research in these areas could enable more human-like multimodal AI.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Kosmos-2, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that enables new capabilities for perceiving object descriptions (e.g. bounding boxes) and grounding text to the visual world. Specifically, the authors represent refer expressions as links in Markdown format, pairing text spans with bounding boxes describing object locations. Using multimodal corpora combined with a new large-scale dataset of grounded image-text pairs called GrIT, the model is trained via next word prediction. In addition to capabilities like following instructions and in-context learning seen in prior MLLMs, Kosmos-2 integrates grounding abilities into downstream tasks. The authors evaluate the model on a range of multimodal grounding, referring, perception-language, and language tasks. Results show Kosmos-2 achieves strong performance on grounding tasks like phrase grounding and referring expression comprehension while maintaining competitive results on vision-language tasks relative to prior MLLMs like Kosmos. This work lays a foundation for developing Embodiment AI and convergence of language, perception, action, and world modeling toward artificial general intelligence.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Kosmos-2, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that enables new capabilities for perceiving object descriptions (e.g. bounding boxes) and grounding text to the visual world. The key innovation is representing refer expressions as links in Markdown, i.e. "[text span](bounding boxes)", where object descriptions are sequences of location tokens. The authors construct a large-scale dataset called GrIT (Grounded Image-Text) from existing image-text corpora, to train the model on grounded image-text pairs. 

Kosmos-2 integrates grounding capabilities into downstream applications. Experiments demonstrate impressive performance on multimodal grounding (referring expression comprehension, phrase grounding), multimodal referring (referring expression generation), perception-language tasks (image captioning, VQA), and language tasks. The grounding capability provides more accurate and comprehensive responses compared to text-only outputs. This work lays the foundation for Embodiment AI by enabling the convergence of language, perception, action and world modeling - a key step towards artificial general intelligence.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces Kosmos-2, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with new capabilities for grounding language to visual representations. The key method is training the model on a large-scale dataset called GrIT (Grounded Image-Text pairs), constructed by linking phrases in image captions to bounding boxes for the corresponding objects. GrIT is built by parsing captions to extract noun phrases, expanding them into referring expressions, and associating them with bounding boxes detected in the image using an off-the-shelf grounding model. The referring expressions and bounding boxes are represented as hyperlinks in the training data, using special tokens like <p> </p> around the phrase and <box> </box> around the location tokens. This allows the model to learn associations between textual phrases and visual regions. The model architecture follows Kosmos-1, using a Transformer encoder pretrained on multimodal corpora augmented with GrIT. The next token prediction objective allows jointly learning text, vision, and grounded representations. Evaluation shows Kosmos-2 acquires strong grounding capabilities for tasks like referring expression comprehension while maintaining strong language and vision-language performance. The grounded representations enable new applications like generating bounded boxes for phrases and generating referring expressions.
