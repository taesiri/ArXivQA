# [Classifying complex documents: comparing bespoke solutions to large   language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07182)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: The paper examines the challenge of automatically classifying a large set of complex legal documents (around 30,000 public courthouse records) into relevant categories. The goal is to evaluate different automated classification approaches, including a custom bag-of-words model versus fine-tuning a large language model (LLM), to achieve high accuracy in categorizing these documents.  

Proposed Solution: The authors develop three classification approaches: (1) A bespoke bag-of-words neural net model trained on all 30,000 documents; (2) An off-the-shelf LLM (GPT-3.5); (3) A fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 using just 2,000 example documents. They compare the accuracy of these models on two classification tasks: Binary (relevant versus not relevant) and multi-label categorization into 9 fine-grained type tags.

Key Results: The custom bag-of-words model performs the best, with 96% binary accuracy. The off-the-shelf LLM is significantly worse. Fine-tuning improves the LLM's accuracy considerably, but plateaus below the custom model, topping out at 90% binary accuracy. More data for fine-tuning yields diminishing returns - performance saturates after the first 2,000 training examples.

Main Contributions:
(1) Demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy for automated classification of complex legal documents;  
(2) Provides comparison between custom NLP methods versus general pretrained LLMs;
(3) Highlights tradeoff between accuracy and annotation effort for LLMs with limited fine-tuning.

In summary, the key insight is that fine-tuned LLMs can approach and complement custom NLP solutions, but likely will not completely replace bespoke models for certain high-stakes classification tasks. The paper offers guidance on this engineering tradeoff for real-world settings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper compares the performance of a custom bag-of-words neural network model, an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM), and a fine-tuned LLM on a complex document classification task involving 30,000 oil and gas legal records, finding that the custom model achieves the highest accuracy, but fine-tuning the LLM leads to comparable though lower performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper compares three approaches for classifying complex legal documents: (1) a bespoke, custom-trained classification model; (2) an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM); and (3) a fine-tuned LLM. It finds that the bespoke model achieves the highest accuracy, but fine-tuning an LLM can reach comparable though lower accuracy levels. Specifically:

- The bespoke model combines a bag-of-words representation with a convolutional neural network and is trained on 30,000 manually labeled documents.

- The off-the-shelf LLM (GPT-3.5) underperforms compared to the bespoke model.

- Fine-tuning GPT-3.5 on as few as 2,000 labeled documents significantly improves its performance, though it does not reach the accuracy of the bespoke model.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating that fine-tuned LLMs can achieve high accuracy on complex document classification without requiring the large labeled datasets and custom model development of bespoke solutions. However, bespoke solutions still outperform LLMs on this task.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares three approaches: a bespoke bag-of-words model, GPT-3.5, and a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5. What are the key differences between these approaches and what are the relative strengths and weaknesses of each?

2. The fine-tuning process for GPT-3.5 involves providing example texts and labels. What considerations went into selecting the examples used for fine-tuning and how might the choice of examples impact model performance? 

3. The bag-of-words model uses n-gram encoding of texts. What was the motivation behind using n-grams versus word-level encoding? How was the optimal n-gram size and context window determined?

4. The paper notes that the bespoke model achieves better performance than the fine-tuned GPT-3.5. What factors may contribute to this gap in performance? Are there ways the fine-tuning process could be improved to further close this gap?

5. For real-world deployment, the paper mentions some additional components needed such as validation layers and post-processing. What would a complete production-level system architecture look like using the fine-tuned GPT-3.5 approach?

6. The legal documents used pose some unique challenges such as length, nuanced classifications, and domain complexity. How do these attributes of the data make this an especially difficult text classification task?

7. The data contained some mislabeled examples. What techniques could be used to identify and handle this label noise during model training? How significant of an impact can label noise have?

8. What other classification algorithms or neural network architectures could have been explored as alternatives to the bag-of-words model? What are the tradeoffs to consider?

9. The paper focuses on a document classification task. What other natural language processing tasks would be good candidates for the GPT fine-tuning approach? What types of tasks would be less amenable?

10. The paper hints that keeping an internal LLM can mitigate some risks of relying on third-party services. What are the practical barriers organizations face in implementing and maintaining production LLMs internally?
