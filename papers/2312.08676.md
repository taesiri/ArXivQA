# [SEF-VC: Speaker Embedding Free Zero-Shot Voice Conversion with Cross   Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08676)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes SEF-VC, a novel zero-shot voice conversion model that does not rely on speaker embeddings for voice conversion. Instead, SEF-VC incorporates target speaker information through a position-agnostic cross-attention mechanism between the semantic representation of the content and the mel-spectrogram of the target reference speech. This allows SEF-VC to directly learn the target speaker's timbre from the reference mel-spectrogram. Waveform synthesis is then achieved by passing the adapted semantic representation through HiFi-GAN in a non-autoregressive manner. Experiments show SEF-VC outperforms baselines in similarity and naturalness, even with very short (2s) references. Ablations demonstrate the superiority of cross-attention over speaker embeddings for speaker modeling. With concise design and strong performance, SEF-VC advances state-of-the-art in zero-shot VC towards a production-ready solution.
