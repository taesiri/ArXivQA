# [Think Twice Before Selection: Federated Evidential Active Learning for   Medical Image Analysis with Domain Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02567)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel federated active learning (FAL) method called Federated Evidential Active Learning (FEAL) to address the challenges of unreliable data assessment and annotation cost burden in the presence of domain shifts across clients. FEAL leverages a Dirichlet-based evidential model to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in categorial predictions. It employs the epistemic uncertainty from the global model to calibrate the aggregated aleatoric uncertainty from both global and local models for reliable evaluation. FEAL also incorporates a diversity relaxation strategy using the local model to reduce redundancy and maintain sample diversity. Experiments on five multi-center medical datasets demonstrate that FEAL consistently outperforms existing FAL methods and attains comparable performance to full supervision with only a fraction of labeled samples. The analyses provide insights into the effects of uncertainty calibration, diversity relaxation, and evidential model training, validating the efficacy of the proposed solutions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a federated active learning method called FEAL that handles domain shifts across clients by using a Dirichlet-based evidential model to capture aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties for reliable data evaluation, an uncertainty calibration strategy to select informative samples, and an evidence regularization approach for accurate data assessment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors explore the problem of federated active learning (FAL) with domain shifts across clients, which aims to attain a global model with limited annotation budget for each local client in the presence of domain shifts. This is a rarely studied but critical problem.

2. The authors propose a novel method called Federated Evidential Active Learning (FEAL) to address the challenges in FAL with domain shifts. FEAL has two key components: 

(a) Calibrated Evidential Sampling (CES), a new FAL sampling strategy that incorporates both uncertainty and diversity measures by leveraging aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in global and local models and also maintaining sample diversity.

(b) Evidential Model Learning (EML), which introduces evidence regularization in model training for accurate evidence representation and reliable data assessment.

3. The authors conduct extensive experiments on five real multi-center medical image datasets and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FEAL method over state-of-the-art active learning and federated active learning methods. The results show the efficacy of FEAL in selecting informative samples and learning effective models under domain shifts in federated scenarios.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the FEAL method to address the important but rarely studied problem of federated active learning with domain shifts by effective sampling strategy design and model training. Both components of FEAL and the comprehensive experimental results demonstrate its capabilities.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning enables collaborative training of a global model across clients without centralizing data, but requires expensive annotation costs at each local client. Federated active learning (FAL) methods have been proposed to select the most informative samples for annotation to reduce this cost.  
- However, existing FAL methods make unreliable assessments of local sample informativeness when there are domain shifts across clients. This is due to two key issues:
  1) Overconfidence: Deterministic models used in FAL can be miscalibrated on out-of-domain data, resulting in overconfident and unreliable uncertainty estimates.
  2) Limited uncertainty representation: Uncertainty can be categorized into aleatoric (data) and epistemic (knowledge). Existing FAL methods only capture aleatoric uncertainty.

Proposed Solution - Federated Evidential Active Learning (FEAL):
- Treats categorical predictions as distributions using a Dirichlet prior to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
- Comprises two modules:
  1) Calibrated Evidential Sampling (CES): Uses expected entropy to quantify aleatoric uncertainty in both global and local models. Leverages differential entropy to characterize epistemic uncertainty in the global model. Calibrates the aggregated aleatoric uncertainty using the global model's epistemic uncertainty. Also employs a diversity relaxation strategy using the local model to reduce redundancy.
  2) Evidential Model Learning (EML): Incorporates an evidence regularization term during local model training to improve evidence modeling and assessment.

Main Contributions:
- First work to study FAL with domain shifts and capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties for reliable assessment.
- Proposes FEAL incorporating calibrated evidential sampling and evidential model learning to select informative samples and learn robust localized representations.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 multi-center medical datasets spanning classification and segmentation tasks. Outperforms existing FAL methods, especially in presence of domain shifts.

In summary, the paper explores an important and practical problem in FAL, and develops a novel solution leveraging probabilistic modeling and uncertainty calibration to reliably evaluate sample informativeness across diverse localized domains.
