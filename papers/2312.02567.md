# [Think Twice Before Selection: Federated Evidential Active Learning for   Medical Image Analysis with Domain Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02567)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel federated active learning (FAL) method called Federated Evidential Active Learning (FEAL) to address the challenges of unreliable data assessment and annotation cost burden in the presence of domain shifts across clients. FEAL leverages a Dirichlet-based evidential model to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in categorial predictions. It employs the epistemic uncertainty from the global model to calibrate the aggregated aleatoric uncertainty from both global and local models for reliable evaluation. FEAL also incorporates a diversity relaxation strategy using the local model to reduce redundancy and maintain sample diversity. Experiments on five multi-center medical datasets demonstrate that FEAL consistently outperforms existing FAL methods and attains comparable performance to full supervision with only a fraction of labeled samples. The analyses provide insights into the effects of uncertainty calibration, diversity relaxation, and evidential model training, validating the efficacy of the proposed solutions.
