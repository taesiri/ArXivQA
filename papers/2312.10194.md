# [Pareto Envelope Augmented with Reinforcement Learning: Multi-objective   reinforcement learning-based approach for Large-Scale Constrained Pressurized   Water Reactor optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10194)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on solving real-world multi-objective optimization problems, particularly in engineering design applications like nuclear reactor fuel loading. Such problems inherently have multiple conflicting objectives (e.g. maximizing efficiency while minimizing cost or risks) and constraints that must be satisfied (e.g. safety limits). Traditional single-objective optimization methods fall short in addressing such scenarios. The paper argues that existing multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) methods also have limitations: they either require multiple policies to be trained separately or rely on problem-specific tuning of parameters, which is undesirable.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new algorithm called PEARL (Pareto Envelope Augmented with Reinforcement Learning). PEARL is capable of learning a single policy to efficiently discover a diverse set of solutions belonging to the Pareto optimal front. Three key variants of PEARL are presented - envelope-based (PEARL-e), indicator-based (PEARL-epsilon) and dominance/crowding-based (PEARL-NdS). For constrained problems, the Curriculum Learning concept is incorporated into PEARL where constraints are first satisfied before optimizing for objectives.  

Contributions:

1) Introduction of a new multi-objective policy-based algorithm (PEARL) that can handle discrete/continuous variables without problem-specific tuning.

2) Pioneering application of multi-objective RL to nuclear reactor core optimization, extending prior single-objective RL work. Comparison against widely used genetic algorithms.  

3) Demonstrated PEARL's versatility through evaluations on multi-objective test suites and a practical engineering design problem (pressurized water reactor loading pattern optimization) involving 2-3 objectives and 3 constraints. PEARL-NdS found to consistently outperform alternatives.

4) Handling constraints via Curriculum Learning by first satisfying constraints before Pareto front optimization. Ranking solutions based on feasibility alone also explored. Distance-based methods found effective for balancing constraint satisfaction and objective optimization.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in developing and demonstrating a flexible multi-objective RL approach for complex engineering design optimization problems.
