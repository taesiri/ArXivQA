# [Predicting Outcomes in Video Games with Long Short Term Memory Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15923)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Forecasting winners in e-sports matches in real-time is challenging but can enhance audience engagement. However, current sports outcome predictions rely on pre-match data and lack real-time predictive capabilities. 
- Two-player video games offer rich real-time data but prior attempts at real-time forecasting in such games have been limited.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to make robust real-time predictions of round outcomes in two-player games. 
- As a proof of concept, the authors apply LSTM networks to predict outcomes in the classic arcade fighting game "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" using only the percentage health losses of both players in each frame.
- Predictions are made at 25%, 75% and 95% of the round progression to evaluate the model's capacity for early, mid-round and late predictions.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates the ability of LSTMs to accurately forecast outcomes of two-player game rounds in real-time at varying stages of progression.
- Provides a novel method of prediction that relies solely on the health indicator data of both players, capturing the dynamics of attacks and reactions.
- Outperforms Transformer networks and other baseline ML models in predicting outcomes.
- Releases an open-source dataset and implementation to further research in this domain. 
- Establishes a proof of concept for using deep learning on game data to temporally predict outcomes as a way to increase viewer engagement.

In summary, the paper pioneers a robust LSTM-based approach for real-time forecasting of outcomes in two player games. It contributes an effective methodology, strong empirical results, and open-sources assets to enable further research directions. The main premise is enhancing viewer immersion by temporally predicting competition outcomes.
