# [GPTBIAS: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Bias in Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06315)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel bias evaluation framework called GPTBIAS for assessing bias in large language models (LLMs). Due to the increasing adoption of LLMs, there are concerns about their potential to generate biased content. Existing evaluation methods have limitations in robustness and interpretability. To address this, the authors introduce "Bias Attack Instructions" specifically designed to elicit biased responses from models. They then input these instructions and model responses into the powerful GPT-4 model, which evaluates the presence of bias and provides additional details including bias types, impacted demographics, causes of bias, and suggestions for mitigations. A key advantage of GPTBIAS is its ability to detect subtle and intersectional biases while also enhancing interpretability through its detailed outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate GPTBIAS's effectiveness in evaluating bias across popular LLMs like OPT, BLOOM, LLaMA variants, and GPT-3 models. The framework provides benchmark bias scores for these models. In summary, GPTBIAS offers an interpretable, comprehensive solution for quantifying and understanding bias in black-box language models.
