# [GPTBIAS: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Bias in Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06315)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are being widely adopted but have the risk of generating biased content.  
- Existing evaluation methods for bias have limitations - require labeled data or model access, limited bias types detected, low interpretability.

Proposed Solution - GPTBIAS Framework
- Leverages capabilities of LLMs like GPT-4 to evaluate bias in other models. 
- Introduces "Bias Attack Instructions" spanning 9 bias categories to test model's susceptibility to bias.
- Outputs comprehensive details - bias score, types, keywords, affected groups, reasons and suggestions.

Key Contributions:
- Bias Attack Instructions to elicit biased responses from models.  
- GPTBIAS framework that uses GPT-4 to assess bias in black-box models.
- More interpretable evaluation via bias types, reasons, affected groups etc.  
- Benchmark to measure model bias beyond just a score.
- Guidance to mitigate model biases and reduce potential harm.

In summary, the paper presents GPTBIAS, a novel bias evaluation framework for large language models that provides interpretability and actionable details in addition to quantifying bias. By leveraging the capabilities of models like GPT-4, it enables comprehensive and credible assessment even for black-box models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a comprehensive framework called GPTBIAS for evaluating bias in large language models, which leverages the capabilities of models like GPT-4 to provide detailed bias analysis including types, demographics affected, reasons, and suggestions beyond just a quantitative score.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel bias evaluation framework called GPTBIAS for assessing bias in large language models. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. Creating a set of bias attack instructions covering nine distinct bias types (gender, religion, race, etc.) to test model susceptibility to biased content. 

2. Introducing the GPTBIAS framework that leverages the capabilities of large language models like GPT-4 to evaluate bias. It provides not just a quantitative bias score but also detailed interpretability into bias types, affected demographics, reasons, and suggestions.

3. GPTBIAS allows evaluating bias in black-box models and detecting intersectional biases as well as biases not present in the instructions themselves.

4. Establishing an interpretable benchmark for measuring model bias that goes beyond a simple score to offer rich analysis about the biases. This enhances credibility and facilitates further analysis into causes and mitigation of biases.

In summary, the key innovation is developing GPTBIAS as a comprehensive, interpretable, and flexible framework for evaluating biases in large language models, setting a new benchmark for bias analysis.
