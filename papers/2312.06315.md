# [GPTBIAS: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Bias in Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06315)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are being widely adopted but have the risk of generating biased content.  
- Existing evaluation methods for bias have limitations - require labeled data or model access, limited bias types detected, low interpretability.

Proposed Solution - GPTBIAS Framework
- Leverages capabilities of LLMs like GPT-4 to evaluate bias in other models. 
- Introduces "Bias Attack Instructions" spanning 9 bias categories to test model's susceptibility to bias.
- Outputs comprehensive details - bias score, types, keywords, affected groups, reasons and suggestions.

Key Contributions:
- Bias Attack Instructions to elicit biased responses from models.  
- GPTBIAS framework that uses GPT-4 to assess bias in black-box models.
- More interpretable evaluation via bias types, reasons, affected groups etc.  
- Benchmark to measure model bias beyond just a score.
- Guidance to mitigate model biases and reduce potential harm.

In summary, the paper presents GPTBIAS, a novel bias evaluation framework for large language models that provides interpretability and actionable details in addition to quantifying bias. By leveraging the capabilities of models like GPT-4, it enables comprehensive and credible assessment even for black-box models.
