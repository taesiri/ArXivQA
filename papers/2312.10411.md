# [Towards Reliable Participation in UAV-Enabled Federated Edge Learning on   Non-IID Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10411)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper investigates the issue of participant selection in federated learning (FL) systems that use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as clients. Such systems face several challenges:

1) Statistical heterogeneity: Due to different locations and environments, UAVs collect non-identically distributed (non-IID) data that is skewed between clients. 

2) System heterogeneity: Differences in UAVs' computing/storage capabilities and battery levels lead to stragglers (slow devices) and dropouts (devices leaving early).

3) Security issues: Malicious UAVs can conduct poisoning attacks by submitting harmful model updates to degrade the global model's accuracy.

These issues significantly affect the convergence and accuracy of the FL model. Existing client selection schemes do not adequately address participant reliability in the presence of such heterogeneous and adversarial environments.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a 3-step cascaded client selection scheme:

1) Filter out stragglers using the interquartile range method.

2) Mitigate dropouts by assigning a reliability score to each client based on their participation history. Prioritize clients with higher scores.

3) Detect poisoning attacks using density-based spatial clustering on the cosine similarity between weight updates. Eliminate clusters detected as malicious.  

Main Contributions:

1) A novel client selection scheme that enhances convergence by favoring reliable and fast UAVs while eliminating misbehaving ones.

2) Effective defense against untargeted attacks (degrading overall accuracy) and targeted attacks (causing wrong predictions for specific inputs).

3) Demonstrated superior performance over baselines in terms of accuracy, convergence rate, attack success rate and overhead, under non-IID data distributions and different attack scenarios.

The scheme provides a robust UAV selection solution for reliable and secure federated learning, in the presence of heterogeneous and adversarial environments.
