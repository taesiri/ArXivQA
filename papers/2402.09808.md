# [Knowledge of Pretrained Language Models on Surface Information of Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pretrained language models (PLMs) lack knowledge about surface information of text tokens, such as character lengths, substrings, and character positions. This limits their performance on tasks requiring surface understanding like information extraction, length-specified generation, and extractive QA. 

- It is unclear what types of surface information are captured in the subword and word embeddings learned by PLMs. Analyzing this is an important first step towards developing "surface-sensitive" PLMs.

Methodology:
- Analyzed surface knowledge of PLMs from 3 perspectives: token length, substrings, word constitution (character locations)
- Trained MLPs to extract these types of surface information from subword and word embeddings of PLMs
- Compared 6 English PLMs (Word2Vec, BERT, T5, LLaMA, etc) and 3 Japanese PLMs (rinna, Swallow)

Results:
- PLMs capture partial knowledge of token length and substrings but not precise character locations
- Recent large PLMs (LLaMA) outperform older PLMs (Word2Vec) in capturing surface properties 
- Observed decoder-side bottlenecks in utilizing the surface knowledge, based on generations

Conclusions:
- Surface knowledge of PLMs is incomplete, lacking precise positional information
- Continued analysis of surface properties is important for improving PLMs and developing "surface-sensitive" models
- There are decoder-side limitations in effectively using the acquired surface knowledge

The key contributions are the in-depth analysis quantifying surface knowledge in PLMs from multiple facets, comparisons across models and languages, and insights on decoder-side bottlenecks. The results motivate developing enhanced architectures to capture surface properties.
