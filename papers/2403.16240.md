## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper focuses on the problem of cardiac motion tracking in medical images. Tracking the motion of the heart across a sequence of images can be clinically useful for diagnosis and identification of certain heart conditions. However, accurately tracking cardiac motion is challenging due to the complex non-rigid deformations of the heart. 

The paper proposes a novel method for cardiac motion tracking by combining ideas from diffeomorphic image registration and robust principle component analysis (RPCA). Diffeomorphic image registration involves warping one image to match another through a smooth and invertible mapping. RPCA decomposes an input matrix into a low-rank part (capturing redundancies) and a sparse part (capturing deviations).  

The key insight is that good alignment of a sequence of images to a target image should result in a low-rank output after warping. This allows RPCA to be incorporated into the image registration framework for enforcing low-rankness as a proxy for good alignment.

Specifically, the method represents the input images as vectorized matrices. Image registration is performed on these matrices in a group-wise manner to align all images simultaneously. The difference between the warped source matrix and fixed target matrix is decomposed into low-rank and sparse parts via RPCA. The low-rankness penalty encourages all aligned images to appear similar. Smooth deformation regularization is also incorporated. These components are combined in an optimization problem and efficiently solved using ADMM techniques.

Experiments on cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate the method's ability to perform accurate group-wise image registration. The warped images are shown to be low-rank, indicating good alignment. Quantitative evaluation using Dice metric shows improved performance over standard pairwise registration.

The key contributions are: (1) a novel formulation for combining diffeomorphic image registration and RPCA for motion tracking, (2) efficient optimization algorithm, and (3) experiments highlighting improved group-wise registration performance on cardiac MRI data. The method provides a new way to leverage low-rank penalties for enforcing constraints in medical image analysis problems.
