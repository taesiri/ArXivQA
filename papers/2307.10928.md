# [FLASK: Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill   Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10928)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we comprehensively evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in an aligned way that takes into account the nuanced combination of skills required to respond properly to open-ended instructions?

The authors note that existing approaches to LLM evaluation using benchmarks or overall scoring have limitations in terms of being coarse-grained and lacking interpretability. Their proposed solution is a fine-grained evaluation protocol called FLASK that allows analyzing model performance on an instance-wise basis across different skills, domains, and difficulty levels. 

Specifically, the key hypotheses/questions FLASK aims to address are:

- Can defining a taxonomy of 12 fine-grained skill sets enable more comprehensive and interpretable analysis of LLMs' capabilities compared to existing evaluation settings?

- Does annotating the skill sets, domains, and difficulty levels for each evaluation instance allow meaningful analysis of model performance depending on these factors? 

- Can fine-grained scoring of model responses for each skill improve reliability and mitigate biases compared to ranking-based evaluation?

- How does model performance vary across different skills, domains, difficulties when evaluated via FLASK's fine-grained protocol?

So in summary, the main research focus is on developing and validating a new comprehensive and interpretable evaluation methodology for analyzing the nuanced skill sets of LLMs when responding to open-ended instructions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Introducing FLASK, a new fine-grained evaluation protocol for assessing language models. FLASK allows evaluating models on a granular, skill-based level rather than just assigning an overall score.

2. Defining a taxonomy of 12 fine-grained language skills needed for models to properly follow open-ended instructions. These skills cover logical reasoning, background knowledge, problem handling, and user alignment abilities.

3. Annotating each instance in the FLASK evaluation set with the necessary skills, target domains, and difficulty levels. This metadata enables analyzing model performance across different axes. 

4. Conducting comprehensive analyses to compare various open-sourced and proprietary models using both model-based and human-based evaluations of FLASK. The analyses reveal strengths/weaknesses of different models.

5. Providing actionable insights for developers and practitioners. For developers, FLASK suggests areas to focus on improving particular skills. For practitioners, FLASK can inform selecting suitable models based on required skills.

6. Releasing the FLASK data, code, and interactive demo to enable further research and applications leveraging this fine-grained evaluation approach.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing FLASK as a new way to evaluate language models at a more granular level based on skill sets, along with conducting insightful analyses using FLASK and releasing the resources to the community. This enables better understanding, comparison, and improvement of language models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on skimming through the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper introduces FLASK, a new fine-grained evaluation protocol for Large Language Models that decomposes coarse scoring into skill set-level analysis to provide a more comprehensive and interpretable assessment of model capabilities across different skills, domains, and difficulties.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- The paper introduces a new fine-grained evaluation framework called FLASK that decomposes the assessment of language model capabilities into 12 distinct skills. This allows for more nuanced analysis compared to common evaluation methods that rely on overall scores or performance on independent benchmarks. The skill taxonomy and instance-wise scoring approach seems novel compared to prior work.

- The paper evaluates and compares several proprietary and open-source large language models using both human evaluators and an "oracle" language model evaluator. Using FLASK to analyze model performance across different skills, domains, and difficulties provides more detailed insights compared to evaluating overall human preference or accuracy on a test set.

- The analysis reveals some interesting findings around the capabilities of different language models. For example, it suggests that current open-source models still lag significantly behind proprietary models in logical reasoning abilities, even if they can mimic other qualities through distillation. These insights build on other recent benchmarking studies.

- The authors demonstrate how FLASK can benefit both model developers and practitioners by identifying strengths/weaknesses of different models and guiding training priorities. Providing this level of analysis to help direct research and application seems relatively unique.

- The focus on evaluating alignment to human values/instructions also relates to emerging work on stewardship and responsible AI, where assessing model behaviors across different dimensions is important. FLASK provides a toolkit to support this.

Overall, the fine-grained skill analysis enabled by FLASK distinguishes this paper from most prior language model evaluation research. The insights it provides into current capabilities and how to improve models also seem quite novel and practically valuable to the field. However, more analysis may be needed to fully validate the skill taxonomy and evaluation approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Extend FLASK to multilingual instructions, multi-turn conversations, multi-modal inputs, and few-shot in-context learning evaluation. The current scope of FLASK is limited to monolingual English instructions, single-turn responses, and zero-shot evaluation without context. Expanding FLASK along these dimensions would allow more comprehensive evaluation.

- Mitigate limitations of human and model evaluators. The authors suggest exploring techniques to reduce human annotator fatigue and biases of model evaluators like position bias and verbosity bias. This could improve the reliability of evaluations.

- Expand the skill taxonomy as new LLM abilities emerge. As LLMs continue to evolve, new capabilities may need to be incorporated into the skill categorization framework. Keeping the taxonomy up-to-date will ensure comprehensive evaluation. 

- Optimize different skills using expert models. The authors propose training separate expert models to acquire each skill effectively instead of relying solely on scale. This could be a promising direction.

- Apply FLASK to develop better base models, training techniques and datasets. The fine-grained insights from FLASK can guide developing stronger LLMs aligned to human values.

- Use FLASK for personalized model recommendation. The evaluation data could automatically recommend suitable LLM APIs based on the requested task's skill, domain and difficulty metadata.

- Expand analysis on model scale, training data, and techniques for proprietary LLMs. More transparency into proprietary models would enable deeper investigation along these dimensions.

In summary, key future work involves expanding FLASK's scope, optimizing human and model evaluation, evolving the skill taxonomy, training expert models per skill, and leveraging FLASK insights to improve alignment of open and proprietary LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces FLASK (Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets), a new evaluation protocol for assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). FLASK decomposes the coarse-level scoring of model responses into fine-grained instance-wise skill set evaluations. The authors define 12 skills categorized into 4 primary abilities - logical thinking, background knowledge, problem handling, and user alignment - that are necessary for LLMs to follow open-ended instructions. For each instance in the evaluation set, relevant skills, domain, and difficulty level are annotated. Human evaluators or "oracle" LLMs then score each skill from 1-5 based on predefined criteria. By aggregating these fine-grained scores, FLASK enables analysis of model performance on different skill combinations, domains, and difficulties. The authors apply FLASK to compare several proprietary and open-source LLMs via model-based and human-based evaluation. Key findings are that current open-source LLMs significantly lag in logical thinking abilities, model scale alone doesn't sufficiently improve certain skills, and even state-of-the-art proprietary models struggle on challenging instruction sets identified by FLASK. The comprehensive perspective provided by FLASK helps pinpoint specific deficiencies and training priorities to better align LLMs to human values.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces FLASK, a new evaluation protocol for comprehensively assessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). FLASK provides fine-grained scoring of model responses based on alignment to 12 different skills needed for following open-ended instructions. These skills are grouped into four main abilities: logical thinking, background knowledge, problem handling, and user alignment. A key aspect of FLASK is that it allows dynamic, instance-wise evaluation by annotating each question with the relevant skills, domain, and difficulty level. This enables analyzing model performance on specific skill compositions depending on the instruction. 

The authors apply FLASK to compare several proprietary and open-sourced LLMs through both human and model-based evaluation. Key findings are that current open-sourced models significantly lag in logical thinking abilities, model scale has varying impact on acquiring different skills, and even state-of-the-art proprietary models struggle on the challenging FLASK-Hard subset. Overall, FLASK provides fine-grained insights to help developers build better aligned models and allows practitioners to select suitable models based on required skills. The skill taxonomy and instance-wise annotation are promising for task-agnostic LLM evaluation.

The paper proposes FLASK (Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets), a new evaluation protocol for assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). FLASK introduces a taxonomy of 12 fine-grained skills categorized into 4 primary abilities - logical thinking, background knowledge, problem handling, and user alignment.

Overall, FLASK allows comprehensive analysis to guide developers in improving model alignment and recommend suitable models for practitioners.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in a way that provides meaningful insights into model strengths, weaknesses, and risks. 

Some key aspects of this problem that the paper discusses:

- Current evaluation methods like accuracy on benchmarks or overall scoring of model outputs have limitations. They don't provide enough interpretability into model performance on different skills.

- Instructions given to LLMs are diverse and require composing multiple skills in different ways. So evaluation needs to be more fine-grained and dynamic based on the required skillset. 

- Both human ratings and model-based evaluations have pros and cons. Using both together can provide more reliable assessment.

- Understanding model capabilities on different skills, domains, difficulty levels etc can better guide developers on how to improve alignment and help practitioners select suitable models.

So in summary, the main problem is how to design a comprehensive, interpretable, and reliable evaluation protocol for assessing LLMs' capabilities across diverse instructions and required skills. The paper aims to address this through their proposed FLASK framework for fine-grained, skillset-based evaluation.
