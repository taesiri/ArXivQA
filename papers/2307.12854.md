# [Multiscale Video Pretraining for Long-Term Activity Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12854)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we learn robust video representations that effectively encode the multiscale temporal structure of actions, in order to improve performance on downstream long-term video forecasting tasks?The key ideas and contributions appear to be:- Observing that actions in videos have a multiscale nature, with atomic actions at short timescales composing more complex actions over longer timescales. - Proposing a self-supervised pretraining approach called Multiscale Video Pretraining (MVP) that trains a model to predict future video clip representations aggregated over multiple timescales. - Introducing a new video summary forecasting task to evaluate the capability of the learned representations to generalize to corresponding elements in the language modality.- Demonstrating through experiments that MVP outperforms prior video self-supervised pretraining methods on long-term forecasting tasks across multiple datasets.- Providing an extensive ablation study to analyze the impact of different design choices in MVP, offering insights into learning multiscale video representations.In summary, the main hypothesis seems to be that explicitly encoding the multiscale structure of actions during self-supervised pretraining will result in video representations that are more effective for long-term forecasting tasks requiring reasoning about temporal video dynamics. The proposed MVP method and experiments are designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new self-supervised video pretraining approach called Multiscale Video Pretraining (MVP).

For example, it achieves over 20% higher accuracy on video summary forecasting.- An extensive ablation study provides insights into the contributions of different components of MVP like multiscale aggregation, number of input/output clips, etc. This analysis could inform future research on learning multiscale video representations.- The paper introduces a new multimodal evaluation task called video summary forecasting which involves retrieving text summaries. Most prior forecasting work focuses on video-only tasks.- MVP is evaluated on diverse real-world datasets like Ego4D and Epic Kitchens containing long, unstructured videos. In contrast, some prior work uses more constrained video datasets.In summary, the key innovations of this paper compared to other work are the MVP self-supervised pretraining approach, extensive experiments demonstrating superiority over existing methods, introduction of a new forecasting benchmark, and detailed ablation analysis providing insights into multiscale video representation learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Integrating multiscale representations into existing state-of-the-art forecasting models: The authors propose MVP as a way to learn robust multiscale video representations for long-term forecasting tasks. They suggest it would be interesting future work to incorporate these representations into current forecasting models to further improve performance. - Exploring capabilities of MVP representations on other tasks: The authors demonstrate MVP's effectiveness on forecasting tasks, but suggest exploring how well the representations transfer to other video tasks like action recognition or multimodal tasks like text-to-video retrieval.- Learning to segment actions into sub-actions automatically: The authors mention a limitation of MVP is using a fixed temporal stride to aggregate future clip representations. They suggest future work could focus on learning to automatically segment long videos into hierarchies of sub-actions as part of the pretraining process.- Curriculum learning strategies: The authors had promising results using a curriculum strategy during pretraining where they gradually increased the prediction steps and timescales. They suggest further exploration of curriculum learning for multiscale video representation learning.- Alternative aggregation mechanisms: The simple temporal aggregation functions (mean pooling) used in MVP could be replaced by more complex learned functions to better model relationships between sub-actions.- Leveraging additional modalities: The authors focused on self-supervised video-only representation learning, but suggest incorporating other modalities like audio or language could provide useful complementary signals.In summary, the main directions are improving integration with existing models, applying representations to new tasks, more sophisticated aggregation mechanisms, curriculum strategies, and incorporating multimodal information. The authors lay good groundwork for future work on learning multiscale video representations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces a new self-supervised video pretraining approach called Multiscale Video Pretraining (MVP) for improving performance on downstream long-term activity forecasting tasks. MVP trains a model to predict future video clip representations that have been contextually aggregated over multiple timescales, in order to capture the multiscale nature of human actions. It contrasts with prior methods that simply maximize similarity between clips from the same video. MVP is evaluated on tasks like order-agnostic and order-specific action forecasting, as well as a new video summary forecasting task. Experiments across Ego4D and Epic-Kitchens datasets show MVP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video pretraining methods. An ablation study provides insights into the contributions of different components of MVP for learning multiscale video representations. The limitations include using a fixed temporal stride for aggregation which may not reflect varying action granularities. Overall, MVP demonstrates the importance of modeling the semantic structure of videos for long-term forecasting.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method presented in the paper:The paper proposes a novel self-supervised video pretraining approach called Multiscale Video Pretraining (MVP) for learning robust video representations that transfer well to downstream long-term forecasting tasks. The key idea is to train a video model to predict contextualized representations of future video clips that have been temporally aggregated over varying timescales, inspired by the observation that actions in videos have a multiscale nature. Specifically, the model is given an observed sequence of video clips and must predict the representations of future clips that have been aggregated using a temporal context aggregation module. The aggregation is done in a causal manner over different time spans to capture multi-scale structure. The prediction targets are generated automatically without human labels by computing contextualized representations of the future clips. A contrastive loss is used to train the model end-to-end to predict representations of the future video that encode contextual information over multiple time horizons. Experiments show MVP outperforms prior self-supervised methods on long-term forecasting tasks including order-agnostic and specific action prediction, demonstrating the benefits of modeling the multiscale structure of videos.
