# [RecycleGPT: An Autoregressive Language Model with Recyclable Module](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03421)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we accelerate the decoding process of large language models to achieve faster inference speed while maintaining high performance? The key hypothesis seems to be:By adding a recyclable module that can predict multiple tokens at once using pre-generated states, we can reduce the number of times the full model needs to be run during decoding. This will lower inference latency and memory footprint while preserving accuracy.Specifically, the paper proposes RecycleGPT, a novel autoregressive language model architecture with an additional recyclable module. The recyclable module is designed to exploit correlations between adjacent tokens and make predictions for multiple tokens using a compact transformer stack, without having to feed each token through the full model. The central goal is to demonstrate that RecycleGPT can achieve faster decoding speeds compared to standard language models that generate one token per inference step. The paper hypothesizes this is possible without sacrificing performance by alternating use of the recyclable module and the full model during inference.In summary, the key research question is how to speed up decoding of large language models, and the core hypothesis is that a recyclable module that predicts multiple tokens per step can help achieve this acceleration. The paper aims to validate this through experiments showing decoding speedup while maintaining accuracy.
