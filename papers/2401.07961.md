## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies a probabilistic variant of the classical Lambert orbital transfer problem, where instead of precise initial and terminal positions, there are probability distributions specifying uncertainties over these positions. The goal is to find an optimal control policy to transfer the probability distribution of the spacecraft's position from the uncertain initial distribution to the uncertain target distribution over a given time horizon, while minimizing a cost function.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper shows that this probabilistic Lambert problem can be formulated as a generalization of the optimal mass transport (OMT) problem from mathematics. This allows proving existence and uniqueness of an optimal solution. Further, a regularization of the problem using a diffusion term leads to a connection with Schrödinger bridge problem (SBP). This in turn allows leveraging computational tools from SBP to numerically solve the original problem.

Key Contributions:

- Establishes connection of the probabilistic Lambert problem with dynamic OMT, allowing to leverage mathematical tools to prove uniqueness of optimal solution

- Shows the regularized problem with diffusion is a generalized SBP, allowing computational techniques from SBP literature to be used

- Derives the optimality conditions as a coupled system of nonlinear PDEs involving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and a Fokker-Planck equation with gravitational potential as the reaction term

- Uses Hopf-Cole transform to convert the nonlinear PDE system into a linear coupled system of reaction-diffusion equations, with gravitational potential appearing as state-dependent reaction rates

- Develops a numerical method involving approximation of integrals using left Riemann sums to solve the boundary coupled linear reaction-diffusion PDEs

- Demonstrates the approach on a Earth-orbit transfer problem with uncertainty in initial and terminal positions, showcasing ability to solve probabilistic Lambert problems.

In summary, the key novelty is establishing new connections between the probabilistic Lambert problem and optimal transport theory, allowing leveraging mathematical tools to solve this problem.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper establishes connections between the probabilistic Lambert problem of orbital transfer under uncertainty and the theory of optimal mass transport, uses these links to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions, derives associated reaction-diffusion PDEs, and leverages them to develop a numerical algorithm for nonparametric computation of solutions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It establishes that the Lambert problem with endpoint joint PDF constraints is a generalized variant of the optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, where the gravitational potential plays the role of a state cost. This connects the probabilistic Lambert problem to the theory of OMT.

2. It proves existence and uniqueness of solution for the probabilistic Lambert problem by leveraging results from the OMT literature. 

3. It shows that the probabilistic Lambert problem with additive process noise is a generalized Schrödinger bridge problem (SBP). This connects it to another active area of research.

4. It derives the conditions for optimality which take the form of a coupled system of nonlinear PDEs. It further transforms this to a linear but boundary-coupled system of reaction-diffusion PDEs using the Hopf-Cole transform.

5. It proposes a novel numerical algorithm, based on the connections with OMT and SBP, to solve the probabilistic Lambert problem in a nonparametric way without making statistical or dynamical approximations.

6. It demonstrates the proposed approach on an illustrative low-Earth orbit transfer example, including closed-loop stochastic optimal control simulation results.

In summary, the main contribution is establishing new theoretical connections between the probabilistic Lambert problem and the fields of OMT and SBP, leveraging these connections to prove existence/uniqueness of solution and to develop a numerical algorithm, thereby providing a way to solve this problem nonparametrically.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Probabilistic Lambert problem: A variant of the classical Lambert problem in orbital mechanics where the endpoint position constraints are replaced with probabilistic uncertainties modeled via probability density functions.

- Optimal mass transport (OMT): A mathematical framework for optimally transporting one probability distribution to another while minimizing a transportation cost. Used to formulate and analyze the probabilistic Lambert problem.

- Generalized OMT: An extension of classical OMT theory that allows additional state-dependent cost terms, leading to the formulation called Lambertian OMT.  

- Schrödinger bridge problem (SBP): A stochastic optimal control problem closely related to OMT, where noise is added to the dynamics. Used to formulate the probabilistic Lambert problem with process noise.

- Lambertian SBP: The stochastic regularization of Lambertian OMT, analogous to how classical SBP regularizes classical OMT.

- Reaction-diffusion PDEs: The first-order optimality conditions for Lambertian SBP lead to a coupled system of reaction-diffusion PDEs to be solved with boundary conditions.

- Schrödinger factors: Auxiliary functions obtained via a transform of the optimally controlled state density and value function, which satisfy linear reaction-diffusion PDEs.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around optimal mass transport theory and its connections to the probabilistic Lambert orbital transfer problem.
