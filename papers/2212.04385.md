# [BEVBert: Multimodal Map Pre-training for Language-guided Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04385)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a new map-based pre-training paradigm to improve vision-and-language navigation agents. The key hypothesis is that pre-training with maps, rather than discrete panoramas, can better enhance spatial reasoning and cross-modal understanding. Specifically, the paper explores using a hybrid topo-metric map during pre-training to balance short-term reasoning and long-term planning. The central research question is whether this map-based pre-training approach can improve navigation performance compared to prior panorama-based pre-training methods. The experiments aim to validate if the learned multimodal map representations can facilitate language-guided navigation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new map-based pre-training paradigm for vision-and-language navigation (VLN). Specifically:- They propose using a hybrid topo-metric map to balance the demand in VLN for both short-term reasoning and long-term planning. This combines a local metric map for spatial reasoning with a global topological map for long-term dependency modeling.- They design a pre-training framework called BEVBert to learn multimodal map representations by map-instruction interaction. This enhances the model's spatial reasoning and cross-modal grounding abilities. - They introduce two pre-training proxy tasks - Hybrid Single Action Prediction and Masked Semantic Imagination - to facilitate downstream navigation.- Extensive experiments show their map-based pre-training route is effective for VLN. The proposed BEVBert model achieves state-of-the-art results on four VLN benchmarks.In summary, the key contribution is exploring map-based pre-training for VLN, where they design a topo-metric mapping scheme and pre-training paradigm to learn superior multimodal map representations. This improves the agent's spatial-aware reasoning and planning capabilities.
