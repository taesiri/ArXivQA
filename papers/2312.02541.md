# [Explainable Severity ranking via pairwise n-hidden comparison: a case   study of glaucoma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02541)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an explainable severity ranking framework for medical images using a pairwise comparison method, with a case study in glaucoma. The methodology involves three main steps: collecting comparison labels, training a siamese neural network, and reconstructing a ranked list. The key innovation is an "n-hidden comparison" function that compares n-dimensional feature vectors instead of scalars to better model complexity. The method improves pairwise accuracy over traditional comparison metrics. For explainability, GradCAM heatmaps visualize salient comparisons to justify decisions. Experiments on the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study dataset compare longitudinal (tracking patients over time) versus cross-sectional (across different patients) settings. The proposed framework with 10 hidden comparisons outperforms a single comparison baseline on accuracy, ranking metrics, and heatmap intersection over union (IoU). Qualitative assessment shows the model identifies clinically relevant optic nerve regions. Main limitations are noise in cross-patient comparisons and need for more annotations. Future work could address ranking, representations, and image registration. Overall, this presents a promising severity ranking and explanation system for medical imaging, with demonstrated utility in glaucoma assessment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a siamese neural network with n-hidden comparisons for severity ranking of glaucoma fundus images, demonstrates its superior accuracy over a single-comparison baseline, and introduces an explainable AI framework to interpret the model's decisions using image saliency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a siamese neural network with n-hidden comparisons that outperforms conventional single-comparison siamese networks in terms of comparison accuracy, especially when the activation vector dimension is condensed.

2) Introducing a novel explainable AI (XAI) framework to interpret the comparisons made by the proposed model using image saliency. Specifically, the framework identifies the most informative comparisons and generates heatmaps highlighting important regions in the image pair for those comparisons.

In summary, the key contributions are a new comparison-based severity ranking model that performs better than baseline models, along with a method to explain the model's pairwise comparisons. The explainability component moves towards more user-centric saliency explanations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Glaucoma 
- Explainable artificial intelligence 
- Severity ranking
- Comparison model
- Siamese neural network
- n-hidden comparisons
- Optic cup-to-disc (CD) ratio  
- Mean Deviation index (MD-index)
- GradCAM

These terms reflect the main focus areas and contributions of the paper, which are developing a framework and siamese neural network model to rank glaucoma severity from fundus images using pairwise comparisons, and providing explanations for the comparisons through explainable AI techniques like GradCAM and SHAP. The comparison model aims to match clinician perspectives on severity based on the CD ratio, while being trained on the patient-centric MD-index. Overall the key ideas revolve around severity ranking, comparisons, explainability, and glaucoma assessment from medical images.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces an "n-hidden comparison" approach for severity ranking. Can you explain in more detail how this approach works and how it is different from conventional comparison functions? What are the motivations and intended benefits?

2. The paper develops an explainable AI (XAI) framework to interpret the comparisons made by the model. Can you walk through the details of this framework - what algorithms are used and how do they generate explanations? 

3. The paper evaluates both longitudinal and cross-sectional experimental settings. What are the key differences between these two settings and what additional challenges exist in the cross-sectional setting?

4. For the cross-sectional setting, the paper mentions imposing restrictions on the MD-index differences to mitigate noise. Can you explain this noise mitigation approach more clearly? What impact did this have on model performance?

5. The paper finds better performance with the n-hidden comparison approach when the activation vector dimension is more condensed. Why might this be the case? Can you analyze the impact of activation vector length?

6. The paper mentions the possibility of using different loss functions like list-net, multitask and multilabel learning to further enhance ranking comparisons. Can you theorize how these different loss functions could improve the model?

7. The qualitative results showcase similarity in patterns among the top hidden comparisons. What does this suggest about the model's comparison criteria? How might we further analyze these patterns?

8. For cross-sectional comparisons, the paper recommends gathering more annotations encompassing factors beyond just MD-index. What are some of the other relevant factors that could be incorporated and how might the model leverage those?

9. The paper identifies open challenges around noise, ranking enhancements, feature representations and image registration. Can you expand on one of these challenges and suggest some ideas/approaches for making progress?

10. Looking at the overall framework, what do you see as the most promising direction for future work in advancing severity ranking and explainability? What technique or component offers the biggest potential gains?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Determining severity and prioritizing patients is critical in healthcare but can be challenging for clinicians. Accurately assessing severity enables properly triaging and treating patients.
- Evaluating severity of medical images via multi-class classification has limitations. Experts often prefer comparing image pairs to identify more severe cases.  
- Linking different clinical perspectives on severity (e.g. ophthalmologist's view using cup-to-disc ratio vs patient's view using visual field test) in models is non-trivial.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a siamese neural network with n-hidden comparisons to rank fundus image severity in glaucoma patients. This allows capturing multiple dynamic comparison patterns.
- Introduce a novel XAI framework to interpret comparisons and explain ranking decisions using saliency maps.

Key Contributions:
- Siamese net with 10-hidden comparisons improves accuracy by 11% over baseline and better identifies clinically relevant regions.
- Comparison method emphasizing refined feature space dimension outperforms conventional single score comparison.
- New XAI framework substantially improves intersection over union of saliency maps and provides user-centric explanations.
- Recommendations on number of comparisons to use based on dataset annotations.
- Identified open challenges around noise, enhanced comparisons, improved representations and registrations.

The paper makes notable contributions in severity ranking of medical images and model interpretability through pairwise comparisons and saliency explanations.
