# [Explainable Severity ranking via pairwise n-hidden comparison: a case   study of glaucoma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02541)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Determining severity and prioritizing patients is critical in healthcare but can be challenging for clinicians. Accurately assessing severity enables properly triaging and treating patients.
- Evaluating severity of medical images via multi-class classification has limitations. Experts often prefer comparing image pairs to identify more severe cases.  
- Linking different clinical perspectives on severity (e.g. ophthalmologist's view using cup-to-disc ratio vs patient's view using visual field test) in models is non-trivial.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a siamese neural network with n-hidden comparisons to rank fundus image severity in glaucoma patients. This allows capturing multiple dynamic comparison patterns.
- Introduce a novel XAI framework to interpret comparisons and explain ranking decisions using saliency maps.

Key Contributions:
- Siamese net with 10-hidden comparisons improves accuracy by 11% over baseline and better identifies clinically relevant regions.
- Comparison method emphasizing refined feature space dimension outperforms conventional single score comparison.
- New XAI framework substantially improves intersection over union of saliency maps and provides user-centric explanations.
- Recommendations on number of comparisons to use based on dataset annotations.
- Identified open challenges around noise, enhanced comparisons, improved representations and registrations.

The paper makes notable contributions in severity ranking of medical images and model interpretability through pairwise comparisons and saliency explanations.
