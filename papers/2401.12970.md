# [Raidar: geneRative AI Detection viA Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12970)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can generate high-quality text, but this also poses risks like facilitating phishing attacks, generating fake content/propaganda, and enabling academic dishonesty. 
- Existing methods for detecting AI-generated text rely on numerical features from the LLM which may not be accessible (e.g. for GPT-3.5/4) and can overfit to spurious patterns.

Method:
- Propose Raidar - a method to detect AI text by prompting an LLM to rewrite input text and comparing editing distance between input and output.
- Key insight: LLMs modify AI-generated text less because they perceive it as high quality. Humans tend to modify it more.
- Raidar uses symbolic word output only so works for black box APIs and focuses on semantics-agnostic editing distance for robustness.

Experiments:
- Test on detecting paragraphs from 6 datasets (news, creative writing, essays, code, Yelp, arXiv)
- Raidar advances state-of-the-art by up to 29 F1 points. Robust to new LM models unseen during training.
- Still effective when text generation aims to bypass detection through rephrasing
- Works for varying input lengths and different detector/generator LM pairs

Contributions:
- Novel method using LM rewrite prompts and editing distance to detect AI text generation
- State-of-the-art results across multiple domains/benchmarks
- Robustness to adversarial inputs and new generator models
- Compatible with black-box APIs that only provide symbolic word output

The key insight is that LLMs perceive AI-generated text as higher quality and modify it less when rewriting, allowing editing distance after rewrites to effectively distinguish AI vs human text.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Raidar, an approach that detects machine-generated text by calculating the editing differences when another language model is prompted to rewrite the text, finding that language models make fewer modifications when rewriting AI-generated content.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Raidar, a method for detecting machine-generated text by prompting large language models (LLMs) to rewrite input text and calculating the editing distance between the original and rewritten text. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposing a simple but effective "detecting via rewriting" approach that relies on the observation that LLM-generated text tends to undergo fewer modifications compared to human-written text when asked to be rewritten by another LLM.

- Introducing Raidar which detects machine-generated content based on measures of output invariance, equivariance, and uncertainty when the text is rewritten by an LLM. It operates solely on symbolic word outputs without access to model internals.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in detecting machine-generated paragraphs across diverse domains like news, creative writing, code, reviews etc. Raidar advances detection over prior academic and commercial methods by up to 29 F1 points.

- Showing the robustness of Raidar to generated text from unseen models, and even when the text generation tries to actively bypass detection by rephrasing.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing and validating a simple yet effective approach for detecting machine text by analyzing how language models rewrite input content.

The paper introduces Raidar, a method to detect machine generated text by prompting large language models to rewrite input text and calculating the editing distance/modifications in the output. Key aspects explored are the invariance, equivariance, and uncertainty of LLM outputs for human vs machine generated text. The method is shown to be simple, effective, robust, and compatible with black box LLMs across diverse domains.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of using rewrite difference for machine text detection. Can you elaborate more on why this difference arises and the intuition behind it? What inherent properties of machine text versus human text cause this?

2. The invariance property is used as one signal for detection. Can you explain more deeply the concept of invariance, why machine text exhibits more invariance, and how exactly invariance is calculated in the paper? 

3. Similarly, can you provide more details on the concepts of equivariance and uncertainty that are also used, including why machine text exhibits more equivariance and less uncertainty? How are they calculated?

4. The paper uses editing distance metrics like Levenshtein distance to quantify rewrite difference. Can you explain what other metrics could potentially be used and what their tradeoffs might be compared to Levenshtein distance?

5. What are some potential ways the generative models could be adapted to reduce the rewrite difference gap when generating text to evade detection? How might the detection method be made more robust to these adaptations?

6. The paper experiments with different rewrite prompts. Can you analyze the prompts used and suggest other prompts that could further increase the rewrite difference gap?

7. How exactly does the classifier use the calculated invariance, equivariance and uncertainty signals to make final predictions? What types of classifiers are most suitable?

8. The method does not require access to numerical metrics from the LLM, making it compatible with black box models. What are the tradeoffs of this versus methods that do use numerical LLM metrics?

9. The paper shows improved detection over academic state-of-the-art methods. Can you discuss remaining challenges and gaps compared to commercial detection services?

10. The method relies solely on word tokens. How could potential future advancements in LLMs that generate images or other modalities impact the approach? Would the core concept still apply and how might the difference metrics need to change?
