# [Pretrained Transformers for Text Ranking: BERT and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06467)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is whether BERT-based neural ranking models can be applied effectively to long documents without running into input length limitations. BERT was originally designed for sequence classification tasks on relatively short text spans, and the authors aim to investigate techniques to adapt BERT for document retrieval tasks where the input texts can be thousands of words long.The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:1) Splitting documents into passages and encoding each passage independently with BERT can be an effective strategy for handling long documents. The authors propose the BERT-MaxP model which takes the maximum relevance score across all passages as the document relevance score.2) Fine-tuning BERT on passage-level data before further training on document-level data (multi-stage fine-tuning) is an effective strategy for adapting BERT to long documents. 3) The proposed BERT-MaxP model with multi-stage fine-tuning can achieve state-of-the-art effectiveness on document ranking benchmarks compared to previous neural ranking models.The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses by evaluating BERT-MaxP on standard ad-hoc document retrieval test collections like Robust04 and compared to previous neural ranking models. The results show that BERT-MaxP with multi-stage fine-tuning is able to effectively handle long documents and outperforms previous models, supporting the authors' hypotheses.In summary, the central research question is how to enable BERT to effectively rank long documents by addressing its length limitations, with the core hypotheses relating to passage splitting, multi-stage fine-tuning, and the overall effectiveness of the proposed BERT-MaxP model. The experiments aim to validate whether these techniques allow BERT to be successfully applied to document retrieval.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new semi-supervised learning method called Deep Co-Training (DeepCT) for document ranking. The key ideas and contributions are:- DeepCT uses BERT to learn context-dependent term weights for documents. It trains a regression model on top of BERT to predict term importance scores based on the contextual embeddings. - The term weights are used to construct "pseudo-documents" where each term is repeated based on its predicted weight. These pseudo-documents are then indexed to enable retrieval with the learned term weights.- DeepCT is trained in a semi-supervised manner, using either pseudo-relevant documents from initial retrieval or document fields like title and anchor text as weak supervision for the regression model. This avoids the need for manual relevance judgments.- Experiments on MSMARCO and TREC DL show that DeepCT substantially outperforms using static embeddings like GloVe for term weighting. It also approaches the effectiveness of supervised state-of-the-art models while being much more efficient.- Overall, DeepCT demonstrates that BERT's contextual embeddings can be effectively used to learn improved term weights in a semi-supervised manner, providing gains over both static embeddings and sparse retrieval baselines. The semi-supervised approach avoids the need for large amounts of labeled data.In summary, the main contribution is a novel semi-supervised deep learning method for document ranking that learns context-dependent term weights using BERT and weak supervision from document fields or retrieval. This provides improved ranking accuracy over sparse retrieval in an efficient and scalable manner.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method for analyzing the semantic relatedness between words by representing words as low-dimensional vectors and using vector arithmetic on these word embeddings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary comparing the paper to other related research:- This paper introduces a new technique for query expansion using contextualized word embeddings from BERT. It builds on prior work like RM3 and other pseudo-relevance feedback methods, but is novel in using BERT rather than static word embeddings. Compared to previous BERT-based query expansion work, this paper's method is more focused on improving first stage retrieval rather than downstream reranking.- The proposed CEQE model is evaluated on standard test collections like Robust04 and compared against strong baselines including RM3 and static embedding-based expansion. The gains over these methods, while statistically significant, are relatively modest. More analysis would be needed to determine if the computational overhead of CEQE is worthwhile compared to simpler expansion techniques.- The idea of using contextualized embeddings for query expansion is promising and this paper provides a good starting point. However, some key limitations are the focus on keyword queries rather than natural language, and the reliance on bag-of-words retrieval models rather than end-to-end neural ranking. - Recent works have started exploring fully neural query reformulation and document expansion techniques. Compared to these approaches, the query expansion method proposed here may not fully leverage the power of pretrained language models like BERT. Combining CEQE with neural ranking models could be an interesting direction for future work.In summary, this paper introduces a novel BERT-based technique for query expansion that outperforms previous methods, but the gains are limited compared to the computational overhead. Fully integrating contextualized embeddings into end-to-end neural ranking remains an open challenge for future work to build on these initial results.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some of the key future research directions suggested in the paper:- Continuing to explore different approaches to applying transformers for ranking - apply, adapt, or redesign architectures. It is unclear which approach will be most fruitful going forward.- Better connecting multi-stage ranking architectures and representation learning techniques. For example, using dense representations in reranking stages, training end-to-end multi-stage pipelines, and addressing mismatches across pipeline stages.- Developing techniques to make ranking models more robust to out-of-distribution data at inference time. This includes handling different queries, texts, and tasks compared to what models were trained on. Approaches like domain adaptation and few-shot learning are relevant here.- Expanding the scope beyond English language ranking to support other languages. This includes monolingual non-English retrieval and cross-lingual retrieval. Leveraging multilingual BERT is a promising approach.- Considering how ranking can augment transformer pretraining objectives. For example, injecting evidence from retrieval into masked language modeling.- Revisiting and revitalizing old ideas from decades past that have new relevance given modern techniques. The paper suggests much recent work is primarily adapting old ideas.- Moving beyond standard ranking metrics to also consider efficiency dimensions like index size and latency in evaluating models. Tradeoffs between quality, time, and space metrics are important.- Addressing challenges in learning from limited labeled data with transformers, which remains a weakness.The paper provides a comprehensive overview of where the field stands today and many interesting open questions to explore next. Advancing solutions in these directions can lead to improved ranking models and user experiences.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new model called ViLT (Vision-and-Language Transformer) for multimodal representation learning. ViLT is based on a transformer encoder architecture and is pretrained on large amounts of image-text data scraped from the internet. The key idea is to treat both visual and textual modalities equally by projecting them into a common embedding space. Specifically, ViLT models take RGB images and tokenized text as input. The images are embedded into visual tokens using a vision transformer backbone, while the text is embedded into textual tokens using a text transformer encoder. The visual and textual tokens are then concatenated and fed into the ViLT transformer encoder. By pretraining on aligned image-text data, ViLT learns a joint representation that combines information from both modalities. Experiments show that ViLT outperforms unimodal baselines on image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks. The results demonstrate ViLT's ability to learn alignments between visual and textual concepts.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method for training BERT models to perform abstractive summarization. The key idea is to use a convolutional seq2seq model as the summarizer and leverage BERT representations to initialize the encoder and decoder. Specifically, the BERT encoder is used to initialize the convolutional encoder which generates representations for the input text. These representations are passed to the convolutional decoder initialized with the BERT decoder. The decoder is trained to generate abstractive summaries using an attention-based copy mechanism over the input text. Experiments on the CNN/DailyMail and NYT datasets show that this approach outperforms previous models including BERTSUM and achieves new state-of-the-art results on abstractive summarization. The authors attribute the improved performance to the benefits of pretraining with BERT combined with the ability of the convolutional seq2seq model to attend over the full input during summary generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a new method called doc2query for document expansion using query prediction with sequence-to-sequence models. The method trains a sequence-to-sequence model on query-document pairs from the MS MARCO dataset, where the model is trained to generate queries that are relevant to a given document. At inference time, the model generates multiple query predictions for each document in the corpus which are then appended to the original document text. This expands the document representation with additional relevant terms and phrases. The expanded documents are then indexed and used for first-stage retrieval, either with BM25 or BM25 + RM3. Experiments show that doc2query improves retrieval effectiveness over the original documents, especially when using a pretrained sequence-to-sequence model like T5. The method provides a simple way to expand document representations using query prediction that improves vocabulary coverage and term weighting.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "Learned Dense Retrieval with Transformer" addresses the problem of efficiently retrieving relevant documents for a given query using learned dense representations. Specifically, it focuses on using transformer models like BERT to encode queries and documents into dense vector representations, and then retrieving documents by computing similarity between these representations.Some key aspects of the problem and approach:- Traditional retrieval relies on sparse bag-of-words representations and exact keyword matching, which has limitations in capturing semantic similarity. Dense representations from neural networks can potentially better model semantic relevance between queries and documents.- Applying transformers like BERT to score query-document pairs (as a reranker) is expensive due to the need to encode each document at query time. The paper explores precomputing document representations to enable efficient retrieval.- The paper proposes a bi-encoder architecture with separate BERT encoders for queries and documents. Document representations can be precomputed and indexed to enable fast nearest neighbor search at query time.- Relevance is modeled as the similarity between query and document vectors, computed via operations like dot product or cosine similarity. This allows reformulating retrieval as nearest neighbor search for efficiency.- Compared to cross-encoder architectures like BERT, bi-encoders have lower effectiveness due to the lack of cross-attention between query and document terms. The paper analyzes this tradeoff.In summary, the key focus is enabling efficient semantic retrieval using precomputed document representations from transformers, while balancing effectiveness tradeoffs compared to cross-encoder architectures. The bi-encoder architecture and nearest neighbor search formulation are the main proposals.
