# [Federated Learning for Short Text Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07556)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the federated short text clustering (FSTC) problem, where short texts need to be clustered but are distributed across multiple clients (e.g. companies) and cannot be gathered to a central server due to privacy or communication constraints. Existing federated clustering methods do not work well for short texts which are sparse and noisy. The paper identifies two main challenges: (1) providing supervision information for discriminative representation learning to improve clustering performance, and (2) efficiently exchanging knowledge across clients.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FedRobustSTC, a federated robust short text clustering framework with two main modules:

1. Robust short text clustering module: Generates pseudo-labels to provide supervision for representation learning using optimal transport. Introduces a Gaussian-uniform mixture model to estimate reliability of pseudo-labels and handle noisy labels.

2. Federated cluster center aggregation module: Aggregates cluster centers instead of models across clients for efficient communication. Uses locally generated pseudo-labels to divide clusters and obtain local centers. Aligns local centers to global centers computed on the server.

Main Contributions:
- First work to address short text clustering in the federated learning setting
- Proposes an end-to-end model for robust local short text clustering using reliable pseudo-supervised data 
- Introduces federated learning through efficient aggregation of cluster centers instead of models
- Achieves significantly improved performance over federated baselines on real-world short text clustering datasets

The solution effectively handles the challenges of providing supervision and enabling collaboration across clients for the FSTC problem. Both proposed modules contribute positively towards improving federated clustering performance.
