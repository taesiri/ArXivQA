# [DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for   Efficient Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00818)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformers have high computational and memory costs during inference due to the self-attention mechanism. 
- State space models (SSMs) are a new type of network architecture that offers lower complexity but their performance still lags behind Transformers.
- A key limitation of SSMs is that hidden states only flow within layers, failing to transmit hierarchical information between layers. This leads to hidden state degradation in deeper layers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance hidden information flow between layers in SSMs. 
- It selectively integrates shallow layer hidden states into deeper layers, preserving fine-grained details useful for the final output.
- This is done via a selective transition module to project and select useful parts of hidden states and a fusion module to inject states into deeper layers.

Contributions:
- Applies dense connections to enhance information flow in SSM architectures like RetNet and Mamba.
- Maintains training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs.
- Achieves significant improvements - DenseRetNet outperforms RetNet by 5% on benchmarks.
- Provides strong alternative to Transformers for building efficient and accurate LLMs.

In summary, the paper identifies the problem of hidden state degradation in SSMs and proposes a novel DenseSSM method to enrich hidden representations via dense connections. This boosts the capabilities of SSM architectures substantially while retaining their efficiency advantages. The approach offers a promising direction for developing high-performance yet low-complexity LLMs.
