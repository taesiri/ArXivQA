# [DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for   Efficient Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00818)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformers have high computational and memory costs during inference due to the self-attention mechanism. 
- State space models (SSMs) are a new type of network architecture that offers lower complexity but their performance still lags behind Transformers.
- A key limitation of SSMs is that hidden states only flow within layers, failing to transmit hierarchical information between layers. This leads to hidden state degradation in deeper layers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance hidden information flow between layers in SSMs. 
- It selectively integrates shallow layer hidden states into deeper layers, preserving fine-grained details useful for the final output.
- This is done via a selective transition module to project and select useful parts of hidden states and a fusion module to inject states into deeper layers.

Contributions:
- Applies dense connections to enhance information flow in SSM architectures like RetNet and Mamba.
- Maintains training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs.
- Achieves significant improvements - DenseRetNet outperforms RetNet by 5% on benchmarks.
- Provides strong alternative to Transformers for building efficient and accurate LLMs.

In summary, the paper identifies the problem of hidden state degradation in SSMs and proposes a novel DenseSSM method to enrich hidden representations via dense connections. This boosts the capabilities of SSM architectures substantially while retaining their efficiency advantages. The approach offers a promising direction for developing high-performance yet low-complexity LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes DenseSSM, a novel method to enhance state space models by densely connecting hidden states across layers to better preserve and integrate fine-grained information for improved language modeling performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in state space models (SSMs). Specifically, the key ideas proposed are:

1) Analyzing the hidden state degradation issue in conventional SSMs, where hidden states from lower layers struggle to transfer information to deeper layers. 

2) Introducing dense connections for hidden states in SSMs to better preserve fine-grained information from shallow layers. This is done by selectively integrating hidden states from earlier layers into deeper layers, allowing deeper layers to retain more useful information.

3) Applying the proposed DenseSSM method to existing SSM architectures like RetNet and Mamba. The resulting DenseRetNet and DenseMamba models achieve significant performance improvements, outperforming the original models and transformer baselines on various language modeling tasks.

4) Showing that DenseSSM maintains the excellent properties of SSMs - efficient autoregressive inference and efficient parallelized training. So there is no compromise made on computational efficiency.

In summary, the key contribution is the DenseSSM framework itself, which enables enhanced information flow in SSMs via dense hidden connections. Both the method and its application to enhance existing SSMs are novel ideas proposed in this paper.
