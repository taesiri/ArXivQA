# [Emulated Disalignment: Safety Alignment for Large Language Models May   Backfire!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12343)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 This paper explores the risks of open-sourcing safety-aligned large language models (LLMs). It introduces a framework called Emulated Disalignment (ED) that combines pre-trained and safety-aligned LLMs to generate harmful responses, without additional training.

The key idea is that safety alignment trains LLMs to produce helpful and harmless responses. This implicit rewarding of safe responses can be reversed to encourage harmfulness. Specifically, ED constructs a contrastive response distribution that boosts harmful tokens from the pre-trained model relative to the safety-aligned model.

Experiments using four model families (Llama, Mistral, Alpaca) on three datasets demonstrate that ED doubles the harmfulness of pre-trained models and significantly outperforms strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that safer alignment leads to greater harm from ED.

The findings suggest that open-sourcing safety-aligned models can still enable malicious usage. The ease of exploiting alignment for harm highlights the need to reconsider accessibility even for safeguarded LLMs. It also motivates more research into alignment techniques robust against such adversarial attacks.

In summary, this work exposes the latent risks persisting within safety-aligned LLMs. By revealing an inference-time attack, it argues for restricting access and improving defenses against the weaponization of language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Emulated Disalignment, an attack framework that combines open-source pre-trained and safety-aligned language models to produce harmful responses without additional training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces a framework called "Emulated Disalignment" (ED) that combines a pre-trained language model and its safety-aligned version to produce harmful responses without additional training. The key contributions are:

1) ED proposes that the log probability difference between a safety-aligned model and its pre-trained version can be interpreted as an implicit reward that encourages safe responses. By minimizing this "safety reward", ED is able to steer language models towards generating harmful content. 

2) ED shows that such adversarial fine-tuning to minimize the safety reward can be emulated at inference time by sampling from a contrastive distribution defined over the pre-trained and safety-aligned model. This makes ED an inexpensive attack that produces harmful responses without model retraining.

3) Through extensive experiments on multiple model families, the paper demonstrates that ED effectively doubles the harmfulness of pre-trained models and outperforms baselines. This highlights the risks of open-sourcing language models even after safety alignment. 

In summary, the main contribution is an inference-time attack framework called Emulated Disalignment that exploits the output distributions of pre-trained and safety-aligned model pairs to produce a harmful conversational model, without additional training.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Emulated Disalignment (ED): The proposed inference-time attack framework that combines a pre-trained and safety-aligned language model pair to produce harmful responses without additional training.

- Safety alignment: The process of fine-tuning language models to ensure they produce safe and helpful content. The paper argues this can unintentionally facilitate harm if reversed. 

- Pre-trained models: Language models before undergoing safety alignment.

- Open-source assumption: ED relies on having access to the full token distributions of models, which is typically only feasible for open-source models. 

- Contrastive decoding: An interpretation of ED's mechanism - it enhances harmfulness by contrasting the pre-trained model where it is more common versus the safety-aligned model where it is rarer.

- Direct disalignment: Actually adversarially fine-tuning the pre-trained model to be harmful, which ED emulates without training.

- Synthetic experiments: Experiments constructed to analyze properties of ED, such as determining if safer aligned models give rise to more harmful emulated disaligned models.

The key high-level ideas are that safety alignment can backfire under adversarial manipulation at inference-time, and combining openly available pre-trained and aligned model pairs facilitates this in practice.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an attack method called "Emulated Disalignment" (ED) that combines a pre-trained model and a safety-aligned model to generate harmful responses without additional training. How does ED operationalize the idea that greater alignment effort leads to greater potential for harm under adversarial manipulation?

2. ED relies on accessing and manipulating the output distributions of language models. What assumptions does this make about the accessibility of models, and how might this limit the applicability of ED in practice compared to other attacks focused on the input space?  

3. The paper discusses ED not just from a reward minimization view but also in terms of contrastive decoding. Can you explain the intuition behind how formulating ED as contrastive decoding results in increasing the selection of harmful tokens?

4. The paper shows ED is competitive and sometimes better than direct adversarial fine-tuning. Why might emulated disalignment be more effective in some cases than resource-heavy direct disalignment through training? What are the tradeoffs?

5. How does the value of the hyperparameter α influence the effectiveness of ED? What explains the observed relationship between α and response harmfulness?

6. The synthetic experiments indicate safer aligned models lead to more harmful ED models, until extremely high safety. Why does ED start to struggle compared to direct disalignment when alignment is very high?  

7. If open release of models can unintentionally facilitate harm under ED, what are the implications for the open research paradigm around language models? How might the community adapt?

8. The success of ED seems to depend greatly on the safety delta between the pre-trained and aligned model. What kinds of alignment methods might be more robust to these types of exploits?

9. The paper focuses on combining a single pre-trained and aligned model pair. How might an ensemble over many such pairs influence the effectiveness of ED for harm?

10. The paper acknowledges ED has limited applicability to proprietary models. How might model providers adapt API design and output control to prevent ED-style attacks, while preserving utility?
