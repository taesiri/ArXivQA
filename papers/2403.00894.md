# [A systematic evaluation of large language models for generating   programming code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Programming code generation is complex and requires advanced training, limiting workforce diversity. Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 could democratize this process if their coding abilities are reliable.  
- Prior LLM evaluations had limitations: simplistic prompting, no human benchmarking, Python-only focus, ignoring computational efficiency and error learning.

Methods:  
- Evaluated 7 LLMs on 100 LeetCode and 15 GeeksForGeeks programming tasks using 6 prompting strategies. 
- Benchmarked against 18K+ human contest participants and analyzed error learning, multi-language translation, computational efficiency.

Key Results:
- GPT-4 substantially outperformed all other LLMs with optimal prompting. Its 5-attempt solve rate reached 100% for easy, 86% for medium and 15% for hard LeetCode tasks.
- GPT-4 ranked above the 85th percentile amongst humans in 81% of contests, demonstrating stronger coding abilities than most programmers.
- GPT-4 exhibited reliable performance across Python, Java, JavaScript and C++. It can accurately translate code between languages.
- GPT-4 can iteratively fix errors when provided feedback, salvaging over 60% of initially failed medium tasks.
- Its code efficiency was on par with humans and further improved through optimization prompting.

Main Contributions:
- First rigorous benchmarking of LLM program generation against thousands of human coders.
- Demonstrating GPT-4's reliable coding abilities with optimal prompting, establishing its promise for democratizing programming.
- Revealing GPT-4â€™s multi-language, error learning and efficiency capabilities, highlighting paths for human-AI collaboration.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of LLMs for programming, revealing GPT-4 as a promising assistant to enhance and empower the human coding workforce.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper systematically evaluates the performance of seven large language models in generating programming code using various prompt strategies, programming languages, and task difficulties, finding that GPT-4 substantially outperforms other models and that employing an optimal prompt strategy significantly enhances its coding abilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a systematic evaluation of the performance of seven large language models (LLMs) in generating programming code. The key aspects of this contribution include:

1) Exploring the impact of different prompt strategies on LLM coding performance. The authors show that varying the prompt significantly impacts performance, with a strategy utilizing code interpreter feedback and error messages substantially improving GPT-4's success rate. 

2) Rigorously benchmarking LLM performance against human coders in contests on LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. The authors demonstrate that GPT-4 outperforms over 85% of human participants in most contests, highlighting its potential as a programming assistant.  

3) Assessing LLM performance across programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, C++) and their ability to translate between languages. The authors show GPT-4 has reliable performance across languages and can accurately translate Python code to other languages in most cases.

4) Examining the computational efficiency and ability to learn from errors for LLM-generated code. The results indicate the code efficiency is comparable to humans, and GPT-4 in particular can effectively learn from past coding mistakes. 

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive benchmarking of major LLMs for programming code generation, highlighting strengths and weaknesses compared to human coders. The results demonstrate GPT-4's state-of-the-art performance and potential to assist in practical software development.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods in this paper:

1. This study evaluated several prompt strategies for guiding large language models (LLMs) to generate programming code. Which prompt strategy was found to yield the best performance for GPT-4, and what key features of this strategy contributed to its superior performance?  

2. The paper found that GPT-4's performance varies substantially depending on the prompt strategy used. In your view, what are the key factors that determine how receptive an LLM is to different prompting approaches? How might we further enhance prompting to maximize LLMs' capabilities?

3. This study benchmarked LLM performance using programming tasks from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. What are the key advantages and limitations of using these sources compared to other benchmark datasets? How could the benchmarking approach be improved in future work?  

4. When comparing LLM performance to human programmers, this study assumed LLMs generate code faster than humans. How valid is this assumption and how might underestimating human coding speed impact the analysis? How could a more rigorous comparison be made?

5. The "feedback CI prompt" strategy for GPT-4 relied heavily on its code interpreter functionality. How integral was this to the performance gains seen? Could similar gains be achieved without a code interpreter? What alternatives could be explored?  

6. The study found GPT-4 demonstrates a capability to learn from errors. What specific evidence supports this conclusion and what are the limitations? How could GPT-4's error correction abilities be rigorously quantified?

7. This paper proposed and evaluated a GPT-4 based strategy for translating programming code across languages. What factors currently limit this approach and how could it be strengthened to make it more robust?   

8. While assessing computational efficiency, the study found GPT-4 provided only marginal optimization when prompted. Why might this be the case? What approaches could better elicit optimizations from LLMs?

9. The paper concludes GPT-4 could serve as a reliable assistant for programmers. Based on the benchmarks shown, what specific programming tasks seem most and least suited for GPT-4 collaboration? 

10. What key limitations around software engineering capabilities were not assessed in this study? What additional benchmarks are needed to evaluate LLMs' readiness to assist in real-world software projects?
