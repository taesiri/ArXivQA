# [Residual Pattern Learning for Pixel-wise Out-of-Distribution Detection   in Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14512)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) How can we improve pixel-wise out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in semantic segmentation models without deteriorating their in-distribution segmentation performance? 2) How can we make pixel-wise OOD detection more robust to different contexts between training and test images?The authors motivate these questions by discussing limitations of prior work on pixel-wise anomaly detection in semantic segmentation:- Methods that freeze the inlier segmentation model and detect OOD pixels based on output uncertainty (e.g. softmax probability) tend to fail on hard outliers that share visual patterns with inliers. - Methods that retrain the segmentation model using outlier exposure can improve OOD detection but often degrade in-distribution accuracy.- Most methods are sensitive to context changes between training and testing, frequently misclassifying unfamiliar inliers as anomalies or failing to detect anomalies in new contexts. To address these issues, the central hypotheses appear to be:1) A residual learning approach can induce uncertainty in the segmentation model for OOD pixels without retraining the model, minimizing impact on inlier accuracy.2) Contrastive learning across contexts can make the OOD detector more robust to context changes.The proposed Residual Pattern Learning (RPL) module and Context-Robust Contrastive Learning (CoroCL) aim to test these hypotheses.
