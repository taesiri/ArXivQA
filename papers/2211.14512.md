# [Residual Pattern Learning for Pixel-wise Out-of-Distribution Detection   in Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14512)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) How can we improve pixel-wise out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in semantic segmentation models without deteriorating their in-distribution segmentation performance? 

2) How can we make pixel-wise OOD detection more robust to different contexts between training and test images?

The authors motivate these questions by discussing limitations of prior work on pixel-wise anomaly detection in semantic segmentation:

- Methods that freeze the inlier segmentation model and detect OOD pixels based on output uncertainty (e.g. softmax probability) tend to fail on hard outliers that share visual patterns with inliers. 

- Methods that retrain the segmentation model using outlier exposure can improve OOD detection but often degrade in-distribution accuracy.

- Most methods are sensitive to context changes between training and testing, frequently misclassifying unfamiliar inliers as anomalies or failing to detect anomalies in new contexts. 

To address these issues, the central hypotheses appear to be:

1) A residual learning approach can induce uncertainty in the segmentation model for OOD pixels without retraining the model, minimizing impact on inlier accuracy.

2) Contrastive learning across contexts can make the OOD detector more robust to context changes.

The proposed Residual Pattern Learning (RPL) module and Context-Robust Contrastive Learning (CoroCL) aim to test these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper proposes a new Residual Pattern Learning (RPL) module that can detect out-of-distribution (OoD) pixels in semantic segmentation with minimal impact on the in-distribution segmentation accuracy. The RPL module is attached to a frozen closed-set segmentation model and trained to induce the model to produce high uncertainty for potential OoD regions. This avoids re-training the segmentation model and preserves its original in-distribution performance. 

2. The paper proposes a Context-Robust Contrastive Learning (CoroCL) method to make the RPL module robust to different contexts between training and test images. CoroCL explores the relationship between OoD pixels and contexts by contrasting embeddings from in-distribution and OoD pixels across different contexts. This improves generalization of OoD detection.

3. The paper proposes a new positive energy loss function to deal with the class imbalance between in-distribution and OoD pixels. The loss focuses only on maximizing OoD pixel energy, avoiding issues with optimizing a joint loss over imbalanced inlier/outlier distributions.

4. Experiments show the proposed approach improves OoD detection over previous state-of-the-art across several datasets while maintaining in-distribution accuracy. The method also shows more robustness to context changes compared to prior work.

In summary, the key contribution is a new module and training approach for improving pixel-level OoD detection in a way that preserves in-distribution performance and generalizes better across contexts. The RPL module and CoroCL method seem to be the main novel components proposed.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection method for semantic segmentation models that adds a residual pattern learning module and contrastive learning approach to improve anomaly detection accuracy and robustness across different contexts, without deteriorating the in-distribution segmentation performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection for semantic segmentation:

- The paper proposes a new residual pattern learning (RPL) module that assists a frozen closed-set segmentation model to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) pixels. This differs from prior work like PEBAL and DenseHybrid that retrain the segmentation model, which can degrade inlier accuracy. It also differs from approaches like Synboost that only use segmentation output, lacking rich intermediate features.

- A new context-robust contrastive learning method (CoroCL) is introduced to make RPL detect OoD pixels robustly across contexts. This addresses a key limitation of prior work like PEBAL and Meta-OoD that fail to generalize OoD detection across contexts. 

- A positive energy loss is proposed to focus only on optimizing outlier energy, unlike prior hinge losses that are sensitive to imbalanced inlier/outlier distributions.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art results on Fishyscapes, SMIYC and RoadAnomaly datasets, improving 5-10% in FPR and AuPRC metrics over prior art like PEBAL and Meta-OoD.

- The RPL module minimally impacts closed-set segmentation accuracy unlike retraining methods. It also generalizes better across contexts than prior work.

- The approach is shown to flexibly improve OoD detection for other methods like PEBAL and Meta-OoD when RPL is integrated, demonstrating its wide applicability.

In summary, this paper introduces a new perspective of using a residual module to induce OoD detection in a frozen segmentation model. The context-aware contrastive learning and positive energy loss provide further improvements in accuracy and generalization. experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art OoD detection across diverse datasets.
