# [Large Window-based Mamba UNet for Medical Image Segmentation: Beyond   Convolution and Self-attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07332)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Medical image segmentation is important for clinical analysis and diagnosis, but current convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have limited receptive fields while Transformers have costly self-attention. 
- Existing approaches using the recently proposed Mamba model for segmentation do not fully explore its potential in large receptive field modeling and lack location awareness.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Large window-based Mamba UNet (LMa-UNet) for 2D and 3D medical image segmentation.
- LMa-UNet utilizes large windows in the Mamba sequence modeling modules to achieve larger receptive fields than CNN kernels and Transformer windows.
- A novel hierarchical and bidirectional Mamba (LM) block is designed to enhance modeling capability:
   - Pixel-level Mamba (PiM) captures local spatial contexts within large image windows.
   - Patch-level Mamba (PaM) models longer-range dependencies between windows.
   - Bidirectional Mamba (BiM) scans sequences in both directions for better localization.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of LMa-UNet that leverages Mamba's linear complexity for large window spatial modeling in segmentation.
- Hierarchical LM block with PiM and PaM components for enriched multi-scale feature learning.
- Introduction of bidirectional Mamba for better localization awareness.
- Demonstration of LMa-UNet's superior performance over CNN, Transformer, and prior Mamba baselines on multi-organ CT and MRI datasets.

In summary, the paper explores large window modeling with Mamba for medical segmentation, achieving strong results via novel bidirectional and hierarchical designs that enhance Mamba's capabilities.
