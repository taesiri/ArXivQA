# [Object Segmentation-Assisted Inter Prediction for Versatile Video Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11694)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In video coding, inter prediction is used to reduce temporal redundancy between frames. The widely used block-based motion compensation assumes uniform motion within a block, which is inefficient for representing complex motion fields of multiple arbitrary-shaped objects.  
- More flexible partitioning methods like rectangular, geometric, and segmentation-based have been proposed. But they still have limitations in aligning partitions to object boundaries, compactly representing motions, and utilizing segmentation assistance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an object segmentation-assisted inter prediction (SAIP) framework that leverages segmentation to assist motion compensation (MC), motion vector coding (MVC) and motion estimation (ME).
- Advanced learned segmentation methods are introduced to segment objects in reference frames. The segmentation mask is translated to current frame for arbitrary-shaped partition of regions.
- Segmentation-assisted MC performs separate prediction generation for regions to increase accuracy. A two-step strategy is used for integer and fractional MC.  
- Segmentation-assisted MVC utilizes the mask to construct candidates by analyzing distribution patterns, improving coding efficiency.
- Joint segmentation-assisted rate-distortion optimization searches best region partitions and motions during ME.

Main Contributions:
- Complete segmentation-assisted inter prediction framework that fully explores segmentation to assist MC, MVC and ME.
- Segmentation-assisted MC with two-step fractional MC and overlapped pixel weighting to improve prediction.
- Segmentation-assisted MVC that selects candidates based on region distribution patterns.
- Joint optimization of partitioning and motion estimation in rate-distortion cost.

Experiments:
- Implemented in VVC reference software VTM. Achieves average 0.82%, 0.49% and 0.37% bit-rate reductions for VVC common test sequences.
- Outperforms previous segmentation-based schemes. Shows higher potential with more accurate segmentations.
