# [ART: Automatic multi-step reasoning and tool-use for large language
  models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09014)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be:

The \sys framework can automatically generate high-quality multi-step reasoning decompositions and select appropriate tools for new tasks, without requiring additional training or fine-tuning of the language model. 

The key claims seem to be:

1) By retrieving demonstrations of related tasks from a task library and formatting them using a structured query language, \sys can prompt a frozen LM to decompose new tasks in a generalizable way, transferring reasoning steps and tool usage from the demonstrations.

2) The interpretable program format makes it easy to parse tool calls, execute them, and integrate the outputs back into the reasoning chain. This allows effective use of tools like search engines and code execution without specialized prompting.

3) The framework is extensible - humans can provide feedback by editing programs or adding new tools, which can further improve performance on specific tasks with minimal additional supervision.

4) Experiments show \sys outperforms baselines like few-shot prompting and automatic CoT generation on unseen BigBench and MMLU tasks. With human feedback, it matches or exceeds prior specialized approaches that use decomposition or tool supervision.

In summary, the main hypothesis seems to be that the combination of structured demonstrations and flexible tool integration enables strong multi-step reasoning and tool use by frozen LMs, without task-specific training or prompting. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on diverse reasoning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is presenting a framework called Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use (ART) that uses a frozen large language model (LLM) to automatically generate multi-step reasoning decompositions and select appropriate tools to use for new tasks, without requiring additional training or supervision. 

Specifically, the key aspects of the ART framework include:

- A task library containing demonstrations of multi-step reasoning decompositions for related seed tasks, following a structured format defined by a parsing expression grammar. This allows the LLM to learn how to decompose new tasks.

- A tool library containing useful external tools like search engines, code execution, etc. that can be called during decomposition steps to improve reasoning.

- At test time, the LLM generates a decomposition for a new task, and ART parses it to identify tool calls, executes those tools, and integrates their output back into the program before resuming LLM generation.

- Minimal supervision is required - just a description and examples of the new task. The LLM generalizes from the task library demonstrations.

- The decompositions are interpretable and can be edited by humans to improve reasoning and extend tool use if needed.

The authors evaluate ART on a variety of reasoning tasks from the BigBench and MMLU benchmarks. The results show it consistently matches or improves over few-shot prompting, automatic CoT generation, and expert-crafted CoT prompts for most tasks. The tool use in particular provides significant gains. With additional human feedback, ART outperforms the best prior GPT-3 results on 12 tasks by over 20 percentage points on average.

In summary, the key contribution is an automated framework for interpretable multi-step reasoning and flexible tool use, without task-specific training, that also allows easy human improvements. This advances the capabilities of LLMs for complex reasoning in a low-resource setting.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a critical analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

The paper presents a framework called NLProgrammer for automatically generating multi-step reasoning and tool use for large language models (LLMs) in a few-shot setting. The key ideas include:

- Using a flexible query language to represent chained reasoning as "programs" with tool calls. This builds on prior work like decomposed prompting by Khot et al. 

- Providing few-shot demonstrations of programs for related tasks, so the LLM can generalize tools and substeps. This is similar to the idea behind AutoCOT by Zhang et al. of eliciting chaining from LLMs.

- Supporting human-in-the-loop refinement of programs and tools. Related ideas have been explored in systems like Prompt Chainer.

Compared to AutoCOT and other automatic chaining methods, a key distinction is the structured program representation that allows parsing tool calls. This improves accuracy of intermediate steps. The programs also enable easier human feedback.

Compared to tool use methods like ToolFormer, a key difference is NLProgrammer is gradient-free. It does not require specialized training for tools. This provides flexibility - new LLMs and tools can be dropped in. However, a learned approach may have better zero-shot performance.

Overall, NLProgrammer combines the strengths of automatic chaining and tool use in a flexible framework. The program representation and human feedback cycle are novel ideas compared to prior art. The paper shows strong empirical results on Big Bench and other datasets.

In summary, this paper integrates several ideas from prior work in a novel framework that pushes forward the state of the art in few-shot reasoning for LLMs. The results are compelling and the approach is flexible and extensible.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some of the key future research directions suggested in the paper:

- Exploring more efficient and effective approaches for task selection when composing the prompt with demonstrations from the task library. The current approaches rely on a held-out set of labeled examples or prompting the LLM, but more principled methods could be developed.

- Developing better techniques for incorporating human feedback to improve task performance. The paper demonstrates that even minimal feedback can provide large gains, so studying how to best elicit useful human input is an important direction.

- Evaluating the framework on an even wider array of tasks and benchmarks beyond BigBench and MMLU to better understand the scope of applicability. Areas like machine translation requiring entirely new skills could reveal limitations.

- Expanding the task and tool libraries to support additional skills and affordances. The paper hypothesizes this could expand the framework's capabilities to new tasks and tools without retraining the underlying LLM.

- Studying the interplay between techniques like self-consistency and scaled finetuning of LLMs with the framework. The paper suggests improved LLMs like Toolformer could boost performance if integrated into the framework.

- Developing interactive interfaces or visual programming tools for users to more seamlessly provide feedback and expand the capabilities of the system.

- Applying the ideas more broadly to various human+AI interaction settings where decompositions and tool use could be beneficial.

In summary, key directions are improving prompt construction, human interaction, expanding task coverage, integrating advances like finetuning, and applying the framework more broadly. The overall goal is developing systems that learn new skills and leverage tools in a sample-efficient, interpretable, and user-friendly manner.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a flexible framework called Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use (ART) for automatically generating multi-step reasoning decompositions and selecting appropriate tools to improve reasoning for large language models (LLMs). ART uses a small library of demonstration programs for related tasks, written in a structured format, to prompt a frozen LLM to decompose new tasks into interpretable programs with tool calls. At test time, ART pauses generation when tools are called, executes them, and integrates their output back into the program before resuming generation. This allows incorporating tools like search engines and code execution without additional training. The structured programs also enable easy human feedback to refine reasoning and extend tool use. Experiments on BigBench, MMLU, and QA datasets show ART matches or improves on LLMs prompted with hand-crafted demonstrations and tools. The framework provides an interpretable approach to multi-step reasoning and tool use that generalizes across tasks and is amenable to human improvements.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called ART (Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use) that enables large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to perform complex reasoning and use external tools on new tasks, without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. ART works by retrieving demonstrations of multi-step reasoning and tool use from a task library for related tasks, and using them to prompt the LLM to decompose and solve new tasks. The demonstrations follow a structured language that allows parsing tool calls, executing tools, and integrating their outputs back into the generation. 

ART is evaluated on 34 unseen tasks from BigBench and MMLU benchmarks. It outperforms few-shot learning by 10.8 percentage points on average by providing interpretable intermediate reasoning steps. It also exceeds Chain-of-Thought style prompting approaches like AutoCOT by 22 percentage points, indicating the benefits of its structured language. The use of tools in ART's decompositions provides an additional boost of over 12 percentage points. With additional human feedback on 5 instances, ART is able to surpass the best known GPT-3 results that use expert demonstrations or tools by over 20 percentage points on 12 tasks. The framework is flexible - new tools and tasks can be added to the libraries used for few-shot learning on new tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a framework called \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{R}easoning and \textbf{T}ool-use (\sys) for generating multi-step reasoning chains with tool usage for large language models, without requiring additional training or supervision. Given a new task, \sys retrieves demonstrations of related tasks from a manually constructed \emph{task library} that are written in a structured format defined by a parsing expression grammar. As the language model generates a reasoning chain for the new task, \sys parses it to identify calls to tools in a separate \emph{tool library}, executes those tools, and integrates their outputs back into the chain before resuming generation. The interpretable chains also allow optional human-in-the-loop feedback by editing programs in the task library. Experiments on BigBench and MMLU tasks show \sys outperforms baselines like few-shot prompting and automatically generated reasoning chains, especially for tasks requiring search, arithmetic, and algorithmic reasoning. It also matches or exceeds human-authored reasoning chains with minimal feedback.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the challenge of designing flexible prompting frameworks that enable large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to perform complex multi-step reasoning and leverage external tools, without requiring additional training or fine-tuning of the LLM. 

Specifically, the key issues this paper tackles are:

1) Most prior work on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting requires manual effort in hand-crafting prompts and demonstrations tailored to specific tasks. This limits the ability to generalize prompting approaches to new tasks.

2) While some recent work explores automatic CoT prompting, generating accurate and complete reasoning chains remains challenging for LLMs. Errors can cascade through the reasoning steps.

3) Using external tools within CoT prompts currently requires expert-crafted integration of tools tailored to each tool and task. This makes it difficult to leverage new tools flexibly.

4) Existing prompting frameworks have limited support for iterative human feedback to improve the LLM's reasoning process.

To address these issues, this paper introduces the ART framework that:

- Automatically generates multi-step reasoning for new tasks by retrieving and prompting with related demonstrations.

- Uses a structured query language to represent demonstrations, enabling parsing and integration of external tools. 

- Provides an extensible task and tool library to improve coverage of skills and tools.

- Enables easy human-in-the-loop feedback like debugging generations and incorporating new tools/tasks.

In summary, ART focuses on automatically generating high-quality and interpretable multi-step reasoning with tool use for LLMs, without needing additional training. The framework is designed to be flexible, extensible, and amenable to human feedback.
