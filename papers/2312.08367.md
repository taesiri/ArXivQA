# [VLAP: Efficient Video-Language Alignment via Frame Prompting and   Distilling for Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08367)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes VLAP, an efficient video-language alignment network for video question answering. VLAP introduces two new components: a question-aware Frame-Prompter to selectively sample the most relevant frames, and a QFormer-Distiller module to distill cross-modal video-text representations for alignment. Compared to prior arts, VLAP demonstrates improved accuracy and inference speed across several video QA benchmarks. On the NExT-QA dataset, VLAP using only 4 frames outperforms the state-of-the-art SeViLA using 4 frames by 1% average accuracy while achieving over 3x speedup. The gains are particularly strong on temporal and causal reasoning questions where keyframe selection matters more. Ablations validate that both the Frame-Prompter and QFormer-Distiller significantly boost performance. Qualitative visualizations also showcase VLAPâ€™s capability in extracting question-relevant frames. Overall, VLAP advances the state-of-the-art in efficient video-language alignment for streaming question answering, highlighting the importance of smart keyframe selection and cross-modal distillation.
