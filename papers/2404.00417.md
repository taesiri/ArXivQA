# [Orchestrate Latent Expertise: Advancing Online Continual Learning with   Multi-Level Supervision and Reverse Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00417)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper identifies a key challenge in online continual learning (OCL) that distinguishes it from regular continual learning (CL). Specifically, in OCL models need to learn from a non-stationary data stream in a one-pass setting with limited data and compute resources. This introduces an "overfitting-underfitting dilemma" where models struggle to adequately learn new tasks while avoiding overfitting to a small memory buffer of old data.  

Solution - Multi-level Online Sequential Experts (MOSE):
The paper proposes a new approach called MOSE to address this dilemma in OCL by learning multi-level representations and distilling knowledge between them. The key ideas are:

1) Multi-level supervision: The model backbone is split into multiple "experts" at different depths. Each expert produces features and task predictions for supervised training objectives. This results in multi-scale representations that capture different levels of abstraction.

2) Reverse self-distillation (RSD): Knowledge is transferred from shallower experts to deeper ones via distillation of intermediate features. This allows the final classifier to leverage strengths from all experts. RSD specifically aggregates skills within the model unlike traditional distillation.

Together, these components allow MOSE balance underfitting new tasks and overfitting old data by coordinating specialized experts.

Contributions:
- Identifies and formalizes the overfitting-underfitting dilemma in OCL
- Proposes a new OCL approach MOSE with multi-level supervision and reverse self-distillation  
- Experiments show state-of-the-art results, e.g. 7.3% higher accuracy on Split CIFAR-100 dataset
- Ablation studies validate the efficacy of individual components to address this dilemma

The paper makes both problem analysis and algorithmic contributions to advance OCL research towards continual learning in realistic sequential data settings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new online continual learning method called Multi-level Online Sequential Experts (MOSE) which utilizes multi-level supervision signals across network hierarchies and reverse self-distillation to orchestrate latent expertise for efficiently learning new tasks while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of old tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper analyzes the online continual learning (OCL) problem and attributes its key challenge to the overfitting-underfitting dilemma that arises from the biased data distributions of new and old tasks.

2. The paper proposes a novel approach called Multi-level Online Sequential Experts (MOSE) to address this dilemma in OCL. MOSE has two main components:

(a) Multi-level supervision that trains the network blocks as separate experts using supervision signals from multiple network layers. This facilitates appropriate convergence when learning new tasks. 

(b) Reverse self-distillation that transfers knowledge from the shallower experts to the final classifier. This gathering of diverse expertise from the network helps mitigate forgetting of old tasks.

3. Through extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates the superior performance of MOSE over state-of-the-art OCL methods. For instance, MOSE achieves over 5% higher average accuracy on Split CIFAR-100 and Split Tiny-ImageNet benchmarks.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and empirical validation of the MOSE framework to advance OCL by orchestrating latent expertise in the network using multi-level supervision and reverse distillation.

The paper proposes a new method called Multi-level Online Sequential Experts (MOSE) to address the challenges of online continual learning. The key ideas are using multi-level supervision signals across network layers to train sub-experts, and reverse knowledge distillation to transfer skills from multiple experts to the final predictor. This aims to achieve appropriate convergence for new tasks while avoiding overfitting to old tasks replayed from a memory buffer. The method is evaluated on class-incremental learning benchmarks like Split CIFAR-100 and shows superior performance over existing online continual learning algorithms.
