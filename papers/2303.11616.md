# [HRDFuse: Monocular 360°Depth Estimation by Collaboratively Learning   Holistic-with-Regional Depth Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11616)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: 

How can we improve monocular 360° depth estimation by combining global context from the equirectangular projection (ERP) with regional detail from tangent projection (TP) patches?

The key points are:

- Previous methods using ERP or TP alone have limitations. ERP suffers from distortion while TP lacks global context. 

- The paper proposes a new method called HRDFuse that combines ERP and TP information.

- HRDFuse uses a spatial feature alignment (SFA) module to aggregate TP patch features into a full ERP feature map. 

- It uses a collaborative depth distribution classification (CDDC) module to learn global ERP depth distributions and regional TP depth distributions.

- Depth predictions from ERP and TP branches are fused to produce the final result.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that combining global ERP context with regional TP detail in this collaborative way can improve 360° depth estimation accuracy and smoothness compared to prior methods. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper on monocular 360° depth estimation are:

1. It proposes a new framework called HRDFuse that combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers. It exploits both the holistic contextual information from the equirectangular projection (ERP) image and the regional structural information from the tangent projection (TP) patches.

2. It introduces a spatial feature alignment (SFA) module to efficiently aggregate the individual TP patch information into the ERP space in a pixel-wise manner. This avoids expensive patch merging operations. 

3. It proposes a collaborative depth distribution classification (CDDC) module to learn both holistic and regional depth distribution histograms. This allows predicting depth values as a linear combination of histogram bin centers.

4. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three 360° depth estimation benchmarks, producing smoother and more accurate depth maps compared to prior works.

In summary, the key novelty is the collaborative modeling of holistic and regional depth distributions via the SFA and CDDC modules. This allows combining ERP and TP effectively, avoiding patch merging issues, and improving depth accuracy. The experiments demonstrate the advantages over existing methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called HRDFuse for monocular 360° depth estimation that combines convolutional neural networks and transformers to exploit both holistic contextual information from the equirectangular projection and regional structural details from tangent projections, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in monocular 360-degree depth estimation:

- This paper proposes a novel framework called HRDFuse that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers to exploit both holistic contextual information from the equirectangular projection (ERP) image and regional structural information from tangent projection (TP) patches. Many prior works rely solely on either ERP or TP, while this paper shows the benefit of using both.

- The paper introduces two key technical contributions - the spatial feature alignment (SFA) module and the collaborative depth distribution classification (CDDC) module. SFA aligns the TP features to aggregate into the ERP space efficiently. CDDC predicts depth by learning holistic and regional depth distributions rather than direct regression. These are novel ideas not explored much before. 

- Compared to recent TP-based methods like OmniFusion and 360MonoDepth, HRDFuse achieves smoother and more accurate depth maps by incorporating holistic ERP context. It also avoids expensive patch merging operations through the SFA module.

- Compared to recent ERP-based methods like ACDNet and SliceNet, HRDFuse better handles ERP distortion by complementing with TP patches. The performance gains are significant especially on real-world datasets like Stanford 2D3D.

- The method obtains state-of-the-art results on the 3D60 and Stanford 2D3D datasets, outperforming recent approaches like OmniFusion, UniFuse, and PanoFormer by large margins. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed ideas.

- One limitation is that the work focuses only on supervised monocular depth estimation, while some recent works have explored self-supervised learning which requires less labeled data. Exploring self-supervision could be an interesting future direction.

In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in monocular 360-degree depth estimation through its novel network architecture and technical contributions combining the strengths of ERP and TP. The gains over prior arts highlight the benefits of the proposed approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several potential future research directions based on their work:

1. Exploring the potential of tangent projection (TP) patches further, such as contrastive learning methods to learn more effective representations from the less distorted TP patches.

2. Extending the framework to joint 360° monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation, since they are closely related dense scene understanding tasks. The representation learning on TP patches could benefit both tasks.

3. Applying the proposed modules like SFA and CDDC to other omnidirectional vision tasks beyond depth estimation, such as semantic/instance segmentation, optical flow estimation, etc. 

4. Investigating more efficient network architectures to extract equirectangular features, instead of the commonly used encoder-decoder structure.

5. Exploring self-supervised methods for monocular 360° depth estimation, which do not require ground truth depth for supervision. The proposed modules provide a framework to combine cues like appearance consistency across viewpoints.

6. Extending the framework to leverage temporal information across monocular 360° video frames, for tasks like depth estimation, SLAM, etc.

In summary, the main future directions are around exploiting TP patches better, joint understanding with other tasks like segmentation, self-supervision, more efficient network architectures, and incorporation of temporal information. The core modules proposed in this work like SFA and CDDC provide a strong foundation for many of these future research avenues.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called HRDFuse for monocular 360° depth estimation that subtly combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers. It takes both an equirectangular projection (ERP) image and tangent projection (TP) patches as input. The spatial feature alignment (SFA) module efficiently aggregates TP features into an ERP feature map. The collaborative depth distribution classification (CDDC) module learns holistic and regional depth distributions from the ERP and TP inputs respectively and predicts depth values as a linear combination of histogram bin centers. This avoids directly regressing pixel depth values and improves smoothness and accuracy. The final depth prediction adaptively fuses the outputs from the ERP and TP branches. Experiments on three datasets show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with more accurate and smoother depth estimation compared to prior works. Key advantages are efficiently incorporating holistic ERP and regional TP information and replacing direct depth regression with learned depth distributions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called HRDFuse for monocular 360° depth estimation, which combines information from equirectangular projection (ERP) and tangent projection (TP) images. The key idea is to exploit the complementary holistic contextual information from the ERP image and regional structural information from the TP patches. The framework has three main components: 1) A spatial feature alignment (SFA) module that determines spatial correspondences between ERP and TP features to enable efficient fusion. 2) A collaborative depth distribution classification (CDDC) module that learns holistic and regional depth distributions and predicts depth as a combination of distribution bin centers. 3) An adaptive fusion of the depth predictions from ERP and TP. 

Experiments on three datasets - Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, and 3D60 - demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The SFA module enables smooth fusion of TP patches without expensive reprojection. The CDDC module captures holistic and regional context for accurate depth estimation. Comparisons show the approach predicts smoother and more accurate depth maps than previous methods. The ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. Overall, the paper presents a novel and effective approach for learning complementary ERP and TP information to achieve accurate 360° monocular depth estimation.
