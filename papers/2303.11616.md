# [HRDFuse: Monocular 360°Depth Estimation by Collaboratively Learning   Holistic-with-Regional Depth Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11616)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: 

How can we improve monocular 360° depth estimation by combining global context from the equirectangular projection (ERP) with regional detail from tangent projection (TP) patches?

The key points are:

- Previous methods using ERP or TP alone have limitations. ERP suffers from distortion while TP lacks global context. 

- The paper proposes a new method called HRDFuse that combines ERP and TP information.

- HRDFuse uses a spatial feature alignment (SFA) module to aggregate TP patch features into a full ERP feature map. 

- It uses a collaborative depth distribution classification (CDDC) module to learn global ERP depth distributions and regional TP depth distributions.

- Depth predictions from ERP and TP branches are fused to produce the final result.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that combining global ERP context with regional TP detail in this collaborative way can improve 360° depth estimation accuracy and smoothness compared to prior methods. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper on monocular 360° depth estimation are:

1. It proposes a new framework called HRDFuse that combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers. It exploits both the holistic contextual information from the equirectangular projection (ERP) image and the regional structural information from the tangent projection (TP) patches.

2. It introduces a spatial feature alignment (SFA) module to efficiently aggregate the individual TP patch information into the ERP space in a pixel-wise manner. This avoids expensive patch merging operations. 

3. It proposes a collaborative depth distribution classification (CDDC) module to learn both holistic and regional depth distribution histograms. This allows predicting depth values as a linear combination of histogram bin centers.

4. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three 360° depth estimation benchmarks, producing smoother and more accurate depth maps compared to prior works.

In summary, the key novelty is the collaborative modeling of holistic and regional depth distributions via the SFA and CDDC modules. This allows combining ERP and TP effectively, avoiding patch merging issues, and improving depth accuracy. The experiments demonstrate the advantages over existing methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called HRDFuse for monocular 360° depth estimation that combines convolutional neural networks and transformers to exploit both holistic contextual information from the equirectangular projection and regional structural details from tangent projections, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in monocular 360-degree depth estimation:

- This paper proposes a novel framework called HRDFuse that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers to exploit both holistic contextual information from the equirectangular projection (ERP) image and regional structural information from tangent projection (TP) patches. Many prior works rely solely on either ERP or TP, while this paper shows the benefit of using both.

- The paper introduces two key technical contributions - the spatial feature alignment (SFA) module and the collaborative depth distribution classification (CDDC) module. SFA aligns the TP features to aggregate into the ERP space efficiently. CDDC predicts depth by learning holistic and regional depth distributions rather than direct regression. These are novel ideas not explored much before. 

- Compared to recent TP-based methods like OmniFusion and 360MonoDepth, HRDFuse achieves smoother and more accurate depth maps by incorporating holistic ERP context. It also avoids expensive patch merging operations through the SFA module.

- Compared to recent ERP-based methods like ACDNet and SliceNet, HRDFuse better handles ERP distortion by complementing with TP patches. The performance gains are significant especially on real-world datasets like Stanford 2D3D.

- The method obtains state-of-the-art results on the 3D60 and Stanford 2D3D datasets, outperforming recent approaches like OmniFusion, UniFuse, and PanoFormer by large margins. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed ideas.

- One limitation is that the work focuses only on supervised monocular depth estimation, while some recent works have explored self-supervised learning which requires less labeled data. Exploring self-supervision could be an interesting future direction.

In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in monocular 360-degree depth estimation through its novel network architecture and technical contributions combining the strengths of ERP and TP. The gains over prior arts highlight the benefits of the proposed approach.
