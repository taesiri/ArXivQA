# [HRDFuse: Monocular 360°Depth Estimation by Collaboratively Learning   Holistic-with-Regional Depth Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11616)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: 

How can we improve monocular 360° depth estimation by combining global context from the equirectangular projection (ERP) with regional detail from tangent projection (TP) patches?

The key points are:

- Previous methods using ERP or TP alone have limitations. ERP suffers from distortion while TP lacks global context. 

- The paper proposes a new method called HRDFuse that combines ERP and TP information.

- HRDFuse uses a spatial feature alignment (SFA) module to aggregate TP patch features into a full ERP feature map. 

- It uses a collaborative depth distribution classification (CDDC) module to learn global ERP depth distributions and regional TP depth distributions.

- Depth predictions from ERP and TP branches are fused to produce the final result.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that combining global ERP context with regional TP detail in this collaborative way can improve 360° depth estimation accuracy and smoothness compared to prior methods. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.
