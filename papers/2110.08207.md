# [Multitask Prompted Training Enables Zero-Shot Task Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can explicit multitask learning induce strong zero-shot generalization abilities in language models, without requiring massive scale?

The authors investigate whether explicitly training a language model in a supervised, massively multitask fashion leads to improved generalization on held-out natural language tasks presented in a prompted format. Their hypothesis is that this explicit multitask prompted training approach can enable models to generalize well to new tasks, without needing extremely large scale like GPT-3. 

The key research questions appear to be:

1) Does multitask prompted training improve generalization to held-out tasks compared to just language model pretraining? 

2) Does training on a more diverse range of prompts improve robustness to the wording of prompts for held-out tasks?

So in summary, the central research question is whether explicit multitask prompted training can induce strong zero-shot generalization abilities without massive scale, which they test by evaluating on held-out tasks and the impact of training prompt diversity.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can explicit multitask prompted training improve the zero-shot generalization abilities of language models, and does training on a wider range of prompts make models more robust to variations in prompt wording?

The key points related to this research question are:

- The paper investigates whether explicit multitask training on a diverse set of prompted NLP datasets can enable language models to generalize to new tasks presented as natural language prompts. 

- This contrasts with prior work showing language models can generalize zero-shot, which has been hypothesized to result from implicit multitask learning during pretraining. Here they want to directly induce the ability through explicit prompted multitask training.

- The authors assemble a large training mixture covering 12 tasks with multiple diverse prompt templates for each dataset. They train an encoder-decoder model on a subset of these tasks and evaluate zero-shot performance on held-out tasks and prompts.

- Experiments compare models trained on different numbers of prompt templates per dataset and different overall numbers of datasets. This tests if prompt diversity and volume lead to better generalization and robustness to prompt wording.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that explicit multitask prompted training can improve zero-shot task generalization, and that training on more diverse prompts makes models more robust to variations in how the tasks are prompted.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

- Develops a system for converting diverse natural language tasks into a human-readable prompted form. The authors create a large collection of prompts for 177 datasets covering 12 common NLP tasks. 

- Trains an encoder-decoder model (called T0) on a subset of these prompted tasks and shows it can generalize well to unseen tasks, outperforming GPT-3 on 9 out of 11 held-out datasets despite being much smaller.

- Demonstrates that training on more diverse prompts for each dataset improves the model's robustness to prompt wording, in terms of higher median performance and lower variance across prompts.

- Releases the trained models, prompt collection, and prompting tools to facilitate future research on improving zero-shot generalization in language models.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that explicit multitask prompted training can induce strong zero-shot generalization abilities, often exceeding models over 10x larger. The diversity of prompts and tasks is important for robust generalization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is developing a method for multitask prompted training of language models to improve their zero-shot task generalization abilities. 

Specifically, the authors collect a large set of prompts for diverse NLP tasks, train an encoder-decoder model (called T0) on a multitask mixture of some of these prompted tasks, and demonstrate that this approach enables T0 to achieve strong performance on several held-out datasets and tasks that it was not trained on. This indicates an ability for zero-shot generalization.

The key findings are:

- T0 matches or exceeds GPT-3's zero-shot performance on 9 out of 11 held-out datasets, despite being 16x smaller.

- T0 outperforms baseline models on 13 out of 14 novel tasks from the BIG-bench benchmark. 

- Increasing the number and diversity of prompts used during training consistently improves T0's median performance and robustness on held-out tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is showing that explicit multitask prompted training can induce strong zero-shot generalization abilities in language models, providing an alternative to relying solely on pretraining scale. The paper also highlights the importance of diverse prompting for improving generalization.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on using explicit multitask prompted training to improve zero-shot generalization abilities in language models. Other recent works like GPT-3 and FLAN have also explored how to enable zero-shot generalization, usually through some form of implicit multitask learning during pretraining. This paper differentiates itself by explicitly training the model on a diverse mixture of prompted tasks.

- The approach of reformatting many NLP datasets into a prompted format and training on the mixture is similar to recent work like UnifiedQA, which also converts datasets into a common format. However, UnifiedQA and other works typically convert datasets into just one type of prompt, whereas this paper uses multiple diverse prompts per dataset.

- The idea of training on more prompts to make models more robust is explored, which aligns with other works arguing that prompt diversity and rewording is important. However, this paper takes a more systematic approach to studying prompt robustness through controlled experiments.

- The scale of the model and training data is much smaller than GPT-3 and FLAN. Despite using a model 16x smaller, it matches or exceeds GPT-3 on many benchmarks, suggesting multitask prompting provides an alternative to scale for generalization.

- The model also generally outperforms FLAN, a concurrent work on prompted training for generalization, while using a much smaller model. The differences in model architecture and prompting diversity may explain the improved results compared to FLAN's ablations.

- The paper provides strong evidence that explicit prompted multitask training improves few-shot and zero-shot generalization. The analysis on prompt diversity confirms its importance. Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to understanding prompted training for generalization in language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in natural language processing and multitask learning:

- The idea of using explicit multitask training to improve zero-shot generalization has been explored before, but not at this scale with hundreds of datasets and thousands of prompts. Previous multitask learning papers have typically used a handful of tasks.

- The paper builds on the idea from GPT-3 and other recent work that large pretrained language models can already do reasonable zero-shot generalization, and tries to induce this ability more directly through multitask training rather than just relying on pretrained models.

- The approach of training on multiple prompts per dataset to improve robustness to prompt wording is novel. Most prior work uses a single prompt per dataset. Analyzing the variability across prompts is also less common.

- The scale of the training mixture, with over 60 datasets spanning 12 distinct tasks, is larger than most prior multitask NLP work. The only comparable prior study I'm aware of is FLAN which used a similar variety of datasets.

- However, the model scale is not that large compared to the biggest models like GPT-3 and FLAN. So it demonstrates these abilities are attainable without massive parameter counts.

- The model architecture of using an encoder-decoder model rather than a decoder-only model is fairly standard in multitask NLP. The use of T5 and adapting it to language modeling before fine-tuning is a solid approach.

- The results on zero-shot BIG-bench tasks is an interesting testbed for generalization. Most multitask NLP papers still just evaluate on held-out regular datasets, not really novel/unseen tasks and skills.

- Overall it shows multitask training is a viable alternative to just scaling up models and data for few-shot and zero-shot abilities. And it provides a recipe for effectively harnessing multitask training.

In summary, the scale and novelty is impressive given most prior work, but otherwise the techniques are fairly standard. The key findings on prompt diversity and model scale vs GPT-3 are interesting. It provides a strong baseline for future work on improved zero-shot generalization.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different encoder-decoder model architectures and pretraining strategies beyond the T5 model used in this work, to see if they can further improve multitask prompted training and generalization. The authors suggest transformer architectures like GPT could be promising to try.

- Expanding the diversity of tasks, datasets, and prompts used for training and evaluation. The authors note their task taxonomy is limited by focusing mainly on existing popular NLP datasets. They suggest exploring less common but still important capabilities like grounded language understanding. 

- Further analysis into what makes prompts effective for generalization, and developing methods to make models more robust to prompt wording. The authors remain agnostic on why prompts work and suggest more research is needed.

- Exploring different schemes for held-out task evaluation, such as holding out a wider range of unseen tasks, or using incremental hold-out sets to better measure generalization.

- Developing methods to reduce the environmental impact of training large prompted models, such as more efficient model architectures.

- Further analysis of social biases learned during prompted training, and development of techniques to mitigate harmful biases.

In summary, the main directions are exploring model enhancements, expanding the diversity of tasks and prompts, better understanding why prompts are effective, developing more thorough evaluation schemes, reducing environmental harms, and analyzing social biases. The authors lay out an extensive research agenda to build on their proposed prompted training approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:

- Testing their multitask prompted training approach on even larger and more diverse mixtures of tasks and prompts to further improve generalization abilities. They mention disciplines like math, programming, and gaming as interesting areas to expand into.

- Exploring different model architectures like dense retrievers and transformers with explicit memory to potentially further improve performance on tasks requiring knowledge. 

- Studying the relationship between model scale, breadth of training tasks, and generalization capability more systematically. For example, how does model size interact with the diversity of training tasks?

- Analyzing what makes some prompts more effective than others through ablation studies and other analysis methods. 

- Developing methods to automatically generate high-quality prompts to reduce the human effort required.

- Exploring whether multitask prompted training can be used along with other methods like adversarial training and data augmentation to improve robustness.

- Testing the limits of multitask prompted training by training models on even larger mixtures with more tasks. Can a single model be trained to handle thousands of distinct tasks?

- Applying this approach to multilingual models and studying cross-lingual generalization.

- Developing better techniques for analyzing possible bias, toxicity, and fairness issues that may arise from training on diverse web data.

In summary, the main future directions are scaling up the training in terms of task diversity and data size, studying what makes effective prompts, improving robustness, and analyzing potential issues around harmful content.

The paper explores whether explicit multitask learning can improve a model's ability to generalize to new tasks at test time without additional fine-tuning, also known as zero-shot task generalization. The authors develop a framework for casting many NLP datasets into a simple prompt-based format. They collect prompts for 177 datasets covering 12 diverse NLP tasks such as question answering, textual entailment, and summarization. The prompts are collected through an open call for participation and a custom built prompt collection interface. 

The authors then train a variant of the T5 model on a subset of 39 of these prompted datasets, holding out 4 tasks completely (natural language inference, coreference resolution, sentence completion, and word sense disambiguation). They find that this multitask prompted training approach substantially improves zero-shot performance on the held out tasks compared to only pretraining the model as a language model. The model also outperforms GPT-3 on 9 out of 11 zero-shot datasets despite being much smaller. Additional experiments demonstrate that training on more diverse prompts consistently improves generalization ability. The authors conclude that explicit multitask training is an effective way to improve zero-shot generalization in language models.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes training a language model in a supervised, multitask fashion on a diverse set of NLP datasets that have been converted into natural language prompts. The authors develop a templating system to allow dataset examples to be formatted as prompts consisting of an input text and target text. They use this system to collect prompts for 177 datasets across 12 tasks, with an average of 11.7 prompts per dataset. The prompts are collected through a community effort from contributors affiliated with various institutions. The authors then train a T5-based encoder-decoder model initialized with additional language modeling training on a subset of the prompted datasets covering a wide variety of NLP tasks. Each task has multiple datasets, and each dataset has multiple prompts with diverse wording. After training on this multitask mixture, the authors evaluate the model's zero-shot performance on held-out datasets from tasks that were not seen during training. They find that their approach attains strong generalization abilities, often outperforming much larger models such as GPT-3. They also perform ablation studies showing the impact of training on more prompts per dataset and more datasets overall.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper develops a system to train language models to perform well on new tasks without explicit training, a capability referred to as zero-shot generalization. The authors convert a large set of NLP datasets into a prompted form by writing multiple natural language prompt templates for each dataset. This prompted data allows models to be trained and evaluated in a multitask format. The authors train an encoder-decoder model initialized with a pretrained language model on a subset of the prompted datasets covering diverse tasks. After this multitask prompted training, the model is evaluated on datasets from tasks it was not trained on in order to test its zero-shot generalization abilities. The trained model is compared to baseline language models as well as GPT-3 in terms of performance on these unseen datasets. The results demonstrate that multitask prompted training improves zero-shot generalization and makes models more robust to prompt wording compared to language model pretraining alone.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the key problem the paper is addressing is how to improve the zero-shot generalization abilities of large language models through explicit multitask training. 

Specifically, the paper investigates whether explicitly training a model on a diverse mixture of prompted natural language tasks can enhance its ability to generalize to new tasks that were not seen during training. This is in contrast to prior work that hypothesizes large language models acquire zero-shot abilities through implicit multitask learning during pretraining.

The main research questions seem to be:

1) Does multitask prompted training improve generalization to held-out tasks compared to just pretraining? 

2) Does training on a wider variety of wordings/prompts for each task improve robustness and consistency across different prompt formulations?

To summarize, the key focus is on using explicit multitask prompted training to improve zero-shot generalization and prompt robustness in language models. The paper aims to demonstrate that this approach can confer strong generalization abilities without requiring massive scale, as well as make models less sensitive to the specific wording of prompts.
