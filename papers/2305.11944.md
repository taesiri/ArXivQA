# [Exploring the Viability of Synthetic Query Generation for Relevance   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11944)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is:How effective are synthetic query generation (QGen) techniques for the task of nuanced relevance prediction compared to conventional cross-domain transfer learning approaches?The key hypotheses explored are:1) QGen techniques can be adapted to generate nuanced queries by conditioning on different relevance labels, rather than just binary relevance. 2) Contrary to claims in prior work, QGen approaches do not universally outperform cross-domain transfer learning for relevance prediction, especially on more complex/nuanced tasks.3) QGen models struggle to fully capture the nuances of different relevance labels, limiting their effectiveness.The paper explores these hypotheses through empirical studies on e-commerce search benchmarks, comparing QGen techniques like finetuning and prompting to transfer learning baselines. A key finding is that cross-domain transfer learning outperforms QGen, unlike prior work. Detailed analysis reveals limitations of QGen models in producing queries faithful to nuanced relevance labels.In summary, this paper provides an in-depth investigation into adapting QGen for nuanced relevance prediction, identifying limitations of current techniques compared to transfer learning. The central research question revolves around assessing the viability of synthetic query generation for this complex IR task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Providing the first detailed empirical study of query generation (QGen) approaches for relevance prediction in the e-commerce domain. The authors experiment with two major families of QGen methods - finetuning-based and prompt-based - on three e-commerce benchmarks.2. Demonstrating through experiments that contrary to some prior claims, current QGen approaches underperform compared to more conventional cross-domain transfer learning for relevance prediction. The authors identify issues with existing QGen methods, like generating incorrect or unfaithful queries.3. Introducing modifications to existing QGen approaches to incorporate knowledge about different levels of relevance, rather than treating it as binary relevant/not relevant. Their label-conditioned QGen models outperform vanilla QGen, showing the importance of modeling nuanced relevance.4. Showing that smaller in-domain labeled datasets can outperform larger general-purpose datasets for training both transfer learning and QGen models, highlighting the importance of domain-relatedness.In summary, the main contribution is providing an in-depth empirical study of QGen techniques for nuanced relevance prediction in e-commerce, identifying limitations of existing methods, and proposing improvements via label-conditioned QGen. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of in-domain data for this task.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper explores using synthetic query generation techniques to improve relevance prediction in e-commerce search, and finds that while conditioning on multiple relevance labels helps, these approaches still fall short of standard transfer learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in synthetic query generation:- The paper provides a nice overview of existing approaches to query generation (QGen), categorizing them into finetuning-based and prompt-based methods. This frames the paper's contributions in the context of current techniques.- A key focus is adapting QGen for nuanced relevance prediction with multiple graded relevance labels. Most prior work has focused on binary relevance or factoid QA. Exploring QGen for more complex multi-class relevance is novel.- The paper demonstrates that current QGen methods underperform cross-domain transfer learning, unlike some prior claims. This is an important empirical finding, especially given comparable model sizes. - Analysis of why QGen falls short, e.g. many duplicates, is insightful. The paper digs deeper into QGen's limitations than most works.- Introducing label-conditioned QGen to capture nuance is a nice idea. Evaluation shows it helps but doesn't fully close the gap to transfer learning.- Showing in-domain data helps for both transfer learning and QGen is consistent with related domains. Most QGen papers use general purpose data.- The focus is on computational experiments and analysis. Other recent QGen work has looked more at controllable/diverse generation which is complementary.Overall, the paper provides useful new insights into adapting QGen for relevance prediction. The empirical comparisons and detailed analysis of QGen's limitations help advance understanding of current methods and their deficiencies. The findings highlight important open problems in making QGen approaches more effective across diverse tasks.
