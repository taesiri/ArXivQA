# [Let the LLMs Talk: Simulating Human-to-Human Conversational QA via   Zero-Shot LLM-to-LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02913)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a framework for simulating human-to-human question-answering conversations using large language models (LLMs). It involves two LLMs interacting with each other: one LLM plays the role of the "student" that asks questions to explore a given topic, while the other LLM is the "teacher" that answers the questions by retrieving relevant text spans from a document. To evaluate their approach, the authors first assess the quality of the simulated teacher's answers through both automatic metrics and human evaluation. They find that the LLM teacher provides more accurate, complete and natural responses compared to human teachers. Next, they analyze the questions asked by the LLM student versus humans by examining aspects like coverage of the document's content and conversation flow. Their experiments uncover interesting differences, like the LLM student tending to ask more diverse questions. The authors also test reading comprehension models on the simulated conversations, finding improved performance over human conversations in several cases. Overall, their analyses demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging LLMs to automatically simulate high-quality question-answering dialogues without any human involvement. The work also discusses the limitations of current LLMs and outlines important ethical considerations around bias, transparency and environmental impact that should be addressed when using LLMs to simulate human behavior.
