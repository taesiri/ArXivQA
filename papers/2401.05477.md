# [Standardizing Your Training Process for Human Activity Recognition   Models: A Comprehensive Review in the Tunable Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05477)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent research in wearable human activity recognition (WHAR) using deep learning has lacked standardization and detail in describing model training procedures. 
- This affects reproducibility and reliability of results.
- Specific deficiencies exist in reporting on optimization techniques, early stopping criteria, scheduler details etc.
- Consequences of lacking these details remain unstudied.

Proposed Solutions:
- Conduct an exhaustive literature review of 102 WHAR papers on model training descriptions.
- Identify most common training hyperparameters and analyze deficiencies. 
- Use control variable analysis to study impact of factors like optimizer, learning rate, batch size on model performance.
- Propose integrated training procedure for WHAR based on insights.
- Evaluate proposed method on benchmark datasets and models.

Key Contributions:
- First review focused on WHAR model training procedure description.
- Provide insights into common practices and issues.
- Demonstrate significant impacts of overlooked factors experimentally.  
- Propose new training procedure and open source it.
- Show improved performance over common procedure through extensive experiments.

In summary, the paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of deficiencies in describing model training details in WHAR research. It highlights and demonstrates the non-negligible influence these factors can have through controlled experiments. To address this, the authors suggest a new training methodology tailored for WHAR and provide evidence of its effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper reviews the current state of model training process descriptions in human activity recognition literature, identifies issues with reproducibility, and proposes an improved training procedure that is demonstrated to boost performance across multiple models and datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides the first review focused specifically on analyzing the model training procedure descriptions in human activity recognition (HAR) research papers. 

2. It identifies prevalent issues with model training descriptions in the HAR field and demonstrates their potential impact on reproducibility using control variables analysis.

3. Based on the control variables analysis, it proposes a new integrated training procedure tailored for HAR models. Empirical evaluation shows this procedure significantly improves inter-subject generalization performance across multiple benchmark datasets and model architectures.  

4. The proposed training procedure is released as an open-source package to support further HAR research.

In summary, this paper focuses on the oft-overlooked model training process rather than model architectures in HAR. It sheds light on deficiencies in training procedure reporting in papers, verifies their influence experimentally, and contributes a systematically designed training methodology to help address reproducibility issues.
