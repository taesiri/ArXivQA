# [Importance-Aware Image Segmentation-based Semantic Communication for   Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10153)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Emerging autonomous driving requires vehicles to share sensing data (especially image data) via V2X communications to understand traffic scenes and improve driving safety. However, transmitting massive image data consumes large amounts of bandwidth, which is challenging for resource-constrained V2X networks. 

- Existing image-based semantic communication works focus on image recovery or classification at the receiver side. They transmit redundant information without considering the differentiated importance of objects for autonomous driving safety.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes VIS-SemCom, an image segmentation-oriented semantic communication system for autonomous driving. It extracts and transmits compact segmentation features of important objects to reduce bandwidth usage.  

- The VIS-SemCom encoder uses a Swin Transformer backbone to extract multi-scale semantic features from input images. The decoder recovers the segmentation label maps directly using the received features.

- Importance-aware loss function is designed to emphasize accurate segmentation of important objects like vehicles, pedestrians, obstacles over less important ones like sky, fence.  

- Online hard sample mining strategy deals with small sample issues for some crucial objects in the dataset like riders, bicycles.

Main Contributions:

- First work designing vehicular semantic communication system tailored for segmented understanding of important objects to improve efficiency.

- Multi-scale Swin Transformer based codec structure extracts semantic features balanced for objects with differentiated segmentation requirements.  

- Importance-aware loss function and online hard sample mining strategy enhance segmentation accuracy of important objects.

- Results show coding gain of 6 dB at 60% mIoU, 70% data reduction with 60% mIoU compared to traditional schemes. IoU of important objects improved by 4%.

In summary, the paper makes vehicular semantic communication aware of object importance for autonomous driving safety, achieving bandwidth savings as well as accuracy improvements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an image segmentation-oriented semantic communication system for autonomous driving that transmits only the important semantic features extracted from input images to reduce data transmission while recovering high-quality segmentation maps at the receiver side.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes VIS-SemCom, a vehicular image segmentation-oriented semantic communication system for autonomous driving. This is the first work that designs semantic communication by considering object importance in images to improve transmission performance.

2. It designs a Swin Transformer-based encoder to extract multi-scale semantic features from input images. A multi-level local self-attention mechanism and shift window strategy are used to balance semantic extraction capability and computational complexity.

3. It optimizes the codec structure, loss function and training strategy to emphasize the accurate segmentation of important objects like vehicles, pedestrians and obstacles. An importance-aware loss and online hard sample mining (OHEM) strategy are proposed.  

4. Experiments show VIS-SemCom reduces transmitted data by 70% and achieves a 6 dB coding gain with 60% mean IoU, compared to traditional transmission. It also improves the segmentation IoU of important objects by 4%. This meets the demand of understanding key objects for safe autonomous driving.

In summary, the key innovation is designing a semantic communication system tailored for autonomous driving by considering differentiation of object importance in images, which is validated to improve transmission efficiency and driving safety.
