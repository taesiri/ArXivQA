# [Diffusion-ES: Gradient-free Planning with Diffusion for Autonomous   Driving and Zero-Shot Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06559)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in modeling complex multimodal trajectory distributions for decision-making and control. However, optimizing arbitrary black-box reward functions with diffusion models is challenging. Reward-gradient guidance requires differentiable reward functions and fitting rewards to noisy samples. This limits the flexibility of diffusion models for trajectory optimization.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Diffusion-ES, a method that combines evolutionary strategies with diffusion models for black-box trajectory optimization. Key ideas:

1) Initialize population by sampling trajectories from a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model 

2) Select high-scoring trajectory samples and mutate them using a truncated diffuse-denoise process with a small number of steps. This allows efficient exploration while staying close to the data distribution.

3) Use evolutionary strategies to iterate between scoring, selection and mutation to optimize arbitrary black-box rewards.

Main Contributions:

1) A novel way to combine evolutionary strategies with diffusion models for flexible black-box trajectory optimization. Matches state-of-the-art performance in nuPlan driving benchmark.

2) Can optimize complex language-shaped rewards by mapping natural language instructions to reward functions using LLMs. Allows synthesizing novel driving behaviors like aggressive lane changes. Solves very challenging nuPlan tasks. 

3) Extensive experiments analyzing tradeoffs in using conditional vs unconditional diffusion models. More conditioning enables faster search but worse out-of-distribution generalization.

4) Demonstrates optimization of non-differentiable objectives, outperforming Reward-gradient guidance baseline designed for differentiable objectives.

In summary, the paper presents a flexible trajectory optimization algorithm using diffusion models and evolutionary strategies with strong experimental results. Key innovation is efficiently mutating and exploring the trajectory space while staying close to the data distribution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Diffusion-ES, a method that combines evolutionary search with diffusion models to optimize non-differentiable black-box objectives for trajectory planning while staying on the data manifold.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Diffusion-ES, a method that combines evolutionary search with diffusion models for black-box trajectory optimization. Specifically:

1) They introduce a novel way to perform evolutionary search by using a trained diffusion model to initialize and mutate trajectory samples. This allows the search process to explore the solution space more efficiently while keeping samples on the data manifold. 

2) They show that Diffusion-ES matches state-of-the-art performance on the nuPlan autonomous driving benchmark by optimizing a standard driving reward function.

3) They demonstrate the flexibility of Diffusion-ES by using it to follow natural language instructions in driving scenarios by optimizing reward functions generated through few-shot prompting of large language models. This allows them to synthesize novel and complex driving behaviors not present in the training data.

4) They perform extensive experiments analyzing tradeoffs in using conditional versus unconditional diffusion models. They find unconditional models enable better out-of-distribution generalization through test-time optimization, at the cost of slower inference.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing a way to effectively combine diffusion models and evolutionary search for flexible black-box trajectory optimization, with applications to autonomous driving.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed Diffusion-ES method balance exploiting high-reward trajectories and exploring new solutions during the evolutionary search process? What is the role of the truncated denoising diffusion in enabling efficient exploration?

2. The paper argues that less conditioning information leads to better out-of-distribution generalization but slower search. What are some ways to strike the right balance between speed and generalization ability when deciding how much conditioning to use?

3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a black-box reward function compared to a differentiable reward function with the proposed method? In what cases would one approach be preferred over the other?

4. How does the performance of Diffusion-ES change when using different schedule lengths or population sizes? What impact do these hyperparameters have and how should they be tuned?

5. The paper demonstrates following language instructions by optimizing LLM-generated reward functions. What are other potential applications where black-box reward shaping could enable new capabilities?

6. How does the performance of Diffusion-ES degrade in more complex environments with additional traffic participants or longer planning horizons? What are limitations of the approach?

7. What modifications could allow the Diffusion-ES method to work in a closed-loop setting where policies of other agents react to the ego vehicle?

8. How does the sample efficiency and wall-clock runtime of Diffusion-ES compare to other evolutionary search methods or gradient-based trajectory optimizers? Where does it excel and falter?

9. Could ideas from Diffusion-ES be combined with other types of generative models beyond denoising diffusion, such as VAEs or normalizing flows? What would be required?

10. The method relies on a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model. How could the trajectory dataset be expanded to capture more driving behaviors and enhance the search space available to Diffusion-ES?
