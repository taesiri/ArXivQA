# [GFPose: Learning 3D Human Pose Prior with Gradient Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08641)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that learning gradient fields incorporating 3D human pose priors and task-specific conditions can lead to a versatile framework for modeling plausible 3D human poses. The paper proposes a score-based generative model called GFPose that estimates gradient fields to gradually denoise 3D poses conditioned on task specifications.The key points are:- Previous methods for modeling 3D human pose priors either serve as ad-hoc constraints in optimization or require separate training for downstream tasks. - This paper proposes to learn gradient fields that incorporate both pose priors and task conditions, avoiding complex optimization or separate training.- The gradients are learned via score matching on a dataset of 3D poses. Task conditions are specified via hierarchical masking of the input.- This allows the same model to handle various tasks like pose estimation, completion, denoising by only modifying the input conditioning.- Experiments show the model outperforms SOTA on multi-hypothesis pose estimation, achieves comparable results to deterministic methods, and produces high-quality samples for generation tasks.In summary, the central hypothesis is that gradient fields can provide a simple yet versatile way to incorporate human pose priors for diverse tasks within a unified framework. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Introducing GFPose, a novel score-based generative framework to model plausible 3D human poses. GFPose learns a time-dependent score network to approximate the gradient of the log-likelihood of plausible 3D poses conditioned on task-specific inputs. 2. Designing a hierarchical condition masking strategy during training to enhance the versatility of GFPose. This allows GFPose to handle different downstream tasks like 3D pose estimation, completion, denoising and generation by simply specifying the condition at test time.3. Demonstrating that GFPose achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks under a simple unified framework. Notably, it outperforms previous methods in both multi-hypothesis and single-hypothesis 3D pose estimation. It also generates high quality and diverse 3D poses that can augment existing datasets.4. Showing that a probabilistic model like GFPose can achieve comparable or even better performance than previous deterministic models that learn one-to-one mappings, even with a simple network backbone. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed score-based formulation and training strategy.In summary, the main contribution is proposing GFPose, a versatile score-based framework that can model 3D human poses and achieve state-of-the-art results on various downstream tasks related to 3D human pose modeling and generation. The effectiveness comes from the novel problem formulation, model design and training strategy.
