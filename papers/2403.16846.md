# [GreeDy and CoDy: Counterfactual Explainers for Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16846)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) are crucial for modeling dynamic graphs where interactions evolve over time. However, TGNNs lack transparency into their decision-making, posing challenges for explainability.  
- Existing explanation methods are predominantly designed for static graphs, do not adequately address the temporal dynamics in dynamic graphs, and focus on factual explanations that identify features contributing to predictions rather than exploring how input changes could alter outcomes.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces two novel counterfactual explanation methods - GreeDy and CoDy - specifically tailored for making TGNN predictions on dynamic graphs more interpretable.

- Both treat the search for explanations as an optimization problem, altering subsets of past events to find input changes that significantly shift model predictions. 

- GreeDy uses a simple greedy search strategy while CoDy employs a more sophisticated Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to efficiently traverse the search space.

- The methods aim to provide concise and intuitive explanations by finding critical subsets of past events in dynamic graphs that, if removed, would alter model predictions.

- When no counterfactual explanations can be identified, the methods provide the next best alternative explanation that comes closest to changing the prediction.

Contributions:
- First work to provide counterfactual explanations for dynamic graph models, offering more actionable insights compared to existing factual approaches.

- Introduces more appropriate evaluation frameworks for assessing counterfactual explanations.  

- Proposes various search strategies like spatio-temporal and local-gradient to enhance the discovery of impactful explanations.

- Empirical analysis shows CoDy substantially outperforms factual methods and GreeDy in identifying counterfactuals, with up to 59% higher success rate. This demonstrates its potential for increasing model transparency.

In summary, the paper pioneers counterfactual explanations for dynamic graph models through optimized search algorithms, enabling enhanced model transparency and trust. The proposed CoDy method shows particular promise in efficiently uncovering insightful explanations.
