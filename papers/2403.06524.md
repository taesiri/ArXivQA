# [Tactical Decision Making for Autonomous Trucks by Deep Reinforcement   Learning with Total Cost of Operation Based Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06524)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing tactical decision-making and control frameworks for autonomous trucks to enable safe and cost-effective driving. Specifically focusing on adaptive cruise control (ACC) and lane change maneuvers in highway scenarios.

Proposed Solutions:
- Implement a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to learn high-level driving policies related to maintaining safe distances and desired speeds. 
- Compare two system architectures:
   - Baseline: RL agent controls both high-level decisions and low-level continuous control actions directly 
   - New: Separate high-level discrete decisions made by RL agent and low-level continuous control by physics-based controllers
- Design realistic multi-objective reward functions based on total cost of operations (operating costs and revenues)
- Apply curriculum reinforcement learning to gradually teach more complex objectives

Key Contributions:
- Show that separating high-level and low-level control between the RL agent and physics-based controllers improves learning efficiency and driving performance
- Evaluate various RL algorithms including DQN, A2C and PPO - find PPO works best
- Introduce total cost of operations (TCOP) based reward function consisting of realistic costs and revenues to shape RL behavior  
- Tune rewards by adding weights or normalization to balance different objectives
- Apply curriculum RL but find no significant gains over regular RL with well-shaped rewards
- Developed simulator environment integrating SUMO and Gym RL interfaces focusing on heavy vehicle combinations

In summary, the key innovation is the architecture separating high-level RL agent decisions from lower-level control policies, combined with well-shaped multi-objective rewards that enable learning safer and cost-efficient driving behavior. The work provides a robust framework for developing autonomous truck driving systems.
