# [SimLM: Can Language Models Infer Parameters of Physical Systems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14215)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 show impressive capabilities for general purpose language tasks, but lack abilities for specific types of reasoning such as advanced math or physics. 
- The paper demonstrates that leading LLMs struggle with simple physics problems like inferring parameters of a ball bouncing system to meet constraints (e.g. making the 3rd bounce land within 1m of a target).
- Performance worsens on harder problems like bouncing on uneven terrain, and providing more reasoning examples hurts rather than improves results.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce SimLM method to augment LLM prompts with physics simulations and self-critique steps. 
- Allow LLM to iteratively refine its reasoning by critiquing the simulation outputs resulting from its predicted parameters.
- Show providing past simulation-augmented reasoning chains as examples improves results.
- Performance scales with problem complexity and outperforms baseline coaching methods.

Main Contributions:
- Identify inability of leading LLMs to reason about basic physics problems.
- Propose SimLM method to incorporate physics simulation feedback without retraining. 
- Demonstrate improved reasoning and parameter inference on physics problems using SimLM.
- Analyze model performance as complexity increases to highlight benefits over baseline methods.
- Establish new prompting approach combining retrieval (simulation) and self-critique for LLM reasoning.

In summary, the paper shows current LLMs lack intuitive physics reasoning, and introduces a simulation-augmented prompting strategy called SimLM that can enhance their reasoning abilities on inverse physics problems without needing retraining. The benefits grow as the complexity of the physical systems increases.
