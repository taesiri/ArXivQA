# [GeoNet: Benchmarking Unsupervised Adaptation across Geographies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15443)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the robustness and transferability of vision models to novel geographic domains that are under-represented in the training data. Specifically, the paper investigates whether current state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised domain adaptation and large-scale pre-training are sufficient for addressing the domain shifts induced by geographical variations. The key hypotheses are:1. Geographic variations between train and test data induce complex domain shifts beyond just style/appearance changes, arising from differences in scene context, object design, and label distributions. 2. Current unsupervised domain adaptation methods developed on existing benchmarks may not suffice for geographic adaptation due to these complex shifts.3. Large-scale pre-training strategies using massive datasets may also have limitations in improving geographic robustness if the pre-training data itself has geographic bias.To test these hypotheses, the paper introduces a new large-scale benchmark dataset called GeoNet with images across diverse geographic regions. The authors then conduct extensive experiments with various adaptation methods and model architectures to demonstrate their limitations on GeoNet, highlighting the need for advances specifically targeted towards geographic robustness. The key research contributions are the new dataset, analysis of geographic distribution shifts, and benchmarking state-of-the-art methods to reveal their shortcomings on this practical problem.
