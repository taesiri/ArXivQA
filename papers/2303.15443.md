# [GeoNet: Benchmarking Unsupervised Adaptation across Geographies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15443)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the robustness and transferability of vision models to novel geographic domains that are under-represented in the training data. Specifically, the paper investigates whether current state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised domain adaptation and large-scale pre-training are sufficient for addressing the domain shifts induced by geographical variations. The key hypotheses are:1. Geographic variations between train and test data induce complex domain shifts beyond just style/appearance changes, arising from differences in scene context, object design, and label distributions. 2. Current unsupervised domain adaptation methods developed on existing benchmarks may not suffice for geographic adaptation due to these complex shifts.3. Large-scale pre-training strategies using massive datasets may also have limitations in improving geographic robustness if the pre-training data itself has geographic bias.To test these hypotheses, the paper introduces a new large-scale benchmark dataset called GeoNet with images across diverse geographic regions. The authors then conduct extensive experiments with various adaptation methods and model architectures to demonstrate their limitations on GeoNet, highlighting the need for advances specifically targeted towards geographic robustness. The key research contributions are the new dataset, analysis of geographic distribution shifts, and benchmarking state-of-the-art methods to reveal their shortcomings on this practical problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Introduction of a new large-scale dataset called GeoNet for studying geographic adaptation in computer vision. The dataset contains three benchmarks: GeoPlaces for scene classification, GeoImNet for object recognition, and GeoUniDA for universal domain adaptation. 2. Analysis of the domain shifts typical in geographic adaptation, identifying three key factors - context shift, design shift, and prior shift. These capture variations in scene context, object design, and label distributions across geographies.3. Extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods on GeoNet, showing their limitations in addressing geographic shifts. The paper also shows that large-scale pretraining of convolutional and transformer models does not alleviate geographic disparities.4. The paper introduces a novel problem of geographic robustness in vision systems and provides a dataset to facilitate research in this direction. It highlights that geographic shifts induce complex domain gaps that are not handled well by existing techniques. The proposed dataset and analysis of different factors causing geographic shifts lays the groundwork for developing new algorithms tailored for this practical problem.In summary, the main contribution is the formulation of geographic adaptation as an open problem in vision, along with a large-scale dataset, taxonomy of associated distribution shifts, and benchmarking of existing approaches, to motivate the development of new techniques for geographic robustness.
