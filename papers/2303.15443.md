# [GeoNet: Benchmarking Unsupervised Adaptation across Geographies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15443)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the robustness and transferability of vision models to novel geographic domains that are under-represented in the training data. Specifically, the paper investigates whether current state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised domain adaptation and large-scale pre-training are sufficient for addressing the domain shifts induced by geographical variations. The key hypotheses are:1. Geographic variations between train and test data induce complex domain shifts beyond just style/appearance changes, arising from differences in scene context, object design, and label distributions. 2. Current unsupervised domain adaptation methods developed on existing benchmarks may not suffice for geographic adaptation due to these complex shifts.3. Large-scale pre-training strategies using massive datasets may also have limitations in improving geographic robustness if the pre-training data itself has geographic bias.To test these hypotheses, the paper introduces a new large-scale benchmark dataset called GeoNet with images across diverse geographic regions. The authors then conduct extensive experiments with various adaptation methods and model architectures to demonstrate their limitations on GeoNet, highlighting the need for advances specifically targeted towards geographic robustness. The key research contributions are the new dataset, analysis of geographic distribution shifts, and benchmarking state-of-the-art methods to reveal their shortcomings on this practical problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Introduction of a new large-scale dataset called GeoNet for studying geographic adaptation in computer vision. The dataset contains three benchmarks: GeoPlaces for scene classification, GeoImNet for object recognition, and GeoUniDA for universal domain adaptation. 2. Analysis of the domain shifts typical in geographic adaptation, identifying three key factors - context shift, design shift, and prior shift. These capture variations in scene context, object design, and label distributions across geographies.3. Extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods on GeoNet, showing their limitations in addressing geographic shifts. The paper also shows that large-scale pretraining of convolutional and transformer models does not alleviate geographic disparities.4. The paper introduces a novel problem of geographic robustness in vision systems and provides a dataset to facilitate research in this direction. It highlights that geographic shifts induce complex domain gaps that are not handled well by existing techniques. The proposed dataset and analysis of different factors causing geographic shifts lays the groundwork for developing new algorithms tailored for this practical problem.In summary, the main contribution is the formulation of geographic adaptation as an open problem in vision, along with a large-scale dataset, taxonomy of associated distribution shifts, and benchmarking of existing approaches, to motivate the development of new techniques for geographic robustness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces a new large-scale dataset called GeoNet for studying geographic robustness of vision models, analyzes the complex domain shifts like context and design shift that arise in geographic adaptation, and shows that current unsupervised domain adaptation methods and large pretrained models are insufficient to address geographic bias.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper makes several important contributions to the field of unsupervised domain adaptation for geographic robustness:1. It proposes a new large-scale dataset called GeoNet for studying geographic adaptation. GeoNet contains three benchmarks - GeoPlaces for scene classification, GeoImNet for object recognition, and GeoUniDA for universal domain adaptation. With labeled images from the US and Asia, GeoNet allows examining geographic shifts unlike existing datasets that focus on other types of domain shift.2. The paper analyzes the nature of distribution shifts in geographic adaptation, identifying key factors like context shift, design shift, and prior shift that underlie the domain gaps across geographies. This provides useful insights into the unique challenges posed by geographic shifts.3. The paper benchmarked several state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation methods on GeoNet, showing their inability to sufficiently address geographic shifts. This highlights limitations of existing methods for real-world geographic robustness and motivates development of suitable techniques.4. Experiments show that large-scale pretraining with models like Vision Transformers also does not alleviate geographic disparities when fine-tuned on biased datasets. This demonstrates that geographic robustness requires going beyond advances in model architectures and training.Overall, GeoNet is the largest dataset proposed thus far for analyzing geographic adaptation, allowing the community to closely examine associated challenges. The analysis and experiments reveal limitations of existing methods for this practical problem. The paper makes a strong case that addressing geographic robustness requires novel algorithms beyond existing techniques successful on other shifts like style or appearance variation. This work identifies an important direction for future research towards fair and inclusive vision systems.
