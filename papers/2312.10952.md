# [Soft Alignment of Modality Space for End-to-end Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10952)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- End-to-end speech translation (ST) aims to translate speech directly to text, but struggles with the modality gap between speech and text representations. 
- Hard alignment methods like contrastive learning can bridge this gap but harm machine translation (MT) performance by disrupting the text space.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce soft alignment (S-Align) to align modality spaces without compromising individual spaces.
- Use adversarial training with a modal network to classify representations and make it struggle, fostering alignment.
- Enhance this with a continuous prediction space using mix-up rather than discrete classes.

Contributions:
- Propose S-Align method to modulate gap while preserving quality of modal spaces.
- Achieve superior MT and ST results to hard alignment methods on MuST-C.
- Accomplish MT, ST and ASR tasks in one unified model, preventing wasted resources.
- Analysis shows S-Align aligns spaces effectively without disrupting text space like hard alignment.
- Losses during training confirm adversarial setup works, with spaces retaining some differences.

In summary, the paper introduces soft adversarial alignment to address modality gaps in end-to-end ST without compromising MT performance. Experiments demonstrate clear improvements, and analysis validates the approach can align representation spaces effectively.
