# [Not All Image Regions Matter: Masked Vector Quantization for   Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13607)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be: 

Existing autoregressive image generation methods do not distinguish between perceptually important and unimportant image regions when learning the discrete codebook representation in the first stage. This results in redundancy in the learned codebook, which decreases image generation quality and speed. The authors hypothesize that masking perceptually unimportant regions before quantization and only modeling the important regions in the second autoregressive stage will improve image generation quality and efficiency.

To test this, the authors propose a novel two-stage image generation framework consisting of:

1) Masked Quantization VAE (MQ-VAE) that adaptively masks unimportant regions before vector quantization to learn a more compact codebook focused on important features.

2) Stackformer that efficiently predicts both the discrete code and position for the next important region using transformers, allowing faster sampling.

The experiments validate that this approach improves generation quality and speed over previous state-of-the-art autoregressive models across unconditional, class-conditional, and text-conditional image generation tasks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that distinguishing between perceptually important and unimportant regions when learning the discrete representation, and only modeling the important regions autoregressively, will improve image generation compared to prior works that treat all regions equally. The proposed MQ-VAE and Stackformer framework tests this hypothesis.
