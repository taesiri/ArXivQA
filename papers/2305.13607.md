# [Not All Image Regions Matter: Masked Vector Quantization for   Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13607)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be: 

Existing autoregressive image generation methods do not distinguish between perceptually important and unimportant image regions when learning the discrete codebook representation in the first stage. This results in redundancy in the learned codebook, which decreases image generation quality and speed. The authors hypothesize that masking perceptually unimportant regions before quantization and only modeling the important regions in the second autoregressive stage will improve image generation quality and efficiency.

To test this, the authors propose a novel two-stage image generation framework consisting of:

1) Masked Quantization VAE (MQ-VAE) that adaptively masks unimportant regions before vector quantization to learn a more compact codebook focused on important features.

2) Stackformer that efficiently predicts both the discrete code and position for the next important region using transformers, allowing faster sampling.

The experiments validate that this approach improves generation quality and speed over previous state-of-the-art autoregressive models across unconditional, class-conditional, and text-conditional image generation tasks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that distinguishing between perceptually important and unimportant regions when learning the discrete representation, and only modeling the important regions autoregressively, will improve image generation compared to prior works that treat all regions equally. The proposed MQ-VAE and Stackformer framework tests this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It points out that existing codebook learning for autoregressive image generation ignores distinguishing the perceptual importance of different image regions. This brings redundancy that degrades generation quality and decreases generation speed.

2. It proposes a novel two-stage generation framework called MQ-VAE + Stackformer to address this issue:

- MQ-VAE incorporates an adaptive mask module to mask unimportant regions before quantization and an adaptive de-mask module to recover the original features after quantization. This removes redundancy in the codebook.

- Stackformer efficiently predicts the combination of codes and their positions using two transformers - one for code prediction and one for position prediction. 

3. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. It achieves state-of-the-art results on unconditional, class-conditional and text-conditional image generation benchmarks while being faster than previous autoregressive models.

In summary, the key contribution is a new masked vector quantization method and transformer-based architecture that focuses on modeling only perceptually important image regions for improved quality and efficiency in autoregressive image generation.
