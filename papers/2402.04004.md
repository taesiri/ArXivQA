# [Understanding the Effect of Noise in LLM Training Data with Algorithmic   Chains of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04004)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Chain of thought (CoT) prompting improves large language model (LLM) performance on reasoning tasks. However, CoT data, whether model-generated or from the internet, often contains irrelevant or inconsistent steps (noise). 
- Little is known about how different types and amounts of noise in CoT training data impact downstream task performance. Studying this is important for best practices in data filtering.

Methods
- Develop a framework called Traced Integer (TInt) to generate customizable, noisy algorithmic CoT traces for arithmetic functions. 
- Define two main types of noise:
  - Static: Local noise applied after trace generation. Models errors in reasoning with local effects.
  - Dynamic: Global noise that propagates through the trace as it accumulates, affecting all later steps. Models reasoning missteps with cascading effects.
- Fine-tune LLMs on noisy algorithmic traces for addition, median-finding etc. Vary noise type, intensity and dataset contamination level.
- Prompt LLMs with a few noisy traces as examples and test performance.

Key Results
- Fine-tuned models are extremely robust even to very high levels of static noise, but far more sensitive to smaller amounts of dynamic noise.
- Prompted models exhibit similar trends but are overall more sensitive to both static and dynamic noise compared to fine-tuning.
- even when all traces contain noise, training with slightly noisy CoT is better than no CoT.

Main Contributions
1. TInt framework to generate customizable noisy chains of thought.
2. Quantitative study showing robustness of CoT learning to static noise, and sensitivity to dynamic noise. 
3. Implications for best practices in filtering internet-sourced or model-generated training data, emphasizing removal of destructive dynamic noise.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the effect of different types and amounts of noise in algorithmic chain of thought training data on model performance, finding models are robust to high levels of static noise but more sensitive to lower levels of dynamic noise.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The TInt framework for flexibly tracing and noising arbitrary python functions over integers. This allows for customizable generation of algorithmic chain of thought (CoT) with controlled amounts and types of noise.

2. An analysis studying the performance of models fine-tuned and prompted on noiseless and noised algorithmic CoT. Key findings are that CoT significantly improves robustness to noise compared to no CoT, and that models are extremely robust to high levels of static/local noise but more sensitive to lower levels of dynamic/global noise. 

3. A discussion of implications for training large language models on natural language CoT, emphasizing the importance of removing samples with destructive dynamic noise while allowing samples with localized static noise.

The paper introduces the TInt framework to generate customizable algorithmic chains of thought in order to study the effect of different types of noise on LLM performance during fine-tuning and prompting. The key research questions studied relate to how noise in CoT training data affects model task performance, and how it affects different training regimes like pretraining, fine-tuning, and prompting. The paper evaluates static and dynamic noise and their relative impacts. Overall, the core focus is on understanding noise robustness in algorithmic CoT and the implications for training large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a Traced Integer (TInt) framework to generate customizable noisy execution traces. How does controlling the visibility of different parts of the full trace allow investigating the trade-offs between more or less detailed chain of thought? What are some ways the flexibility of this framework could be further leveraged?

2. The paper defines static noise and dynamic noise as two distinct types of noise injected into the algorithmic chain of thought. How do these noise types relate to real-world noise encountered in natural language reasoning chains? What other types of noise could be productively studied?  

3. When studying the impact of noise on fine-tuning, the paper finds extreme robustness to static noise but sensitivity to even low levels of dynamic noise. Why does this difference in robustness occur? How do you expect scale (model size) would impact this?

4. For prompted models, why does the paper observe higher overall sensitivity to noise of all kinds compared to fine-tuned models? How do you think prompting on more complex, decomposable tasks would compare?

5. The style of chain of thought used in the experiments only outputs variable value changes. How could the impacts of different chain of thought verbosity be studied by controlling trace visibility? What potential benefits exist for more detailed traces?

6. The integer sampling method is found to significantly impact model length generalization capability. What other data generation choices could improve length generalization? Can good length generalization be achieved without chain of thought?

7. The paper hypothesizes models correct local errors by attending to multiple steps, some of which may be noisy. What experiments could provide more direct evidence for this ability? Are current attention mechanisms in transformers sufficient?

8. For tasks like median finding, could performance on noised chain of thought be improved by handling complex subroutines like division via learned tool usage instead of treating them as atomic? What challenges exist in learning executable tool usage?

9. What sorts of confusion do models exhibit when failing on noised algorithmic chain of thought? Do they tend to hallucinate new computation steps or struggle to copy inputs correctly?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on algorithmic reasoning. How could the impacts of noise in chain of thought be studied for more complex, compositional tasks? What new challenges arise when branching beyond arithmetic operations?
