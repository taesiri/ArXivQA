# [Adaptive Confidence Threshold for ByteTrack in Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01650)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an adaptive confidence threshold method for the ByteTrack algorithm to improve multi-object tracking performance. ByteTrack extends the SORT tracker by using two sets of object detections - high and low confidence detections which are associated with tracks in two stages. However, ByteTrack relies on a predefined fixed threshold to classify high and low confidence detections which limits performance when scenes change. To address this, the authors propose an adaptive threshold selection approach that analyzes the distribution of confidence scores from the object detector and identifies the steepest drop point to differentiate high and low confidence detections. Experiments on MOT16, MOT17 and MOT20 datasets demonstrate that the proposed adaptive method achieves similar performance to ByteTrack without needing to manually tune the threshold for each sequence. Key benefits are better generalization capability and avoiding performance loss when scene conditions vary. The adaptive threshold is computed efficiently without compromising run-time. In summary, the adaptive confidence threshold provides improved, robust and automated threshold selection for ByteTrack while maintaining its speed and simplicity.
