# [Patch-Craft Self-Supervised Training for Correlated Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09919)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we train an image denoiser in a self-supervised manner when the noise model is unknown and the noise is correlated?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By constructing artificial training targets via patch matching within bursts of noisy images, we can train an effective denoiser without access to clean target images or knowledge of the noise model.

In particular, the paper proposes a framework called "Patch-Craft Self-Supervised Training" that:

- Uses bursts of noisy images as input, with no need for ground truth clean images.

- Creates artificial target images via patch matching and stitching patches from the burst frames.

- Analyzes the target noise statistically and excludes dependent image pairs to improve training. 

- Demonstrates superior denoising performance compared to other self-supervised methods on synthetic and real image noise.

So in summary, the central research question is how to do self-supervised denoising training on correlated noise without clean targets or noise models. And the key hypothesis is that the proposed patch-craft framework can effectively solve this problem.
