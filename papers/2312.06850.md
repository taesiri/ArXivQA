# [NDELS: A Novel Approach for Nighttime Dehazing, Low-Light Enhancement,   and Light Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06850)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper tackles the challenge of enhancing the visual quality of hazy nighttime images captured under low-light conditions. Such images suffer from degradations like non-uniform illumination, texture blurring, glow effects, color distortion, noise, and poor visibility due to thick haze, which limits their usefulness for computer vision applications. While methods exist for dehazing daytime images, they perform poorly on nighttime hazy images. Prior nighttime dehazing methods also have limitations in terms of noise amplification, incomplete dehazing, and glow removal.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel end-to-end deep learning based method called NDELS (Nighttime Dehazing, Enhancement and Light Suppression) to address this problem. NDELS has three main components:

1) A low-light module based on attention guided multi-scale fusion to selectively brighten dark regions and expose haze while avoiding over-enhancement of bright areas. 

2) A dehazing module built on a Res2Net encoder-decoder network with residual channel attention blocks to remove haze and sharpen edges.

3) An extended multi-scale Retinex module to refine colors and enhance visual quality.

The modules are trained on a novel synthetic dataset generated by adding haze to day and night image pairs obtained from a webcam dataset. This allows the network to learn nighttime dehazing effectively.

Main Contributions:

1) First end-to-end learning based method designed specifically for complete nighttime hazy image enhancement.

2) A new synthetic training data generation strategy crucial for handling light effects.  

3) Extensive experiments showing NDELS outperforms state-of-the-art in quantitative metrics and visual quality over diverse real and synthetic datasets. It effectively suppresses light effects while enhancing visibility and details.

4) Demonstration of improved object detection on real-world data processed by NDELS, showing its practical applicability.

In summary, the paper presents a holistic nighttime hazy image enhancement solution that sets a new state-of-the-art for this challenging problem. The method has advantages over prior arts in terms of visual quality, glow reduction and completeness of dehazing.
