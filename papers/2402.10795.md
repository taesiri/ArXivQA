# [Diversified Ensembling: An Experiment in Crowdsourced Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10795)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional crowdsourcing platforms for machine learning like Kaggle have some limitations: they don't optimally direct participants' efforts, and don't provide mechanisms to identify or fix issues of model unfairness or bias. Specifically, only one team "wins" by having the single best performing model, rather than combining strengths of different teams. And there are no incentives to identify or improve performance on subgroups.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors implement an alternate crowdsourcing framework proposed in prior work, which has competitors submit (g,h) pairs - a group indicator function g and hypothesis/model h. If h has lower error than the current global model f when restricted to group g, then h replaces f on g via ensembling. 
- This allows participants to specialize and improve model performance on subgroups. It also better combines multiple participants' strengths via ensembling.

Contributions:
- First medium-scale implementation of this framework, with 46 teams in a competition to predict income.
- Analysis of teams' approaches: most teams specialized on subgroups, primarily using contextual knowledge and manual examination. The final global model outperformed all individual team models.
- Designed and built a novel system architecture using GitHub for crowdsourcing competitions. Documents lessons learned for usability, scaling, and security.
- Generated a dataset of ~7000 (g,h) pairs that may be useful for further research in fairness or ensemble methods.

In summary, this paper demonstrates via empirical analysis that this alternate crowdsourcing framework allows participants to specialize their efforts, enables explicit mechanisms for improving subgroup performance, and produces an accurate ensembled model - addressing limitations of traditional platforms. The authors contribute the first real-world case study of this method, a novel system to host such competitions, and analysis to guide future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents an empirical analysis of a crowdsourced machine learning framework where competitors submit models for subgroups of the data distribution in order to improve an overall global model, demonstrating the efficacy of ensembling and competitor specialization as well as detailing the software architecture developed to host such competitions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an empirical analysis of a crowdsourced machine learning framework proposed in prior theoretical work. Specifically, the paper:

1) Implements a platform and runs a medium-scale competition with 46 teams to evaluate the framework, which allows competitors to make specialized improvements on subgroups rather than just overall model accuracy.

2) Analyzes the approaches taken by competitors, finding that most teams specialized their efforts on subgroups, often leveraging contextual knowledge of the task, and that the final crowdsourced model outperformed all individual team's models. 

3) Discusses the system architecture and platform design necessary to operationalize such competitions, including security protections, lessons learned about usability and incentives, and analysis of potential denial of service attacks.

4) Releases a dataset of nearly 7,000 submitted model-group pairs from competitors for further research, arguing they may be useful for benchmarking fairness approaches or analyzing ensemble methods.

In summary, the key contribution is an empirical evaluation and analysis of a novel crowdsourcing framework through an implemented system and competition, providing both practical and research-focused insights.

It examines how allowing participants to specialize and focus their efforts, both in service of fairness and to cater to their expertise, can be beneficial. Key aspects analyzed include the approaches employed by student participants, the novel system architecture developed to host the competition, security protections implemented, and lessons learned regarding incentive design and usability.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an alternate crowdsourcing framework for machine learning models compared to traditional platforms like Kaggle. What are some key differences in the framework proposed versus the Kaggle competition format? How does explicitly ensembling competitor's models help address limitations of the Kaggle format?

2. The paper emphasizes the ability of competitors to specialize and focus their efforts on subgroups of the data distribution. In what ways can this allow for more diverse participation and leverage different expertise compared to traditional crowdsourcing platforms? Provide some examples of how competitors specialized in the study.

3. The paper introduces a novel software architecture and platform for hosting such crowdsourcing competitions, utilizing GitHub for authentication and competitor interactions. What are some advantages of designing the platform in this way compared to a traditional web application stack? How does the use of Docker containers increase security?

4. What practical challenges arose in the study related to competitors' approaches and participation? How might the competition format or instructions be altered to mitigate some of these issues in the future?

5. The paper observes that the final global model outperformed all individual competitor's models. Why is this only possible because of the explicit ensembling mechanism in the competition format? How does this demonstrate effectively leveraging the efforts of multiple teams?  

6. Discuss the repair procedure introduced that allows the global model to monotonicially decrease error on previously identified groups after new updates. Why is this an important mechanism and how does it provide formal optimality guarantees?

7. The dataset of competitor's model submissions itself may be of independent interest. What are some potential use cases or applications for this dataset discussed in the paper? In what ways could it be used to evaluate or improve multi-group or expert learning techniques?

8. What are some limitations of the crowdsourcing framework proposed? When might alternate fairness definitions or approaches be more suitable than the minimax error notion considered here?  

9. The paper emphasizes difficulties competitors faced in identifying promising subgroups to make improvements on, especially later in the competition. What approaches did they use and how might the competition format be altered to incentivize continued engagement?

10. What lessons were learned related to the software infrastructure and competitor interactions with the platform? How could the daily submission process or threshold for update acceptance be adjusted to improve usability?
