# [IITK at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Hierarchical Embeddings for Detection of   Persuasion Techniques in Memes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04520)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on SemEval-2024 Task 4 which involves detecting persuasion techniques used in memes spread across social media in English, Arabic, Bulgarian and North Macedonian languages. 
- Specifically, the task consists of 3 subtasks: (1) hierarchical multi-label classification using only text (2) hierarchical multi-label classification using text and image (3) binary classification on whether persuasion technique is present using text and image

Proposed Solution:
- For subtask 1, the paper proposes an ensemble of HypEmo and a multi-task learning model leveraging class definitions 
- HypEmo uses pre-trained hyperbolic label embeddings to capture hierarchical relationships between classes
- The multi-task model incorporates masked language modeling and predicting whether a concatenated class definition matches the actual definition
- For subtask 2, CLIP image embeddings are combined with HypEmo text embeddings before classification 
- For subtask 3, an ensemble of DistilBERT and CNN extracts text and image features respectively, which are classified by a linear layer 

Main Contributions:
- Novel ensemble approach combining HypEmo and multi-task definition modeling for hierarchical meme classification
- Integration of CLIP visual features with HypEmo text embeddings for multi-modal classification
- Binary meme classification via ensemble of DistilBERT and CNN for text and images
- Experiments conducted on English and 3 other languages, with the proposed approaches outperforming baselines
- Detailed analysis provided on model performances across different persuasion techniques and languages

In summary, the paper introduces an effective methodology for detecting persuasion techniques in multilingual multi-modal memes by combining state-of-the-art models in an ensemble approach tailored to the task requirements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an ensemble of hyperbolic embeddings and definition-based multi-task learning approaches for hierarchical multi-label classification and binary classification of persuasion techniques in memes using textual and visual content.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a novel approach to meme classification that integrates two key frameworks:

1) HypEmo, which utilizes pre-trained label hyperbolic embeddings to effectively capture hierarchical structures in a taxonomy of persuasion techniques.

2) A multi-task learning model focused on emotion definition modeling, which incorporates auxiliary tasks like masked language modeling and class definition prediction to enhance understanding of emotional concepts relevant to persuasion techniques. 

The paper presents an ensemble approach that combines predictions from both the HypEmo and definition-based models to leverage their complementary strengths and enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of meme classification outcomes. This integrated methodology drawing upon hyperbolic embeddings and emotion definition modeling seems to be the key novelty introduced.

The paper also explores augmentations like adding CLIP embeddings to handle multimodal visual+textual content in memes and transfer learning from DistilBERT/CNNs for the binary classification subtask. But the main contribution appears to be the proposed HypEmo + definition-based ensemble approach for hierarchical multi-label meme classification.

The paper focuses on detecting persuasion techniques in memes using both textual and visual content. It proposes an ensemble approach combining HypEmo, CDP, and CLIP for hierarchical multi-label classification across three subtasks. Key methods employed include hyperbolic embeddings, class definition modeling, and transfer learning from pretrained models. The task involves multilingual multimodal propaganda detection for languages like English, Arabic, Bulgarian and North Macedonian.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using an ensemble of HypEmo and a multi-task learning model focused on emotion definition modeling. Can you explain in more detail how these two models are combined and the rationale behind using an ensemble approach? 

2. For the HypEmo model, the DAG is transformed into a tree structure by duplicating children with multiple parents. What is the impact of this transformation on the embedding space? How does it affect the classification of persuasion techniques?

3. The paper mentions fine-tuning hyperparameters when combining predictions from the HypEmo and definition-based models. What hyperparameters were tuned and what was the motivation behind tuning them? 

4. For subtask 2, CLIP embeddings are used to capture visual features. What modifications were made to the HypEmo architecture to incorporate CLIP? How effective was CLIP in improving performance?

5. The results show minimal differences between using CLIP vs not using CLIP in subtask 2. What are some possible reasons for why the visual cues did not help much? How can the impact of visual cues be improved?

6. For subtask 3, a weighted binary cross-entropy loss is used to handle class imbalance. Can you explain this formulation? What changes would an alternative loss such as Focal Loss bring?

7. The paper concludes visual cues are only helpful for specific input-output pairs. Based on the analysis, for what types of techniques were visual cues most relevant? How can we determine this relevance apriori?

8. What approaches were taken to handle the multilingual setting since models were only trained on English data? What are some limitations of these approaches? 

9. The ensemble approach takes the union of predicted labels from different models. What other ensemble techniques like stacking or voting could have been considered? What are the tradeoffs?

10. How were the thresholds for making final predictions set in the Z-score analysis? What impact would changing these thresholds have on precision vs recall?
