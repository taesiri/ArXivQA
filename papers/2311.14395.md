# [Multi-scale Semantic Correlation Mining for Visible-Infrared Person   Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14395)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework called Multi-Scale Semantic Correlation Mining Network (MSCMNet) for visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID). The key innovation is exploring implicit correlations of semantic information across modalities and scales to extract comprehensive identity-discriminative features. Specifically, a Quadruple-Stream Feature Extractor (QFE) is designed to capture diverse semantic information using non-shared network streams and data augmentation. A Multi-Scale Information Correlation Mining Block (MIMB) is then proposed to reduce information loss and mine semantic correlations between shallow and deep network features across scales using a novel attention-based structure. Furthermore, a Quadruple Center Triplet Loss function is introduced to handle semantic discrepancies and enforce inter-identity constraints. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component. Additional visualizations also show the model's ability to focus on identity-discriminative regions and achieve compact intra-class feature distributions. The exploration of multi-scale semantic correlations is the main strength of this work.

 This paper proposes a Multi-scale Semantic Correlation Mining Network (MSCMNet) to explore semantic feature correlations across multiple scales for visible-infrared person re-identification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel deep learning framework called Multi-scale Semantic Correlation Mining Network (MSCMNet) to extract comprehensive modality features for visible-infrared person re-identification. 

2. It designs two key components in MSCMNet: 

(a) The Quadruple-Stream Feature Extractor (QFE) to extract features from multiple semantic dimensions using channel-level and global-level data augmentation. 

(b) The Multi-scale Information Correlation Mining Block (MIMB) to explore semantic correlations across multiple scales and reduce information loss during feature extraction.

3. It introduces a new loss function called Quadruple Center Triplet Loss to handle semantic information discrepancy in the extracted cross-modal features.

4. Extensive experiments show that MSCMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three VI-ReID datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of exploring multi-scale semantic correlations for discriminative feature learning.
