## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes LoGiPT, a novel large language model designed to directly emulate the reasoning process of logical solvers for deductive reasoning tasks. The authors first reveal the invisible reasoning steps executed by an off-the-shelf logical solver like pyke on training data from two deductive reasoning datasets - ProofWriter and PrOntoQA. They modify the solver code to explicitly output intermediate actions like rule applications and implied facts. Then they use this revealed reasoning data to construct an instruction-tuning dataset containing natural language premises/rules and corresponding symbolic reasoning steps in four conversational turns between a human and the model. After filtering out invalid cases, they fine-tune open-source language models like Vicuna and CodeLlama on this dataset to create LoGiPT models that can act as deductive solvers. At test time, LoGiPT directly generates all implied facts from a question's context and checks if the query matches any implied fact to determine the answer, avoiding errors from natural language to symbolic parsing. Experiments show LoGiPT models significantly outperform the state-of-the-art solver-augmented LMs like LogicLM as well as competitive LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4, demonstrating the efficacy of directly learning reasoning processes from solvers.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper introduces LoGiPT, a novel language model designed to mimic the reasoning process of logical solvers to solve deductive reasoning tasks. Current solver-augmented language models parse natural language questions into symbolic logic representations and feed them to external logical solvers. However, parsing errors inevitably cause reasoning failures. To address this, the authors propose revealing and formalizing the normally invisible reasoning steps of solvers to create an instruction-tuning dataset. They filter out invalid syntax cases and refine the reasoning chains into an interpretable 4-turn dialog format. Using this data, they fine-tune open-source LMs like Vicuna and CodeLlama into LoGiPT, which can directly emulate a solver's deductive reasoning and bypass parsing errors. Experiments on two deductive reasoning datasets show LoGiPT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solver-augmented LMs. It also surpasses prompting methods on competitive LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4. Analysis shows the symbolic reasoning format is crucial for performance. Overall, the work introduces a novel technique to distill the reasoning capability of logical solvers into LMs, enabling them to act as deductive solvers themselves.

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to empower language models to directly learn and emulate the reasoning process of logical solvers in order to improve their performance on deductive reasoning tasks. 

The key points are:

- Current solver-augmented language models rely on parsing natural language questions into symbolic logic representations as input for the solver. However, parsing errors inevitably lead to failure in executing the logical solver. 

- This paper proposes LoGiPT, a novel language model designed to mimic the reasoning process of logical solvers. It does this by revealing and formalizing the invisible symbolic reasoning steps of solvers to create an instruction-tuning dataset.

- LoGiPT is fine-tuned on this dataset to acquire reasoning skills similar to actual solvers. It can then directly act as a deductive solver, generating all implied facts from premises and rules to determine the truth value of a query.

- This approach bypasses the issue of parsing errors by learning to adhere to strict solver syntax and grammar. Experiments show LoGiPT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on deductive reasoning tasks.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that language models can learn to perform logical reasoning by directly imitating and being fine-tuned on the symbolic reasoning process of deductive solvers, bypassing the need for error-prone natural language to symbolic parsing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing LoGiPT, a novel language model that can directly emulate the reasoning process of logical solvers for deductive reasoning tasks. Specifically:

- The paper constructs an instruction-tuning dataset by revealing and formalizing the invisible symbolic reasoning steps of deductive solvers like pyke. This dataset contains natural language logical questions and corresponding symbolic reasoning chains. 

- The authors fine-tune open-source language models like Vicuna and CodeLlama on this dataset to create LoGiPT. LoGiPT can generate all implied facts from premises and rules, allowing it to determine the truth value of a logical query. 

- LoGiPT can directly act as a deductive solver, bypassing the syntax/grammar errors from natural language to symbolic language parsing that plague other solver-augmented language models.

- Experiments on two deductive reasoning datasets show LoGiPT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solver-augmented language models and competitive few-shot prompting methods on large models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing LoGiPT, a novel language model trained to emulate deductive solvers, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on logical reasoning while avoiding syntax errors. The instruction-tuning dataset and method of distilling reasoning skills from solvers into language models is also an important contribution.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related work in logical reasoning with large language models:

- The main contribution is proposing LoGiPT, a novel language model that directly emulates the reasoning process of logical solvers to perform deductive reasoning, bypassing the need for parsing natural language into symbolic logic. This is a novel approach compared to other methods that rely on parsing or operate directly in natural language.

- Most prior work focuses on specialized module fine-tuning of LLMs or in-context learning with prompting. In contrast, this work proposes directly distilling the reasoning skills of a symbolic solver into a neural LM via instruction tuning. The instruction dataset revealing solver reasoning steps is also novel.

- This paper compares against recent state-of-the-art methods like solver-augmented LLMs (e.g. LogicLM) that parse questions into symbolic logic then invoke a solver. LoGiPT outperforms these approaches significantly, showing it can better acquire solver reasoning skills through instruction tuning rather than the pipeline approach.

- The evaluation benchmarks and comparison of open-source vs closed-source LLMs is quite comprehensive. LoGiPT outperforms the latest closed-source LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 in many cases.

- The analysis provides useful insights, like the impact of symbolic vs natural language representations in the instruction tuning data. Overall the approach seems promising.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel instruction tuning method to distill logical reasoning skills from a solver into an LM. The results demonstrate strong capabilities compared to prior state-of-the-art in deductive reasoning. The approach of directly acquiring reasoning skills rather than parsing to symbolic logic is a unique direction in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring different methods to reveal and formalize the reasoning processes of other types of solvers beyond deductive reasoning, such as satisfiability solvers, programmatic interpreters, etc. The approach proposed in this paper focuses specifically on deductive reasoning solvers, but could potentially be extended to other types of automated reasoning tools. 

- Applying the proposed approach to even larger language models beyond the 13B parameter models tested in this paper. The authors suggest that empowering models on the scale of LLMs like PaLM, Chinchilla, and GPT-4 with solver-simulated reasoning could lead to further performance improvements.

- Developing methods to enhance the transfer learning abilities between datasets constructed under different reasoning assumptions (open world vs closed world). The authors found that directly mixing the two types of data resulted in lower performance, indicating that better techniques for transfer could be beneficial.

- Exploring the potential of code foundation models like CodeLlama for logical reasoning tasks, since the version of their proposed model based on CodeLlama achieved strong results, despite having less natural language tuning.

- Experimenting with additional deductive reasoning datasets beyond the two used in this paper to further analyze the generalization capabilities.

- Investigating whether the proposed instruction-tuning approach could be combined with existing methods like module fine-tuning to create models with even stronger reasoning skills.

In summary, the main future directions are developing techniques to apply the approach to broader types of solvers and reasoning, scaling up to even larger language models, improving transfer learning, evaluating on more datasets, and combining the approach with complementary methods. Overall the authors propose interesting ways to build on this approach to continue enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models.
