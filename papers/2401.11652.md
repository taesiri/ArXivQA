# [OnDev-LCT: On-Device Lightweight Convolutional Transformers towards   federated learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11652)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across edge devices without centralizing private data. However, existing vision models like CNNs and transformers have limitations that make them inefficient for resource-constrained FL scenarios, such as large size, high computational demands, inability to handle data heterogeneity.  

- Lightweight models intended for on-device FL should balance model size, efficiency and ability to adapt to diverse data distributions across devices. But current lightweight vision models cannot achieve this effectively.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes "OnDev-LCT" - lightweight convolutional transformers optimized specifically for on-device vision tasks under limited data and resources.

- The LCT tokenizer leverages efficient depthwise separable convolutions in residual linear bottleneck blocks to extract local features from images.

- The LCT encoder uses multi-head self-attention to capture global representations. 

- This combination provides a balance between local feature extraction of CNNs and global modeling of transformers.

Main Contributions:
- Novel lightweight convolutional transformer architecture specially designed for on-device scenarios.

- Integrates strengths of CNNs and transformers via efficient convolutions for local features and self-attention for global representations.

- Outperforms existing lightweight models on multiple image classification datasets with fewer parameters and computations.

- More robust to data heterogeneity in federated learning, handles diversity across edge devices better.

- Suitable for on-device vision applications with limited local data, communication constraints.

In summary, the paper proposes OnDev-LCT, a new convolutional transformer architecture that achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and effectiveness for deploying vision models on edge devices under federated learning using limited heterogeneous data.
