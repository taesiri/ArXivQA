# [Semantic Image Synthesis with Unconditional Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14395)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Semantic image synthesis (SIS) aims to generate realistic images that match given semantic masks. This allows precise spatial control over image generation. However, existing SIS methods require large datasets of image-mask pairs for training, which are expensive and laborious to obtain. Also, changes in mask configurations necessitate full retraining of models. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a novel SIS approach that rearranges the feature maps of a pretrained unconditional generator to conform to input masks. This is done in two steps:

1. Rearranging feature maps: A "rearranger" module is trained to rearrange the intermediate feature maps of the generator according to "proxy masks". The proxy masks are obtained by clustering feature maps of random generator samples. The rearranger learns in a self-supervised manner to modify feature maps to match proxy masks of other random samples.

2. Mapping arbitrary masks to proxy masks: A "semantic mapper" is trained to convert user-provided masks into proxy masks that the generator can understand. This bridges the perception gap and allows various inputs like segmentation maps, sketches, scribbles etc.

Main Contributions:
- First SIS method that rearranges feature maps of a pretrained unconditional GAN for spatial control.
- Self-supervised training without needing actual image-mask pairs. Proxy masks derived from feature map clustering provide supervision.  
- Compatible with various inputs beyond segmentation masks like sketches, scribbles through the semantic mapper.
- Experiments validate quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing SIS techniques.
- Approach is efficient as it avoids full retraining for new mask configurations, only the semantic mapper needs to be retrained.

In summary, the key novelty is rearranging feature maps of an unconditional GAN for semantic control and the self-supervised strategy, which avoids expensive manual annotations. The semantic mapper makes the approach widely adaptable.
