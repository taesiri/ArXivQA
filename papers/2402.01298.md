# [Learning Semantic Information from Raw Audio Signal Using Both   Contextual and Phonetic Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01298)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing spoken language models (SLMs) mainly encode phonetic information in their speech representations, which limits their ability to learn semantic information effectively. Capturing both contextual and phonetic representations can potentially improve semantic learning in SLMs.

Methods:
- Proposed a framework to train SLMs using both contextual representations (lower-resolution, capturing word meanings) and phonetic representations (higher-resolution, capturing phonetic details).
- Adopted a dual-channel architecture with separate contextual and phonetic channels that interact through a heterogeneous interaction module, avoiding issues with joint input sequences.  
- Introduced two self-supervised training objectives:
  - Masked Context Reconstruction (MCR): Reconstruct quantized contextual representations.
  - Masked Context Prediction (MCP): Predict masked contextual units using unmasked phonetic units.

Results: 
- Evaluated on semantic similarity (sSIMI) metric of Zero Resource Speech Benchmark. Proposed framework achieved higher sSIMI scores than baseline BERT-small, demonstrating improved semantic learning. MCR benefited learning dataset-specific semantics while MCP gave consistently good performance.
- Additional experiments on Fluent Speech Commands dataset also showed advantages over baselines, especially for unseen utterances, confirming benefits for spoken language understanding.

Main Contributions:
- First SLM framework trained on both contextual and phonetic speech representations for improved semantic learning.  
- Dual-channel architecture more effective than joint sequence approach.
- New pretraining objectives MCR and MCP utilize both representation types to learn semantics.
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on sSIMI metric and spoken language understanding task.
