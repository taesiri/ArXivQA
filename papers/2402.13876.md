# [Scene Prior Filtering for Depth Map Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13876)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Depth map super-resolution (DSR) aims to restore a high-resolution (HR) depth map from a low-resolution (LR) input. 
- Existing guided filtering methods for DSR suffer from significant texture interference and edge inaccuracy in the filter kernels constructed from the RGB guidance image.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a Scene Prior Filtering Network (SPFNet) that utilizes surface normal and semantic priors from large-scale models to reduce texture interference and enhance edges.

- Generate normal and semantic priors from the RGB input using Omnidata and SAM models.

- Propose an All-in-one Prior Propagation (APP) module that computes similarity between the multi-modal priors and depth to attenuate interference.

- Present a One-to-one Prior Embedding (OPE) module with Mutual Guided Filtering that recursively aggregates each single-modal prior into the depth, further reducing interference and improving edges.

Main Contributions:
- Pioneer the incorporation of surface normal and semantic priors from large-scale models to address texture interference and edge inaccuracy for depth super-resolution.

- Propose the SPFNet incorporating the novel APP, OPE and Mutual Guided Filtering to recursively diminish texture interference and enhance edges.

- Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets for various upsampling factors. The model balances performance and complexity.

- Effectiveness is demonstrated for joint depth super-resolution and denoising, and on real-world data.
