## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a scalable, bottom-up and intrinsically diverse data collection method for robotics that has 2.2x higher throughput compared to traditional top-down step-by-step collection approaches. The authors collect realistic data by performing user requests within 3 office buildings using multiple embodiments (robot, human, human with tool). They release a large and diverse dataset called RoboVQA containing over 800k (video, text) pairs for visual question answering and demonstrate that models trained on all embodiments outperform robot-only models. The paper establishes benchmarks for long-horizon planning tasks with an intervention mechanism that enables performing tasks to completion with human oversight. It shows a video-conditioned model called RoboVQA-VideoCoCa trained on the dataset can perform high-level reasoning and long-horizon robot planning with lower intervention rates than baselines. The performance gaps indicate more grounded data is needed for real-world deployment, emphasizing the need for scalable collection. The work also shows video VLMs significantly outperform image VLMs, thanks to video conditioning providing finer temporal reasoning.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents RoboVQA, a large and diverse dataset for training and evaluating multimodal robotic reasoning models. The key contributions are: (1) A scalable, bottom-up data collection scheme that yields 2.2x higher throughput compared to traditional top-down step-by-step collection. Long-horizon tasks from users are collected by teleoperating robots and humans, then medium-horizon subtasks are labeled after-the-fact via crowdsourcing. (2) The release of a large cross-embodiment dataset called RoboVQA containing over 800k (video, text) pairs covering 29k unique instructions. The diversity of tasks and environments is critical for avoiding overfitting. (3) Demonstration of a video-conditioned model called RoboVQA-VideoCoCa trained on this data that exceeds baselines on robotic VQA and planning tasks. Videos give a 19% average error reduction over images. (4) Real robot evaluations with an intervention mechanism that enables performing long-horizon tasks through completion via human oversight when imperfect. This provides a deployable solution with a single performance metric. Overall, the work emphasizes the need for scalable data collection as zero-shot visual language models still fall short. The diverse RoboVQA dataset and model lay the foundations for real-world robotic reasoning.

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively collect large-scale multimodal data and develop models for performing high-level reasoning tasks with long and medium horizons in realistic settings for robotics. 

Specifically, the key questions and hypotheses explored in the paper are:

- Can they develop a more efficient, scalable, and diverse data collection scheme compared to traditional top-down step-by-step collection? Their hypothesis is that a crowd-sourced bottom-up approach where long-horizon tasks are decided by users will lead to higher throughput and more natural diversity.

- Does training multimodal models on their collected data lead to improved performance on visual reasoning tasks compared to state-of-the-art models? Their hypothesis is that current models will perform poorly on real-world visual reasoning without additional scalable data collection.

- Can they train a single model capable of general visual reasoning across a variety of grounded tasks using their dataset? Their hypothesis is that the diversity of their data will enable training a general video-conditioned model for robotics.

- Does video modeling lead to improved performance compared to image modeling? Their hypothesis is that video will be important for temporal reasoning.

- Can cheaper human embodiment data improve robot performance? Their hypothesis is that human data will transfer knowledge useful for robot tasks.

So in summary, the key research questions focus on developing more scalable multimodal data collection for robotics, training models on this data to advance real-world visual reasoning, and exploring whether factors like video, task diversity, and cross-embodiment data improve performance.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in visual question answering and robotics:

- The data collection approach is more scalable and efficient than traditional top-down step-by-step collections. By collecting long-horizon tasks and segmenting them into medium-horizon steps, they achieve higher throughput and more natural diversity compared to lab-curated datasets.

- The dataset size and diversity is substantially larger than previous robotics VQA datasets like CLEVRER and Visual Room Navigation. It contains over 800k video-text pairs across a wide variety of everyday tasks.

- They demonstrate the importance of video inputs rather than just static images for visual reasoning, with significant gains from video models. Most prior work has focused on VQA with static images.

- The model architecture leverages recent advances in large video-text models like VideoCoCa. In contrast, a lot of prior robotics VQA research uses smaller task-specific models.

- They establish new benchmarks for robotics VQA and long-horizon planning that better reflect real-world conditions compared to synthetic datasets. The intervention mechanism also enables full task completion.

- The results show there is still a large gap between current VQA models and human performance in unconstrained environments. This highlights the need for further scalable data collection compared to current datasets.

Overall, the scalable data collection, model architecture, and evaluation benchmarks push forward the state-of-the-art in applying VQA and language models to real-world robotics tasks. But the analysis also demonstrates how much room there still is for progress in this direction.
