# [Discover and Mitigate Multiple Biased Subgroups in Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12777)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Discover and Mitigate Multiple Biased Subgroups in Image Classifiers":

Problem:
- Image classifiers can perform well on average but fail on certain biased subgroups that are underrepresented in the training data. This undermines model robustness.  
- Most prior works assume only a single biased subgroup, but real-world data contains multiple biases. Identifying and mitigating multiple subgroups is important yet challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel framework called DIM (Decomposition, Interpretation and Mitigation) to discover, interpret and mitigate multiple unknown biased subgroups.

Key Ideas:
- Decompose image features into multiple directions representing subgroups using Partial Least Squares (PLS). Model training dynamics like loss are used to supervise this.  
- Identify biased subgroups by generating pseudo-subgroup labels and evaluating model performance.
- Interpret subgroups by retrieving images and generating descriptions using vision-language models.
- Mitigate biases using data-centric strategy (filtering extra data) and model-centric strategy ( annotate data with pseudo-subgroup labels for debiasing methods like group DRO).

Contributions:  
- Formulate the problem of discovering and mitigating multiple unknown biased subgroups.
- Propose the DIM framework to address this using supervised decomposition, interpretation and bias mitigation strategies. 
- Demonstrate effectiveness over baselines in discovering and mitigating multiple biases on CIFAR-100, Breeds and Hard ImageNet datasets. Uncover new failure modes in Hard ImageNet.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions in identifying multiple subgroup biases, interpreting them and leveraging discovered subgroups to enhance model robustness. The DIM framework effectively tackles key limitations of prior arts.
