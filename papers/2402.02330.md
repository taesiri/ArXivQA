# [Enhance Reasoning for Large Language Models in the Game Werewolf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02330)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have limitations in complex reasoning and planning tasks that require logical analysis and domain-specific knowledge. 
- Most LLM-based agents avoid fine-tuning on task-specific data to preserve the model's generality, but this makes it difficult to utilize existing domain data/expertise.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a framework that integrates LLMs with an external "Thinker" module to enhance reasoning capabilities.
- Distinctly separate reasoning tasks into two systems based on dual process theory:
    - LLMs handle intuitive System-1 tasks like NLP. 
    - Thinker handles logical System-2 tasks requiring analysis and planning.
- Establish communication between LLM and Thinker via language features and instructions.
- Thinker directly harnesses knowledge from databases and employs imitation learning, reinforcement learning, etc.

Contributions:
- Demonstrate framework in complex 9-player Werewolf game that demands advanced reasoning and NLP.
- Introduce communication protocol between LLM and Thinker.
- Train Thinker module using 18,800 human game sessions and reinforcement learning.  
- Experiments show framework effectively enhances LLM's deductive reasoning, speech generation, and overall game performance.
- A 6B LLM fine-tuned on data surpasses GPT-4 when integrated with Thinker.
- Release largest dataset of 18,800 game sessions for social deduction games.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel framework to integrate LLMs with an external reasoning module called Thinker to enhance performance on complex tasks, and demonstrates this effectively in the Werewolf game while releasing a large new dataset.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates large language models with an external "Thinker" module to enhance reasoning capabilities, showcased in the complex social deduction game Werewolf where the Thinker handles complex logical analysis and strategic planning while the LLM focuses on intuitive language tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing an external Thinker module to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM agents. The Thinker specializes in complex logical analysis and strategic planning tasks (System-2 reasoning) while the LLM handles intuitive thinking and natural language tasks (System-1 reasoning).

2. Applying the framework to the game of Werewolf which requires dual reasoning systems. This includes designing communication protocols between the LLM and Thinker, training the Thinker module using imitation learning and reinforcement learning, and collecting a dataset of 18,800 Werewolf game sessions.

3. Experimental results demonstrating that integrating the Thinker module substantially improves the reasoning and generation capabilities compared to standalone LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Additionally, fine-tuning a smaller 6B LLM to align better with human preferences allows it to surpass GPT-4 when integrated with the Thinker.

4. Releasing the dataset of 18,800 Werewolf game sessions, which is stated to be the largest dataset for social deduction games.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating an approach to enhance LLM reasoning by integrating an external strategic planning and analysis module specialized for complex reasoning tasks.

The paper proposes an external "Thinker" module to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents, separating reasoning tasks into intuitive System-1 tasks handled by the LLM and complex System-2 tasks handled by the Thinker. It demonstrates this framework on the Werewolf game, which requires both natural language processing and strategic reasoning. Key methods include extracting language features to communicate between the LLM and Thinker, training the Thinker module with imitation learning and reinforcement learning, and generating logical speeches guided by the Thinker's strategic instructions. The goal is to augment LLMs with better reasoning abilities while preserving their generality.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes separating reasoning tasks into System-1 and System-2 based on dual process theory. What are some key differences between System-1 and System-2 reasoning and why is this separation useful?

2. The Thinker module is optimized using imitation learning and reinforcement learning. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using each of these approaches? How do they complement each other?

3. The paper uses structured language features and instructions to enable communication between the Listeners, Thinkers, and Presenters. What are some limitations of this approach and how could it be made more flexible and generalizable? 

4. What are some key challenges in training the Thinker module using reinforcement learning and how does the paper address issues like illegal actions and speeches that can arise during exploration?

5. The paper demonstrates the approach on the complex game of Werewolf. What aspects of Werewolf make it a good testbed environment? How could the approach be extended to other strategic reasoning tasks?

6. A key contribution is the collection of a large dataset of over 18,000 Werewolf game sessions. What are some ways this data could be utilized beyond training the Thinker? What other potential applications does it enable?

7. The paper shows performance improvements over GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. What are some ways the Thinker framework could be used to improve reasoning in even larger language models like GPT-5 and beyond?

8. The paper uses a 6B parameter model for the Listener and Presenter. How does model scale impact overall performance and how could much larger models potentially be leveraged?

9. The paper focuses on win rate and behavior scores for evaluation. What are some other metrics that could be used to provide more insight into the approach's reasoning abilities?

10. What forms could the Thinker module take beyond the neural network architecture used in the paper? Could other reasoning methods like logic programming, theorem proving, etc. be integrated?
