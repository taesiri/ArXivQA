## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the limited information provided in the LaTeX document, there does not appear to be a clear research question or hypothesis stated. The document contains a title "ConAdv", author name "lucasliunju", date "October 2021", and one section titled "Introduction", but no actual introductory text or content. Without more context or information about the intended research focus and goals, it's not possible to determine a specific research question or hypothesis from this template document alone. The section title "Introduction" suggests the paper is intended to introduce some topic, but the topic itself and the research goals are not specified.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the limited LaTeX code provided, there is not enough information to determine the main contribution of the paper. The title indicates it is potentially about something called "ConAdv", but there is no abstract, introduction, or body text to elaborate on what this refers to or what the key ideas are. The paper contains only a title, author, date, and empty introduction section. Without more context or content, I cannot infer the main contribution or topics covered in the paper. More information about the actual contents and focus of the paper would be needed to summarize its core contribution.
