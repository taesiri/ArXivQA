# [Robustness-Congruent Adversarial Training for Secure Machine Learning   Model Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17390)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Machine learning models need frequent updates to improve their performance by incorporating new architectures and data. However, model updates can cause "negative flips (NFs)", where samples correctly classified by the old model get misclassified by the new model, causing a regression in users' perceived accuracy. 

The authors show that model updates can also cause "robustness negative flips (RNFs)", where adversarial examples that did not fool the old model are now able to fool the updated model. This causes a regression in the perceived security against adversarial attacks.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a new defense called "Robustness-Congruent Adversarial Training (RCAT)". The key ideas are:

1) Use adversarial training to improve robustness to adversarial examples. 

2) Add a penalty term to the loss function that forces the updated model to produce similar outputs to the old model on samples that were robust to attacks against the old model. This reduces RNFs.

3) Allow distilling from an improved "source" model over the whole input space, while enforcing old model's behavior only where no adversarial examples existed against old model. This retains accuracy/robustness while reducing NFs/RNFs.

4) Theoretical analysis shows RCAT provides a statistically consistent estimator without affecting convergence rate.

Contributions:
1) First work to show model updates can worsen robustness by increasing RNFs.

2) Propose RCAT defense to reduce NFs and RNFs during model updates.

3) Demonstrate RCAT's improved tradeoff between accuracy, robustness and regression mitigation over baselines.

4) Provide theoretical justification that adding non-regression constraints maintains consistency.

In experiments, RCAT is shown to find a better accuracy-robustness tradeoff during model updates compared to baselines, while minimizing the sum of NFs and RNFs.
