## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "Foundation Models for Decision Making: Problems, Methods, and Opportunities":

The paper provides an overview of foundation models, which are pretrained machine learning models that can be adapted to downstream tasks through transfer learning. The authors focus on the use of foundation models for decision making, where the model is given a context and must choose an appropriate action. The main method discussed is interactive learning, where the model is iteratively trained through interactions with a human who provides demonstrations, critiques, and corrections. This allows the model to learn a policy for selecting good actions in a given context. The human feedback helps align the model with human preferences and values. Various techniques for interactive learning are reviewed, including learning from human preferences, learning from critiques, and learning from corrections. The interactive learning paradigm allows foundation models to be adapted for decision making in ways that incorporate human guidance.
