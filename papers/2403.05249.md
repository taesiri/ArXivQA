# [On Representing Electronic Wave Functions with Sign Equivariant Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05249)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent neural network models have shown impressive accuracy in approximating electronic wave functions for quantum chemistry calculations. However, these models typically use a permutation-equivariant network followed by a permutation-antisymmetric operation to enforce electron exchange symmetry. This makes them computationally expensive. The paper explores an alternative approach of using sign equivariant neural networks, which operate on antisymmetric inputs first before applying the network, to reduce computational cost. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose using sign equivariant neural networks, which preserve the input's antisymmetry in the output, to represent electronic wave functions. They introduce two approaches: (1) Implicit construction by combining simple odd operations like tanh activations and linear layers without bias. (2) Explicit enforcement of oddness by computing the function on the input and its negative and subtracting. This is applied on top of a neural network.  

Theoretical Analysis:
The authors prove mathematically that such odd sign equivariant networks amount to just a Jastrow factor, which is a commonly used symmetric multiplicative factor. So these cannot represent anything more than what Jastrow factors already capture. They also show that the odd functions cannot add any new zeros to the wave function, so cannot create cusps.

Experiments:
Empirically, the odd networks provide small improvements over a linear baseline for simple molecules like LiH and Li2 when combined with CASSCF wave functions from quantum chemistry. But they fail to improve upon the baseline neural network wavefunction (FermiNet) and often cause optimization difficulties and degradation in larger systems.

Conclusion: 
Both theoretically and empirically, the work finds little evidence for advantages of using sign equivariant networks or odd functions for representing electronic wave functions over existing methods. The functions turn out to be limited to Jastrow factors and do not expand representational power.
