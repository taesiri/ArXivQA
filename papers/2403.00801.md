# [Self-Retrieval: Building an Information Retrieval System with One Large   Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00801)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Self-Retrieval: Building an Information Retrieval System with One Large Language Model":

Problem:
- Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems are isolated from large language models (LLMs) and cannot fully meet their requirements for retrieval. They lack deep interaction with LLMs and cannot leverage the powerful semantic representation abilities of LLMs. 

- Existing works that enhance IR systems with LLMs only make limited improvements to components of the systems rather than fully integrating the capabilities of LLMs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Self-Retrieval, an end-to-end LLM-driven IR architecture. It internalizes the abilities of indexing, retrieval and assessment of an IR system completely within a single LLM. 

- It first builds an index of a corpus via self-supervised learning to internalize the documents into the LLM's parameters. 

- For a query, the LLM first generates a natural language index, then generates relevant passages conditioned on the index, and finally scores the passages through self-assessment.

- This allows fully utilizing the semantic matching, understanding and generation abilities of the LLM in an end-to-end manner. It also ensures consistency between retrieval and downstream LLM tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the Self-Retrieval paradigm that builds an IR system completely within an LLM in an end-to-end manner.

- Introduces methods for corpus internalization, passage retrieval via natural language index generation, and self-assessment for scoring and ranking.

- Experiments show Self-Retrieval significantly outperforms previous sparse, dense and generative retrieval methods. It also boosts performance of retrieval augmented generation.

- The work explores the potential of LLMs for IR and enables better utilization of LLM abilities for retrieval and downstream applications. It provides a way towards more reliable and traceable text generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Self-Retrieval, an end-to-end large language model-driven information retrieval architecture that internalizes corpus storage, indexing, retrieval, and assessment abilities into a single model to enable deep exploitation of language model capabilities throughout the retrieval process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Self-Retrieval, an end-to-end large language model (LLM) driven information retrieval architecture. Specifically, Self-Retrieval has the following key properties:

1) It internalizes the corpus to be retrieved into the parameters of a single LLM via a natural language indexing architecture. This allows the LLM to store, index, and retrieve documents on its own.

2) The entire retrieval process is redefined as a procedure of document generation and self-assessment executed within one LLM. Given a query, the LLM first generates a relevant index and passages, then scores the passages through self-assessment. 

3) Experimental results show Self-Retrieval significantly outperforms previous sparse retrieval, dense retrieval and generative retrieval methods. It also boosts performance of downstream tasks like retrieval augmented generation.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an end-to-end information retrieval paradigm driven entirely by capabilities of a single large language model. This brings improved retrieval performance and better integration with LLM-based downstream applications.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Self-retrieval - The proposed end-to-end LLM-driven information retrieval architecture. It aims to fully internalize retrieval abilities into a single LLM.

- Large language models (LLMs) - The shift to using LLMs for information access is a key motivation. Self-retrieval aims to better leverage LLMs for retrieval.

- Corpus internalization - Self-retrieval internalizes the corpus into LLM parameters via self-supervised pre-training to build indexes.  

- Natural language index - The indexes built by self-retrieval are described in natural language within the LLM. Queries are mapped to these indexes.

- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) - A key downstream application that can benefit from self-retrieval's tighter integration between the retriever and LLM components.

- End-to-end training - Self-retrieval enables end-to-end training of the indexing, retrieval, and assessment components within a single LLM architecture.

- Traceable generation - By internalizing documents, self-retrieval works towards more reliable and traceable text generation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Self-Retrieval method proposed in the paper:

1. How does Self-Retrieval internalize the corpus into the parameters of the language model during the indexing process? What self-supervised learning approach is used? 

2. What are the key components generated during the retrieval process - the natural language index and passages? How does the model map a query to these components?

3. How does the self-assessment process work to score the retrieved passages? What responses does the model generate for this and how are they used?

4. What are the key differences between Self-Retrieval and traditional retrieval methods like sparse retrieval, dense retrieval and generative retrieval? How does it overcome their limitations?

5. How is the entire retrieval process formulated as a procedure of document generation and self-assessment within a single large language model? What capabilities does this provide?

6. What were the different types of training data used to teach the model the abilities needed for indexing, retrieval and self-assessment?

7. What constraints or algorithms are used during passage generation to ensure the content is from the internalized corpus? 

8. How does Self-Retrieval bridge the gap between retriever and language model in retrieval augmented generation? What advantage does this provide?

9. What were the different natural language index selection strategies analyzed? How did a meaningful index with global document information benefit performance?

10. How did model scale impact the retrieval capabilities of Self-Retrieval? What does this suggest about the potential as models continue to evolve?
