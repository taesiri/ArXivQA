# [Self-Retrieval: Building an Information Retrieval System with One Large   Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00801)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Self-Retrieval: Building an Information Retrieval System with One Large Language Model":

Problem:
- Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems are isolated from large language models (LLMs) and cannot fully meet their requirements for retrieval. They lack deep interaction with LLMs and cannot leverage the powerful semantic representation abilities of LLMs. 

- Existing works that enhance IR systems with LLMs only make limited improvements to components of the systems rather than fully integrating the capabilities of LLMs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Self-Retrieval, an end-to-end LLM-driven IR architecture. It internalizes the abilities of indexing, retrieval and assessment of an IR system completely within a single LLM. 

- It first builds an index of a corpus via self-supervised learning to internalize the documents into the LLM's parameters. 

- For a query, the LLM first generates a natural language index, then generates relevant passages conditioned on the index, and finally scores the passages through self-assessment.

- This allows fully utilizing the semantic matching, understanding and generation abilities of the LLM in an end-to-end manner. It also ensures consistency between retrieval and downstream LLM tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the Self-Retrieval paradigm that builds an IR system completely within an LLM in an end-to-end manner.

- Introduces methods for corpus internalization, passage retrieval via natural language index generation, and self-assessment for scoring and ranking.

- Experiments show Self-Retrieval significantly outperforms previous sparse, dense and generative retrieval methods. It also boosts performance of retrieval augmented generation.

- The work explores the potential of LLMs for IR and enables better utilization of LLM abilities for retrieval and downstream applications. It provides a way towards more reliable and traceable text generation.
