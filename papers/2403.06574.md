# [AC-EVAL: Evaluating Ancient Chinese Language Understanding in Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06574)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in Chinese focus primarily on modern contexts, lacking comprehensive assessment of ancient Chinese language understanding and reasoning.  
- There is a gap in evaluating LLMs' grasp of historical knowledge and cultural wisdom hidden within ancient Chinese texts. 
- Varied formats of existing ancient Chinese datasets for specific tasks make uniform LLM evaluation challenging.

Proposed Solution - AC-EVAL Benchmark:
- Comprises 3,245 multiple choice questions across 13 subjects, spanning 3 levels of difficulty: general historical knowledge, short text comprehension, and long text comprehension.
- Covers broad range of concepts related to ancient Chinese history, geography, philosophy, social customs, art and more over various Chinese dynasties.
- Tasks require linguistic analysis, semantic understanding, reasoning, synthesis and appreciation of classical Chinese poetry and prose excerpts.  
- Offers standardized framework for evaluating both English and Chinese language LLMs.

Key Contributions:
- Identifies gap in existing benchmarks regarding assessment of LLMs on ancient Chinese and provides extensive structured benchmark to address this gap.
- Comprehensive analysis of 17 major LLMs highlights current capabilities and improvement areas. 
- Reveals unique challenges posed by ancient Chinese as low-resource language even for top English LLMs like GPT-4.
- Demonstrates distinction in few-shot learning benefits between larger and smaller LLMs due to stability in handling irrelevant information.
- Aims to promote LLM advancement in educational and research applications for ancient Chinese.

In summary, the paper presents the AC-EVAL benchmark containing 3,245 questions to evaluate LLMs' proficiency in ancient Chinese comprehension. Experiments on top LLMs reveal gaps that AC-EVAL aims to help address through its standardized assessment framework across history, linguistics and literature.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces AC-EVAL, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models' understanding of ancient Chinese language, literature, and history.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of AC-EVAL, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding ancient Chinese language, literature, and history. 

Specifically, AC-EVAL comprises 3,245 multiple-choice questions across 13 subjects, spanning three levels of difficulty - general historical knowledge, short text understanding, and long text comprehension. It covers a diverse range of concepts related to ancient Chinese, including historical facts, geography, social customs, art, philosophy, classical poetry and prose. 

The paper conducts an extensive evaluation of top-performing LLMs on the AC-EVAL benchmark and analyzes their strengths and weaknesses. It aims to highlight areas for improvement to advance the development and application of LLMs in ancient Chinese language education and research.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of an innovative, multifaceted benchmark tailored specifically for assessing LLMs' proficiency in the crucial yet under-addressed area of ancient Chinese comprehension.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- AC-EVAL - The name of the proposed benchmark for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) proficiency in ancient Chinese language understanding and reasoning.

- Ancient Chinese - The focus area of texts and knowledge that AC-EVAL aims to assess LLMs' comprehension of. This encompasses China's historical, cultural, and linguistic heritage spanning several millennia.  

- Large language models (LLMs) - The AI models that AC-EVAL aims to evaluate, including top performers like GPT, ERNIE, GLM, and more.

- Comprehension tasks - The paper structures AC-EVAL into tasks assessing general historical knowledge, short text understanding, and long text understanding, with growing difficulty.

- Multiple-choice questions - The primary question format used in AC-EVAL to test LLMs, with each question providing four answer options. 

- Zero-shot vs. Few-shot - Testing methodologies employed to evaluate LLMs with no and a small number of examples respectively.

- Chain-of-thought - A prompting approach that requires models to provide step-by-step reasoning towards the final answer.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper introduces a new benchmark called AC-EVAL for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) proficiency in ancient Chinese. What are some of the key limitations or gaps in existing Chinese LLM benchmarks that AC-EVAL aims to address?

2) AC-EVAL is organized into 3 major categories and 13 subjects, encompassing general historical knowledge as well as short- and long- text comprehension tasks. What considerations and principles guided the selection and organization of these specific categories and subjects? 

3) The AC-EVAL benchmark utilizes a multiple-choice question format with 4 answer options. What are some potential limitations of relying solely on this closed-ended question type, and what provisions could be made to incorporate more open-ended or generative tasks in future work?

4) Accuracy is noted as the primary evaluation metric. What additional quantitative and/or qualitative metrics could complement accuracy scores to provide a more comprehensive assessment of LLMs on tasks like classical poetry appreciation and analysis?  

5) The paper acknowledges the lack of a human baseline. Why would comparisons against human performance be valuable, and what steps could be taken to establish human baselines for future benchmarking?

6) What were some key findings regarding the relative performance of Chinese vs. English LLMs on the AC-EVAL benchmark? What do these results imply about the uniqueness of ancient Chinese as a challenge for models trained primarily on modern Chinese or English corpora?

7) The decline in few-shot vs. zero-shot performance was more pronounced for smaller models on the AC-EVAL benchmark. What factors may explain this discrepancy in size-dependent model behaviors between AC-EVAL and prior Chinese benchmarks?  

8) For the chain-of-thought (COT) experiments, what explanations are provided for why few-shot COT underperformed zero-shot COT across model sizes? Do you agree with these hypothesized explanations?

9) To what extent does the AC-EVAL benchmark assess LLMs' capabilities in generating coherent, relevant, and contextualized responses vs. simply selecting correct multiple choice answers? How could AC-EVAL better evaluate generative abilities?

10) What are some key societal impacts and ethical considerations involved in developing LLMs specialized for comprehension and generation of content related to ancient Chinese history and literature?
