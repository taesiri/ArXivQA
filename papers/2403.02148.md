# [MiM-ISTD: Mamba-in-Mamba for Efficient Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02148)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Infrared small target detection (ISTD) aims to detect small targets in infrared images, which is challenging as the targets are very small and easily confused with background clutter. Existing methods either focus too much on local features using CNNs, missing global context, or use Transformers that have high computational complexity. There is a need for an efficient ISTD method that can capture both local and global information well.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Mamba-in-Mamba (MiM-ISTD) structure tailored for efficient ISTD. It represents the image as visual "sentences" (patches) of "words" (sub-patches). An outer Mamba block models relationships between sentence embeddings while a shared inner Mamba block models relationships between the word embeddings in each sentence. This hierarchical design extracts multi-granularity features efficiently.

Main Contributions:
- First work to successfully apply the efficient Mamba architecture to ISTD, providing new insights.
- Propose a novel MiM structure to address Mamba's weakness in local feature modeling by hierarchically modeling visual words and sentences.
- Achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency trade-off - 10x faster inference than previous SOTA while using 73.4% less GPU memory per 2048x2048 image.
- Extensive experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1k datasets demonstrate MiM-ISTD's superior accuracy and efficiency over other methods.

In summary, the paper makes Mamba viable for ISTD via a tailored MiM design that hierarchically models visual features, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off. The insights could facilitate future exploration of efficient Mamba architectures for vision.
