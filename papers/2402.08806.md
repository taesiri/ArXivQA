# [Combining Insights From Multiple Large Language Models Improves   Diagnostic Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and PaLM 2 have potential to be useful medical diagnostic support tools, but currently lack sufficient accuracy and trust from medical professionals.
- Studies show variable diagnostic performance of LLMs, and medical professionals want evidence that LLMs are "good enough" before trusting them.  

Proposed Solution:  
- Use collective intelligence methods to aggregate differential diagnoses from multiple LLMs to create synthetic diagnoses with higher accuracy than any individual LLM.  

Methods:
- Sampled 200 real-life clinical case vignettes from Human Diagnosis Project database
- Queried 4 LLMs (GPT-4, PaLM 2, Cohere, Llama 2) for differential diagnoses 
- Aggregated LLM responses using frequency-based scoring to create synthetic diagnoses
- Compared accuracy of individual LLM diagnoses to accuracy of aggregated synthetic diagnoses

Key Results:
- Aggregating responses from multiple LLMs improves diagnostic accuracy (75.3% for groups of 3 LLMs) compared to individual LLMs (59.0% on average)
- Accuracy continues improving as more LLMs are added, demonstrating the value of aggregation
- Holds true even when excluding top-performing GPT-4, showing potential for vendor-agnostic solutions

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrated feasibility of using collective intelligence methods to combine multiple LLM diagnoses into highly accurate synthetic diagnoses
- Addresses accuracy and trust issues that have impaired LLM adoption - paving way for use as diagnostic support tools
- Prevents vendor lock-in by showing combinations of cheaper LLMs can match GPT-4 accuracy
- Simple method enables integration in software tools or even manual synthesis by medical personnel


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper demonstrates that aggregating differential diagnoses from multiple large language models using collective intelligence methods leads to improved diagnostic accuracy compared to relying on a single model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating that aggregating differential diagnoses from multiple large language models (LLMs) using collective intelligence methods leads to higher diagnostic accuracy compared to the diagnoses produced by individual LLMs. 

Specifically, the paper shows that:

- The average diagnostic accuracy of groups of 3 LLMs (\MEAN{75.3}{1.6}) is higher than the accuracy of individual LLMs (\MEAN{59.0}{6.1}).

- Increasing the number of LLMs contributing to an aggregated differential diagnosis leads to higher accuracy.

- This trend holds even when not considering the top performing LLM (GPT-4) in the aggregates.

- The proposed aggregation method is simple, universal, and could prevent vendor lock-in by enabling the use of multiple cheaper LLMs rather than relying on a single expensive one.

In summary, the key contribution is using collective intelligence to combine multiple LLM diagnoses into a more accurate differential diagnosis overall. This could help improve trust and acceptance of LLM-based diagnostic support tools.

The paper compares the diagnostic accuracy of individual LLMs like GPT-4 and PaLM 2 to aggregated differential diagnoses produced by combining multiple LLMs using collective intelligence methods. It demonstrates that aggregation leads to higher accuracy, addresses issues like vendor lock-in, and could strengthen trust in LLMs as diagnostic support tools. The key method is a frequency-based scoring approach using real clinical vignettes from the HumanDx database.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a frequency-based, 1/r-weighted aggregation method to combine the differential diagnoses from multiple LLMs. Can you explain in more detail how this aggregation method works and why it is effective? 

2. The results show that combining 3 LLMs leads to higher accuracy than a single LLM. Did the authors try combining more than 4 LLMs? Is there a point at which adding more LLMs leads to diminishing returns or even reduced accuracy?

3. The authors mention that their aggregation method emphasizes plausible diagnoses while minimizing hallucinated ones. Can you elaborate on what specific mechanisms allow it to do this effectively? 

4. The paper talks about using the aggregation method to address issues like vendor lock-in. Can you explain how this method helps prevent dependence on a single LLM vendor? What are some real-world scenarios where this could be beneficial?

5. What are some potential limitations or weaknesses of the proposed aggregation method? Under what conditions might it perform poorly or lead to suboptimal differential diagnoses?  

6. The collective intelligence literature shows aggregation works well in many domains. Why do you think it is so effective for diagnostic medicine specifically? What unique aspects make medicine amenable to this approach?

7. The authors used 4 commercial LLMs in this study. How might the results change if they used a larger set of models, including locally-trained ones focused on medicine? Would more models always be better?

8. What ideas do you have for expanding on the aggregation method used here or tailoring it to specific clinical settings? For example, how could it be optimized for primary care vs specialty diagnosis?  

9. The paper focuses on diagnostic accuracy, but are there other clinically-relevant metrics that could be used to evaluate the aggregated differentials? How might you assess usefulness, safety, etc?

10. The authors suggest this method could be used by clinicians to manually aggregate LLM responses. What factors would influence whether doctors adopt this in practice? How could the process be made simple and efficient?
