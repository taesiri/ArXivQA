## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Anomaly detection is an important research area with applications across domains like healthcare, finance, security, etc. However, anomaly detection methods face challenges in handling large-scale, high-dimensional, heterogeneous data prevalent in the big data era. Isolation-based unsupervised methods are promising for anomaly detection due to advantages like low computational complexity, robustness to noise and irrelevant features, and no need for labels or parameter tuning. However, a systematic review of isolation-based anomaly detection methods is lacking.

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides the first comprehensive survey on isolation-based unsupervised anomaly detection methods. It reviews five main space partitioning strategies used - axis parallel splitting, random hyperplane, hypersphere, Voronoi diagram, and hash-based splitting. It then delineates computational methodologies to ascertain anomaly scores based on geometric characteristics like path length and hypersphere size, as well as similarity measures like mass and kernel-based methods. Extensions for streaming, trajectory, time series and unstructured data are explored. The Isolation Distributional Kernel technique to enable isolation methods to detect group anomalies is also reviewed. 

Main Contributions:
- First systematic review of isolation-based unsupervised anomaly detection methods covering aspects like partitioning strategies, scoring functions, algorithms, and applications
- Review of extensions enabling isolation methods to handle streaming data, trajectories, time series, images and other unstructured data  
- Introduction of Isolation Distributional Kernel to extend isolation mechanisms for identifying group anomalies
- Open challenges and future directions like theoretical analysis, incremental learning, and partitioning optimization are discussed

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive review of isolation-based anomaly detection methods, their scoring mechanisms, algorithmic details, applications and open problems. It enables better understanding and further research innovation in this area.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses several different isolation partitioning strategies like axis-parallel splitting, random hyperplanes, hyperspheres, Voronoi diagrams, and locality-sensitive hashing. How do these different strategies impact the anomaly detection performance and computational complexity? What are the tradeoffs between them?

2. The path length and hypersphere size are used as anomaly scores in iForest and iNNE respectively. What is the intuition behind using these geometric properties to quantify anomaly? How do they relate to the density and sparsity of regions in the dataset? 

3. The paper defines an isolation kernel to measure similarity between points based on the probability of two points falling in the same partition. How does this notion of similarity differ from traditional distance-based similarity? When would isolation kernel be more effective?

4. Explain the key idea behind using kernel mean embedding to extend isolation kernel to a distributional kernel for detecting group anomalies. What property of the isolation distributional kernel enables identifying unique distributions? 

5. The survey discusses applications of isolation-based methods for streaming data, trajectories, time series and images. For each of these data types, what modifications or additional techniques are needed to effectively apply isolation-based anomaly detection?

6. Parameter selection and model optimization are important practical considerations when applying isolation forests. Explain the objective functions proposed in OptiForest and DOIForest for optimization. What are their limitations?

7. The isolation mechanism has been applied for tasks like clustering, classification and change point detection, not just anomaly detection. Pick one such application and explain the intuition behind formulating it as an isolation-based problem. What are the advantages over traditional techniques?

8. What key theoretical gaps exist in understanding isolation-based anomaly detection? What analyses are needed to provide probabilistic explanations of why isolation mechanisms are effective for identifying anomalies? 

9. Most isolation-based techniques rebuild models from scratch when new streaming data arrives. What incremental learning strategies can be incorporated to efficiently update models instead? What are some challenges in doing so?

10. The choice of partitioning strategy significantly impacts performance of isolation-based methods. What supervised, semi-supervised or reinforcement learning techniques can potentially help optimize the partitioning process by utilizing limited labeled data or feedback from domain experts?
