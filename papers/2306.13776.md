# [Swin-Free: Achieving Better Cross-Window Attention and Efficiency with   Size-varying Window](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13776)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Swin Transformer models for computer vision tasks. Specifically, the authors aim to mitigate the high runtime cost and data movement overhead caused by the shifted window mechanism in Swin Transformers. Their proposed approach is to use size-varying windows across stages instead of shifted windows to achieve cross-window connections while avoiding the extra data shuffling operations. The key hypothesis is that this design change will lead to faster runtime with better accuracy compared to Swin Transformer models.The paper introduces Swin-Free, a modified Swin Transformer architecture that removes shifted windows and instead varies the size of local attention windows across stages. The authors hypothesize and demonstrate that:- Avoiding shifted windows reduces memory copy overhead, thereby improving runtime efficiency. - Varying window sizes provides better cross-window modeling than shifted windows, leading to accuracy improvements.- Larger window sizes combined with fewer windows per stage improve GPU utilization for faster matrix multiplications. - Additional tweaks like BatchNorm/ReLU layers and reduced model depth can further enhance latency without sacrificing accuracy.In summary, the central hypothesis is that Swin-Free will achieve superior efficiency and accuracy compared to Swin Transformers through its use of size-varying windows and other optimizations. The experiments validate these claims and analyze the impact of different design choices.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Swin-Free, a Transformer architecture that improves upon Swin Transformer in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The key ideas are:- Removing the shifting windows used in Swin Transformer to reduce memory copy operations. Shifting windows enable cross-window connections in Swin Transformer but are costly. - Instead, using size-varying windows across stages to achieve cross-window connections. For example, doubling the window size at later stages to cover multiple windows from previous stages.- Replacing LayerNorm and GELU with BatchNorm and ReLU to further improve efficiency without accuracy loss. - Reducing model depth (number of Transformer blocks) as the size-varying windows provide better modeling capability.The paper shows Swin-Free variants outperform Swin Transformer in ImageNet classification with lower latency. The size-varying windows provide better cross-window modeling than shifting windows while avoiding costly memory copies. The modifications make Swin-Free attractive for latency-critical applications.
