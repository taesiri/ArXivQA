# [Causal Walk: Debiasing Multi-Hop Fact Verification with Front-Door   Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02698)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Causal Walk: Debiasing Multi-Hop Fact Verification with Front-Door Adjustment":

Problem:
- Multi-hop fact verification aims to verify a claim by integrating and reasoning over multiple evidence sentences. However, existing models rely on spurious correlations and have poor performance on unbiased datasets.
- Previous debiasing methods like data augmentation and reweighting cannot handle complicated bias patterns in multi-hop datasets. Recent causal inference methods focus on shallow bias patterns and cannot deal with biases hidden in multiple reasoning hops.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Causal Walk, a novel debiasing method for multi-hop fact verification based on front-door adjustment from a causal perspective. 
- Introduce the reasoning path between input claim-evidence graph and output veracity label as a mediator variable. Decompose the causal effect into the effect between input and mediator, and between mediator and output.
- Estimate input-mediator effect by applying random walk idea with graph neural network to model reasoning path probability. 
- Estimate mediator-output effect by introducing normalized weighted geometric mean approximation into recurrent neural network.

Main Contributions:
- First work to debias multi-hop fact verification using front-door adjustment based on causal inference.
- Propose Causal Walk to perform causal intervention by introducing reasoning path as mediator variable.
- Construct adversarial and symmetric multi-hop datasets using GPT-4 to evaluate debiasing methods.
- Experiments show Causal Walk outperforms previous debiasing methods on both existing and newly constructed datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel debiasing method called Causal Walk for multi-hop fact verification that utilizes front-door adjustment in causal inference by introducing the reasoning path between input and output as the mediator.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes Causal Walk, a novel method to debias multi-hop fact verification using front-door adjustment. This is the first work to debias multi-hop fact verification with front-door adjustment.

2. It introduces the reasoning path between the input (claim-evidence graph) and output (veracity label) as a mediator variable to enable front-door adjustment. The causal effect is decomposed into the effect between input and mediator, and between mediator and output. 

3. It proposes techniques to estimate the causal effects, including using random walks with graph neural networks to model the effect between input and mediator, and using normalized weighted geometric mean with recurrent networks for the effect between mediator and output.

4. It constructs new adversarial and symmetric multi-hop fact verification datasets to evaluate debiasing methods. Experiments on existing and new datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal Walk over previous debiasing methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel method Causal Walk that leverages front-door adjustment and reasoning path mediation to effectively debias multi-hop fact verification, evaluated on both existing and newly constructed datasets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using front-door adjustment for debiasing multi-hop fact verification. Why is front-door adjustment preferred over backdoor adjustment in this setting? What are the key assumptions needed for front-door adjustment to work here?

2. The reasoning path R is introduced as a mediator variable between the input graph G and output label L. What is the intuition behind using the reasoning path as a mediator? How does this allow blocking the effect of confounder U?

3. Explain the estimation of P(r|do(G)) using random walks on the input graph G. Why is a random walk reasonable for estimating this probability? How are the transition probabilities calculated?

4. Explain the estimation of P(L|do(r)) using the Normalized Weighted Geometric Mean (NWGM) approximation. Why is an approximation needed here and how does NWGM allow absorbing the sampling of G?

5. The paper uses a fixed dictionary D_g to store compressed representations of G. What is the motivation behind using a fixed dictionary? How is D_g initialized and updated during training?

6. Walk through the overall training process, including the losses used. How are the causal effect and random walk objectives combined during training? 

7. The ablation study shows that using evidence labels to supervise the transition probabilities hurts performance. Provide an analysis of why this counterintuitive result occurs.

8. How does the method address complicated bias patterns hidden across multiple hops of evidence? What limitations still exist in the approach?

9. The method is evaluated on original and adversarially constructed datasets. Analyze the results and discuss what they indicate about the robustness of the approach.

10. What opportunities exist for future work to build upon the approach proposed here? What are some potential ways the method could be extended or improved?
