## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Causal Walk: Debiasing Multi-Hop Fact Verification with Front-Door Adjustment":

Problem:
- Multi-hop fact verification aims to verify a claim by integrating and reasoning over multiple evidence sentences. However, existing models rely on spurious correlations and have poor performance on unbiased datasets.
- Previous debiasing methods like data augmentation and reweighting cannot handle complicated bias patterns in multi-hop datasets. Recent causal inference methods focus on shallow bias patterns and cannot deal with biases hidden in multiple reasoning hops.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Causal Walk, a novel debiasing method for multi-hop fact verification based on front-door adjustment from a causal perspective. 
- Introduce the reasoning path between input claim-evidence graph and output veracity label as a mediator variable. Decompose the causal effect into the effect between input and mediator, and between mediator and output.
- Estimate input-mediator effect by applying random walk idea with graph neural network to model reasoning path probability. 
- Estimate mediator-output effect by introducing normalized weighted geometric mean approximation into recurrent neural network.

Main Contributions:
- First work to debias multi-hop fact verification using front-door adjustment based on causal inference.
- Propose Causal Walk to perform causal intervention by introducing reasoning path as mediator variable.
- Construct adversarial and symmetric multi-hop datasets using GPT-4 to evaluate debiasing methods.
- Experiments show Causal Walk outperforms previous debiasing methods on both existing and newly constructed datasets.
