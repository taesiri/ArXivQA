# [SCHEMA: State CHangEs MAtter for Procedure Planning in Instructional   Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01599)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of procedure planning in instructional videos, which aims to generate a goal-oriented sequence of action steps given partial visual observations of start and goal states. While recent works have shown promising results by modeling the temporal relations between action steps, they overlook the role of state changes associated with each step. Specifically, the causal relations between steps and states are not explicitly modeled. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes to represent each step as state changes using language descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs). Each step is described by the states before and after the step execution. The core ideas are:

1) Step representation: Use LLM with a chain-of-thought prompting strategy to generate discriminative language descriptions of the state changes for each step. 

2) State change tracking: Align the visual observations of states with the LLM-generated language descriptions via cross-modal contrastive learning. Use the descriptions as guidance to represent the intermediate states.

3) Formulate procedure planning as mid-state prediction and step prediction in a masked language modeling manner.

Main Contributions:

1) Point out the importance of modeling state changes for procedure planning and propose a new step representation as state changes.

2) Leverage LLM's commonsense knowledge to obtain language descriptions of state changes. Propose chain-of-thought prompting for better descriptions.

3) Track state changes by aligning visual states and language descriptions. Use descriptions as supervision to represent intermediate states.

4) Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on CrossTask, COIN and NIV datasets. Demonstrate better generalization ability.

In summary, the paper provides a new perspective on procedure planning by explicitly modeling the causal relations between steps and states via language-guided state tracking, which leads to improved performance and explainability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes representing steps as state changes in instructional videos for procedure planning by leveraging language models to generate descriptive state changes and aligning visual observations and language descriptions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Pointing out that state changes matter (SCHEMA) for procedure planning in instructional videos, and proposing a new representation of steps in procedural videos as state changes. 

2. Proposing to track state changes by aligning visual state observations with large language model (LLM) generated language descriptions for a more structured state space. The paper also represents mid-states via LLM-generated descriptions.

3. Conducting extensive experiments on CrossTask, COIN, and NIV datasets that demonstrate the quality of state description generation and the effectiveness of the proposed method for procedure planning. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance and obtains explainable visualizations.

In summary, the key innovation is explicitly modeling state changes for steps using LLM-generated descriptions, instead of only focusing on sequence modeling of steps. This establishes a more structured state space by investigating the causal relations between steps and states.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Procedure planning - The goal of the paper is to study procedure planning in instructional videos, which aims to generate a goal-oriented sequence of action steps given visual observations.

- State changes - The paper proposes to represent each step in a procedure as the associated state changes before and after that step. This allows modeling the causal relations between steps and states.

- Language descriptions - The paper leverages large language models like GPT-3.5 to generate natural language descriptions characterizing the state changes for each step. This textual representation complements the visual observations.

- Alignment - The visual and textual representations of states are aligned via cross-modal contrastive learning. This helps establish a more structured state space.  

- Weak supervision - Unlike prior works, the paper operates under weak supervision where only step sequence annotations are available during training, without intermediate state annotations.

- Modeling - Key model components include the state encoder, description encoder, state decoder for mid-state prediction, and step decoder for action prediction. Losses include contrastive alignment loss and masked prediction losses.

In summary, the key ideas focus on explicitly modeling state changes using language descriptions and alignments to improve procedure planning under weak supervision. The terms state changes, language descriptions, alignment, and weak supervision capture the essential concepts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes to represent each step as state changes using language descriptions generated by large language models. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using language descriptions over using visual observations directly to represent state changes?

2. The chain-of-thought prompting method is proposed to generate better state change descriptions from large language models. How does this prompting strategy help improve the quality of the generated descriptions compared to more straightforward prompting approaches? 

3. The paper aligns visual states with language state descriptions using cross-modal contrastive learning. What other techniques could be explored to establish correspondence between visual and language modalities for this task?

4. The paper models the intermediate states in procedures using the generated language descriptions. How else could these intermediate states be modeled given that direct visual observations may not be available?

5. The paper uses two separate decoders for mid-state prediction and step prediction. What is the motivation behind this design choice compared to using a single decoder? What are the tradeoffs?

6. External language description memory interacts with the Transformer decoders via cross-attention. What role does this memory play during decoding and how does it help with procedure planning?

7. The paper applies Viterbi algorithm during inference for incorporating temporal ordering priors. What other techniques could be used to account for ordering constraints between steps?

8. Uncertainty modeling is discussed for generating multiple possible plans. How can the proposed model be extended for conditional generation of diverse but valid plans?

9. The model seems to work well on existing small-scale benchmark datasets. What modifications would be needed in terms of model architecture, training process etc. to scale it up to large real-world video datasets?

10. When analyzing failure cases, the paper points out issues with start/end state understanding, action hallucination etc. What solutions could be proposed to specifically address these problems faced by the model?
