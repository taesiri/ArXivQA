# [Enhancing Neural Machine Translation of Low-Resource Languages: Corpus   Development, Human Evaluation and Explainable AI Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01580)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents research on enhancing neural machine translation (NMT) for low-resource languages, using English-Irish (EN-GA) and English-Marathi (EN-MR) as case studies. 

It identifies several challenges facing NMT for such languages, including lack of training data, overfitting, and difficulties handling morphological complexity. The main research questions explored are:

1) How to optimize hyperparameters and subword models for Transformer NMT with low-resource data. Experiments find 16k BPE SentencePiece models work best.

2) The impact of small in-domain datasets. A new EN-GA health dataset called gaHealth is developed. Models trained on it improve MT quality by 22 BLEU points over baseline.

3) Comparison of Transformer versus RNN models using manual Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) error analysis. Transformers reduce both accuracy and fluency errors substantially.

4) Streamlining and simplifying the NMT workflow in an eco-friendly manner. Two open-source tools are introduced - adaptNMT for building models from scratch, and adaptMLLM for fine-tuning large multilingual models.

Key contributions include hyperparameter optimization guidelines for low-resource NMT, empirical evidence for in-domain data benefits, a rigorous human evaluation framework, the gaHealth dataset, and the user-friendly adaptNMT and adaptMLLM tools. 

AdaptMLLM boosted performance significantly over baseline models, achieving 14-117% relative BLEU score gains on EN-GA and EN-MR translation. The tools and insights pave the way for advancing low-resource NMT accessibly and sustainably.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the development of two open-source applications, adaptNMT and adaptMLLM, that streamline the process of building, evaluating, and deploying neural machine translation (NMT) models. Specifically:

1. adaptNMT simplifies the setup and training of recurrent neural network (RNN) and Transformer NMT models. It has an intuitive interface, visualization capabilities, supports hyperparameter optimization, and can deploy models as a translation service. A key feature is the "green report" that tracks the environmental impact of model training.

2. adaptMLLM focuses on fine-tuning large pre-trained multilingual language models (MLLMs) like Meta's No Language Left Behind models. It is tailored for low-resource languages and significantly improves translation quality over baseline models. The application simplifies MLLM fine-tuning and evaluation.

In summary, the main contribution is developing these two open-source tools to streamline and improve NMT for both developers and translators. Their application to low-resource languages like English-Irish and English-Marathi demonstrates their capabilities. The availability of these user-friendly tools helps make NMT more accessible.
