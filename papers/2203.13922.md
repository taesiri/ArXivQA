# [AutoML for Deep Recommender Systems: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13922)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can positional information be effectively exploited to improve session-based recommendation systems (SBRS)?

The key points are:

- SBRS aims to predict a user's next item based on their current session of clicked/interacted items. 

- The position of each item in the session provides important contextual information - early items indicate initial intentions, while later items reflect shifts in preference. 

- Existing SBRS methods do not fully exploit this positional information. Recurrent and graph-based models only capture it implicitly. Attention mechanisms focus solely on the last position.

- The paper proposes a novel dual positional encoding scheme (DPE) to explicitly capture both forward (initial) and backward (latest) positional information.

- They also design a Position-aware Gated Graph Neural Network (PGGNN) to better inject positional information into graph-based models. 

- Combining DPE and PGGNN allows their proposed PosRec model to achieve state-of-the-art performance by effectively exploiting positional information for SBRS.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly encoding forward and backward positional information, and integrating it into SBRS models, can significantly improve recommendation accuracy. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed techniques.

This provides useful insights into the practical performance tradeoffs of different techniques. Comparative empirical analysis is lacking in most other survey papers. 

- The taxonomy proposed covers recent state-of-the-art methods published in top venues through 2022. Other surveys tend to cover earlier work but lack coverage of the latest advancements.

- The paper outlines several promising future research directions for AutoML recommender systems. Other surveys generally do not provide this type of forward-looking analysis of open problems and opportunities.

Overall, this survey stands out for its comprehensive taxonomy, focus on technical details, empirical analysis, coverage of recent advances, and discussion of future directions. This allows it to provide unique insights compared to other surveys on this topic.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following key future research directions for AutoML for deep recommender systems:

1. Feature Cold Start: Develop methods to efficiently assign embedding dimensions to new features that are added in real-time. Current AutoML methods for recommender systems mainly focus on existing features in the dataset.

2. Long-tail Features: Develop better methods for assigning embedding dimensions to low-frequency, long-tail users/items. Current methods often assume high-frequency features should get larger dimensions, but this may not work well for rare features.

3. Theory Analysis: Provide more rigorous theoretical analysis to guide the design of search spaces and strategies. Currently there is limited theory connecting AutoML techniques with performance guarantees.

4. AutoML for On-Device Recommendation: Design AutoML techniques specialized for recommender systems deployed on heterogeneous user devices with limited resources, as opposed to cloud servers. This introduces challenges around model heterogeneity and resource constraints.

5. AutoML for Various Recommendation Tasks: Expand AutoML to other important recommendation tasks beyond basic rating prediction and item ranking, such as social recommendation, sequential recommendation, point-of-interest recommendation. Each task has unique challenges.

6. AutoML for GNN-based Recommendation: Develop AutoML techniques to automatically design graph neural network architectures for recommendation. This is an emerging area as GNNs become more prominent for recommendation.

In summary, the key future directions are around handling new/rare features, theoretical foundations, on-device deployment, expanding to new tasks, and GNN model architecture search. Advances in these areas could significantly expand the impact of AutoML for recommendation systems.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a survey of AutoML techniques for deep recommender systems (termed AutoRecSys). The survey first proposes an abstract concept for AutoRecSys, describing its key components and how it differs from conventional AutoML methods and standard recommender systems. AutoRecSys focuses on automatically designing recommender system components like feature selection, embedding dimensions, feature interactions, model architecture, and other components, alleviating the need for extensive human effort and expertise. 

The paper then introduces a taxonomy to categorize AutoRecSys methods into five groups: automated feature selection search, automated embedding dimension search, automated feature interaction search, automated model architecture search, and automated other components search. For each category, the survey analyzes the key challenges, reviews representative techniques, and compares the search spaces and search strategies which connect methods within each group. The paper also empirically analyzes and compares different AutoRecSys methods. Finally, the survey discusses four promising future research directions: handling feature cold starts, assigning dimensions for long-tail features, integrating theoretical analyses into methods, and developing AutoML for on-device recommender systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an automated machine learning framework called AutoRecSys for deep recommender systems. It introduces a taxonomy to classify AutoML methods for recommendation into five categories: 

1) Automated feature selection search (Auto-FSS) which selects the most useful subset of features as input to the recommender system model. 

2) Automated embedding dimension search (Auto-EDS) which automatically determines the optimal embedding size for each feature to balance model capacity and efficiency.

3) Automated feature interaction search (Auto-FIS) which searches for the most effective feature interactions to model complex relationships. 

4) Automated model architecture search (Auto-MAS) which automatically designs the overall architecture of the recommender system model.

5) Automated other components search (Auto-OCS) which searches for optimal components like loss functions.

The key innovation is using techniques like neural architecture search to automate the design of various components of deep recommender systems instead of relying solely on human experts. This allows the system to automatically discover well-performing model architectures tailored to the specific recommendation task and data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of how to effectively utilize positional information in session-based recommender systems (SBRS). The key questions it seeks to answer are:

1) How can positional encodings be designed to fully capture the forward and backward positional information that is important in SBRS? 

2) How can graph neural networks be enhanced to effectively exploit positional information for session-based recommendation?

The paper argues that existing positional encoding schemes like sinusoidal positional encodings are inadequate for SBRS, as they only capture forward positional information. However, SBRS requires encodings that are both forward-aware and backward-aware, to represent the initial and latest user intentions in a session respectively. 

To address this, the paper proposes a novel Dual Positional Encoding (DPE) scheme that combines elements of forward and backward encoding to capture both types of positional information. It also enhances graph neural networks with a Position-aware Gated Graph Neural Network (PGGNN) module to better exploit positional information during item embedding learning.

Together, the proposed DPE and PGGNN aim to allow positional information to be fully utilized in SBRS for improved recommendation performance. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed techniques over existing methods.

In summary, the key focus and contribution of the paper is developing encodings and graph neural network architectures tailored to effectively exploit the unique characteristics of positional information in SBRS.
