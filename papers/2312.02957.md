# [Classification for everyone : Building geography agnostic models for   fairer recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02957)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper analyzes geographical biases present in image classification models and proposes methods to mitigate this bias. The authors first quantitatively demonstrate the inferior performance of models like VGG-16 and ResNet-18 on low-income images from the Dollar Street and ImageNet datasets compared to high-income images. They then explore techniques like weighted loss, over/under-sampling, and focal loss (down-weighting easy examples) during training to make models more robust to image geography. Experiments on the Dollar Street dataset show focal loss with γ=5 flattens the accuracy curve across income groups best, reducing variance from 83-90% originally to 82.5-87.5%, thereby mitigating bias. The authors also try adversarial domain adaptation between high and low-income groups but find the domain shift too large to adapt well. For ImageNet, focal loss with γ=5 again works best, decreasing the accuracy variance across income levels, though not eliminating it. In conclusion, while some bias mitigation is achieved, the domain shift remains too significant to enable building truly geography-agnostic models, identifying an open research direction. The income-annotated ImageNet subset created could enable further analysis in future work.
