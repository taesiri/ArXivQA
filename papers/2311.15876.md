# [RO-LLaMA: Generalist LLM for Radiation Oncology via Noise Augmentation   and Consistency Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15876)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents RO-LLaMA, a versatile large language model tailored for the clinical workflow in radiation oncology. RO-LLaMA demonstrates proficiency across three key tasks - clinical report summarization, radiation treatment plan suggestion, and plan-guided 3D target volume segmentation on CT scans. To boost robustness, the authors explore noise augmentation and consistency regularization techniques like Noisy Embedding Fine-Tuning (NEFTune), Consistency Embedding Fine-Tuning (CEFTune) for text, and Noisy/Consistency Embedding Segmentation (NESEG/CESEG) for segmentation. Through multi-center experiments, RO-LLaMA shows promising performance and generalization capabilities. The model summarizes reports clearly, suggests appropriate treatment plans, and delineates target volumes effectively. This hints at the potential for developing generalist medical AI models that can replicate expertise across clinical workflows. Limitations include dataset constraints to initial cancer diagnoses. Overall, the results mark a significant step towards versatile AI in radiation oncology.
