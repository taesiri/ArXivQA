# [MELODY: Robust Semi-Supervised Hybrid Model for Entity-Level Online   Anomaly Detection with Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10338)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of anomaly detection for software deployments in large online cloud systems. As code changes are regularly deployed, faults may be introduced that degrade performance or cause outages. Thus, deployments need to be monitored and anomalies detected quickly so that faulty deployments can be rolled back. This is an entity-level anomaly detection problem across streaming deployment entities, with the following unique challenges:

1) Heterogeneity of deployments in terms of time series scales, lengths, and metrics monitored.

2) Low latency tolerance as deployments are short-lived streams.

3) Ambiguous anomaly definition based on domain expert feedback, not unexpected data changes.  

4) Limited and potentially noisy supervision at the entity level from domain experts.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes MELODY, a robust semi-supervised framework with two key components:

1) Online Feature Extractor (OFE): Transforms heterogeneous multivariate time series of deployments to comparable fixed-length feature vectors using rule-based, algorithmic, and metadata featurizers. Applies time pooling for variable lengths.

2) Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection (SemiAD): A hybrid model combining a Semi-supervised Deep One-Class (SemiDOC) model trained with negative sampling to tighten normal boundary, and supervised LightGBM detectors. Two strategies to ensemble them are mean-based or sequential.

Main Contributions:

1) Formalizes and addresses the new problem of entity-level anomaly detection over streaming deployments.

2) Proposes an end-to-end framework MELODY to address the unique challenges, with customized semi-supervised learning and robust featurization.

3) Evaluates on a large industrial dataset of 30K+ deployments and 1.2M time series, significantly outperforming SOTA methods.

4) Deploys MELODY into production environment monitoring millions of deployments per month. Human evaluation shows improved precision over existing system.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes MELODY, a robust semi-supervised framework with an online feature extractor and hybrid anomaly detection model for detecting anomalies in streaming multivariate time series data from heterogeneous entities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It investigates a new entity-level anomaly detection problem, which is motivated by real applications in cloud native systems. The unique challenges of this problem cannot be directly addressed by existing multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection approaches.

2. It proposes MELODY, a novel robust semi-supervised framework for online anomaly detection in streaming entities. MELODY resolves the ambiguous definition of anomalies via limited labels, and leverages the vast amount of unlabeled data to enhance its robustness and performance.

3. It evaluates MELODY on large-scale datasets with over 30K deployments and 1.2 million time series from Amazon, and compares it with state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate MELODY significantly outperforms the baselines, with up to 56.5% relative improvement on F1 score.

4. It deploys MELODY in a core production system at Amazon for detecting anomalous deployments. The human evaluation results suggest MELODY is effective for monitoring deployments in large online systems.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel semi-supervised framework called MELODY to address the new problem of entity-level anomaly detection in cloud native systems, which outperforms existing methods.

The paper introduces a new problem of entity-level anomaly detection, where the goal is to detect anomalous entities that emit multivariate time series data, rather than detecting anomalous time points. It proposes a semi-supervised framework called MELODY to address challenges with heterogeneity, low latency requirements, ambiguous anomaly definitions, and limited supervision. Key components include an online feature extractor, a semi-supervised deep one-class model with negative sampling, and ensembling with a supervised classifier. The method is evaluated on a dataset of cloud service deployments, where it outperforms baselines and demonstrates effectiveness for monitoring rollbacks.
