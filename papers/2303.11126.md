# [Robustifying Token Attention for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11126)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we make the attention mechanism in vision transformers (ViTs) more robust against common image corruptions and perturbations?

The authors observe that standard ViTs tend to rely too heavily on a few "important" tokens when computing self-attention. However, these tokens are not actually robust and can change entirely when the input image is corrupted with noise, blur, etc. 

To address this, the authors propose two main techniques:

1) Token-aware Average Pooling (TAP): Allows each token to adaptively aggregate information from its local neighborhood, making the model less reliant on just a few individual tokens.

2) Attention Diversification Loss (ADL): Explicitly encourages the model to distribute attention across diverse input tokens rather than focusing too heavily on the same "important" tokens.

The central hypothesis is that alleviating the "token overfocusing" phenomenon via these techniques will substantially improve the robustness of ViT models against common image corruptions while maintaining accuracy on clean images. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis across different model architectures and tasks.

In summary, the core research question is how to make ViT attention more robust, with the central hypothesis being that reducing token overfocusing will achieve this goal. The TAP and ADL methods are proposed to address the token overfocusing problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Identifying and analyzing the "token overfocusing" phenomenon in vision transformers (ViTs), where the self-attention mechanism relies too heavily on just a few tokens. The authors show this leads to fragile attention patterns that are not robust to image corruptions.

2. Proposing two general techniques to alleviate the token overfocusing issue and improve the stability and robustness of ViT attention:

- Token-aware Average Pooling (TAP): Encourages the local neighborhood of each token to participate in attention by learning adaptive average pooling schemes for each token.

- Attention Diversification Loss (ADL): Explicitly reduces the similarity of attention patterns between different output tokens, encouraging more diverse attention. 

3. Demonstrating that both TAP and ADL can be incorporated into various ViT architectures and consistently improve robustness across multiple image classification datasets and tasks, including semantic segmentation. For example, the methods achieve over 2% improvement on corruption and distribution shift benchmarks like ImageNet-C while also slightly improving clean accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be identifying token overfocusing as a key robustness issue in ViTs, and proposing two lightweight and general techniques to mitigate this issue and significantly improve robustness across tasks and architectures.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes two techniques - Token-aware Average Pooling (TAP) and Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) - to address the issue of token overfocusing in vision transformers, where only a few unimportant tokens get high attention, making the models fragile to corruptions; TAP encourages nearby tokens to participate in attention through learnable pooling, while ADL explicitly diversifies the attention patterns across tokens.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper proposes a new method for improving the robustness and stability of vision transformers (ViTs) against corruptions like noise or blur. This goal of robustifying ViTs is shared by other recent works, but the paper takes a novel approach by examining the self-attention mechanism specifically.

- The paper identifies a phenomenon called "token overfocusing" as a key weakness of standard ViT self-attention. This issue seems overlooked in prior work, though a few papers have hinted at elements of it in visualizations. Identifying and addressing this overfocusing is a unique contribution.

- The two main techniques proposed - Token-aware Average Pooling (TAP) and Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) - are new ideas not explored before for improving self-attention, as far as I can tell. They provide more localized, diverse attention compared to standard self-attention.

- These techniques seem broadly applicable across transformer architectures and tasks. The paper demonstrates gains not just for image classification but also semantic segmentation, and for multiple ViT models. This flexibility is a strength compared to approaches that modify specific architectures.

- The improvements on robustness benchmarks like ImageNet-C and Cityscapes-C are sizable compared to prior art. The gains of 2-3% mCE/mIoU appear very competitive, while still maintaining accuracy on clean data.

- The comparison on robustness is mainly to other vision transformers. It would be interesting to compare to convolutional networks too. And only limited adversarial robustness results are reported. But the breadth of evaluation is otherwise quite extensive.

In summary, the paper offers good novelty through the problem identification and proposed techniques. The methods seem general and achieve impressive gains in corruption robustness across tasks and models compared to previous state-of-the-art ViTs. The empirical evaluation methodology is also thorough.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more advanced pooling mechanisms in the TAP module, beyond the averaging pooling explored in this work. The authors suggest exploring learnable pooling operations that can better capture local contexts and relationships.

- Applying TAP and ADL to self-supervised pre-training paradigms. The authors mention that both techniques are general and could potentially be used during pre-training as well, which they aim to explore in future work. 

- Evaluating the benefits of TAP and ADL on other downstream tasks beyond image classification and segmentation. The robustness improvements were shown to generalize in the authors' experiments, suggesting they could be broadly valuable.

- Combining TAP and ADL with other transformer architectures and attention mechanisms. The authors demonstrated strong results when applying their methods to existing state-of-the-art models, implying further gains may be possible.

- Exploring the theoretical connections between attention diversification and robustness, to better understand when and why ADL improves robustness.

- Developing additional regularization techniques along the lines of ADL that can encourage diversity and stability in learned attention patterns.

In summary, the main future directions involve broadening the application domains for TAP and ADL, strengthening their formulations, and further understanding the theoretical underpinnings of how they improve robustness. The authors propose their techniques as general strategies with much room for extension and refinement in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes two techniques, Token-aware Average Pooling (TAP) and Attention Diversification Loss (ADL), to improve the robustness of vision transformers (ViTs) against common corruptions like noise and blur. The authors observe that standard ViTs tend to overly focus on just a few tokens in the self-attention mechanism, making the model fragile to corruptions of those tokens. TAP encourages each token to aggregate information from its local neighborhood using adaptive average pooling, making more tokens contribute to the attention. ADL explicitly reduces the similarity between attention vectors of different tokens, diversifying the information each token attends to. Experiments on ImageNet classification and Cityscapes segmentation show these techniques applied to models like FAN and RVT significantly improve robustness to corruptions in ImageNet-C, Cityscapes-C, etc. while also slightly improving clean accuracy. The gains generalize across architectures and tasks, alleviating the token overfocusing issue and making attention more stable.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two-paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes two general techniques to address the token overfocusing issue in vision transformers (ViTs). The token overfocusing issue refers to ViTs relying on very few important tokens in the self-attention mechanism. This leads to fragile attention patterns that can easily change when images are corrupted, such as with noise or blur. 

To address this issue, the authors first propose a Token-aware Average Pooling (TAP) module. TAP encourages the local neighborhood of each token to participate in the attention mechanism. It does this by learning an adaptive average pooling scheme for each token to aggregate useful information from surrounding tokens. Second, the authors propose an Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) to explicitly reduce the similarity of attention vectors between different output tokens. This encourages the output tokens to rely on diverse sets of input tokens. Experiments show that both techniques significantly improve robustness across architectures on image classification and segmentation tasks. For example, TAP and ADL together improve corruption robustness on ImageNet-C by 2.4% and Cityscapes-C by 2.4% when applied to state-of-the-art models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes two techniques to improve the robustness and stability of vision transformers (ViTs) against image corruptions. First, they introduce a Token-aware Average Pooling (TAP) module that encourages each token to aggregate useful information from its local neighborhood before computing self-attention. This is done by learning a weighted combination of branches with different dilation rates for pooling each token's neighborhood. Second, they propose an Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) that explicitly reduces the cosine similarity between the attention vectors of different output tokens. This encourages the model to diversify the input tokens that each output token attends to. Together, TAP and ADL help alleviate the issue of models overly focusing on few fragile tokens, making the attention mechanism more stable and robust. Experiments show improved accuracy and robustness on ImageNet, ImageNet-C, and other datasets when applying TAP and ADL to various ViT architectures.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem it is addressing is the lack of robustness of vision transformers (ViTs) to common corruptions like noise or blurring. Specifically, the authors identify an issue they call "token overfocusing" where the attention mechanism in ViTs relies too heavily on just a few important tokens. These tokens are not robust, so when images are corrupted, the attention patterns can change drastically which hurts performance. 

The main questions the paper seems to be addressing are:

1) How can we quantify and demonstrate this "token overfocusing" issue in Vision Transformers?

2) How can we modify or regularize the self-attention mechanism to alleviate overfocusing and make it more robust to corruptions?

To address these questions, the authors propose two main methods:

1) A Token-aware Average Pooling (TAP) module that encourages nearby tokens to participate more in the attention calculation, rather than just a few important tokens.

2) An Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) that explicitly maximizes the diversity of attention patterns between different output tokens, rather than allowing them to focus on the same few input tokens.

Together, TAP and ADL aim to mitigate token overfocusing, stabilize attention patterns, and improve robustness of ViTs to common corruptions. The authors demonstrate improved performance on benchmarks like ImageNet-C.

In summary, the main problem is the lack of robustness in ViT attention, traced to an overfocusing issue. The solutions explore better aggregating neighboring information (TAP) and diversifying attention patterns (ADL) to address this.
