# [PARADE: Passage Representation Aggregation for Document Reranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09093)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the introduction, the key research questions and hypotheses of this paper appear to be:

1) Can PLMs like BERT and ELECTRA be effectively applied to ad-hoc document ranking while preserving document-level signals beyond the passage level? 

2) Does aggregating passage relevance representations directly (i.e. passage representation aggregation) outperform simply aggregating passage relevance scores (i.e. passage score aggregation)?

3) Can the computational cost of transformer-based representation aggregation be reduced by decreasing model size, while maintaining effectiveness?

4) How is the effectiveness of transformer-based representation aggregation influenced by the number of passages considered?

5) What dataset characteristics influence whether representation aggregation is more effective than score aggregation on certain benchmarks?

The central hypothesis seems to be that passage representation aggregation techniques like CNNs and transformers can significantly improve over prior passage score aggregation techniques by better capturing document-level relevance signals. The authors test this hypothesis through extensive experiments on multiple standard IR benchmark datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The formalization of passage score and representation aggregation strategies for document reranking, showing how they can be trained end-to-end. 

2. A thorough comparison of different passage aggregation strategies on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the value of passage representation aggregation approaches like CNN and Transformer over score aggregation approaches.

3. An analysis of how to reduce the computational cost of transformer-based representation aggregation by decreasing model size, including using distillation.

4. An analysis of how the effectiveness of transformer-based representation aggregation is influenced by the number of passages considered.

5. An analysis into dataset characteristics that influence which aggregation strategies are most effective, finding representation aggregation works better on datasets where relevance is spread throughout documents. On datasets where relevance is focused in a few passages, score aggregation can be more effective.

In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates a new passage representation aggregation approach for document reranking called PARADE. The analyses provide insights into when representation aggregation is preferred over score aggregation, and how to improve neural reranking efficiency.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper focuses on neural techniques for aggregating passage-level signals into document relevance scores for ad-hoc document ranking. This builds on prior work on passage-based document reranking, but explores more sophisticated representation aggregation techniques like CNNs and transformers rather than just score aggregation.

- Compared to other work on representation aggregation for NLP tasks, this paper specifically looks at aggregation for the document ranking problem. It adapts common strategies like CNNs and transformers to operate on passage relevance representations rather than lower-level text representations.

- The paper compares against recent work on contextualized language models like BERT for document ranking. It shows that representation aggregation over BERT passage embeddings can outperform approaches like BERT-MaxP that just aggregate passage scores.

- For efficiency, the paper explores model compression techniques like knowledge distillation that have been studied for BERT, but applies them to the passage aggregation models. This allows the benefits of representation aggregation while reducing computational overhead.

- Compared to work on long-text transformers that process full documents, this paper shows passage representation aggregation can be more effective on some collections while being more memory efficient. But the transformer approaches have efficiency advantages for very long texts.

- The analysis of dataset characteristics provides new insights on when complex aggregation is most beneficial compared to simple score aggregation methods. Findings suggest the number of relevant passages per document influences this.

In summary, the paper pushes forward representation aggregation techniques for document ranking using modern neural models like BERT. The thorough empirical comparisons and analyses make several notable contributions over prior work in this specific area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further exploring different passage representation aggregation techniques, such as using more sophisticated CNN and transformer architectures. The authors found these hierarchical aggregation approaches to be quite effective, so there is room for further innovation and optimization here.

- Analyzing additional dataset characteristics that may influence the effectiveness of different aggregation strategies. The authors provide some analysis of "maximum passage bias" but suggest more work could be done to understand when simple vs complex aggregation is preferable.

- Combining representation aggregation approaches like PARADE with transformer models that support longer sequences, such as Longformer. The authors suggest PARADE could potentially handle even longer documents when coupled with such models.

- Additional efficiency improvements and analysis, building on the knowledge distillation experiments. Further reducing the computation time of the aggregation models would be beneficial.

- Testing on a wider range of datasets, especially those with complete passage-level judgments. This could shed more light on the number of relevant passages per document in different collections.

- Exploring the impact of different passage segmentation techniques on the aggregation approaches. The fixed window approach could be replaced with something more semantic.

- Leveraging passage-level labels during training rather than document labels, when available. The authors suggest this could improve training.

In summary, the authors have highlighted passage representation aggregation as an important direction, and provided analysis on model sizes and dataset biases. Future work can build on this strong foundation in several ways to further advance document re-ranking with pre-trained language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores strategies for aggregating relevance signals from passages in a document into a final document ranking score using pretrained language models like BERT. It makes a distinction between passage score aggregation techniques used in prior work, and passage representation aggregation techniques, which it calls PARADE. PARADE aggregates passage representations using methods like max pooling, attention, CNNs, and transformers, rather than just passage scores. Experiments show that representation aggregation approaches like PARADE-CNN and PARADE-Transformer significantly outperform score aggregation methods like BERT-MaxP and Birch on collections like Robust04 and GOV2. The paper also analyzes model efficiency, finding smaller PARADE models can be effective when combined with knowledge distillation. An analysis shows the transformer aggregation approach performs better on datasets where relevance is spread throughout documents, while simple max aggregation works better when queries can be answered by a single highly-relevant passage.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called PARADE for aggregating passage-level relevance signals into document scores for ad-hoc document ranking. Previous approaches have focused on aggregating passage relevance scores using techniques like max or average pooling. However, the authors argue that aggregating passage representations directly can better preserve document-level relevance signals that get lost when only using passage scores. 

The PARADE approach splits documents into passages that can be handled by BERT. It then gets a representation for each passage using the [CLS] token output from BERT. These passage representations are aggregated into a document representation using different techniques like max pooling, CNNs, or transformers. Experiments on TREC Robust04, Gov2, and other datasets show these representation aggregation techniques outperform score aggregation baselines like Birch. The transformer aggregation method (PARADE-Transformer) is generally the most effective. The paper also analyzes dataset characteristics and model efficiency. It provides guidance on when representation aggregation is preferable and how to improve transformer efficiency using distillation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method in the paper:

The paper proposes PARADE, an end-to-end document reranking model that aggregates passage-level relevance signals into a document-level score. Since transformers like BERT have a limited input sequence length, the model first splits documents into passages that can be fed individually into BERT to obtain passage relevance representations. PARADE then aggregates these representations in various ways, such as max pooling, attention, CNNs, and transformers, to produce a final document representation. This document representation is passed through a feedforward network to generate the document relevance score. The key distinction from prior work is the use of representation aggregation rather than score aggregation. Experiments show that representation aggregation approaches like PARADE-CNN and PARADE-Transformer outperform score aggregation methods like BERT-MaxP across various text collections. The paper also analyzes model efficiency and dataset characteristics to determine when representation aggregation is most beneficial.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of effectively applying pretrained language models like BERT to ad-hoc document ranking. Specifically, it is looking at aggregation techniques to combine relevance signals from individual passages into a document-level score.

4) How is the effectiveness of different aggregation strategies influenced by characteristics of the dataset, like the number of relevant passages per document?

The paper proposes a new approach called PARADE that explores passage representation aggregation rather than just aggregating passage scores. It compares techniques like max pooling, CNNs, and transformers for aggregating passage representations. The paper analyzes the effectiveness and efficiency tradeoffs of these techniques through experiments on several standard ad-hoc ranking benchmarks.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes PARADE, a new neural approach for document ranking that aggregates relevance signals from passages in a document. Previously, approaches like BERT-MaxP and Birch used BERT to score individual passages and then aggregated the scores, which can lose important document-level signals. PARADE moves beyond just aggregating passage scores and explores aggregating passage representations using techniques like CNNs and Transformers. Experiments on TREC collections like Robust04 and GOV2 show PARADE's representation aggregation approach is much more effective than just using passage scores. The Transformer variant of PARADE performs the best overall. The paper also analyzes the impact of model size, finding smaller distilled PARADE models can effectively trade off efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, it studies dataset characteristics to determine when representation aggregation is most useful over score aggregation, finding the former excels when queries require synthesizing signals across multiple passages. Overall, the paper demonstrates the importance of aggregating signals across the full document when ranking. PARADE provides an effective framework for neural document ranking while overcoming sequence length limitations.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes PARADE, a neural approach for aggregating passage-level relevance representations into document-level relevance scores for ad-hoc document ranking. Rather than simply taking the maximum passage score like prior work, PARADE explores techniques for aggregating the intermediate passage representations, such as using CNNs or transformer encoders. Experiments on TREC benchmark datasets show that the representation aggregation techniques in PARADE outperform previous passage score aggregation methods like Birch and ELECTRA-MaxP. Analyses demonstrate that representation aggregation is particularly beneficial for complex topics where relevance signals are spread throughout the document. The paper also explores knowledge distillation strategies to create more efficient PARADE models by transferring knowledge from a larger teacher to a smaller student. Overall, the paper formalizes and demonstrates the effectiveness of aggregating intermediate passage representations for neural document ranking. Key innovations include going beyond passage score aggregation to aggregate representations, using CNNs and transformers over these representations, and showing PARADE's benefits on diverse test collections.
