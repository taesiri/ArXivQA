# ['One size doesn't fit all': Learning how many Examples to use for   In-Context Learning for Improved Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06402)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In-context learning (ICL) involves using a frozen pre-trained language model and controlling its output using labeled examples in the prompt/context. 
- A key component of ICL is determining the ideal number of examples to include. Prior work uses a static number of examples.
- Some instances likely require more examples than others to predict correctly. There is a need for adaptive selection of examples.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Adaptive ICL (AICL) to dynamically choose the number of examples per instance at inference time.
- Train a classifier on the training set to predict the optimal number of examples per instance. Optimal is based on minimum examples for correct prediction.  
- Apply the classifier at inference to predict examples for a test instance before ICL.

Key Contributions:
- Novel AICL method to adaptively select examples for improved ICL performance.
- AICL outperforms static ICL baselines on text classification datasets in accuracy and efficiency.
- Shows automatically adapting the number of examples works better than hand-picked static values.
- Provides a more computationally efficient ICL workflow by using fewer examples when possible.

In summary, the paper presents Adaptive ICL to dynamically determine the number of examples for improved efficiency and accuracy of in-context learning for text classification.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes an adaptive in-context learning (AICL) method to dynamically determine the optimal number of examples to include in prompts for improved text classification, outperforming standard in-context learning with a fixed number of examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Adaptive In-Context Learning (AICL), a method that dynamically selects the number of example demonstrations to include in the prompt for each test instance instead of using a fixed number. Specifically, AICL:

1) Predicts the appropriate number of examples to use for each training instance by testing with progressively more examples and selecting based on correctness and confidence criteria. 

2) Learns a classifier on the training data to predict the number of examples for unseen test instances, under the hypothesis that similar instances should use a similar number of examples.

3) During inference, first predicts the number of examples for a test instance using the learned classifier, then performs that many-shot in-context learning to make the prediction.

Experiments on text classification datasets show AICL outperforms standard static in-context learning baselines in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The main implication is that dynamically adapting the number of examples can prevent negative effects from irrelevant examples.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- In-context learning (ICL): Using a small number of labeled examples in the prompt to an LLM to guide its text generation for a downstream task without any task-specific fine-tuning.

- Adaptive in-context learning (AICL): The proposed method of dynamically selecting the number of ICL examples based on the input instance rather than using a static number. 

- Number of examples: The key idea in AICL is adapting the number of ICL examples in the prompt based on the test instance.

- Text classification: The paper evaluates AICL on multiple text classification datasets like AGNews, Toxicity, and SST2.

- Instruction tuning: Controlling the output of LLMs by varying the input prompt/instruction without modifying model parameters.

- Few-shot learning: Using very few labeled examples, like 1-shot or 5-shot, during inference.

- Localized examples: Examples that are topically similar to the test instance work better than random ones.

- Classifier confidence: One heuristic uses the prediction confidence of the classifier to select the optimal number of examples.

- Computation efficiency: AICL can reduce the input size and improve run-time efficiency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an Adaptive In-Context Learning (AICL) method that dynamically selects the number of examples to use during inference. How is this analogous to a variable-sized neighborhood in k-NN classification? What is the key motivation behind this idea?

2. The paper hypothesizes that some test instances have better candidate training examples compared to others. How does this draw parallel from information retrieval principles of query performance? Explain the similarity and differences.  

3. Explain the two heuristics used to select the ground-truth number of examples on the training data. How do these balance between effectiveness and efficiency? What are the tradeoffs?

4. The paper models the prediction of the number of examples as a classification problem. Explain how the classifier is trained and what hypothesis it leverages for generalizability to unseen data. 

5. Analyze the results comparing AICL with static ICL baselines. Why does dynamically selecting examples help? When does AICL start to degrade compared to the best static ICL baseline?

6. The paper also compares against an Oracle method. Explain what this Oracle is and how its performance bounds the potential of AICL. Are there any practical ways to get closer to the Oracle?

7. One practical issue mentioned is that running AICL on the full training set may be expensive for large datasets. Analyze the experiments showing impact of the training set size. What proportion seems sufficient?

8. The verbalizer and prompt engineering also impact ICL performance. How can AICL be extended to adapt these in a data-driven way? What are the challenges?

9. The paper focuses on text classification. What other potential NLP tasks can benefit from an adaptive selection of demonstrations? What might be limitations?

10. The decoding time of LLMs depends on the input size. Analyze the efficiency results of AICL versus static ICL in the paper. How does a variable number of examples provide speed-effectiveness tradeoffs?
