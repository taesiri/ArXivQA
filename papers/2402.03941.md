# [Discovery of the Hidden World with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03941)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Discovery of the Hidden World with Large Language Models":

Problem: 
Traditional causal discovery algorithms rely on high-quality, human-annotated variables to uncover causal relationships from data. However, in many real-world settings, the underlying causal variables are unknown or unmeasured. This paper examines how large language models (LLMs), which have been pre-trained on massive amounts of text data, can help discover latent causal variables and relationships from raw, unstructured observational data.

Proposed Solution - COAT:
The paper proposes COAT (Causal representatiOn AssistanT), a framework that uses LLMs in two ways:

1) As a "factor proposer" that extracts candidate causal factors from unstructured data by relating pre-trained knowledge to the observations.

2) To provide annotation guidelines for the proposed factors and parse raw data into structured data accordingly.  

The structured data is then fed into a causal learning algorithm like FCI which outputs causal relationships. FCI also provides feedback (e.g. on faithfulness issues) to further improve the factor extraction by the LLM.

By using the LLM's knowledge rather than its causal reasoning, and combining it with a rigorous causal discovery algorithm, COAT reliably uncovers hidden causal variables and relationships from raw data.

Contributions:

- Proposes COAT, a reliable framework to incorporate LLMs into causal discovery from unstructured data

- Uses LLMs for factor proposal and data annotation rather than direct causal reasoning

- Shows LLMs can be improved via feedback from causal discovery algorithms  

- Demonstrates effectiveness of framework on two realistic benchmarks of review rating analysis and medical diagnosis

- Opens up ability to apply causal discovery algorithms to broader range of problems lacking clearly defined variables

In summary, the paper demonstrates how judiciously combining the knowledge inside LLMs with rigorous causal discovery can uncover hidden causal factors and relationships from raw, unstructured data.
