# [Discovery of the Hidden World with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03941)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Discovery of the Hidden World with Large Language Models":

Problem: 
Traditional causal discovery algorithms rely on high-quality, human-annotated variables to uncover causal relationships from data. However, in many real-world settings, the underlying causal variables are unknown or unmeasured. This paper examines how large language models (LLMs), which have been pre-trained on massive amounts of text data, can help discover latent causal variables and relationships from raw, unstructured observational data.

Proposed Solution - COAT:
The paper proposes COAT (Causal representatiOn AssistanT), a framework that uses LLMs in two ways:

1) As a "factor proposer" that extracts candidate causal factors from unstructured data by relating pre-trained knowledge to the observations.

2) To provide annotation guidelines for the proposed factors and parse raw data into structured data accordingly.  

The structured data is then fed into a causal learning algorithm like FCI which outputs causal relationships. FCI also provides feedback (e.g. on faithfulness issues) to further improve the factor extraction by the LLM.

By using the LLM's knowledge rather than its causal reasoning, and combining it with a rigorous causal discovery algorithm, COAT reliably uncovers hidden causal variables and relationships from raw data.

Contributions:

- Proposes COAT, a reliable framework to incorporate LLMs into causal discovery from unstructured data

- Uses LLMs for factor proposal and data annotation rather than direct causal reasoning

- Shows LLMs can be improved via feedback from causal discovery algorithms  

- Demonstrates effectiveness of framework on two realistic benchmarks of review rating analysis and medical diagnosis

- Opens up ability to apply causal discovery algorithms to broader range of problems lacking clearly defined variables

In summary, the paper demonstrates how judiciously combining the knowledge inside LLMs with rigorous causal discovery can uncover hidden causal factors and relationships from raw, unstructured data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes COAT, a framework that leverages large language models to propose candidate causal factors from unstructured data and uses causal discovery algorithms to validate relations among factors and provide feedback to improve factor proposals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing COAT (Causal representatiOn AssistanT), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to assist with causal discovery from unstructured observational data. 

Specifically, COAT incorporates LLMs as a "factor proposer" to extract potential causal factors from unstructured data. It also uses LLMs to provide additional information to help collect structured data values for the proposed factors. This annotated data is then fed into a causal learning module like the FCI algorithm to provide explanations of the data and useful feedback to further improve the LLM's extraction of causal factors.

The key ideas are:

1) Using LLMs to propose causal variable candidates rather than directly reasoning about causality, in order to leverage their capability of comprehending unstructured data while avoiding some reliability issues with LLM reasoning.

2) Incorporating rigorous causal discovery algorithms to audit the proposed factors, learn causal relations, and provide feedback to improve the factor proposals.

3) An iterative framework between the LLM factor proposer and causal discovery module.

The effectiveness of COAT is demonstrated through case studies on review rating analysis and neuropathic diagnosis. The main contribution is opening up a new direction to apply LLMs for discovering causal knowledge from raw unstructured observational data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Causal discovery: Discovering unknown causal relationships from observational data. A main focus of the paper.

- Large language models (LLMs): Models like GPT-3 that are pre-trained on large amounts of text data and can be used for a variety of downstream tasks. Used in the proposed COAT framework.

- Unstructured data: Data like free text or images that does not have an explicit structured representation. The paper aims to do causal discovery directly from such data.  

- Factor proposal: Using an LLM to propose potential causal factors hidden in unstructured data, based on its knowledge about the world. A key capability leveraged from LLMs.

- Feedback loops: Iteratively providing causal discovery outputs as feedback to the LLM to help it propose better factors over multiple rounds. Allows progressively uncovering causal variables.

- Markov blanket: The goal of the causal discovery process. Identify the subset of factors that screen off the target variable from all others.

- Reliability: A concern when using LLM outputs directly. The paper incorporates rigorous causal discovery algorithms rather than purely relying on LLM reasoning about causality.

In summary, the key focus is on reliably leveraging knowledge extracted by powerful LLMs from unstructured observations to facilitate more effective causal discovery. The proposed COAT framework realizes this in an iterative, feedback-driven approach.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) as a "factor proposer" to extract potential causal factors from unstructured data. What are some of the key challenges in using LLMs for this task compared to having human experts propose factors? For example, how can we ensure the factors proposed by the LLM are relevant and not spurious correlations?

2. The paper feeds the annotated data from the LLM into a causal learning module like FCI. What modifications need to be made to causal learning algorithms like FCI to account for the different noise characteristics and potential biases introduced by having an LLM annotate the data versus human annotation?  

3. What types of causal feedback would be most useful for the LLM to improve its factor proposals in the next round? For example, should the feedback focus on samples the LLM struggled to explain or are there other strategies? How can the causal feedback be framed into useful prompts?

4. How sensitive is the approach to the choice of the specific LLM used for factor proposal versus factor parsing? Are certain LLMs better suited for one task over the other? How does the performance degrade if a weaker LLM is used?

5. The paper focuses on uncovering the Markov blanket for a target variable. How does the performance change if the objective is to learn the full causal graph? What modifications need to be made to the method and the feedback prompts?

6. What theoretical guarantees can we provide on the soundness and completeness when combining LLMs with causal discovery algorithms in this framework? Under what assumptions can we ensure discovering the full Markov blanket?

7. The paper uses two LLMs for factor proposal and parsing. Is it better to use a single unified LLM? What are the tradeoffs? Does fine-tuning help for these tasks?

8. How does the approach deal with shifts in the distribution of the unstructured data compared to what the LLM saw during pre-training? When would we expect the performance to degrade?

9. What modifications are needed to apply this framework to other types of unstructured data like images instead of text? Do LLMs still remain useful as factor proposers?

10. The paper focuses on observational data. How can this approach be extended to leverage experimental data where interventions are performed to test causality directly? Would that provide better feedback signals?
