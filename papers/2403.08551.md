# [GaussianImage: 1000 FPS Image Representation and Compression by 2D   Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08551)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Implicit neural representations (INRs) have shown promise for image representation and compression, but have major limitations in terms of slow training/inference speed, high GPU memory usage, and poor decoding efficiency. This hinders their deployment on low-end devices. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new paradigm called "GaussianImage" for image representation and compression using 2D Gaussian Splatting. 

- It represents images using a set of 2D Gaussians, each with 8 parameters - position, anisotropic covariance, color coefficients and opacity. This is far more compact than 3D Gaussians used in prior work.

- A novel accumulated summation based rasterization is proposed to render the image. This avoids issues with Gaussian sorting and alpha blending in prior Gaussian splatting methods. 

- For compression, attribute vector quantization and entropy coding is applied on the Gaussian parameters. Partial bits back coding can optionally be used to further reduce bitrate.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces first image representation and compression method using 2D Gaussian Splatting, with very efficient training and ultra-fast decoding.

- Achieves up to 5x faster training than INR methods, with 3x lower GPU memory usage, while maintaining visual quality. Rendering speed is up to 2000 FPS.

- Develops a neural image codec with rate-distortion performance competitive with leading approaches like COIN, but with 5-9x faster decoding over 1000 FPS.

- Provides comprehensive ablation studies and analyses to demonstrate the impact of key technical innovations.

In summary, the paper makes Gaussian splatting practical for image representation/compression for the first time, with exceptional efficiency gains over prior art. This opens up new possibilities for deployment of such learned representations on resource-constrained platforms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes GaussianImage, a new paradigm for efficient image representation and compression using 2D Gaussian splatting with a compact representation and novel accumulated summation blending that achieves fast training and rendering with low GPU memory usage while attaining competitive rate-distortion performance to implicit neural representation methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It presents a new paradigm of image representation and compression using 2D Gaussian Splatting. With compact 2D Gaussian representation and a novel rasterization method, this approach achieves high representation performance with short training duration, minimal GPU memory overhead and remarkably fast (2000 FPS) rendering speed.

2. It develops a low-complexity neural image codec using vector quantization. Furthermore, a partial bits-back coding technique is optionally used to reduce the bitrate. 

3. Experimental results show that compared to existing implicit neural representation (INR) methods, this approach achieves significant training and inference acceleration with less GPU memory usage while maintaining visual quality. As an image codec, it achieves compression performance competitive with state-of-the-art INR-based codecs like COIN and COIN++.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a brand new paradigm for efficient image representation and compression using concepts from 2D Gaussian Splatting. This explicit representation strategy enables faster training/inference and codec decoding speeds compared to implicit neural representations.
