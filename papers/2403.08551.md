# [GaussianImage: 1000 FPS Image Representation and Compression by 2D   Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08551)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Implicit neural representations (INRs) have shown promise for image representation and compression, but have major limitations in terms of slow training/inference speed, high GPU memory usage, and poor decoding efficiency. This hinders their deployment on low-end devices. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new paradigm called "GaussianImage" for image representation and compression using 2D Gaussian Splatting. 

- It represents images using a set of 2D Gaussians, each with 8 parameters - position, anisotropic covariance, color coefficients and opacity. This is far more compact than 3D Gaussians used in prior work.

- A novel accumulated summation based rasterization is proposed to render the image. This avoids issues with Gaussian sorting and alpha blending in prior Gaussian splatting methods. 

- For compression, attribute vector quantization and entropy coding is applied on the Gaussian parameters. Partial bits back coding can optionally be used to further reduce bitrate.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces first image representation and compression method using 2D Gaussian Splatting, with very efficient training and ultra-fast decoding.

- Achieves up to 5x faster training than INR methods, with 3x lower GPU memory usage, while maintaining visual quality. Rendering speed is up to 2000 FPS.

- Develops a neural image codec with rate-distortion performance competitive with leading approaches like COIN, but with 5-9x faster decoding over 1000 FPS.

- Provides comprehensive ablation studies and analyses to demonstrate the impact of key technical innovations.

In summary, the paper makes Gaussian splatting practical for image representation/compression for the first time, with exceptional efficiency gains over prior art. This opens up new possibilities for deployment of such learned representations on resource-constrained platforms.
