# [Towards Automated Readable Proofs of Ruler and Compass Constructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13700)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing systems can successfully generate construction steps for ruler and compass geometry problems. However, they do not provide readable, formal proofs that the constructions are correct. 
- Such proofs are important for education, so students understand why the constructions work.

Proposed Solution:  
- Integrate the ArgoTriCS automated triangle construction system with automated theorem provers for first order logic (FOL) and coherent logic.  
- ArgoTriCS generates construction steps and problem statements with geometry axioms/lemmas. 
- Automated provers use this to produce readable, formal proofs of correctness.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate an approach to automatically generate readable correctness proofs for geometric constructions. 
- ArgoTriCS sets up the problem statement and construction steps. Additional uniqueness and geometry lemmas are provided for proving.  
- General FOL and coherent logic provers can then produce synthetic proofs. Example proofs are shown.
- Coherent logic proofs can be formal and checked by interactive theorem provers.
- Implemented prototype for a subset of ruler/compass construction problems. FOL and coherent logic provers successfully proved correctness.
- Main goal is end-to-end formal proofs from basic axioms. This work shows progress towards that using high-level geometry lemmas.

In summary, the key idea is integrating an existing construction system with automated reasoning tools to produce readable, formal correctness proofs for geometric constructions. This has important applications in education. Early prototype results are promising.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper describes an approach for automatically generating readable, synthetic proofs of correctness for ruler and compass constructions found by the ArgoTriCS automated triangle construction solver by combining it with first-order logic and coherent logic theorem provers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is demonstrating how an automated system for generating ruler and compass construction steps (ArgoTriCS) can be combined with first-order logic and coherent logic provers to automatically generate readable proofs of correctness for the generated constructions. Specifically:

- ArgoTriCS can already automatically analyze construction problems and find the steps for ruler and compass constructions to solve most problems in a standard problem set (Wernick's corpus). 

- What has been missing is the ability to also automatically generate classic, human-readable proofs that the constructions are correct. This is important for using the system in mathematical education.

- This paper shows a prototype of integrating ArgoTriCS with automated theorem provers to generate readable correctness proofs for constructions found by ArgoTriCS. They test it on a subset of Wernick's problem set.

- The key ideas are: (1) ArgoTriCS generates the construction steps and problem statement; (2) Additional lemmas for proving uniqueness and other geometry facts are provided to the provers; (3) The provers (Vampire and Larus) can then generate readable proofs, with Larus producing fully coherent logic proofs.

So in summary, the main contribution is demonstrating the feasibility of automatically generating readable correctness proofs for ruler and compass constructions, by integrating a construction solver with automated reasoning.

The main focus seems to be on using automated theorem provers and the ArgoTriCS system to generate readable, synthetic proofs of correctness for ruler and compass triangle constructions. It discusses combining coherent logic and first-order logic provers to produce proofs that are understandable for students in an educational context, while also being formal enough to be machine checkable. Key goals include automating the analysis, construction, and proof phases of geometry constructions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper for generating readable proofs of geometric constructions:

1. The paper mentions using both first-order logic (FOL) and coherent logic automated theorem provers. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach for generating readable proofs in this domain? In what situations might one approach be preferred over the other?

2. Uniqueness lemmas, such as those stating properties of triangles are unique (e.g. the circumcircle), play an important role in the proofs. What challenges arise in properly formulating these lemmas without missing key preconditions? How can we ensure the correctness of the uniqueness axioms?

3. The proofs rely on many high-level geometry lemmas provided to the automated provers. What is the risk of inconsistency or unsound proofs if these lemmas contain errors? How can the soundness of the overall approach be guaranteed?  

4. How difficult is it to encode the necessary geometric axioms and inference rules within the coherent logic prover? What aspects of automated geometric theorem proving make this challenging?

5. To what extent can providing "hints" to the prover, in the form of intermediate lemmas, undermine full automation or introduce bias into the constructed proofs? How can high-level guidance be balanced with proof independence?

6. The examples show proofs structured very differently from the constructions themselves. Does this reflect fundamental differences between analysis and proof in geometry? If so, how should automation strategies differ between construction and proof?

7. Are there additional mechanics or features that could be incorporated into the coherent logic prover to reduce the need for hinted lemmas and increase readable proof generation capability?

8. How difficult would it be to scale up the approach to handle more complex geometric constructions and proofs? What barriers exist to expanding the scope?

9. The paper focuses on triangle constructions and proofs. How much of the approach could generalize to other common geometric figures and their properties? What new axioms would need encoding?

10. The ultimate goal is fully mechanically checked proofs from basic axioms. Realizing this in systems like Coq or Isabelle will require significant effort. What are the open challenges to achieve this for geometry proofs? How far away is this goal?
