# [RVT: Robotic View Transformer for 3D Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14896)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:Can we develop a 3D object manipulation method that is both scalable and accurate, overcoming limitations of prior methods that rely on voxel representations or only use camera images? The key hypothesis is that a multi-view transformer architecture that jointly attends over re-rendered views of the scene can achieve strong manipulation performance while retaining the scalability benefits of image-based methods.In summary, the paper proposes a multi-view transformer called RVT that aims to be both accurate for 3D manipulation tasks and scalable in terms of training time and compute requirements. RVT is evaluated on a range of simulated and real-world tasks to test this hypothesis.
