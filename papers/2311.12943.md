# [InteRACT: Transformer Models for Human Intent Prediction Conditioned on   Robot Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12943)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes InteRACT, a novel transformer-based architecture for predicting human intent in collaborative human-robot manipulation tasks. The key insight is to condition the prediction on the robot's future planned actions. This allows capturing the interdependency between human intent and robot actions. The authors collect a paired human-robot interaction dataset by teleoperating a 7-DOF robot arm. This enables fine-tuning models pre-trained on more readily available human-human interaction data, while aligning human and robot representations. Experiments across three human-human and three human-robot collaborative tasks demonstrate that conditioning intent prediction on robot actions outperforms marginal baselines. Additional gains are achieved by incorporating alignment losses between paired human-robot motion. The results validate the importance of leveraging both large synthetic human activity datasets and real human-human interaction data for more accurate human intent predictions. By open-sourcing the collected paired dataset and methodology, this work enables further research into conditional models for human-robot collaboration.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel transformer-based architecture, InteRACT, that can predict human intent in collaborative manipulation tasks by conditioning on future robot actions, and introduces techniques to collect a paired human-robot interaction dataset to enable transfer learning from more readily available human-human interaction data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel transformer-based architecture called InteRACT that can predict human intent conditioned on future robot actions for collaborative manipulation. 

2. Introducing a technique to collect a paired human-robot dataset via tele-operation of a 7-DoF robot arm. This allows fine-tuning models with aligned human and robot representations. The paper also open-sources a first dataset of human-robot collaborative manipulation. 

3. Demonstrating that the proposed conditional intent prediction model shows improved performance over marginal baselines on multiple real-world datasets of both human-human and human-robot interaction.

So in summary, the key contribution is developing a new way to model the interdependency between human intent and robot actions by conditioning intent predictions on future robot actions. The paper also contributes new datasets and model training techniques to enable learning such conditional models.
