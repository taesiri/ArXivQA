# [Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12109)

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using Monarch matrices, a class of structured matrices that generalize the FFT, as a sub-quadratic mixing operator in machine learning architectures. How do Monarch matrices achieve sub-quadratic computational complexity? What are the tradeoffs in expressiveness vs efficiency with different choices of the order p?

2. The paper builds architectures like BERT and GPT entirely out of Monarch matrices. What modifications were required to make Monarch matrices causal for autoregressive modeling? How does the theory of polynomial manipulation developed in the paper ensure causality? 

3. For non-causal modeling like BERT, the paper shows improved throughput over Transformers. What are the relative bottlenecks in Monarch matrix architectures compared to Transformers? How could optimizations like kernel fusion help improve throughput further?

4. The paper evaluates Monarch matrices on a range of modalities like text, image, speech, and synthetic data. Are there any modalities where Monarch architectures seem particularly suitable or unsuitable? How do design choices affect suitability?

5. The paper proposes using Monarch matrices for both mixing across sequence length and across model dimension. What are the tradeoffs between using the same vs different classes of matrices along each axis?

6. How does the performance of Monarch matrix architectures compare to other approaches for efficient Transformers, like sparse attention, kernel methods, or linear attention? What are relative advantages and disadvantages?

7. The paper focuses on replacement of attention and MLP blocks. What other neural network components could potentially be replaced by Monarch operations? What would be required?

8. What are the implications of the strong empirical results on causal language modeling? Does this indicate potential promise for attention-free architectures in generative settings?

9. What modifications would be needed to scale Monarch architectures to even longer sequences or larger models than studied in the paper? Are there any fundamental limitations?

10. The paper provides a simple PyTorch implementation of Monarch layers. What would be required to build an optimized high-performance Monarch matrix library? What optimizations beyond kernel fusion could help?


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the proposal and analysis of the Monarch Mixer (M2) architecture. The key ideas are:

- Monarch Mixer uses Monarch matrices to mix information along both the sequence length and model dimensions. Monarch matrices are a class of structured matrices that can capture many useful linear transforms (convolutions, Toeplitz matrices, etc) and have sub-quadratic computational complexity.  

- The architecture scales sub-quadratically in both sequence length and model dimension, unlike the quadratic scaling of Transformer architectures. This could enable modeling longer sequences and larger models more efficiently.

- Monarch Mixer is simple to implement, requiring just matrix multiplies, transposes, reshapes, and elementwise operations. The provided PyTorch implementation is under 40 lines.

- It is hardware efficient, exploiting fast GEMM implementations and achieving much higher FLOP utilization than approaches based solely on FFTs.

- Monarch Mixer matches or exceeds the quality of Transformers in non-causal settings like BERT and ViT, while using fewer parameters in some cases. It also achieves promising results in causal settings by using a polynomial view to enforce causality.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Monarch Mixer as a simple, efficient, and high quality architecture for sequence modeling that scales sub-quadratically along both key dimensions. The paper analyzes it theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its potential as an alternative to Transformers.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper introduces a new neural network architecture called Monarch Mixer (M2) that aims to be more efficient in sequence length and model dimension compared to architectures like the Transformer. This goal of greater efficiency aligns with other recent work exploring alternatives to the quadratic scaling of self-attention, like models based on convolutional layers, low-rank approximations, sparse attention, etc. 

- A main contribution of this paper is proposing Monarch matrices, a class of structured matrices, as a building block that can scale sub-quadratically. Monarch matrices generalize operations like the FFT and various polynomial transforms. Other work has proposed related structured matrix classes, like Toeplitz matrices, circulant matrices, neural kernels, etc. 

- The paper shows promising results matching or exceeding Transformer models on major NLP tasks using the proposed M2 architecture. This demonstrates the potential of exploring alternatives to attention and dense layers. However, Transformers remain state-of-the-art on most tasks, so more research is needed to conclusively show the capabilities of non-attention-based models.

- The paper introduces innovations like a polynomial view of Monarch matrices to make the architecture causal, and block algorithms to make computation efficient. These theoretical contributions add new techniques and insights for working with structured matrices in ML models.

- M2 aims for a simple architecture based purely on matrix operations like GEMM, avoiding complex components like attention. Some other work like MLP Mixer has a similar motivation of exploring simpler alternatives to Transformers.

In summary, this paper makes meaningful contributions in proposing Monarch matrices and the M2 architecture as a potential path towards more efficient sequence and dimension scaling. But existing Transformers remain dominant, so further research is needed to fully demonstrate the capabilities of these ideas in practice across different domains. The theoretical tools introduced could see broader applications in structured matrix techniques for ML.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Further optimizing the M2 layer for better runtime performance, such as through kernel fusion techniques. The authors mention there is still room to improve the implementation and optimization of the M2 operator.

- Exploring the applicability and performance of M2 layers in other domains beyond the ones tested in the paper. The authors have shown promising results on language modeling, image classification and speech, but think M2 may have broader applicability.

- Extending the theory and analysis to other polynomial bases beyond the ones used for defining Monarch matrices. The authors discuss the potential to explore analogs of their techniques in bases like Chebyshev or orthogonal polynomials.

- Generalizing the theoretical results on causality and polynomial manipulations to broader classes of evaluation points. The current results rely on specific properties of the roots of unity, and extending this could allow more flexible parameterizations. 

- Avoiding the quadratic blowup in sequence length when converting the model to causal, currently needed for the theoretical guarantees. Reducing the blowup to linear would allow more efficient causal modeling.

- Reducing the number of parameters needed to represent the constrained Monarch factors that guarantee causality. Currently these require more parameters than the core Monarch formulation.

- Further analysis and experimentation to better understand the properties, tradeoffs and potential limitations compared to Transformers. More work is needed to fully characterize the pros/cons.

So in summary, key directions are further optimization and engineering of the core method, broadening the theoretical analysis, and more rigorous characterization of how the approach compares to established techniques like Transformers across different domains and applications.
