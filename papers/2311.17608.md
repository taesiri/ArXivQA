# [Adversarial Robust Memory-Based Continual Learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17608)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach to achieve adversarial robustness in continual learning settings. The authors first analyze the interaction between adversarial training and continual learning, finding that adversarial training exacerbates forgetting in continual learners. To mitigate this, they introduce Adversarial-aware Feature Calibration Layers (AFLC) which suppresses the impact of adversarial gradients on old task heads to alleviate forgetting. Additionally, they propose Robustness-aware Experience Replay (RAER) to select the most informative and robust samples for replay based on prediction variance and adversarial confidence score. Experiments on Split CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet show their method substantially enhances robustness and mitigates forgetting when combined with existing continual learning techniques like experience replay, gradient-based sampling, and logit masking. Notably, their approach achieves consistent gains over multiple metrics like final accuracy, forgetting, and robustness against PGD and AutoAttack over a range of buffer sizes. The authors also demonstrate the generalizability of their defense against adaptive attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a robust adversarial continual learning approach that jointly leverages adversarial focused logit calibration and robust adversarial example replay to enhance adversarial robustness while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method to achieve adversarial robust continual learning. Specifically, the paper proposes two components:

1) Adversarial Forgetting-aware Logit Calibration (AFLC): This reduces the negative impact of adversarial gradients on past task outputs by calibrating the logits for old classes. This helps mitigate forgetting of past tasks. 

2) Robustness-Aware Experience Replay (RAER): This selects those replay samples which are robust and representative to store in the memory buffer. Storing robust and diverse samples helps improve overall robustness against adversarial attacks. 

By combining these two components, the paper is able to achieve improved performance on continual learning benchmarks like Split-CIFAR and Split-TinyImagenet, in terms of both clean and robust accuracy as well as alleviation of forgetting. The consistent gains demonstrate the capability of the proposed method to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks in continual learning settings.

In summary, the main contribution is a new approach to achieve adversarial robust continual learning by proposing AFLC and RAER to mitigate forgetting while improving robustness to adversarial perturbations.
