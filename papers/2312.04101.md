# [Edge computing service deployment and task offloading based on   multi-task high-dimensional multi-objective optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04101)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-task high-dimensional multi-objective optimization (MT-HD-MOO) model to concurrently optimize service deployment and task offloading in edge computing environments. The model incorporates four objectives for each problem: latency, energy consumption, cost, and an additional objective of network reliability for service deployment and load balancing for task offloading. To solve the MT-HD-MOO model, the authors design a multi-objective multitask evolutionary algorithm based on multiple selection strategies (MOMFEA-MS). MOMFEA-MS constructs a pool of selection strategies using vector angle-based, tournament-based, and grid-based selection to enhance population diversity. It also employs a vertical culture transfer technique to enable knowledge transfer between solutions. Experiments compare MOMFEA-MS to state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms on the MT-HD-MOO model. Results show MOMFEA-MS achieves better objective values and convergence over the compared algorithms, demonstrating the efficacy of the multiple selection strategy pool and vertical culture transfer approach in solving the concurrent service deployment and task offloading optimization problem.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenges of service deployment and task offloading in multi-access edge computing (MEC) environments. Specifically, it considers a multi-user MEC system with multiple edge clouds (servers) and mobile users. The goals are to optimize service deployment across edge clouds to minimize latency, energy, cost, and maximize reliability; and to optimize task offloading from mobile devices to edge clouds to minimize latency, energy, cost while balancing load. Solving these two problems jointly is framed as a multi-task high-dimensional multi-objective optimization (MT-HD-MOO) problem.

Solution:
The paper proposes a MT-HD-MOO algorithm based on a multi-selection strategy to solve the joint service deployment and task offloading problem. Separate multi-objective models are built for service deployment and task offloading, considering four objectives each - latency, energy, cost, and reliability/load balancing. The two problems are then jointly optimized using the multi-task algorithm, which exploits their similarity to improve optimization efficiency. 

The proposed MOMFEA-MS algorithm employs multiple selection strategies to construct a diverse pool of selection policies, helping retain elite individuals in the population. It also uses vertical cultural transmission to enable transfer of skill factors between solutions to enhance knowledge transfer between the two tasks.

Main Contributions:

- Formulation of service deployment and task offloading as a MT-HD-MOO problem in MEC systems, considering network reliability and load balancing as additional objectives.

- A MT-HD-MOO algorithm based on multi-selection strategies which constructs a selection pool to increase population diversity and preserve elites.

- Enhanced optimization efficiency by concurrently optimizing the two problems using multi-tasking to leverage their similarity.

- Evaluation on a simulation testbed demonstrating improved performance over state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms.

In summary, the paper provides an effective solution for joint service deployment and task offloading in MEC systems by framing it as a MT-HD-MOO problem and designing a suitable algorithm. The highlights are the multi-task formulation and the multi-selection strategy design.
