# [Edge computing service deployment and task offloading based on   multi-task high-dimensional multi-objective optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04101)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-task high-dimensional multi-objective optimization (MT-HD-MOO) model to concurrently optimize service deployment and task offloading in edge computing environments. The model incorporates four objectives for each problem: latency, energy consumption, cost, and an additional objective of network reliability for service deployment and load balancing for task offloading. To solve the MT-HD-MOO model, the authors design a multi-objective multitask evolutionary algorithm based on multiple selection strategies (MOMFEA-MS). MOMFEA-MS constructs a pool of selection strategies using vector angle-based, tournament-based, and grid-based selection to enhance population diversity. It also employs a vertical culture transfer technique to enable knowledge transfer between solutions. Experiments compare MOMFEA-MS to state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms on the MT-HD-MOO model. Results show MOMFEA-MS achieves better objective values and convergence over the compared algorithms, demonstrating the efficacy of the multiple selection strategy pool and vertical culture transfer approach in solving the concurrent service deployment and task offloading optimization problem.
