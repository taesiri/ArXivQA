# [RoCode: A Dataset for Measuring Code Intelligence from Problem   Definitions in Romanian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13222)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing code intelligence benchmarks and models are focused on English, lacking support for other languages. There are no datasets to evaluate code generation from native language (non-English) prompts.
- Current Romanian language models (RoGPT-2, GPT-Neo-Ro) are small, trained without code data and perform poorly on coding tasks.
- Multilingual models also perform poorly on Romanian coding tasks. Translation is an imperfect solution.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce RoCode, the first competitive programming dataset with 2,642 problems defined in native Romanian language. 
- Problems have multiple solutions in C/C++ and Python, alongside comprehensive test suites to evaluate solution correctness.
- Solutions exhibit "code-code switching" - code keywords in English but comments/variables in Romanian.
- Dataset contains train/dev/test splits to benchmark code generation models.

Main Contributions:
- First dataset to measure code intelligence from Romanian language prompts
- Analysis of existing model performance on RoCode - no current model able to achieve reasonable scores
- Argument for need to develop native language coding models instead of just translating English benchmarks
- RoCode enables future research directions in monolingual Romanian coding models and code generation for non-English languages

The paper makes a case for native language coding models and benchmarks to increase accessibility and democratization of coding. RoCode is posed as a first dataset to facilitate research in this direction for Romanian language.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents RoCode, the first competitive programming dataset with 2,642 problems written in Romanian alongside solutions and test cases, meant to benchmark code intelligence capabilities of language models on non-English languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors propose RoCode, the first dataset for measuring code intelligence from problem definitions written in Romanian. The dataset contains 2,642 programming problems with solutions and test cases.

2. They provide benchmark results on RoCode for existing Romanian language models (RoGPT-2 and GPT-Neo-Ro) and some English-oriented models. None of the models achieve good performance, showing that RoCode is challenging.  

3. The paper serves as a position paper, arguing for the need to develop multilingual and monolingual non-English code intelligence models. The authors discuss limitations of current models and provide potential future research directions in this area.

In summary, the key contribution is the new RoCode dataset to facilitate research on code intelligence for the Romanian language. The paper also makes a case for building specialized models for languages other than English through an extensive discussion of models' limitations on the proposed dataset.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper are:

- code intelligence
- language models
- dataset
- code-switching
- Romanian
- competitive programming
- natural language to programming language (NL-PL)
- low-code platforms
- multilingual systems
- monolingual models
- code generation
- non-English languages

The paper introduces a new dataset called "RoCode" which consists of programming problems and solutions written in Romanian. The goal is to provide a benchmark for evaluating code intelligence capabilities of language models trained on Romanian or multilingual text. 

Some key themes explored in the paper include: the dominance of English-language programming resources, the concept of "code-code-switching" where code contains a mix of languages, the lack of non-English code intelligence models, and the need for more programming language resources and models in other native languages. The RoCode dataset aims to help further research in these areas for the Romanian language.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes RoCode, the first dataset for measuring code intelligence from problem definitions written in Romanian. What are some key differences between RoCode and existing competitive programming datasets like APPS? How does the Romanian language component provide additional challenges?

2. The paper argues that most existing code intelligence models and benchmarks are implicitly English-oriented. What evidence supports this claim? Why is a Romanian-focused benchmark like RoCode needed, beyond just enabling programming democratization?  

3. The paper finds that no existing Romanian language models are able to produce valid code from the problem descriptions. What are some potential reasons discussed for this poor performance? How might future research directions address these limitations?

4. The paper observes a phenomenon called "code-code-switching" in the human-written solutions. What is code-code-switching and what evidence is provided for its presence? How did the model-generated solutions compare in their use of code-switching?

5. For the English-oriented models benchmarked, what explanations are given for their low but non-zero performance? Could the passing of some test cases indicate model robustness or some form of data leakage? Elaborate.  

6. The paper concludes that translation is not a viable long-term solution for multilingual code intelligence. Explain this position using both the negative results from translated prompts as well as conceptual arguments around translation limitations.

7. The curated dataset contains candidate solutions in C/C++ and Python. Discuss the process and rationale behind additionally providing auto-transpiled Python solutions using a separate model. What are the potential benefits of having Python solutions?

8. The paper utilizes accuracy metrics like strict accuracy and pass@k that are customized for measuring code solution correctness. Explain what these metrics capture and why they are suitable for evaluating performance on programming problems.  

9. The process for determining problem difficulty involves metrics like user scores and problem recency. Why were these specific signals chosen as proxies for problem difficulty? How reliable are they compared to a human-labeled dataset?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on textual problem descriptions for code generation. How might incorporating additional modalities like diagrams, input-output examples, etc. make the tasks more tractable while retaining complexity? What research would be needed to take advantage of multiple modalities?
