# [RoCode: A Dataset for Measuring Code Intelligence from Problem   Definitions in Romanian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13222)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing code intelligence benchmarks and models are focused on English, lacking support for other languages. There are no datasets to evaluate code generation from native language (non-English) prompts.
- Current Romanian language models (RoGPT-2, GPT-Neo-Ro) are small, trained without code data and perform poorly on coding tasks.
- Multilingual models also perform poorly on Romanian coding tasks. Translation is an imperfect solution.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce RoCode, the first competitive programming dataset with 2,642 problems defined in native Romanian language. 
- Problems have multiple solutions in C/C++ and Python, alongside comprehensive test suites to evaluate solution correctness.
- Solutions exhibit "code-code switching" - code keywords in English but comments/variables in Romanian.
- Dataset contains train/dev/test splits to benchmark code generation models.

Main Contributions:
- First dataset to measure code intelligence from Romanian language prompts
- Analysis of existing model performance on RoCode - no current model able to achieve reasonable scores
- Argument for need to develop native language coding models instead of just translating English benchmarks
- RoCode enables future research directions in monolingual Romanian coding models and code generation for non-English languages

The paper makes a case for native language coding models and benchmarks to increase accessibility and democratization of coding. RoCode is posed as a first dataset to facilitate research in this direction for Romanian language.
