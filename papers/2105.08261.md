# KECRS: Towards Knowledge-Enriched Conversational Recommendation System

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1) How to improve conversational recommendation systems (CRS) to generate more diverse and informative responses while providing accurate recommendations? 2) Whether introducing knowledge graphs (KG) as external knowledge can help CRS better understand user's intentions and generate more informative responses?3) Whether aligning the representation spaces of words and entities in different modules of CRS can help improve the model's ability to generate informative responses?4) Whether constructing a high-quality domain-specific KG can further improve the performances of CRS compared to using existing open-domain KGs?The authors propose a Knowledge-Enriched Conversational Recommendation System (KECRS) to address these questions. Specifically, they introduce two losses - the Bag-of-Entity loss and the infusion loss - to integrate KG knowledge into CRS to generate more diverse and informative responses. They also construct a movie domain KG to provide higher quality external knowledge. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in improving both recommendation accuracy and response quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.In summary, the key hypotheses are around leveraging KG knowledge and representation alignment to improve CRS performance, which are validated through empirical experiments in this work. The construction of a high-quality domain KG is also shown to be beneficial.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Reformulating the conversational recommendation task to highlight that recommended items should be new and possibly interested by users. 2. Proposing a Knowledge-Enriched Conversational Recommendation System (KECRS) that can generate more informative and diverse responses by better integrating knowledge graph into the model through two proposed losses - Bag-of-Entity (BOE) loss and infusion loss.3. Constructing a high-quality knowledge graph called The Movie Domain Knowledge Graph (TMDKG) to facilitate research on conversational recommendation systems.4. Experimental results demonstrating that KECRS outperforms state-of-the-art conversational recommendation systems in both recommendation accuracy and response quality. The proposed BOE and infusion losses are shown to be effective. Using TMDKG also improves performance of both KECRS and baseline methods.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new conversational recommendation system KECRS that can provide more accurate recommendations and generate better responses by effectively incorporating knowledge graphs, through novel loss functions and a domain-specific knowledge graph. The effectiveness of KECRS and its components is validated through extensive experiments.
