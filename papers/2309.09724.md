# [Robust Geometry-Preserving Depth Estimation Using Differentiable   Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09724)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we train monocular depth estimation models to predict geometry-preserving depth up to scale for accurate 3D scene reconstruction, without requiring extra datasets or annotations, through mix-dataset training?

The key hypothesis is that by rendering novel views of reconstructed scenes and designing losses to promote consistency of depth prediction across views, the model can learn to produce undistorted 3D structures from depth. This allows mix-dataset training without extra data/annotations.

In summary, the paper focuses on enabling robust 3D scene structure recovery from monocular images by developing depth estimators that can generalize well across diverse scenes while preserving geometric integrity, which is a challenge for existing mix-dataset trained models. The core ideas are around using differentiable rendering and multi-view consistency losses to achieve this goal in a data-efficient manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a learning framework to train depth estimation models to predict geometry-preserving depth without requiring extra datasets or annotations. The key ideas are:

- Using differentiable rendering to reconstruct 3D point clouds from predicted depth maps and render novel views. 

- Designing consistency losses between rendered views and original views to promote geometry-preserving depth predictions.

- Showing the consistency losses can also recover domain-specific scale/shift coefficients and estimate focal length in a self-supervised manner.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a method to enable robust 3D scene reconstruction from monocular images using mix-dataset trained depth estimators, without needing extra data or supervision. Experiments show it outperforms prior arts in recovering geometrically accurate depth and 3D structures.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a learning method to train depth estimation models to predict geometry-preserving depth for accurate 3D reconstruction from monocular images, without needing extra datasets or annotations, by rendering novel views of the reconstructed scene and enforcing consistency of predictions across views through differentiable rendering.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key comparisons between this paper and other related works on monocular depth estimation and 3D scene reconstruction:

- Most prior depth estimation models are trained on single datasets and have limited generalization ability across diverse scenes. This paper focuses on mix-dataset training, which combines data from various sources to improve generalization. 

- Existing mix-dataset training methods use scale-and-shift invariant losses, but the depth predictions are geometrically incomplete due to the unknown shift. This limits their direct use for 3D reconstruction. This paper aims to produce geometry-preserving depth without extra supervision.

- Previous works require additional 3D datasets or ground truth metric depth to rectify the distorted point clouds from mix-dataset trained models. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel framework using differentiable rendering and consistency losses to achieve this goal without extra data.

- Compared to self-supervised methods that leverage stereo video or images, this work focuses on monocular training and does not assume access to multi-view data. The proposed consistency loss acts as self-supervision but only requires a single image.

- For focal length estimation, prior work trains a separate module with 3D data. This paper demonstrates that the proposed consistency loss can also estimate focal length by selecting the value that minimizes inconsistency.

- Experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art depth estimation models on benchmark datasets in terms of 3D reconstruction metrics without requiring extra training data or annotations.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a geometry-preserving depth estimation framework that supports robust mix-dataset training without needing additional data/supervision, which is a practical solution for real-world generalization. The consistency losses act as a form of self-supervision to achieve this goal.
