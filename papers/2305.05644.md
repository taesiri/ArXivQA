# [Towards Building the Federated GPT: Federated Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05644)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. Can federated learning (FL) be effectively leveraged as a framework for instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs)? 2. Will federated instruction tuning of LLMs allow for improved model performance by exploiting the heterogeneous/diverse sets of instructions available across users' local devices, compared to just using limited local instructions from each user?3. Can parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA enable feasible deployment of instruction tuning within an FL framework by reducing communication costs and making it compatible with the limited compute of edge devices?4. Does the proposed Federated Instruction Tuning (FedIT) framework outperform baseline LLMs tuned on individual limited local instruction sets, and approach the performance of centralized tuning on the full pooled dataset?5. Can the introduced Shepherd platform provide a useful and flexible framework to facilitate research into federated instruction tuning of LLMs?The central hypothesis appears to be that leveraging FL for instruction tuning of LLMs will enable tapping into diverse decentralized instructional data to improve model generalization, while overcoming the limitations around data privacy, access control, and compute constraints faced in traditional centralized tuning. The experiments and results aim to validate if the proposed FedIT framework and Shepherd platform can effectively achieve these hypothesized benefits.In summary, the key research questions focus on investigating FL as a technique for instruction tuning of LLMs, evaluating its benefits compared to centralized and individual local tuning, and providing an accessible platform to further research in this direction. The hypothesis is that FL-based instruction tuning can unlock the advantages of decentralized diverse instructional data for LLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the key contributions of this paper appear to be:1. It proposes a new approach called Federated Instruction Tuning (FedIT) that leverages federated learning (FL) as the learning framework for instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs). This represents the first attempt to explore FL for LLM instruction tuning.2. It provides an analysis of the heterogeneity in the instruction datasets used for FedIT training. The authors use the Databricks-dolly-15k dataset with different categories of instructions to highlight how FedIT can take advantage of diverse local instruction datasets on client devices. 3. It incorporates the parameter-efficient tuning method LoRA into the FedIT framework to reduce computational/communication costs for resource-constrained edge devices.4. It introduces a GitHub repository called "Shepherd" that implements the proposed FedIT approach and provides a flexible framework for exploring federated fine-tuning of LLMs.5. It presents qualitative analyses using automatic evaluation with GPT-4 and example demonstrations to show the effectiveness of FedIT in improving LLM performance compared to baseline methods like centralized training or training on limited local instructions.In summary, the core novel contribution is the proposal of FedIT, which exploits federated learning to enable instruction tuning of LLMs using diverse decentralized instruction data while preserving privacy. The GitHub framework also facilitates further research in this direction.
