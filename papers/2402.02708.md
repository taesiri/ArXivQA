# [CRANE: A Redundant, Multi-Degree-of-Freedom Computed Tomography Robot   for Heightened Needle Dexterity within a Medical Imaging Bore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02708)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Computed tomography (CT) guided needle insertion procedures like biopsies and ablations require high accuracy to reach small targets. However, freehand manual insertion suffers from limited accuracy. As a result, these procedures often require multiple needle insertion attempts, increasing costs, risks and radiation exposure.

- Existing CT-guided robots have limitations like complex setup, limited workspace and applicability, insufficient accuracy, and lack of compatibility with different needles. These limitations have prevented wider clinical adoption.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents CRANE, a robotic system focused on dexterity, accuracy and safety for in-bore CT-guided needle procedures. 

- CRANE uses a redundant serial link arm with 8 degrees of freedom. It has a cable-driven design with motors located outside the bore to minimize artifacts while allowing dexterous manipulation inside the bore.

- An automated planning and control method is proposed that allows automatic device setup and needle insertion towards user-specified targets, while avoiding collisions.

Main Contributions:

1. A robot arm design focused on dexterity and precision using cable drives, redundancy and extensive sensing for accuracy and safety.

2. A method for automated in-bore setup and planning that removes the burden of manual device positioning from the user.

3. Comprehensive dexterity evaluation method considering variety of patient morphology and insertion constraints.

4. Novel needle clutching mechanism for both active and passive needle manipulation.

- Experiments demonstrate CRANE's ability to accurately reach insertion targets across different patient models. Feasibility is shown via phantom studies performed inside a CT scanner bore.

In summary, CRANE aims to improve accuracy, safety and workflow for in-bore CT-guided procedures through innovations in mechanical design and automation. Its performance is validated in simulation and benchtop experiments.
