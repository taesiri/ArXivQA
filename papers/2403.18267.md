# [DSF-GAN: DownStream Feedback Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18267)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating synthetic tabular data with high utility that matches the performance of models trained on real data remains a challenge. Despite advances in improving the privacy of synthetic data using GANs, the utility of synthetic tabular data lags behind real data. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel GAN architecture called DownStream Feedback GAN (DSF-GAN) that incorporates feedback from a downstream prediction model during training to improve the utility of the generated synthetic samples. 

The key idea is to augment the generator's loss function with additional terms that measure the performance of a downstream classifier or regressor trained on the synthetic samples, evaluated on a held-out validation set of real samples. This helps steer the generator to produce synthetic samples that are more useful for the downstream task.

Specifically, the regression loss (RMSE) or classification loss (log loss) of the downstream model is added to the generator's loss, scaled by a hyperparameter Î». This feedback signal is only introduced after training the GAN for N/2 epochs without it.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new GAN architecture DSF-GAN that uses downstream performance feedback to improve utility of synthetic tabular data
- Empirically demonstrates improved classification precision/recall and regression RMSE/R2 when models are trained on DSF-GAN synthetic data vs vanilla GAN data
- Evaluates DSF-GAN on two real-world tabular datasets (adult census and house pricing) and shows consistent utility improvements
- Open sources code and data to promote reproducibility

In summary, the key innovation is using downstream model performance rather than sample realism to steer GAN training, to directly optimize the utility of synthetic samples for a target machine learning task. The paper shows promising initial results on this idea.
