# [LHMKE: A Large-scale Holistic Multi-subject Knowledge Evaluation   Benchmark for Chinese Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12601)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating Chinese language models (LLMs) are insufficient for comprehensively measuring the knowledge they have acquired. 
- Current datasets focus on multiple choice questions, lacking diversity in question types.
- Subjective questions are needed to evaluate LLMs more holistically, but require manual scoring.  

Proposed Solution - LHMKE:
- A large-scale, holistic, multi-subject knowledge benchmark for Chinese LLMs.
- Covers entire Chinese education spectrum from primary school to career exams.
- Contains 10,465 questions over 75 tasks and 30 subjects.
- Includes both objective and subjective questions from standard Chinese exams.
- Explores using advanced LLMs like GPT-4 to automatically score subjective questions.

Main Contributions:
- Construction of LHMKE - the most comprehensive Chinese LLM benchmark with widest variety of question types matched to major Chinese education system. 
- Testing of 11 major Chinese LLMs under zero-shot setting and analysis of performance across different subjects.
- Exploration of methods for scoring subjective questions, finding GPT-4 with careful prompting best matches human scorers.
- Public release of dataset and evaluation scripts to serve as advanced testbed for capabilities of Chinese LLMs.

In summary, the paper introduces LHMKE, a diverse and challenging benchmark tailored to the Chinese education context for evaluating knowledge and capabilities of Chinese language models across a broad range of question types and subjects. Detailed experiments show current models still struggle on this benchmark, presenting opportunities for progress.
