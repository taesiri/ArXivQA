# [LHMKE: A Large-scale Holistic Multi-subject Knowledge Evaluation   Benchmark for Chinese Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12601)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating Chinese language models (LLMs) are insufficient for comprehensively measuring the knowledge they have acquired. 
- Current datasets focus on multiple choice questions, lacking diversity in question types.
- Subjective questions are needed to evaluate LLMs more holistically, but require manual scoring.  

Proposed Solution - LHMKE:
- A large-scale, holistic, multi-subject knowledge benchmark for Chinese LLMs.
- Covers entire Chinese education spectrum from primary school to career exams.
- Contains 10,465 questions over 75 tasks and 30 subjects.
- Includes both objective and subjective questions from standard Chinese exams.
- Explores using advanced LLMs like GPT-4 to automatically score subjective questions.

Main Contributions:
- Construction of LHMKE - the most comprehensive Chinese LLM benchmark with widest variety of question types matched to major Chinese education system. 
- Testing of 11 major Chinese LLMs under zero-shot setting and analysis of performance across different subjects.
- Exploration of methods for scoring subjective questions, finding GPT-4 with careful prompting best matches human scorers.
- Public release of dataset and evaluation scripts to serve as advanced testbed for capabilities of Chinese LLMs.

In summary, the paper introduces LHMKE, a diverse and challenging benchmark tailored to the Chinese education context for evaluating knowledge and capabilities of Chinese language models across a broad range of question types and subjects. Detailed experiments show current models still struggle on this benchmark, presenting opportunities for progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces LHMKE, a large-scale, comprehensive Chinese benchmark spanning primary school to professional exams with over 10,000 questions of varying types to evaluate knowledge capabilities of Chinese language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces LHMKE, a comprehensive, multi-subject knowledge evaluation benchmark for Chinese large language models. LHMKE encompasses the largest number of question types aligned with the major Chinese education system.

2. It conducts tests on a broad range of latest open-source Chinese LLMs tuned by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback under a zero-shot setting. 

3. It evaluates the performance of each LLM across different subjects in LHMKE. It also explores various evaluation methods for automatically scoring LLM-generated answers to subjective questions in LHMKE.

4. It releases LHMKE (data and evaluation scripts) to serve as a new testbed for evaluating and analyzing Chinese LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of LHMKE as a holistic and challenging benchmark for assessing the knowledge acquisition capabilities of Chinese LLMs across a wide range of educational levels and subjects.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the key terms and keywords associated with this paper are:

Chinese LLMs, Evaluation Benchmark, Knowledge Evaluation

These keywords encapsulate the main focus of the paper, which is proposing a new large-scale benchmark called LHMKE for comprehensively evaluating the knowledge acquisition capabilities of Chinese large language models across a diverse range of subjects and question types. Specifically:

- "Chinese LLMs" indicates that the benchmark is designed for assessing Chinese language models.

- "Evaluation Benchmark" reflects that the paper introduces a new testbed/dataset for evaluating models. 

- "Knowledge Evaluation" highlights that a core objective of LHMKE is assessing the knowledge captured by models across various subjects through different types of exam questions.

So in summary, the keywords succinctly summarize the key contribution of the paper in developing a holistic, multi-subject knowledge benchmark tailored for Chinese LLMs. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces both objective and subjective questions into the benchmark. What are some of the key challenges in evaluating subjective questions, and how does the method address this?

2. The paper uses GPT-4 as an automatic evaluator for scoring subjective questions. What modifications or additions were made to the prompt given to GPT-4 compared to a generic prompt? How did this impact scoring accuracy?

3. The paper explores both careful prompting and multi-agent debates for scoring subjective questions. What are the tradeoffs between these two approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency? Which approach aligned more closely with human scoring?

4. What types of analysis were conducted on the human scoring data to validate the automatic scoring approach? For instance, was inter-annotator agreement assessed?

5. The benchmark encompasses questions spanning primary school to professional exams across 30 diverse subjects. What gaps exist in the knowledge and capabilities of current Chinese LLMs identified through evaluation on this benchmark?

6. What trends were observed in terms of relative LLM performance on objective versus subjective questions? What may account for these trends?  

7. The paper evaluates LLMs exclusively using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. How might performance differ if self-supervised or few-shot prompted LLMs were assessed instead?

8. What safeguards were implemented in curating the benchmark data and designing the testing protocol to prevent exposing biases or ethical concerns?

9. How reusable and extensible is the benchmark for continually assessing progress in Chinese LLMs over time? What plans exist for augmenting the benchmark with additional tasks?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on Chinese language models. How transferable is the methodology for constructing knowledge benchmarks spanning multiple educational levels and scoring approaches to other languages?
