# [TT-SNN: Tensor Train Decomposition for Efficient Spiking Neural Network   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08001)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient models for neuromorphic computing. However, SNNs suffer from high memory and computation costs during training due to the spatio-temporal dynamics and multiple backpropagation computations across timesteps. This hinders the wider adoption of SNNs.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes TT-SNN, which applies tensor train (TT) decomposition to reduce the number of parameters and computations in SNN models. The key ideas are:

1) Decompose the weights of convolutional layers into smaller TT-cores using TT decomposition. This leads to fewer parameters and FLOPs. 

2) Introduce a parallel TT (PTT) module that computes two asymmetric kernels in parallel, preserving more spatial information compared to sequential TT.

3) Propose a half TT (HTT) module that uses only half the TT-cores in later timesteps based on the observation that SNNs capture more information early on. This further reduces computations.

4) Flexibly integrate PTT and HTT into the SNN training pipeline with negligible accuracy loss. After training, reconstruct the full weights from the TT-cores.

5) Propose a multi-cluster systolic array accelerator tailored to TT-SNN that exploits the parallelism in PTT and HTT, reducing training energy.

Main Contributions:

- First work to apply TT decomposition for efficient SNN training, reducing model parameters, FLOPs and training time.

- Novel PTT and HTT modules to enable parallel computations and remove timestep redundancies in SNN training.

- Flexible integration of TT modules into SNN training pipelines with negligible accuracy loss.

- Custom accelerator design that leads to lower training energy for TT-SNN models.

- Experiments on CIFAR and N-Caltech101 datasets validate accuracy preservation and significant gains in model compression, speed and energy efficiency during SNN training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a tensor train decomposition technique to reduce model size, computation, and memory costs during training of spiking neural networks, enabling faster and more efficient training while maintaining accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing the TT-SNN module, which leverages tensor train (TT) decomposition to enhance the efficiency of SNN architectures by enabling faster computation and reducing memory costs during training. The key novelty is introducing parallel processing into the TT computation pipeline, departing from the typical sequential tensor computations.

2. The TT-SNN module can be easily and flexibly integrated into SNN convolutional computations. 

3. Proposing a multi-cluster systolic-array-based SNN training accelerator design to efficiently implement and evaluate the proposed TT-SNN training methods. Compared to existing SNN training accelerators, this design further reduces training energy costs.

4. Experimental results demonstrating that TT-SNN reduces the number of trainable parameters, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and training time on datasets such as CIFAR10/100 and N-Caltech101 without significant accuracy loss. For example, on the N-Caltech101 dataset, TT-SNN achieves compression ratios of 7.98× in parameters, 9.25× in FLOPs, and 17.66% training time reduction.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and validating a novel TT-SNN framework that leverages tensor decomposition to accelerate SNN training with flexible integration into existing SNN architectures and tailored hardware accelerator support.
