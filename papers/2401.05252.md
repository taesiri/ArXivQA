# [PIXART-δ: Fast and Controllable Image Generation with Latent   Consistency Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05252)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion are slow in inference speed and lack fine-grained control during image generation. Existing methods like LCM can accelerate sampling speed but are tailored for UNet architectures. ControlNet enables controllability but is also designed specifically for UNets.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose PixArt-LCM (PLCM), which incorporates Latent Consistency Models (LCM) and a novel ControlNet variant into PixArt. Specifically:

1) PLCM integrates LCM into the PixArt architecture to accelerate sampling while preserving quality. This enables 1024x1024 image generation in just 0.5 seconds on an A100 GPU, a 7x speedup over PixArt.

2) The authors design a ControlNet-Transformer module tailored to Transformer architectures like PixArt. This allows fine-grained control over the generated images by manipulating latent representations.

Main Contributions:

- PLCM achieves state-of-the-art sampling efficiency, generating 1024px images in 0.5 seconds on an A100 GPU, 7x faster than PixArt.

- The proposed ControlNet-Transformer enables explicit image control for Transformer models, allowing manipulation of geometric composition and details.

- PLCM has efficient training and inference, enabling usage on affordable GPUs with only 8GB memory. This improves accessibility.

- Extensive experiments demonstrate PLCM's faster sampling and fine-grained control capabilities for high resolution 1024px image generation.

In summary, PLCM pushes state-of-the-art text-to-image generation through faster and more controllable sampling while improving accessibility through efficient resource requirements. The LCM and ControlNet-Transformer innovations unlock new applications in real-time controllable image synthesis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces PixArt-LCM, an improved text-to-image generation model that integrates Latent Consistency Models for faster 4-step image sampling and a customized Transformer-based ControlNet for precise control over high-resolution 1024px image generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It proposes PixArt-LCM, which integrates Latent Consistency Models (LCM) into the PixArt text-to-image generation framework to achieve 4-step sampling acceleration while maintaining high image quality.

2. It introduces a novel Transformer-based ControlNet architecture customized for Transformer models like PixArt to enable precise control over the generated images. 

3. Through experiments, the paper demonstrates PixArt-LCM's faster sampling speed (0.5 seconds per 1024x1024 image on A100) and ControlNet-Transformer's effectiveness in high-resolution (1024px) and fine-grained controllable image generation.

So in summary, the main contributions are accelerating the inference speed of PixArt using LCM while preserving quality, and enabling controllability over PixArt's image generation through a tailored ControlNet-Transformer module. The end result is a state-of-the-art text-to-image model called PixArt-LCM that is fast, high-quality, and controllable.
