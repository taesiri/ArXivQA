# [$R^{2}$Former: Unified $R$etrieval and $R$eranking Transformer for Place   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03410)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- Proposes a unified framework for visual place recognition (VPR) that handles both image retrieval and reranking using only transformer models. The framework is called R2Former.

- Shows that vision transformer tokens can serve as effective local features for reranking/local matching, performing comparably or better than CNN local features. 

- Introduces a novel transformer-based reranking module that models feature correlation and attention information to determine if an image pair matches the same location.

- Achieves state-of-the-art VPR performance on major datasets while having significantly faster inference speed and lower memory footprint compared to prior reranking methods like RANSAC.

- Demonstrates the flexibility of the reranking module by integrating it with different CNN and transformer backbones.

The key hypothesis seems to be that transformers and their tokens can be adapted to effectively handle both global retrieval and local reranking for place recognition, challenging the need for separate CNN-based components. The paper provides extensive experiments to validate this hypothesis and the advantages of the unified R2Former framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposes a unified framework named R2Former for visual place recognition that handles both retrieval and reranking with transformers. 

2. Introduces a novel transformer-based reranking module that takes feature correlation, attention value, and xy coordinates into account to determine if an image pair is a true match.

3. Shows for the first time that vision transformer tokens are comparable or even better than CNN local features for reranking/local matching.

4. The proposed reranking module significantly outperforms previous methods like RANSAC in terms of accuracy, speed, and memory efficiency.

5. Achieves state-of-the-art performance on major VPR datasets while having 4x faster inference speed and 5x lower memory footprint compared to prior arts.

6. Demonstrates the proposed reranking module is generic and can boost performance when combined with different CNN/transformer backbones.

7. Provides in-depth analysis on model components, training strategies, backbone architectures through extensive ablation studies.

In summary, the key novelty is the unified transformer framework for VPR, which is simple, efficient and achieves superior accuracy. The reranking module and the finding that transformer tokens are good for local matching are also important contributions of this work.
