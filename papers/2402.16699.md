# [SwarmPRM: Probabilistic Roadmap Motion Planning for Swarm Robotic   Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16699)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Planning optimal and collision-free trajectories for large-scale swarm robotic systems is challenging. Existing approaches face trade-offs between solution quality, computational efficiency, and scalability. Centralized methods become intractable for large swarms. Decentralized methods often yield suboptimal solutions. There is a need for planning algorithms that scale well, compute high-quality solutions efficiently, and ensure safety by avoiding collisions.

Proposed Solution - SwarmPRM:
The paper proposes a hierarchical, sampling-based motion planning approach called SwarmPRM with the following key properties:

1) Represents the swarm with a time-varying probability distribution function (PDF) at the macroscopic level rather than tracking individual robots. This provides scalability.

2) Constructs a novel "risk-aware Gaussian roadmap" for efficient planning in Gaussian-PDF state space. Evaluates chance of collisions using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), ensuring safety. 

3) Achieves asymptotic optimality under mild assumptions by adapting ideas from optimal probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithms.

4) At microscopic level, uses potential fields for robot navigation to track macro-state PDF and avoid collisions.

5) Simulation results demonstrate improved efficiency over other decentralized/hierarchical methods and centralized multi-robot approaches. Also scales to 500 robots which others cannot handle.


Main Contributions:

1) Novel formulation of swarm planning problem using time-varying macro-state PDFs.

2) Risk-aware Gaussian roadmap construction and chance-constrained collision checking.

3) Asymptotically optimal planning of PDF trajectories in Gaussian-GMM state space.  

4) Demonstrated efficiency, scalability and optimality compared to state-of-the-art approaches in simulations.

In summary, the paper provides an important advancement in planning for large swarms by developing a hierarchical approach that leverages macroscopic representation, chance constraints, and sampling-based optimal planning to achieve safety, efficiency and scalability simultaneously.
