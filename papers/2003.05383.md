# [xCos: An Explainable Cosine Metric for Face Verification Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05383)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:

How can we develop a more explainable and interpretable face verification framework that provides spatial explanations (e.g. which parts of two face images are considered similar/dissimilar) while maintaining high accuracy?

The key hypothesis seems to be that by proposing a new similarity metric called "explainable cosine" ($xCos$) that considers local patch-wise similarities and learns an attention mechanism, they can create a face verification model that is more explainable and interpretable to humans while still achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.

In particular, the paper proposes that by comparing local patches of two face images and generating a "similarity map", as well as learning an "attention map" that indicates which patches are more important, the $xCos$ module can help explain which parts of the faces are driving the verification decision. This provides spatial interpretability that is lacking in standard face verification models based on deep feature representations.

So in summary, the central research question is how to make face verification more explainable, and the key hypothesis is that the proposed $xCos$ module can achieve this via local similarity and attention maps. The experiments then aim to validate that $xCos$ can indeed provide interpretability while maintaining accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel explainable cosine metric called xCos for face verification. The key ideas are:

- xCos decomposes the overall similarity score between two face images into local cosine similarities (patched cosine map) and attention weights. This allows visualizing which parts of the faces are considered similar/dissimilar. 

- The attention weights are learned to focus on important facial parts like nose, mouth, etc. This reveals which local similarities matter more in computing the global similarity score.

- The xCos module can be plugged into existing face verification models like ArcFace and CosFace to make them more interpretable, with minimal performance drop.

In summary, xCos provides local similarity and attention visualizations to help explain the face verification results. This improves model interpretability and trustworthiness while maintaining accuracy.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new explainable face verification method called xCos that decomposes the similarity score into interpretable local similarity and attention maps to help users understand model decisions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in explainable AI for face verification:

- It focuses specifically on improving the interpretability and explainability of face verification models, whereas much prior work on explainable AI looks at classification tasks more broadly. The authors argue that explaining similarity judgments between two faces requires different techniques than explaining classifiers.

- The proposed xCos module is model-agnostic and can be inserted into many existing face verification architectures like ArcFace and CosFace without major changes. This differs from some prior work that proposes new model architectures from scratch for explainability.

- The xCos module produces spatial similarity and attention maps that visually show which parts of two faces are deemed (dis)similar by the model and their importance weights. This provides more intuitive spatial explanations compared to saliency maps from other methods like Grad-CAM that highlight important pixels but don't show local similarities.

- The spatial explanations consider local patches/grids of the face, unlike some prior work that looks at more holistic or global interpretability. This granular approach aligns better with how humans compare faces.

- The paper shows xCos can improve model robustness to occlusion, whereas most prior work on explainable face recognition focuses only on explanations without considering robustness.

- The experiments demonstrate xCos explanations can be generated with minimal drops in accuracy on standard datasets like LFW, compared to state-of-the-art face verification models.

Overall, this paper makes nice contributions in bringing intuitiver spatial explanations specifically tailored to comparing faces into mainstream face recognition models. The xCos approach seems promising as a model-agnostic explainability module that provides local fine-grained explanations without sacrificing accuracy.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Adapting xCos to handle face images with significant pose variations or extreme illuminations. The current approach focuses on frontal aligned face images, so extending it to handle non-frontal and unaligned faces is an important next step. The authors suggest using techniques like face frontalization as a preprocessing step.

- Evaluating the absolute quality of the attention maps generated by xCos, i.e. how well they correlate with human perception of important face regions. The authors mention the lack of ground truth data as a challenge here. 

- Applying xCos to other challenging face recognition tasks like cross-age verification or recognition under occlusion. The authors demonstrate increased robustness to occlusion already, but more work is needed.

- Exploring other potential applications of xCos beyond face verification, such as facial expression recognition, as the local similarity and attention maps may provide useful explanations there as well.

- Improving the computational efficiency of xCos to make it more suitable for real-time applications.

- Investigating other interpretable representations for face verification beyond the patched cosine similarity maps used in xCos.

Overall, the key future directions are extending xCos to more challenging scenarios, evaluating the quality of explanations, applying it to new tasks, improving efficiency, and exploring alternative interpretable representations. The authors have presented an intriguing initial approach for explainable face verification, but substantial work remains to realize its full potential.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel explainable cosine (xCos) metric for face verification that provides spatial explanations to help humans understand the model's predictions. The xCos module computes a local similarity map showing cosine similarities between grid features of two faces and an attention map highlighting important regions. By weighting the local similarities by attention and summing them, the xCos module produces an overall similarity score that is supervised by an existing face verification model's cosine similarity. Experiments show that plugging in the xCos module into models like ArcFace and CosFace retains accuracy while gaining interpretability. The visualizations provided by xCos reveal which face parts are considered (dis)similar and important, allowing inspection of the model's behavior. Overall, xCos strikes a balance between verification performance and interpretability.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel face verification framework called xCos (explainable cosine) to improve the interpretability of deep face recognition models. The key idea is to decompose the overall similarity score between two face images into local similarity scores and attention weights. Specifically, the face feature maps from a CNN backbone are divided into grids. The cosine similarity between corresponding grid pairs represents local similarity. An attention module learns to weight the importance of each grid pair. The weighted sum of grid similarities gives the final xCos score. 

Compared to prior arts, xCos provides spatial explanations on model predictions, including which facial parts are considered (dis)similar and their contribution weights. This is more intuitive than saliency maps. Experiments show xCos improves model interpretability while maintaining verification accuracy when plugged into state-of-the-art models like ArcFace and CosFace. Additional robustness to occlusion is observed owing to the disentangled local similarities. In conclusion, the paper presents an effective approach to explain face verification models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel explainable metric for face verification called xCos (explainable cosine). The key idea is to decompose the overall similarity score between two face images into local patched cosine similarities and attention weights. Specifically, the face features from a CNN backbone are treated as grid features that preserve spatial information. For an input pair of faces, a patched cosine similarity map is computed by measuring the cosine similarity between corresponding grid features. Meanwhile, an attention map is generated to indicate the importance of each grid. The final xCos score is obtained by performing weighted summation over the patched cosine map according to the attention map. In this way, xCos provides interpretability by revealing which parts of the two faces are considered (dis)similar and important for verification. The xCos module can be plugged into various face verification models like ArcFace and CosFace with minimal performance drop.
