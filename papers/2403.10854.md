# [A Comprehensive Study of Multimodal Large Language Models for Image   Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10854)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise for image quality assessment (IQA) due to their flexibility, interpretability, and ability to leverage both visual and textual data. However, how to best prompt MLLMs for the IQA task remains largely unexplored. 

Key Contributions
- The paper systematically explores 9 different prompting systems for MLLMs by combining 3 standardized psychophysical testing methods (single stimulus, double stimulus, multiple stimulus) with 3 NLP prompting strategies (standard, in-context, chain-of-thought).

- A computational procedure is proposed to select a small set of difficult IQA samples while ensuring diversity and consistency with human ratings. This uses expert IQA models to identify challenging cases.

- Experiments compare prompting strategies across 4 MLLMs - 3 open source (LLaVA, mPLUG, InternLM) and 1 proprietary (GPT-4V) on datasets covering various distortions and scenarios. 

- It is shown that the optimal prompting system varies between open source and proprietary MLLMs. Chain-of-thought prompting with double stimulus works best for GPT-4V.

- GPT-4V demonstrates state-of-the-art IQA performance in many cases, but still struggles with fine-grained color discrimination and comparing multiple images. Open source MLLMs perform poorly on IQA overall.

- The work calls for re-evaluation of recent MLLM advances on IQA using optimal prompting strategies paired with GPT-4V as the benchmark. There remains room for improvement in IQA even with leading MLLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper conducts a comprehensive study of systematically prompting multimodal large language models for image quality assessment using strategies from psychophysics and natural language processing, revealing their strengths and weaknesses in modeling human perception of image quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes nine prompting systems for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for image quality assessment (IQA), by combining standardized psychophysical testing procedures (single-stimulus, double-stimulus, and multiple-stimulus methods) with prompting strategies from NLP (standard, in-context, and chain-of-thought prompting).

2. It presents a computational procedure for selecting difficult samples to further challenge MLLMs on IQA, taking into account sample diversity and uncertainty.

3. It conducts a comprehensive evaluation of three open-source and one closed-source MLLMs equipped with the nine prompting systems on human-rated IQA datasets. The results show that the optimal prompting system varies between open-source and closed-source MLLMs. 

4. It reveals that even the most advanced MLLM, the proprietary GPT-4V, still has limitations in fine-grained quality discrimination and multiple-image quality analysis, compared to the incredibly sophisticated human visual system for IQA.

In summary, the main contribution is a systematic study of prompting strategies for MLLMs on the image quality assessment task, along with the proposal of computational methods for difficult sample selection and benchmarking.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes combining psychophysical testing methods and NLP prompting strategies into systematic prompting systems for multimodal language models (MLLMs) in image quality assessment (IQA). Why is this a useful approach? What are the potential benefits over existing approaches?

2. The paper explores single-stimulus, double-stimulus, and multiple-stimulus prompting methods from psychophysics. What are the key differences between these methods when applied to MLLMs? What are the tradeoffs between them? 

3. The paper also explores standard prompting, in-context prompting, and chain-of-thought prompting strategies from NLP. How do these strategies differ in how they prompt MLLMs to perform IQA? What are the relative merits of each?

4. The paper finds that different MLLMs perform optimally with different prompting systems. What does this suggest about the current state of capability and limitations across different MLLMs when applied to IQA? 

5. The paper proposes a computational procedure for difficult sample selection in IQA by attacking expert IQA models. Why is difficult sample selection important for benchmarking MLLMs? What are the key criteria optimized for in the procedure?

6. Even with the optimal prompting system, the paper finds that GPT-4V still struggles with fine-grained quality discrimination and multiple-image analysis compared to humans. Why do you think this is the case? What capabilities are still lacking?

7. The paper emphasizes the importance of re-evaluating recent claims of progress in open-source MLLMs surpassing GPT-4V, in light of the optimal prompting not being paired with GPT-4V. Do you agree? What further analyses could elucidate this?

8. Could the proposed prompting systems and sample selection method be applicable beyond IQA? What other perceptual tasks could benefit from this approach?

9. The paper discusses limitations of current approaches and opportunities for future work. Which of these directions do you think are most promising for advancing MLLM performance on IQA?

10. The overarching goal is improving alignment of MLLMs with human perception for quality assessment. What other techniques could help drive progress towards this goal, beyond systematic prompting and difficult sample selection?
