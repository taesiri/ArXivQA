# [A Language Model based Framework for New Concept Placement in Ontologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17897)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the task of automatically inserting new concepts extracted from texts into an ontology. This is an important problem in ontology engineering and evolution, as ontologies need to be continuously enriched with new concepts discovered in texts. However, placing concepts in the ontology structure by inserting them into subsumption (is-a hierarchy) relationships is challenging, as there are many more relationships than concepts in an ontology. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a 3-step framework leveraging language models:

1. Edge Search: Find candidate locations (edges) to insert the new concept. This uses BERT-based models to encode the mention text and ontology edges into embeddings for searching the most similar edges.

2. Edge Formation & Enrichment: Leverage ontology structure to form edges from concepts and enrich the edge candidates by traversing the ontology graph.  

3. Edge Selection: Select the final edges to insert concept into, modeled as multi-label classification. Fine-tune BERT for contextual interaction between mention text and edge candidates.

The framework allows comparing multiple language model architectures - BERT, GPT-3, FLAN-T5, Llama-2. For LLMs, the paper proposes explainable instruction tuning by generating reasoning steps.

Main Contributions:

- New 3-step framework for concept placement leveraging language models and ontology structure

- Employing contrastive learning for fine-tuning BERT to match textual mentions with ontology edges

- Adapting BERT for multi-label edge classification to select final edge placement  

- Investigating different PLMs and prompting strategies for LLMs with instruction tuning

- New dataset based on SNOMED-CT ontology and benchmarking of models

- Showing advantages of PLMs and potential of emerging LLMs to motivate future research

The paper provides a comprehensive study for an important ontology engineering problem using modern neural language models.
