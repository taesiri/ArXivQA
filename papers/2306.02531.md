# [PLANNER: Generating Diversified Paragraph via Latent Language Diffusion   Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02531)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we generate high-quality, diverse, and fluent long-form text while exercising global control over the generation?

The paper proposes a model called PLANNER that combines latent semantic diffusion with autoregressive decoding to address this question. The key ideas are:

- Learn a variational autoencoder (VAE) model to encode input text into a small set of continuous latent codes that capture paragraph-level semantics.

- Apply a denoising diffusion model on these latent codes to iteratively refine them in a coarse-to-fine manner. This "planning" via latent diffusion provides global control over the generation. 

- Use an autoregressive decoder to convert the refined latent codes into fluent raw text. The decoder focuses on "decoding" the semantics into natural language.

- The combination allows generating diverse and high-quality long-form text while leveraging the global editing capabilities of diffusion models and local fluency of autoregressive models.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that applying latent diffusion on a paragraph embedding space can enhance long-form text generation in terms of diversity and global coherence, compared to just using autoregressive or raw text diffusion models. The PLANNER model is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here is a summary of the key contributions of this paper:

- The paper proposes a new method called PLANNER (Paragraph-level Diffusion model for Embedding Representation) that combines latent semantic diffusion with autoregressive generation for text generation. 

- A variational autoencoder is used to learn paragraph embeddings that condense lengthy text into a small set of continuous codes capturing semantics. These embeddings are used with a diffusion model to generate semantics in a coarse-to-fine manner.  

- An autoregressive decoder then converts the semantic codes into fluent raw text. This allows global control over paragraph semantics via diffusion while retaining fluency with the decoder.

- The method is shown to generate more diverse and less repetitive text compared to autoregressive baselines across tasks like sentiment-guided generation, text completion, and summarization.

- A new metric called AuBLEU is introduced to evaluate the denoising capability of text diffusion models by assessing reconstruction quality over varying noise levels.

- Analysis is provided on optimizing the paragraph embedding space for accuracy, smoothness, and minimizing conversion errors. The impact of diffusion steps on generation quality is also analyzed.

In summary, the key contribution is a new technique to generate long, high-quality text by combining the benefits of latent semantic diffusion and autoregressive decoding. The method improves diversity while maintaining accuracy and fluency.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of text generation using diffusion models:

- The key novelty of this paper is applying latent diffusion models to generate paragraph-level embeddings rather than operating directly on raw text or word embeddings. Other recent work like Diff-LM and Genie has focused more on diffusion models over word or token embeddings. So this is an interesting new direction.

- Most prior text diffusion models like Diff-LM generate text autoregressively during the decoding phase. This paper instead uses an autoregressive decoder to convert the generated latent codes into raw text. So it combines non-autoregressive diffusion with autoregressive decoding.

- By performing diffusion in a latent space, this model can generate longer paragraphs more efficiently than raw token-level diffusion. Other models like Diff-LM require many diffusion steps to generate long text, making them slow.

- For evaluation, the paper introduces a new metric AuBLEU to assess the overall denoising capability. On this metric their model outperforms baselines, indicating stronger denoising abilities especially at lower SNRs.

- The results demonstrate improved diversity and fluency compared to baselines, with reduced repetition. The gains are more pronounced on open-ended tasks like text completion versus summarization. This is likely because the summarization task is more constrained.

- One limitation is that their approach still relies on an autoregressive decoder, which can sometimes cause inconsistencies or hallucinations. Fully non-autoregressive decoding could help further.

Overall, I'd say the main contributions are in exploring latent semantic diffusion for paragraphs, the proposed model architecture combining diffusion and autoregressive components, and showing improved results over baselines on various text generation tasks. The AuBLEU metric for comparing denoising strength is also a nice addition.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating non-autoregressive decoders to improve efficiency and minimize conversion errors and hallucinations in generation. The current approach relies on an autoregressive decoder which can sometimes lead to problematic outputs. Exploring non-autoregressive alternatives could help address this issue.

- Developing a "calibration" strategy for the latent codes to better fit the data distribution during training. The classifier-free guidance approach results in a discrepancy between training and inference distributions, so calibrating the latent codes could help improve results. 

- Further analyzing the causes of hallucinations and errors, especially relating to named entities and numbers. The authors suggest these could stem from either conversion errors in the decoder or errors generating the paragraph embeddings. More investigation is needed.

- Considering alternative paragraph embedding architectures beyond the transformer-based autoencoder used in the paper. The authors note the inevitable conversion loss with the current approach, so exploring other architectures could potentially improve performance.

- Testing the approach on a wider range of long-form generation tasks beyond the sentiment, text completion, and summarization tasks explored in the paper. This could reveal more insights into the strengths and limitations of the method.

- Exploring ways to make the inference process more efficient. The authors note their approach can be computationally expensive compared to autoregressive models. Improving inference efficiency would make the method more practical.

So in summary, the main directions focus on improving conversion between spaces, minimizing hallucinations, enhancing paragraph embeddings, expanding to more tasks, and boosting efficiency. The authors lay out a promising research program for advancing latent diffusion models for long text generation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new model called PLANNER for generating diversified and fluent paragraphs of text. PLANNER combines a non-autoregressive "planning" module that uses latent diffusion to generate semantic paragraph embeddings in a coarse-to-fine manner, with an autoregressive "decoding" module that translates the embeddings into raw text. Specifically, PLANNER first trains a variational autoencoder to learn a smooth latent space of paragraph embeddings that encode salient information from the input text. Then a transformer-based latent diffusion model is trained to generate these paragraph embeddings conditioned on some input signal like a class label or context text. Finally, the generated embeddings are passed to a pretrained autoregressive decoder to output the raw text. Experiments on sentiment-guided generation, text completion, and summarization tasks show PLANNER can generate more diverse and less repetitive text than baselines while maintaining fluency and relevance. The planning via latent diffusion provides global control over the generated paragraphs, while the decoding handles translating the semantics into coherent text. Limitations include potential conversion errors and hallucinations when mapping between the latent and text spaces. Overall, PLANNER demonstrates the promise of combining latent diffusion with autoregressive decoding for conditional text generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new model called PLANNER (Paragraph-leveL DiffusioN model for EmbeddiNg Representation) for generating long, diverse, and fluent text paragraphs. The model has two main components:

First, a variational autoencoder is used to learn a latent space of "paragraph embeddings" that encode the key semantic information from a long input text into a small, fixed number of continuous codes. This allows the model to work in a lower-dimensional latent space rather than directly on the discrete text tokens, which is more efficient. The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the original text from these codes. 

Second, a latent diffusion model is applied on the paragraph embeddings, which generates the codes in a gradual, coarse-to-fine manner. This allows for iterative refinement of the generated text. The diffusion model is conditioned on a label or context text to control the semantic content. Finally, the generated codes are decoded into fluent text using an autoregressive model.

Experiments on sentiment-guided text generation, text completion, and summarization tasks demonstrate PLANNER's ability to produce long, diverse paragraphs while maintaining relevance. The non-autoregressive latent diffusion modeling avoids the issue of error accumulation in standard autoregressive methods. Comparisons to baselines like fine-tuned GPT-2 and text diffusion models show PLANNER's strengths.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage latent text diffusion model called PLANNER that combines non-autoregressive semantic diffusion with autoregressive generation to generate long, fluent text while allowing global control over paragraphs. First, a variational autoencoder is trained to condense lengthy text into a fixed number of paragraph embeddings that capture semantics. Next, a diffusion model is trained on these latent embeddings to generate embeddings corresponding to longer text semantics. The diffusion model employs a transformer architecture and is conditioned on class labels or raw text. It is trained using a cosine noise schedule and signal prediction objective. During inference, the diffusion model generates paragraph embeddings in a coarse-to-fine manner over multiple steps. Finally, an autoregressive decoder translates the embeddings into raw text. This combines the "planning" of semantics via diffusion with fluent "decoding". The aim is to improve diversity and reduce repetition compared to autoregressive models, while maintaining fluency. Experiments on sentiment-guided generation, text completion, and summarization tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing a new method called PLANNER for generating diversified paragraphs of text through the use of latent language diffusion models. The key problems/questions it is aiming to address are:

- Autoregressive text generation models like GPT can suffer from issues like exposure bias, where errors accumulate during generation leading to repetitive or low-quality outputs. The paper aims to mitigate this issue.

- Previous diffusion models applied directly to text have resulted in less fluent outputs compared to autoregressive models, especially for long text. The paper aims to improve fluency for paragraph generation.

- Generating long text with diffusion models can be computationally expensive as it requires multiple passes over the text. The paper aims to improve efficiency.

- Text diffusion models operating directly on tokens/embeddings can suffer from "rounding errors" in the discrete to continuous conversion. The paper aims to alleviate this issue.

- Autoregressive generation lacks global control over the generated paragraphs. The paper aims to achieve better global semantics control.

In summary, the key focus is on developing a diffusion-based method that can generate diverse, fluent paragraphs with global semantic control in an efficient manner, overcoming limitations of both autoregressive and previous diffusion techniques.
