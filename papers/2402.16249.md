# [SeqTrack3D: Exploring Sequence Information for Robust 3D Point Cloud   Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16249)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing 3D single object tracking (SOT) methods either match features between two frames or predict relative motion, ignoring long-term motion patterns over continuous frames. This causes performance issues when dealing with sparse point clouds. 

Method - Sequence-to-Sequence Tracking:
- Proposes a new Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) tracking paradigm that utilizes both historical point clouds and bounding box sequences to capture long-term motion patterns.
- Introduces SeqTrack3D tracker based on Seq2Seq framework with an encoder-decoder architecture. 
- Encoder extracts spatial-temporal features from point cloud sequence using a Transformer module with decoupled local and global encoding. 
- Decoder integrates target information from encoded point features and historical boxes to produce updated box sequence embeddings.
- Only predicts bounding box attributes (x,y,z,Î¸) unlike prior works that use complex prediction heads.

Main Contributions:
- Novel Seq2Seq tracking paradigm for 3D SOT that models continuous object motion using sequence-level information.
- SeqTrack3D tracker that leverages Transformer to establish relationship between point cloud and box sequences.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art on NuScenes dataset by 6% and on Waymo dataset by 14.13% in success metric. 
- More robust to sparse points than other methods.
- Maintains real-time efficiency with 38 FPS run-time speed.

In summary, the key idea is using historical state sequences to provide useful cues that allow the model to learn motion patterns and overcome issues due to sparse points, instead of just using consecutive frame feature matching. This Seq2Seq approach sets a new state-of-the-art for the 3D single object tracking task.
