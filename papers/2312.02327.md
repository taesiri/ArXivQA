# [FLea: Improving federated learning on scarce and label-skewed data via   privacy-preserving feature augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02327)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the challenges of data scarcity (limited data per client) and label skew (non-identical label distributions among clients) in federated learning (FL). It reveals that existing FL methods underperform when data is both scarce and skewed. Loss-based methods that modify the local training objective struggle to balance between local optimization and global knowledge preservation. Data augmentation methods by sharing global data proxies improve performance but compromise privacy.

Solution - FLea:
The paper proposes FLea, a framework where clients exchange features to augment local data. Features refer to activations from an intermediate model layer which are privacy-preserved before sharing. A global feature buffer with targets gathers features from participating clients. Locally, FLea augments batches of local data with global features via interpolation, helping mitigate overfitting and bias. It also distills knowledge from the global model prediction into the local model. A loss term reduces correlation between features and original data to protect privacy.  

Main Contributions:
- Identifies limitations of existing methods under scarce and skewed local data
- Proposes first framework for clients to exchange obfuscated features as data augmentation
- Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods by 2.6-17.6% on image and audio tasks
- Reduces privacy risks compared to sharing model updates or data augmentations 
- Provides insights on impact of data scarcity in FL through empirical analysis

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in tackling critical yet less explored data scarcity and label skew issues in FL, while enhancing privacy over existing data augmentation techniques. FLea presents a promising research direction by exchanging protected features to aid local learning.
