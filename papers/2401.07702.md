# [Prompting open-source and commercial language models for grammatical   error correction of English learner text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07702)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Grammatical error correction (GEC) of second language learner text is important for providing feedback and enabling language learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for GEC when prompted appropriately. 
- However, previous work has mostly focused on evaluating GPT models on a limited set of GEC datasets. It is unclear how well other LLMs perform on GEC across diverse benchmarks and whether they can match state-of-the-art supervised approaches.

Method:
- Evaluated 3 commercial (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Cohere) and 7 open-source LLMs on 4 English GEC datasets: CoNLL-14, FCE, JFLEG, and W&I+LOCNESS.
- Tested different zero-shot and few-shot prompt templates to elicit minimal edit corrections from models rather than fluency rewrites.
- Compared model performance overall and on specific error types.

Key Findings:
- LLMs do not universally surpass state-of-the-art supervised models on minimal edit GEC datasets like CoNLL-14 and FCE but match performance on fluency-focused dataset like JFLEG.
- Open-source models are competitive, sometimes outperforming commercial models on minimal edit benchmarks. Few-shot prompting helps some but not all models.
- Model performance varies across prompts and number of examples, highlighting the difficulty of prompting for this task.

Main Contributions:
- Most extensive evaluation so far of how different LLMs perform on diverse English GEC datasets with focus on minimal edits.
- Demonstrates strengths and weaknesses of commercial vs open-source models.
- Provides insights into effective prompting strategies through comparative analysis.
- Offers recommendations for future work on analyzing model biases, personalized prompting approaches, and dynamic few-shot example selection.

In summary, while LLMs show promise for GEC, more research is needed to match state-of-the-art supervised approaches, especially for minimal error correction critical to language learning applications. There are also open questions around best practices for prompting design and selection of appropriate few-shot examples.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates the performance of several open-source and commercial large language models on grammatical error correction of English learner text using different prompting strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of several open-source and commercial large language models (LLMs) on the task of grammatical error correction (GEC) across multiple English GEC benchmark datasets. Specifically:

- The paper evaluates 7 open-source and 3 commercial LLMs on 4 established GEC benchmarks, going beyond previous work that focused only on GPT models and a subset of datasets. 

- The authors investigate both zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies to elicit minimal edit corrections from the LLMs, rather than fluency rewrites.

- They compare the LLM performance to existing state-of-the-art supervised GEC systems, finding that the LLMs do not always outperform these systems, except in the case of fluency-focused datasets like JFLEG.

- The paper provides an analysis of model performance on different error types and proficiency levels. 

- The prompts, few-shot examples, and model predictions are made publicly available to serve as a comparison point and resource for future work on GEC with LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous benchmarking of how current LLMs perform on English GEC across diverse datasets and using various prompting strategies, highlighting current capabilities and limitations.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper evaluates performance of LLMs on minimal edit and fluency style GEC datasets. Could the lower performance on minimal edit datasets be partly attributed to over-reliance on fluency prompting during pre-training? How could LLM pre-training be adapted to improve minimal edit capabilities?

2. The paper finds the GPT models have higher recall compared to smaller open-source models. What architectural or scaling properties might explain this? Could an analysis of attention patterns provide insight?

3. This paper focuses on sentence-level GEC. How could the methods be extended to document-level GEC? What additional challenges might arise at the document-level compared to the sentence-level? 

4. The paper finds lower LLM performance on advanced learner text compared to beginner text. What textual properties differentiate these proficiency levels, and why might they pose greater difficulties? How could prompting or fine-tuning address this?

5. The paper notes human evaluations have preferred fluent LLM outputs over reference corrections. Could improved automatic metrics better capture human preferences? What impact could this have on systems optimized for automatic metrics?

6. Minimal edits may provide more focused feedback, but fluency rewrites could better model target language. How should these two correction styles be balanced for language learning? What empirical studies could investigate their relative benefits?

7. The paper explores a limited prompt search space. What methods like reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms could more efficiently search over prompt crafting? How much performance gain is possible?

8. The paper uses fixed few-shot examples. How should few-shot examples be sampled? Should they target specific learner errors or language features? What pool of examples works best?

9. The paper finds inconsistent few-shot gains across models and datasets. Why do some models benefit more from few-shot learning? How is optimal number of examples determined?

10. The paper focuses on English GEC. How transferable are the methods to other languages? What challenges arise from typological differences between languages?
