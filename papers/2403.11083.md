## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Anomaly detection is important for quality control across various industrial applications like manufacturing. However, existing anomaly detection techniques tend to be specialized for certain scenarios and lack generalization capability. The paper aims to develop a generic anomaly detection model that can be applied across multiple industrial contexts.  

Proposed Solution:
The key idea is to leverage recent advances in foundation models like GPT-4 Vision that have extensive knowledge and reasoning abilities. The paper proposes customizing such foundation models for anomaly detection by incorporating domain knowledge from experts. This is done via a multi-modal prompting strategy that provides the model textual and visual representations of normality as conditions to guide anomaly identification.  

The prompting strategies include:
(1) Task descriptions 
(2) Class context information 
(3) Textual rules defining normality 
(4) Reference images of normal cases

The inputs are pre-processed into a unified 2D image format to handle multi-modal data like images, point clouds, time series etc.  

By combining the domain knowledge prompts with the foundation model's general intelligence, customized industrial anomaly detectors are created.

Main Contributions:
- Novel strategy to customize foundation models for anomaly detection by incorporating human expertise through multi-modal prompts
- Unified input representation as 2D images to enable handling of diverse data types
- Demonstrated improved anomaly detection performance over vanilla foundation models 
- Showcased detection capabilities across modalities like images, point clouds, time series data
- Highlighted qualitative reasoning abilities in complex scenarios

The key insight is that prompts allow integrating human knowledge into foundation models, enhancing their specificity for industrial applications while retaining generalizability. This can pave the way for customizable anomaly detectors.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a unified pre-processing operation to convert all data modalities into a standardized 2D image format. What are some challenges or limitations of converting complex data like point clouds or time series into 2D images? How could this impact anomaly detection performance?

2. The paper proposes 4 main types of prompts to incorporate domain knowledge - task instructions, class context, normality criteria, and reference images. What strategies could be used to select the most informative prompts for a given anomaly detection task? How to balance between too few and too many prompts?

3. The quantitative experiments compare performance between two foundation models - Gemini Pro Vision 1.0 and GPT4-Vision. What are some key architectural or capability differences between these models that could explain performance gaps observed? 

4. The results show improved accuracy from using visual prompts versus just language prompts in many cases. Why might visual prompts provide complementary information to language for anomaly detection? When would visual prompts not help or potentially hurt performance?

5. Could the multi-modal prompting strategies proposed be used for purposes beyond just anomaly detection? What other industrial applications could benefit from customized foundation models using similar prompting approaches?

6. The failure cases highlight issues detecting small defects or anomalies in complex scenes. How could the prompting strategies or data representations be improved to better capture fine-grained details? What are other approaches?

7. What types of prompts could help improve reasoning over temporal anomaly detection tasks? Are there prompts uniquely suited for time-series or video data?

8. How was the reference normal image selected in the experiments when using visual prompts? Could more strategic selection of reference images further improve accuracy?

9. The unified input representation converts diverse data into 2D images. What are limitations of 2D projections for complex 3D point cloud data? Could native 3D input representations improve performance?

10. The paper focuses on anomaly detection, but could similar prompt engineering strategies enable foundation models for other manufacturing tasks like segmentation, classification or prediction? What other applications seem promising?
