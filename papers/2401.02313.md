# [SuperEdge: Towards a Generalization Model for Self-Supervised Edge   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02313)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Edge detection is fundamental in computer vision but relies heavily on manual pixel-wise annotations which are laborious and prone to inconsistency across human annotators. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a self-supervised strategy to generate pixel-level and object-level pseudo ground truth edges by transferring annotations from synthetic to real images using multi-level multi-homography adaptation.

- A streamlined encoder-decoder model called SuperEdge is proposed that concurrently extracts edges at pixel and object levels. It has two decoder heads - one for pixel edges using cross entropy loss and another for object edges using weighted loss.

Main Contributions:
- First work to adapt the homography adaptation method from SuperPoint to enable self-supervised edge annotation on real images, eliminating dependency on manual labels.

- Designed a novel SuperEdge model tailored to leverage the self-supervised pseudo ground truth for both pixel and object level edge extraction.

- Extensive evaluations demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art with significant improvements of 4.9% in ODS and 3.3% in OIS over existing STEdge method on the BIPEDv2 dataset.

- The self-supervised strategy and SuperEdge model generalize very well across multiple datasets like COCO, BSDS, BSDS-RIND, BIPED, BIPEDv2 etc.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions in designing a self-supervised edge annotation strategy and a streamlined yet efficient SuperEdge model to advance the state-of-the-art in edge detection across diverse datasets while eliminating dependency on manual labeling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel self-supervised edge detection method called SuperEdge that employs a multi-level, multi-homography technique to generate pixel-level and object-level pseudo labels on real images, eliminating the need for manual annotation, along with an efficient dual-decoder model that outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A novel self-supervised strategy for edge detection that generates pixel-level and object-level pseudo edge annotations on real-world images, eliminating the need for manual labeling. This is done using techniques like homography adaptation, L0 smoothing, and Canny edge detection.

2. A streamlined yet effective model called SuperEdge, with a dual decoder architecture to concurrently extract pixel and object level edges. It is trained on the pseudo annotations generated by the self-supervised strategy.

3. Comparative evaluations show that the proposed self-supervised method and SuperEdge model achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets like BIPED, BIPEDv2, BSDS-RIND, NYUD, and BSDS500. For example, SuperEdge obtains improvements of 4.9% in ODS and 3.3% in OIS over previous methods on the BIPEDv2 dataset.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) a self-supervised edge annotation strategy, (2) an effective SuperEdge model designed for this strategy, and (3) superior performance over existing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.
