# [Online Identification of Stochastic Continuous-Time Wiener Models Using   Sampled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05899)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of online identification of continuous-time stochastic Wiener models from noisy discrete-time measurements. Such models comprise a linear dynamical system followed by a static nonlinearity and are driven by stochastic disturbances.

- Ignoring disturbances leads to biased parameter estimates. Existing likelihood-based methods for identification of stochastic systems are complex and sensitive to mismatches in disturbance characteristics. 

- The paper aims to develop a computationally simpler online identification algorithm that is robust to disturbance misspecification.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an online stochastic approximation algorithm based on minimizing an output-error quadratic prediction error criterion. 

- Independent simulations of the Wiener model and its gradient filters are used to obtain unbiased estimates of the output predictor and its gradient at each time step. These drive a stochastic gradient or Newton update of the parameter estimates.

- The algorithm runs recursively, discretizing the linear dynamics and disturbance model at each step based on current parameter estimates. Approximations of latent signals are computed online via recursive filters.

- This provides a simple and efficient approach for online identification that leverages asymptotic convergence results for stochastic approximation.

Main Contributions:
- A novel online identification algorithm for stochastic Wiener systems using stochastic approximation and simulation of internal model signals.

- Applicable to generic model parameterizations and robust to disturbance misspecification unlike likelihood-based methods.

- Convergence guarantees from stochastic approximation theory even with model under-parametrization.

- Numerical examples demonstrate successful parameter convergence even with incorrect disturbance models and non-Gaussian disturbances.

In summary, the key innovation is a simple and recursive online algorithm for identification of stochastic Wiener models that is widely applicable and robust to mismatches in disturbance characteristics. Theoretical and empirical results confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach.
