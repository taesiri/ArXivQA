# [Precipitation Prediction Using an Ensemble of Lightweight Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09424)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Precipitation prediction is challenging due to:
1) Sparsity of high precipitation events limits training data 
2) Diverse and intricate spatio-temporal patterns are difficult to model
These issues hinder accurate prediction, especially for high rainfall intensities.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose an ensemble learning framework with multiple lightweight convolutional learners to capture diverse precipitation patterns. The key components are:

1) Backbone network based on WeatherFusionNet to extract useful features from satellite image sequences 
2) Multiple lightweight convolutional heads acting as ensemble learners
3) Learners optimized independently to capture distinct patterns
4) Convolutional LSTM to model temporal correlations  
5) Controller module to generate learner weight maps for more reliable predictions

The model is trained in 3 stages:
1) Train WeatherFusionNet + ConvLSTM backbone
2) Train ensemble learners while freezing backbone
3) Train controller while keeping other modules fixed

Main Contributions:
- Ensemble approach to handle diversity of precipitation patterns
- Lightweight convolutional learners to enable modeling of intricate distributions
- Controller module for improving prediction reliability 
- Three stage training procedure ensuring sufficient optimization

The proposed method achieved 1st place on the core test and nowcasting leaderboards of the Weather4Cast 2023 competition, demonstrating substantial gains especially for high precipitation levels.
