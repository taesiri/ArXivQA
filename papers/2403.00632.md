# [Metamorpheus: Interactive, Affective, and Creative Dream Narration   Through Metaphorical Visual Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00632)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Prior research has shifted to focusing on lived experiences and meaning-making in human-computer interaction (HCI). However, there is limited work on how technologies can support narrating and reflecting on affective lived experiences to facilitate meaning-making for self-awareness and mindfulness. Though expressive therapies leverage creative expression of experiences for wellness, it remains unexplored how to adapt this to HCI to support average users in creatively relating an emotional experience for reflection.

Proposed Solution: The paper presents Metamorpheus, an affective interface that engages users in creatively narrating emotional experiences in dreams through metaphorical visual storytelling. Key features:

- Arranges visual storyline based on emotional arc of a dream 
- Provokes reflection through creating metaphorical images and text depicting emotions in dreams using AI models 
- Provides metaphor suggestions and generates visual metaphors and text using design space and AI creativity tools 
- Allows recoloring interface and re-arranging scenes over storyline visualization to construct personalized meaning

Contributions:

1. Design and implementation of Metamorpheus for creative dream narration 

2. Phenomenological study revealing how Metamorpheus afforded interactive meaning co-construction through co-creative narration, which:

- Promoted mindfulness of emotions by vividly reliving affective experiences
- Created connectedness and motivated sharing dreams 
- Supported sense of agency while using AI for self-expression

The interface engaged users in articulating emotions by co-creating representations. Though guided, users took ownership by interpreting outputs to construct personalized meaning. Results suggest human-AI co-creation can enable meaning making of experiences for reflection.
