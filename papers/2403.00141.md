# [EROS: Entity-Driven Controlled Policy Document Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00141)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Privacy policies of organizations are often long, complex, and use technical language, making it difficult for users to understand how their personal data will be collected, used, and protected. This leads to users inadvertently consenting to terms they do not fully grasp. There is a need for systems that can generate concise, coherent, and accessible summaries from privacy policies while retaining critical information about data usage and protection.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an Entity-driven Controlled policy document Summarization (EROS) system to generate summaries that capture key privacy-related concepts. EROS has two main stages:

1) Entity Extraction Module: Uses a BERT and XLNet-based model called EEPD to identify critical entity spans in the policy text related to what data is collected, who it is collected from, why it is needed, etc.  

2) Entity-Driven Summarization Module: Employs a BART model to generate summaries. It incorporates the extracted entities from stage 1 to control the summary content using proximal policy optimization (PPO), ensuring coverage of critical information. Custom loss functions and rewards manage summary relevance, conciseness and inclusion of key entities.

Main Contributions:
- Development of a new dataset called PD-Sum with ~1900 privacy policy documents, annotated summaries and privacy entity labels.
- An entity extraction module (EEPD) that can recognize privacy entities like data types, collection purpose, etc.
- An end-to-end entity-driven controlled summarization model (EROS) that generates informative and concise summaries covering critical privacy information.
- Comparative evaluations showing EROS outperforms extractive and abstractive baselines by 4-9% on ROUGE, BLEU and other metrics.
- Analysis demonstrating EROS's ability to induce key privacy entities in generated summaries.

The proposed EROS framework is an important step towards producing accessible privacy policy summaries for users. The controlled generation approach ensures critical transparency related to data usage, furthering research in this crucial domain.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an entity-driven controlled policy document summarization model called EROS that extracts key privacy-related entities using a BERT-XLNet model and incorporates them into abstractive summaries generated by a BART model through proximal policy optimization to improve relevance, readability and transparency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing an entity-driven controlled policy document summarization model called EROS to generate concise and coherent summaries that capture critical privacy-related information. 

2. Developing an entity extraction model called EEPD to identify key privacy entities like data types, sources, targets, mediums, and reasons in policy documents.

3. Introducing a new dataset called PD-Sum of privacy policy documents annotated with summaries and privacy-related entities.

4. Establishing performance benchmarks by comprehensive evaluations against several baseline methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

5. Performing qualitative and error analyses to assess the capability of EROS in ensuring various aspects of privacy-related information in the generated summaries.

So in summary, the key contributions are: proposing the EROS model for controlled summarization of privacy policies, creating the PD-Sum dataset, and showing through experiments that EROS outperforms other methods in generating informative and entity-rich summaries.

The paper proposes an approach called EROS (Entity-dRiven cOntrlled policy document Summarization) to generate concise and informative summaries of privacy policy documents. It utilizes entity extraction to identify critical privacy entities, and a BART summarizer with a custom loss function and PPO-based reinforcement learning to control the summaries. The key focus is on capturing privacy-related information like what data is collected, who collects it, why and how it is collected etc. A new dataset called PD-Sum is also introduced. The main goals are enhancing interpretability, readability and transparency of privacy policies for users.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an entity-driven controlled policy document summarization model called EROS. What is the motivation behind developing a controlled summarization model instead of a generic abstractive summarization model for this task?

2. Explain the schema used for annotating privacy-related entities in the policy documents. What are the different types of entities identified and what role do they play in generating a useful summary?

3. The paper uses a two-stage approach consisting of an entity extraction module followed by a summarization module. Why is entity extraction an important first step before summary generation? How does it help in controlling the summaries?

4. Describe the span-based entity extraction approach used in the paper. Why is it preferred over sequence labeling approaches like BIO tagging? What improvements does the proposed SpanNER model have over other baseline span-based models?

5. How exactly does the proposed EROS model ensure that the generated summaries contain the key entities extracted by SpanNER? Explain the working of proximal policy optimization and reward calculation used.

6. What are the various loss components used for training the entity extraction module? Explain the motivation and effect of using contrastive loss.

7. The paper introduces a new dataset PD-Sum. Describe the data collection, filtering and annotation process. What inter-annotator agreement score was achieved?

8. Compare and analyze the performance of EROS against extractive and abstractive baselines. Which metrics show the most gains using the proposed controlled summarization approach?

9. What results were obtained from the human evaluation? Which aspects of summary quality were evaluated? How does EROS perform against baselines?

10. What are some limitations of the current approach? Can you think of ways to address them in future work?
