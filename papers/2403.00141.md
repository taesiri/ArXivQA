# [EROS: Entity-Driven Controlled Policy Document Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00141)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Privacy policies of organizations are often long, complex, and use technical language, making it difficult for users to understand how their personal data will be collected, used, and protected. This leads to users inadvertently consenting to terms they do not fully grasp. There is a need for systems that can generate concise, coherent, and accessible summaries from privacy policies while retaining critical information about data usage and protection.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an Entity-driven Controlled policy document Summarization (EROS) system to generate summaries that capture key privacy-related concepts. EROS has two main stages:

1) Entity Extraction Module: Uses a BERT and XLNet-based model called EEPD to identify critical entity spans in the policy text related to what data is collected, who it is collected from, why it is needed, etc.  

2) Entity-Driven Summarization Module: Employs a BART model to generate summaries. It incorporates the extracted entities from stage 1 to control the summary content using proximal policy optimization (PPO), ensuring coverage of critical information. Custom loss functions and rewards manage summary relevance, conciseness and inclusion of key entities.

Main Contributions:
- Development of a new dataset called PD-Sum with ~1900 privacy policy documents, annotated summaries and privacy entity labels.
- An entity extraction module (EEPD) that can recognize privacy entities like data types, collection purpose, etc.
- An end-to-end entity-driven controlled summarization model (EROS) that generates informative and concise summaries covering critical privacy information.
- Comparative evaluations showing EROS outperforms extractive and abstractive baselines by 4-9% on ROUGE, BLEU and other metrics.
- Analysis demonstrating EROS's ability to induce key privacy entities in generated summaries.

The proposed EROS framework is an important step towards producing accessible privacy policy summaries for users. The controlled generation approach ensures critical transparency related to data usage, furthering research in this crucial domain.
