# [FMB: a Functional Manipulation Benchmark for Generalizable Robotic   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08553)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robotic manipulation remains challenging, especially handling complex contact dynamics and variability in environments/objects. 
- Existing benchmarks focus on either broad generalization with simple tasks or complex tasks without much generalization. There is a need to study both together in a reasonably accessible setting.

Proposed Solution - Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB):
- Focuses on "functional manipulation" - manipulating objects to accomplish complex, multi-stage behaviors by composing basic skills.
- Consists of 3D printed objects for two categories of tasks: 
   1) Single-object: grasping, repositioning, insertion
   2) Multi-object: interlocking assemblies 
- Objects are procedurally generated to enable controlled generalization.
- Real-world robot (Franka) dataset with 22.5k demos of skills like grasping, reorientation using fixtures, insertion.
- Detailed eval protocol to test generalization (new objects, randomization).
- Modular design - can test individual skills or full pipeline.
- Imitation learning system provided with baseline policies (ResNet, Transformer).

Key Contributions:
- Accessible benchmark for studying both complexity and generalization in manipulation.
- Easily reproducible - standard objects, robot setup, dataset. 
- Framework for acquiring skills and combining them to solve multi-stage tasks.
- Analysis of baseline methods sheds light on issues like compounding errors.
- Serves as a "toolkit" to facilitate robotic learning research.

In summary, the paper presents a principled benchmark to study a key open challenge in robotic manipulation - handling complexity and generalization together. The benchmark is designed to be accessible and reproducible while posing a significant challenge to state-of-the-art methods. Detailed experiments showcase the complexity of the tasks and provide baselines for future research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB), a real-world benchmark consisting of a variety of 3D-printed objects and datasets of robotic manipulation behaviors for studying generalization in robotic learning across diverse objects and tasks, from grasping to complex multi-stage assemblies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a real-world benchmark called the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB) for studying robotic learning in the context of functional manipulation. The key design principles of FMB emphasize:

1) A harmonious balance between complexity and accessibility of the tasks. The tasks are deliberately scoped to be narrow enough that models and datasets of manageable scale can be utilized effectively, while still being diverse enough to pose a significant generalization challenge. 

2) Easy replicability, encompassing all essential hardware and software components. FMB consists of 3D-printed objects designed for easy and accurate replication to facilitate reproducibility.

3) A focus on fundamental manipulation skills like grasping, repositioning, and assembly behaviors that require handling complex contact dynamics and generalizing across varied objects.

4) Providing an imitation learning framework with baseline policies as well as the collected dataset to serve as a versatile toolkit for examining various parts of the pipeline. Researchers can propose improvements to individual components and evaluate them as part of the overall system.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing FMB as an accessible, reproducible, and yet sufficiently challenging real-world benchmark that combines multiple factors like task complexity, generalization, and fundamental manipulation skills for pushing robotic learning research forward.
