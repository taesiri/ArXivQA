# [Differentially Private Zeroth-Order Methods for Scalable Large Language   Model Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07818)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Finetuning large language models (LLMs) on task-specific datasets is popular, but raises privacy concerns about leaking sensitive information in the datasets. 
- Existing differentially private (DP) methods for LLM finetuning are mostly based on DP-SGD, which has inherent scalability issues that limit the privacy-utility tradeoff.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate the potential of differentially private zeroth-order (DP-ZO) methods for LLM finetuning, which are more efficient by approximating gradients using two forward passes instead of backpropagation.
- Propose a stagewise DP-ZO method that dynamically schedules key hyperparameters across training stages based on the synergy between DP noise and ZO gradient error. Earlier stages use lower ZO error and higher learning rate for faster convergence, while later stages deliberately increase ZO error to stabilize training.
- Further boost scalability by reducing the number of trainable parameters using a data-free pruning technique that does not require additional data or privacy budget.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive investigation of DP-ZO methods for LLM finetuning from theoretical and empirical viewpoints.
- Novel stagewise DP-ZO algorithm with theoretical privacy and convergence guarantees, as well as empirical evaluations.
- Additional scalability improvement via data-free pruning of parameters guided by a proposed importance matrix.
- Strong performance demonstrated across multiple models (RoBERTa-large, OPT-2.7B) and datasets (SST, SNLI, MultiRC, etc.) under varying privacy budgets.

In summary, the paper explores DP-ZO methods to overcome scalability limitations of DP-SGD for private LLM finetuning, with a stagewise algorithm design backed by theory and experiments. Data-free pruning further improves efficiency. The methods achieve impressive utility under strict privacy guarantees.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from this paper:

This paper proposes new stagewise differentially private zeroth-order methods for scalable and utility-preserving finetuning of large language models, combining dynamic hyperparameter scheduling and parameter pruning guided by a data-free importance metric.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, I would summarize the main contributions as:

1) The authors propose two novel stagewise differentially private zeroth-order methods for large language model finetuning and provide theoretical analysis for both the privacy and convergence properties. 

2) They introduce techniques to enhance scalability further, including dynamically scheduling key hyperparameters over stages based on the interplay between the DP noise and ZO approximation error. 

3) They also incorporate data-free pruning to reduce the number of trainable parameters guided to important directions without additional data or privacy cost.

4) The authors conduct extensive empirical evaluations on models like RoBERTa-large and OPT across datasets like GLUE and SuperGLUE. The results demonstrate the superiority of their proposed methods in terms of scalability, utility and performance compared to prior arts.

In summary, the key contributions are introducing two stagewise DP zeroth-order methods specifically designed for private LLM finetuning, repurposing data-free pruning, and comprehensive empirical evidence showing the effectiveness of their proposed techniques. The paper provides both theoretical and empirical analysis to demonstrate the viability of using zeroth-order methods for practical private LLM adaptation.

The paper explores using differentially private zeroth-order methods for finetuning large language models, with a focus on achieving a good tradeoff between privacy, utility/accuracy, and scalability. Key ideas include dynamically scheduling hyperparameters across training stages, reducing the trainable parameters via data-free pruning, and analyzing both the privacy and convergence properties. The methods are evaluated on masked LMs like RoBERTa and autoregressive LMs like OPT across multiple NLP datasets. So the key terms revolve around differentially private optimization of large neural models, with zeroth-order approximations, stagewise training strategies, and parameter sparsification.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a stagewise strategy for controlling the zeroth-order scale parameter beta. Can you explain the intuition behind dynamically adjusting beta across stages? How does this help improve utility?

2. The paper introduces a novel noise injection method that adds Gaussian noise to the difference of function values. How does this differ from existing noise injection strategies? What are the advantages?

3. Can you walk through the details of how the stagewise DP zeroth-order method guarantees ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-differential privacy? What are the key steps in the privacy analysis?

4. The paper leverages data-free pruning to identify important parameters for training. What is the motivation behind this? How does pruning boost scalability while preserving utility? 

5. What are the theoretical convergence rates derived for the proposed stagewise DP zeroth-order method? What are the key conditions and assumptions required to guarantee convergence?

6. How does the introduction of the "important matrix" help guide training on critical parameters? What are some ways the thresholds could be selected adaptively?

7. The paper demonstrates empirical results on both masked language models like RoBERTa and auto-regressive models like OPT. What differences did you observe? Why might this be the case?

8. What are some limitations of the proposed approach? What kinds of datasets or models might it not perform well on? 

9. The method requires selecting various hyperparameters like stage sizes, learning rates, clipping thresholds etc. What are some ways these could be set automatically?

10. The paper focuses on empirical case studies in NLP. What are some other potential application domains that this differentially private zeroth-order approach could be valuable for?
