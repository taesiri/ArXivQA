# [DRSM: efficient neural 4d decomposition for dynamic reconstruction in   stationary monocular cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00740)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reconstructing and rendering dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos captured by stationary cameras is challenging. Unlike multi-view 3D reconstruction methods that leverage geometric cues across views, modeling a dynamic scene from a single view is highly under-constrained and ill-posed. The paper aims to tackle this problem using neural rendering techniques.

Method - DRSM Framework:
The paper proposes a novel framework called DRSM for efficient neural 4D decomposition to enable high-quality reconstruction and rendering of dynamic scenes from monocular videos. The key ideas are:

1) 4D Scene Decomposition: The 4D dynamic scene is decomposed into static and dynamic components using planar factorization into spatial tri-planes (xy, xz, yz) for the static scene and space-time tri-planes (xt, yt, zt) for the dynamic components. This allows efficient 4D representation.

2) Importance Sampling: An adaptive sampling strategy called ISDM focuses more samples on dynamic regions and occluded areas to improve reconstruction quality there.

3) Depth Supervision: Since single-view geometry is ambiguous, explicit depth maps are provided as supervision to help constrain the geometry.

4) Regularization: Strong regularizers like TV loss are used to enable robust learning from the limited single-view data.

The framework combines these ideas to enable high quality and efficient 4D reconstruction of dynamic scenes from monocular videos.

Results:
The method is evaluated on a variety of real monocular videos showing dynamic scenes. Comparisons to prior arts like D-NeRF and NDR show DRSM produces higher quality novel view synthesis and 3D point clouds while being faster to train. Ablations verify the importance of the different components of the framework.

Contributions:
The key contributions are - (i) efficient 4D decomposition framework DRSM for reconstructing dynamic scenes from single-view videos (ii) adaptive sampling strategy ISDM (iii) use of depth maps to constrain ambiguity (iv) demonstrations of high quality rendering on real monocular videos.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel framework called DRSM that efficiently decomposes dynamic scenes from monocular videos into static and dynamic components using planar factorization, and reconstructs high-quality 4D representations by emphasizing learning of dynamic regions through dense ray casting, depth supervision, and specialized sampling strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing an efficient 4D decomposition framework (DRSM) with planar factorization for fast dynamic reconstruction in stationary monocular cameras. 

2) Addressing the inherent motion-appearance ambiguity for single-view inputs using depth prior.

3) Proposing an efficient importance sampling strategy (ISDM) based on dynamic and mask regions to improve the reconstruction quality for time-variant and occluded regions.

4) Demonstrating convincing rendering quality and smooth point clouds on multiple short-form videos.

In summary, the paper presents a novel neural framework that can decompose a dynamic scene from a single monocular video into static and dynamic components and reconstruct high quality renderings. The method handles challenges like motion-appearance ambiguity and occlusions through depth supervision and adaptive sampling. Experiments show it outperforms previous methods on reconstructing both geometry and appearance.
