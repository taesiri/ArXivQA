# [Assessing the Extrapolation Capability of Template-Free Retrosynthesis   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03960)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Template-based retrosynthesis models are limited to predicting reactions using a predefined set of reaction templates derived from known reactions. In contrast, template-free models are claimed to have the ability to discover novel synthesis pathways. 

- However, it remains unclear whether template-free models can effectively predict out-of-distribution (OOD) reactions and if the novel reactions they propose are chemically feasible.

Methodology:
- The authors curate an OOD dataset with reactions involving unseen reaction templates compared to a standard training set. They also sample an equal number of in-distribution (ID) reactions.

- They evaluate the top-k exact match and round-trip accuracy of template-free models (Transformer, Retroformer, Chemformer) on predicting the ID and OOD sets.

- They also analyze the validity, uniqueness and novelty of predicted reactions, especially investigating if template-free models generate reasonable novel reaction templates on the OOD set.

Key Findings:  
- While template-free models can predict some OOD reactions, their top-10 exact match accuracy is extremely low (<1%). Their round-trip accuracy is also much lower compared to ID reactions.

- More than 50% of the novel reactions predicted are chemically implausible, involving the use of unsuitable leaving groups.

Main Conclusions:
- Template-free models show potential in predicting novel reactions but their overall extrapolation capability remains limited. Considerations of chemical feasibility must be integrated when navigating unexplored reaction spaces.

- Substantial advancements in template-free models are necessary before they can reliably predict chemically valid novel synthesis pathways beyond established boundaries.
