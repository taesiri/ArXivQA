# [m2mKD: Module-to-Module Knowledge Distillation for Modular Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16918)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training modular neural networks poses optimization challenges due to sparse connectivity between modules. Using knowledge distillation from pretrained monolithic models could help, but conventional distillation methods fail when applied to modular networks due to unique architectures and enormous parameters.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a module-to-module knowledge distillation (m2mKD) approach to transfer knowledge between modules of the teacher and student models.

- The teacher model is first trained in a modular way using Deep Incubation. It is split into modules that are incubated using a smaller meta model. 

- Student modules are encouraged to mimic the behaviour of the corresponding teacher modules by combining them independently with the meta model and comparing outputs.

- Only the student module parameters are updated during this process. The distilled student modules are then used to initialize the full modular student model.

Key Contributions:

- First work to investigate knowledge distillation specifically for modular neural networks. Identifies challenges in this context.

- Proposes the module-to-module knowledge distillation (m2mKD) approach to address challenges, enables transforming monolithic models into modular ones.

- Demonstrates m2mKD improves performance of modular models - NACs and MoEs. Up to 5.6% better IID accuracy on TinyImageNet. Up to 4.2% better OOD robustness on TinyImageNet-R.

- Establishes feasibility of using Deep Incubation to train teacher modules in a modular way instead of just separating a pretrained monolithic model.

- Algorithm is general, does not impose restrictions on teacher or student model architectures. Can handle irregular distillation scenarios beyond monolithic-to-modular.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel knowledge distillation approach specifically tailored for modular neural networks to improve their training and performance by transferring knowledge in a module-to-module manner.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a module-to-module knowledge distillation (m2mKD) approach to transfer knowledge between modules of a pretrained monolithic teacher model and a modular student model to facilitate training and enhance performance of the modular architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a general module-to-module knowledge distillation (\texttt{m2mKD}) method for transferring knowledge between modules of modular neural networks. Specifically:

1) They propose \texttt{m2mKD} to address the challenges of distilling knowledge into modular models compared to conventional knowledge distillation methods designed for monolithic models. \texttt{m2mKD} distills knowledge at the module level rather than between whole models.

2) The approach splits a pretrained monolithic teacher model into modules and matches them with student modules from the target modular model. It encourages each student module to mimic the behaviour of the corresponding teacher module.

3) This allows transforming a pretrained monolithic model into a modular student model in a modular way. The method can handle irregular distillation scenarios and works for both monolithic-to-modular and monolithic-to-monolithic conversion.

4) They demonstrate the effectiveness of \texttt{m2mKD} on two modular architectures - Neural Attentive Circuits (NACs) and Vision Mixture-of-Experts (V-MoE). Results show accuracy gains on image classification over end-to-end training of the modular models.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and demonstrating a module-level knowledge distillation approach to transfer knowledge from monolithic to modular neural networks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Module-to-module knowledge distillation (m2mKD): The proposed knowledge distillation approach that transfers knowledge between modules of a teacher model and student model rather than full models.

- Modular neural architectures: Neural network models composed of independent modules that can be trained separately. Examples discussed include Neural Attentive Circuits (NACs) and Mixtures-of-Experts (MoEs).

- Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness: The ability of a model to generalize to data that is different from the original training distribution. Modular architectures are designed to have better OOD robustness. 

- Deep Incubation: A modular training technique that first trains a small meta model, then incubates modules separately by connecting them to the meta model before assembling the full modular model.

- Knowledge distillation: A model compression technique to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model, usually by having the student mimic the softened output logits of the teacher.

- Stitch layers: Linear layers inserted before and/or after student modules to adjust dimensions when connecting student and teacher modules to the shared meta model during m2mKD.
