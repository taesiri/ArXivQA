# [AI Hallucinations: A Misnomer Worth Clarifying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06796)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The term "AI hallucination" is used extensively to describe issues with artificial intelligence systems, but lacks a precise and consistent definition. This causes confusion and ambiguity when discussing AI hallucination across different applications. 

Main Contributions:
- Conducted one of the broadest systematic reviews of AI hallucination definitions across 14 databases spanning computer science, healthcare, and other domains
- Analyzed 333 definitions obtained to highlight lack of consistency in how the term is used
- Categorized definitions by application area and used an LLM to extract key points within each category
- Showed characteristics associated with AI hallucination differ across applications, ranging from "deviating from established knowledge" to "nonsensical"
- Presented summary of alternative terms suggested in recent literature to replace "AI hallucination", though issues remain

Proposed Solution:
- Establish consistent taxonomy and terminologies to describe issues currently labeled as "AI hallucination" 
- Formulate robust, formal definition of "AI hallucination" or replace with more semantically nuanced terms
- Take unified effort to bring clarity and coherence when discussing contemporary AI issues affecting multiple domains

The paper provides one of the most comprehensive reviews of AI hallucination definitions and uses this to highlight the need for more consistency in discussing the issues and phenomena currently described by this term. It calls for the AI community to establish a formal taxonomy as well as consider alternative terminologies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper conducts a systematic review of 333 papers to analyze the definitions and usage of the term "AI hallucination" across 14 databases and various applications, finding a lack of consistency but compiling key points that show differing extents of inaccuracy, and calls for more unified terminology and taxonomy going forward.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a systematic review of 333 papers from 14 databases covering diverse domains to identify the various definitions used for "AI hallucination" in the literature. The key findings are:

1) There is a lack of a consistent, formal definition of "AI hallucination". Definitions vary widely across different applications and contexts.

2) The characteristics attributed to "AI hallucination" are also not consistent, with some contradictory interpretations even within the same application. Terms like "unfaithful", "incorrect", "inaccurate", "nonsensical" are used in overlapping ways.  

3) The paper categorizes the 333 papers by application area and uses an LLM to extract key points of the definitions within each category. This highlights similarities and differences in how the term is used.

4) The paper also compiles alternative terms suggested in some recent papers as replacements for "AI hallucination", along with their provided definitions.

5) The paper calls for more systematic efforts to bring clarity and consistency in discussing "AI hallucination", including more semantically nuanced taxonomy of related terms, rather than just broadly using "hallucination" which has problematic connotations.

In summary, the main contribution is a broad, systematic review to highlight the lack of consistency in an important contemporary AI issue, analyze how the terminology is used, and provide some initial structure around definitions and alternatives to spur further research towards better taxonomy and terminology.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- AI hallucination
- Definitions
- Alternative terms
- Applications (chatbots, dialogue, generative AI, academia, health, legal/ethical, science, technology, translation, QA, summarization, etc.)
- Characteristics (inaccuracy, implausibility, irrelevance, fabrication, falsification, etc.)
- Issues (inconsistency, lack of consensus, potential harms)
- Systematic literature review 
- Analysis of definitions
- Summary of applications
- Calls for clarity and consistency

The paper conducts a broad systematic review of how the term "AI hallucination" has been defined and used across different applications. It highlights the lack of consensus around the term and presents an analysis of definitions categorized by domain. The authors argue for more clarity, consistency, and appropriate terminology related to this phenomenon in AI systems. Potential alternative terms are also discussed. Overall, it's a useful synthesis of definitions and issues around the notion of "hallucinations" in artificial intelligence.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors utilized a manual review process to examine the papers retrieved from the database searches. What are some of the limitations of this approach compared to using automated techniques like machine learning for paper screening and selection? How might those limitations have impacted the definitions collected?

2. The paper mentions iteratively modifying search queries within each database. Can you expand more on the iterative search process? What kinds of modifications were made and why? How did you balance castings a "wide net" with feasibility given the manual review?

3. Table 1 shows the final search methodology details for each database. Can you expand more on the decision-making process for determining the appropriate search fields, terms, and date ranges for each one? What factors dictated those choices?

4. The exclusion criteria only involved non-English records. Could relevant definitions have been missed by not considering papers in other languages? What steps were taken to mitigate this limitation? 

5. For databases with very large initial result sets, how did you systematically narrow down the list to a feasible number for full review? What factors determined which papers were chosen for closer examination?

6. What quality assessment criteria or critical appraisal methods were utilized when analyzing the content of papers selected for full review? How was the process standardized across definitions extracted?

7. What data management techniques or tools were leveraged to systematically collect, organize, and analyze the definitions extracted from 333 papers? How was inter-rater reliability ensured?

8. The discussion section mentions some limitations regarding potentially missed definitions despite the broad search. Can you further detail the tradeoffs made between search breadth and depth during the design of the review methodology?  

9. Can you expand more on the specific inclusion criteria, screening process, and data analysis methods that allowed you to strategically focus on definitions related to language models rather than other types of AI hallucination?

10. What future methodological improvements do you envision to enhance the collection of AI hallucination definitions across databases and applications? What advice would you give researchers aiming to reproduce or extend your review methodology in future work?
