# [Perception of Misalignment States for Sky Survey Telescopes with the   Digital Twin and the Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18214)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method to estimate the misalignment states of optical elements in telescopes by using sequences of point spread function (PSF) maps as input to a neural network. The authors leverage a digital twin model of the telescope to generate simulated misalignment states and corresponding PSF maps, which are used to train the neural network. A key contribution is the concept of a state graph to systematically explore the space of possible misalignment states and model the relationships between these states and PSF maps. To handle real-world conditions like atmospheric turbulence, the method employs transfer learning on the neural network. The approach is validated on different telescope designs, including Ritchey-Chrétien and prime focus configurations, with misalignment introduced on the primary and/or secondary mirrors. Results demonstrate that the method can effectively estimate tilt and decenter misalignments along different axes down to the sub-millimeter and sub-arcsecond scale even in the presence of noise and other degradations. The digital twin and state graph framework facilitates generating abundant training data to overcome ambiguity problems. By using sequences of PSF maps rather than single images, the technique can decouple intricate relationships between certain coupled misalignment states. In conclusion, this misalignment perception method, with the integration of simulation and deep learning, provides an automated way to maintain telescope performance with minimal human intervention.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to estimate misalignment states of optical elements in telescopes by using a digital twin to generate simulated misalignment data, constructing a state graph to store this data, and training a deep neural network on sequences of misalignment states and corresponding point spread functions to accurately predict misalignment from observed point spread functions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel method to estimate the misalignment states of optical elements in telescopes by using sequences of point spread functions (PSFs) instead of a single PSF. This allows the method to decouple intricately coupled misalignment states.

2. It introduces the concept of a "digital twin" of the telescope to generate large amounts of simulated misalignment state data and corresponding PSFs. This data is stored in a "state graph" which helps guide the data collection process.

3. It uses the state graph data to train a deep neural network to estimate misalignment states from sequences of PSF maps. An active learning strategy is employed to handle difficult to fit states.

4. It validates the method on different telescope designs under realistic conditions like atmospheric turbulence, noise, etc. The results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in estimating tilt and decenter misalignments along different axes for various optical elements.

In summary, the key innovation is using the digital twin and state graph to generate rich training data to allow a recurrent neural network to accurately estimate coupled misalignment states from continuous PSF observations. This enables automated misalignment detection for telescopes lacking wavefront sensors.
