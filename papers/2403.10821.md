# [H3-Mapping: Quasi-Heterogeneous Feature Grids for Real-time Dense   Mapping Using Hierarchical Hybrid Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10821)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing neural radiance field (NeRF) based dense mapping methods struggle to efficiently optimize scene texture, which limits their real-time performance. Uniform feature grids used in these methods cannot adapt well to varying levels of texture complexity across different scene regions. Besides, their keyframe selection strategies may not fully utilize the information in each keyframe.

Proposed Solution:
1) Introduce quasi-heterogeneous feature grids that combine the efficiency of uniform grids with the adaptability of non-uniform grids for texture modeling. It applies different space warping functions based on detected texture patterns - compressed grids for rich textures with low-frequency directions, scaled grids for weak textures, and identity warping otherwise. This allows better optimization of textures with limited samples.  

2) Propose a gradient-aided coverage-maximizing keyframe selection strategy. It treats regions with different texture complexity differently - selecting views that look closer at rich textures and have wider coverage for weak textures. An adaptive pruning method retain only useful historical keyframes.  

3) Use explicit octree SDF for geometry and integrate the above ideas into a hierarchical hybrid representation for real-time high-quality reconstruction.

Main Contributions:
1) Quasi-heterogeneous feature grids that enable efficient and adaptive texture modeling by approximating ideal heterogeneous grids.

2) Gradient-aided coverage-maximizing keyframe selection strategy combined with adaptive pruning that better utilizes information from selected keyframes.

3) A complete system combining the above with hierarchical hybrid geometry representation that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and faster runtime compared to existing NeRF mapping techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces adaptive texture modeling and informed keyframe selection to enhance detail reconstruction and accelerate convergence of neural radiance field based dense mapping approaches.
