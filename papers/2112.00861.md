# A General Language Assistant as a Laboratory for Alignment

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research questions this paper addresses are:1. Is naive prompting a workable baseline for alignment in large language models? How does it scale, and can it be leveraged without taxing model capabilities?2. When and how much does learning ranked preferences (preference modeling) improve on imitation learning for alignment-relevant tasks? 3. Can sample efficiency for preference modeling be improved with a pre-training stage, and does pre-training on binary discrimination transfer better than ranked preferences?The authors investigate these questions through a variety of experiments on alignment evaluations, toxicity, coding tasks, and preference modeling with different model sizes. The key findings seem to be:- Simple prompting provides a decent alignment baseline, improves with scale, and doesn't significantly impair large models. Prompting can also be "distilled" back into the original model.- Preference modeling greatly outperforms and scales better than imitation learning on tasks with ranked preferences, but not on binary tasks.- A preference model pre-training stage before finetuning significantly improves sample efficiency, especially when pre-training uses binary discrimination rather than ranked preferences.So in summary, the main research questions focus on understanding and improving techniques like prompting, preference modeling, and pre-training for aligning large language models. The authors find simple but promising techniques, while also identifying key areas needing more work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents research on training more aligned AI assistants using large language models. The main contributions include:- Studying prompt engineering as a simple technique for improving alignment. They find prompts can significantly boost performance on alignment evaluations without major taxes on model capabilities. They also introduce "context distillation" as an alternative to prompting.- Comparing the scaling of imitation learning, binary discrimination, and ranked preference modeling. They find ranked preference modeling can greatly improve on and scale better than imitation learning, while binary discrimination shows little benefit. - Introducing a "preference model pretraining" phase before finetuning that significantly improves sample efficiency. Pretraining on large public datasets like StackExchange transfers robustly.- Overall, the paper helps characterize when techniques like preference modeling and human feedback are most beneficial for alignment. The results suggest that progress on alignment may be possible using these methods. The authors frame alignment concretely in terms of training assistants that are helpful, honest, and harmless.
