# [KADEL: Knowledge-Aware Denoising Learning for Commit Message Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08376)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Commit messages describe code changes and are important for software development, but often lack quality and key details. 
- Existing commit message generation methods do not leverage the fact that some commits adhere to good practices (e.g. AngularJS rules) while others don't.

Solution - KADEL:
- Proposes a Knowledge-Aware DEnoising Learning (KADEL) method to improve commit message generation using good practice commits.  
- Builds a commit knowledge model trained on good practice commits to predict type and scope of changes.
- Uses this to label commits without this info and align training data distribution.  
- Handles inevitable noise using a dynamic denoising technique with distribution-aware confidence scores.

Key Contributions:
- Empirical study showing training on good practice commits boosts performance.
- KADEL method to transfer commit message knowledge to the entire dataset. 
- Commit knowledge model to predict missing type/scope labels.
- Dynamic denoising technique to handle noisy labeled data.
- Evaluated on large-scale MCMD dataset and achieved state-of-the-art results across metrics and languages. 
- Analysis of model components showed each provides significant gains.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel approach to effectively transfer commit message knowledge from good practice examples to improve generation performance overall, validated through comprehensive experiments. The dynamic denoising technique and empirical analysis of good practices are also valuable additions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called KADEL that introduces commit knowledge learned from good-practice data into commit message generation and uses a dynamic denoising technique to address noise, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a large public dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. An empirical study that discovers training on commit messages adhering to good practices (like the AngularJS commit message convention) significantly contributes to improved commit message generation performance.

2. Proposing a novel knowledge-aware denoising learning method called KADEL for commit message generation. It has two main components:

(a) A commit knowledge model trained on good practice data to provide commit message type and scope information. This allows aligning other training samples to good practices. 

(b) A dynamic denoising training method to handle noise in the supplementary type/scope information. It uses a distribution-aware confidence function and dynamic distribution list to enhance training.

3. Experimental evaluation showing KADEL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large MCMD dataset compared to previous methods. The results validate the effectiveness of incorporating commit message best practices into models.

In summary, the key innovation is leveraging developer knowledge and best practices encapsulated in high-quality commit messages to improve automatic commit message generation. Both incorporating this domain knowledge into models and handling noise during training are shown to be impactful.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Commit message generation - The main task that the paper focuses on, which is automatically generating commit messages to describe code changes.

- Good practice commits - A portion of commit messages that adhere to good practices or standards, such as the AngularJS commit message format. The paper finds these can significantly contribute to commit message generation. 

- Knowledge-aware - The paper proposes a knowledge-aware method that learns from and introduces commit knowledge into the model to improve training data and the training process.

- Denoising learning - The paper also proposes a dynamic denoising training method to deal with noisy labels and improve the training process.

- Distribution-aware confidence - A confidence function proposed that is based on inferring distributions of clean and noisy training data. 

- Dynamic distribution list - Used to track training loss distributions over epochs.

- Evaluation metrics - Metrics used such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE to evaluate similarity of generated vs reference commit messages.

So in summary, the key terms cover knowledge-aware and denoising learning for commit message generation, leveraging good practice commits, and evaluation metrics for this task.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a knowledge-aware denoising learning method called KADEL. What are the key components of KADEL and how do they contribute to improving commit message generation?
