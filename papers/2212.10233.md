# [Pre-trained Language Models for Keyphrase Generation: A Thorough   Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10233)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Keyphrase extraction and generation are important tasks that help summarize documents and improve search/recommendation systems. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been used for these tasks but there is a lack of systematic study on when and how to effectively utilize PLMs. 

Key Research Questions
- How do PLMs compare to state-of-the-art non-PLM methods on keyphrase extraction/generation, especially in low-resource settings? 
- Does the pre-training domain (general vs in-domain) impact performance?  
- Can encoder-only PLMs generate better keyphrases than encoder-decoder PLMs?
- What is the optimal parameter allocation strategy for building efficient seq2seq models?

Methods
- Formulate keyphrase extraction as sequence labeling and keyphrase generation as sequence-to-sequence generation
- Conduct extensive experiments with encoder-only PLMs (BERT, SciBERT) and encoder-decoder PLMs (BART, T5, SciBART)
- Introduce techniques to adapt BERT for sequence generation 
- Pre-train in-domain BART variants: SciBART and NewsBART
- Compare different model architectures and objectives

Key Findings
- Large/in-domain seq2seq PLMs approach state-of-the-art performance while being very sample efficient
- In-domain encoder-only PLMs can achieve strong performance, especially with limited resources
- Model depth should be prioritized over width for seq2seq models
- Allocating more layers to the encoder significantly improves results
- Introduced SciBART and NewsBART establish new state-of-the-art for scientific documents

In summary, the paper presents an in-depth empirical study on effectively utilizing PLMs for keyphrase generation. The findings provide concrete recommendations to build performant and efficient models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents an empirical study of using pre-trained language models for keyphrase extraction and generation, investigating encoder-only vs encoder-decoder models, in-domain vs out-of-domain PLMs, parameter allocation strategies for seq2seq models, and different formulations for identifying present keyphrases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It provides an in-depth empirical study on using pre-trained language models (PLMs) for keyphrase extraction and keyphrase generation. Specifically, it investigates encoder-only vs encoder-decoder PLMs, PLMs pre-trained in different domains, parameter allocation strategies for seq2seq PLMs, and different formulations for identifying present keyphrases.

2) It shows that large or in-domain seq2seq PLMs can approach state-of-the-art keyphrase generation performance while being much more sample efficient. 

3) It demonstrates for the first time that fine-tuning in-domain encoder-only PLMs can produce strong keyphrase generation models that are better than domain-general seq2seq PLMs in some cases.

4) It finds that with a limited parameter budget, prioritizing model depth over width and allocating more layers to the encoder leads to better performance for seq2seq models.

5) It introduces two new in-domain seq2seq PLMs called SciBART and NewsBART, and shows their effectiveness for keyphrase generation over general domain PLMs like BART. SciBART also establishes a new state-of-the-art on a scientific keyphrase generation benchmark.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive empirical study on strategies for effectively utilizing PLMs for keyphrase extraction and generation across different domains, model types, and resource constraints. The findings provide concrete recommendations to guide future research in this area.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares PLMs to several strong supervised baselines like SetTrans and ExHiRD-h. Could incorporating ideas from these methods into the PLM framework lead to further improvements? For example, could a PLM-based set prediction model outperform SetTrans?

2. For low-resource keyphrase generation, PLMs seem to have a clear advantage. But what is the minimum amount of in-domain data needed to fully realize this benefit? Is there a threshold effect where performance rapidly improves once a certain annotated dataset size is reached? 

3. This paper studies parameter allocation strategies for encoder-decoder PLMs under a fixed budget constraint. How would the conclusions change if the computational budget was fixed instead? Would deeper models still be preferred in that setting?

4. The paper introduces strong in-domain PLMs for the scientific and news domains. Could these PLMs be further improved with intermediate pre-training objectives like replaced token detection before the final language modeling objective? 

5. The encoder-decoder models generally perform better than encoder-only models. But could decoder-only models also work reasonably well if initialized with a strong domain-specific language model?

6. For finding present keyphrases, sequence labeling performs competitively. Could a multi-task learning approach combining generation and extraction further improve performance? Or does the extraction loss over-regularize the model?

7. The paper studies BERT models of different sizes. How would performance change for more modern PLMs like RoBERTa which use dynamic masking and large mini-batches? Are the conclusions still valid?

8. This paper focuses on extractive keyphrase generation where keyphrases must come from the source text. How do the conclusions change for abstractive generation where novel keyphrases are synthesized?

9. The paper introduces SciBART and shows strong performance on KP20k. Could continued pre-training of SciBART on other scientific summarization datasets lead to further gains?

10. The paper studies news and scientific documents. Would the overall conclusions remain unchanged for other domains like social media or biomedical text? Are certain model choices more or less important depending on domain?
