# [What can Discriminator do? Towards Box-free Ownership Verification of   Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15860)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can ownership verification of generative adversarial networks (GANs) be done by checking outputs only, without specifying the input (i.e. in a "box-free" setting)? The key points are:- Prior work on GAN ownership verification relies on a "black-box" setting where the defender can query the model with specific inputs to trigger hidden behaviors. However, this is not possible in applications like unconditional image synthesis where inputs cannot be controlled.- The authors propose using the discriminator's learned feature representations to capture the unique distribution learned by the paired generator. This allows verifying ownership without controlling the input.- They introduce two losses - a compactness loss to enclose the distribution in a hypersphere in feature space, and a Pearson correlation loss to prevent the discriminator's representations from degrading during training.- Experiments on image synthesis and translation tasks with multiple GAN architectures show the method can effectively verify ownership. It is also robust to various attacks like pruning, image transformations, and ambiguity attacks.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that GAN ownership can be verified without input control by exploiting the discriminator's learned representations. The paper proposes and validates a method to achieve this "box-free" verification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It identifies a limitation of existing black-box ownership verification schemes that rely on querying models with specific inputs. For generative tasks like unconditional image synthesis, choosing deterministic inputs is not allowed.2. It reveals the potential of well-trained discriminators in GANs to capture the unique distribution learned by the paired generator. Based on this, the authors propose the first box-free ownership verification scheme for GANs that does not require specifying inputs or training additional detection networks. 3. It introduces a compactness loss to learn a hypersphere enclosing the distribution learned by the generator using the discriminator's representations. A Pearson correlation loss is also proposed to quantify and preserve the discriminator's reconstruction ability.4. Extensive experiments on two GAN tasks and over 10 architectures show the scheme can effectively verify ownership. It is also shown to be immune to popular removal attacks like input transformations and robust against other existing attacks.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel box-free ownership verification scheme for GANs by exploiting the potential of discriminators to capture unique distributions. This overcomes limitations of input-based black-box schemes and is shown to be effective, scalable and robust.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper focuses specifically on ownership verification of GAN models, which has not been extensively explored before. Most prior work on IP protection has focused on classifiers rather than generative models. - The key insight is using the discriminator's learned representations to capture the unique distribution of the paired generator. This is a novel approach not proposed in other ownership verification schemes.- It operates in a box-free setting rather than relying on querying the model with specific inputs. This makes it more applicable to generative tasks where the inputs can't be controlled. Other black-box verification methods are more limited in this regard.- It does not require training any external detection networks or classifiers. Other attribution techniques often rely on training additional models for verification which is resource intensive.- The method appears robust against common attacks like pruning, image transformations, and ambiguity attacks. Most prior verification methods are shown to be vulnerable to such attacks.- The experiments cover a diverse set of GAN architectures and tasks. Many previous works focus on a single GAN or task. The scalability is demonstrated better here.- There is still a reliance on keeping the discriminator private. Some other works avoid this assumption. But the authors acknowledge this limitation.Overall, this paper makes significant contributions over prior art by specializing the verification scheme for GANs, devising a novel discriminator-based approach suitable for the box-free setting, demonstrating robustness to attacks, and showing versatility across models and tasks. The limitations are also clearly discussed.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Extending the distribution capturing insight to other generative models like diffusion models. The authors state this could be an interesting direction to explore.- Exploring effective methods to evade the proposed box-free verification scheme. The authors mention this could be future work to better understand the limitations and robustness of their method.- Applying the concept of empowering the discriminator for distribution capturing to other conditional GAN settings beyond just image synthesis and translation. The authors demonstrate it on these two tasks but do not explore other applications.- Developing more advanced discriminator architectures or training techniques to better preserve useful feature representations for distribution capturing. The authors use a basic discriminator and rely on the pearson correlation loss to avoid convergence issues.- Evaluating the approach on larger-scale and higher-resolution image generation tasks. The authors focus on 128x128 image sizes from LSUN and CelebA datasets. Testing on more complex datasets could further demonstrate scalability.- Extending beyond image generation tasks to other data modalities like text, audio, video, etc. The core concepts could potentially apply but would need validation.- Enhancing security by keeping the discriminator private to prevent ambiguity attacks, as discussed in the limitations. More work on secure storage and use of the discriminator could be beneficial.- Developing optimization techniques to make the training process more efficient and stable. The alternating training of network and radius parameters could potentially be improved.So in summary, the authors point to several worthwhile directions for advancing box-free GAN ownership verification and generative model security overall. Both improvements to their specific technique as well as extensions to other models, tasks, and data modalities are suggested.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a novel ownership verification scheme for GANs that works in a box-free manner without needing to specify deterministic inputs. It leverages the potential of the discriminator to capture the unique distribution learned by the paired generator during GAN training. Specifically, the discriminator is encouraged to preserve useful feature representations via an additional reconstruction task, which are then used to optimize a hypersphere enclosing the generator's distribution. Ownership verification can be performed by feeding synthesized images to the learned hypersphere network and checking if the representations fall inside. Experiments on image synthesis and translation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme. The key advantage is being immune to input-based removal attacks that are effective against prior black-box verification methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes a new method for verifying the ownership of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models in a "box-free" setting, where the owner cannot specify inputs to the model. Most prior works assume a black-box setting where the owner can query the model with specific inputs to trigger hidden behaviors that identify it. However, for GAN models that generate entire images, choosing inputs is not possible. To address this, the authors propose using the discriminator of a trained GAN model to capture the unique data distribution learned by the paired generator. They add a loss term based on the Pearson correlation coefficient to preserve the discriminator's ability to reconstruct latent codes. The discriminator embeddings are then used to learn a hypersphere enclosing the distribution. At test time, images can be fed to this network and proximity to the hypersphere indicates they come from the same distribution/model. Experiments on image synthesis and translation tasks with multiple GAN architectures show the method effectively verifies ownership without input selection. It is also robust to various attacks including pruning, image transformations, and ambiguity attacks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a novel box-free ownership verification scheme for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that can verify the ownership of a GAN model by only checking its generated outputs, without needing to specify input queries. The key insight is to utilize the discriminator's potential to capture the unique data distribution learned by the paired generator during GAN training. Specifically, the discriminator is encouraged to preserve useful feature representations by reconstructing the latent code, instead of converging trivially. These representations are then used to learn a hypersphere that encloses the generator's distribution in the embedding space. For ownership verification, images generated by a suspicious GAN model can be fed into this hypersphere network to obtain a proximity score indicating whether the distribution matches the source model.Compared to prior black-box verification methods relying on specially crafted inputs, this approach operates in a box-free manner without needing to control the input. Extensive experiments on image synthesis and translation tasks demonstrate its effectiveness on various GAN architectures. The scheme is also shown to be robust against attacks like pruning and input/output transformations.
