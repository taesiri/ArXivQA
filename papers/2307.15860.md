# [What can Discriminator do? Towards Box-free Ownership Verification of   Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15860)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can ownership verification of generative adversarial networks (GANs) be done by checking outputs only, without specifying the input (i.e. in a "box-free" setting)? The key points are:- Prior work on GAN ownership verification relies on a "black-box" setting where the defender can query the model with specific inputs to trigger hidden behaviors. However, this is not possible in applications like unconditional image synthesis where inputs cannot be controlled.- The authors propose using the discriminator's learned feature representations to capture the unique distribution learned by the paired generator. This allows verifying ownership without controlling the input.- They introduce two losses - a compactness loss to enclose the distribution in a hypersphere in feature space, and a Pearson correlation loss to prevent the discriminator's representations from degrading during training.- Experiments on image synthesis and translation tasks with multiple GAN architectures show the method can effectively verify ownership. It is also robust to various attacks like pruning, image transformations, and ambiguity attacks.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that GAN ownership can be verified without input control by exploiting the discriminator's learned representations. The paper proposes and validates a method to achieve this "box-free" verification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It identifies a limitation of existing black-box ownership verification schemes that rely on querying models with specific inputs. For generative tasks like unconditional image synthesis, choosing deterministic inputs is not allowed.2. It reveals the potential of well-trained discriminators in GANs to capture the unique distribution learned by the paired generator. Based on this, the authors propose the first box-free ownership verification scheme for GANs that does not require specifying inputs or training additional detection networks. 3. It introduces a compactness loss to learn a hypersphere enclosing the distribution learned by the generator using the discriminator's representations. A Pearson correlation loss is also proposed to quantify and preserve the discriminator's reconstruction ability.4. Extensive experiments on two GAN tasks and over 10 architectures show the scheme can effectively verify ownership. It is also shown to be immune to popular removal attacks like input transformations and robust against other existing attacks.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel box-free ownership verification scheme for GANs by exploiting the potential of discriminators to capture unique distributions. This overcomes limitations of input-based black-box schemes and is shown to be effective, scalable and robust.
