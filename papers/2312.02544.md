# [Characterization of Locality in Spin States and Forced Moves for   Optimizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02544)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new algorithm to efficiently escape from local minima when solving combinatorial optimization problems formulated as Ising or QUBO models. The key idea is to introduce "forced moves" to transition out of trapped states, guided by a measure of locality that quantifies the difficulty of escaping the current configuration. Specifically, the average single spin flip probability is used to judge if the system is stuck, and then a spin variable is selectively flipped according to a rule analogous to rejection-free sampling. This allows efficient hardware implementation while still enhancing transitions. Numerical experiments on a small spin glass system demonstrate that the proposed method with forced moves can find lower energy states much more frequently compared to conventional simulated annealing or parallel tempering alone. The results indicate promise for integrating this approach into specialized annealing hardware like quantum or CMOS annealers to boost performance on optimization tasks by mitigating issues with local minima.
