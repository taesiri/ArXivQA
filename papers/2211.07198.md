# [Fcaformer: Forward Cross Attention in Hybrid Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07198)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new vision transformer model called FcaFormer, which aims to improve model performance by densifying the attention pattern rather than sparsifying it like many prior works. 

The key ideas are:

- Introduce forward cross attention between blocks in the same stage, where tokens from previous blocks are reused as extra input to the attention modules in later blocks. 

- Use a token merge and enhancement (TME) module to generate representative cross tokens from previous blocks through depthwise convolutions. 

- Introduce learnable scale factors (LSFs) to calibrate the statistics of cross tokens before they are integrated with regular tokens.

The central hypothesis is that reusing tokens across blocks and enhancing interactions of tokens from different semantic levels will improve model performance with limited extra computational cost. Experiments on image classification, segmentation and detection verify that the proposed FcaFormer models outperform baseline vision transformers consistently across tasks and scales.

To summarize, the paper proposes a new densified attention pattern that reuse tokens across transformer blocks, and demonstrates its effectiveness empirically on various vision tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new vision transformer called FcaFormer, which improves model performance by densifying the attention pattern rather than sparsifying it like many previous works. The key contributions are:

- It proposes a new FcaFormer block that introduces forward cross attention to reuse and integrate tokens from previous blocks in the same stage. This enhances interactions between tokens of different semantic levels.

- Two new components are introduced - learnable scaling factors (LSFs) and a token merge and enhancement (TME) module. LSFs help calibrate the statistics of cross tokens before integrating them. TME aggregates cross tokens spatially and enhances regular tokens.

- FcaFormer models built with the proposed blocks achieve SOTA accuracy under similar model size constraints. For example, FcaFormer-L1 achieves 80.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 6.2M parameters, outperforming EfficientNet-L1 by 1.1%.

- Experiments on image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of FcaFormer blocks over baseline models like DeiT, Swin Transformers and ConvNeXT.

- Detailed analysis shows the extra computation cost of densified attention is limited, as most cost is in the FFN part. FcaFormer can reuse representations to achieve better accuracy with fewer parameters.

In summary, the key novelty is introducing forward cross attention to reuse and densify connections across transformer blocks, enabled by the proposed LSFs and TME modules. This opens a new direction for designing efficient vision transformer models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new vision transformer architecture called FcaFormer which densifies attention patterns by reusing features from previous blocks as additional inputs to later blocks, and shows this improves accuracy and efficiency versus baseline ConvNet and ViT models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on efficient vision transformers:

- The main difference is that this paper proposes densifying the attention connections, while much previous work focused on sparsifying attention to improve efficiency. So this provides a new direction for designing efficient transformers.

- Most prior work modified the spatial attention patterns within a transformer block, like using local windows or reducing the input tokens. This paper keeps spatial attention global but adds connections across blocks. 

- Many recent papers proposed hybrid ConvNet and transformer models. This paper shows the forward cross attention can improve these hybrid models, complementing those works.

- For model architectures, this paper evaluates the proposed approach on both pure transformers like ViT and hybrid models like LeViT. The consistent improvements across different base models demonstrates the general applicability. 

- The experiments cover classification, segmentation and detection. The improved results on downstream tasks show the backbone improvements transfer well. This is important for practical usages.

- Compared to knowledge distillation methods that require a teacher model, this work improves efficiency via architecture changes. So it provides a complementary way to strengthen vision transformers.

- For model analysis, this paper provides a detailed computational cost analysis showing the overheads of the denser attention are limited. The ablation studies also give insights into the design choices.

Overall, by densifying attention connections across blocks, this paper provides a new direction for efficient vision transformer design with solid experiment analysis. The approach appears generalizable and complementary to other existing work.
