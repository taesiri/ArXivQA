# [Fcaformer: Forward Cross Attention in Hybrid Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07198)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new vision transformer model called FcaFormer, which aims to improve model performance by densifying the attention pattern rather than sparsifying it like many prior works. 

The key ideas are:

- Introduce forward cross attention between blocks in the same stage, where tokens from previous blocks are reused as extra input to the attention modules in later blocks. 

- Use a token merge and enhancement (TME) module to generate representative cross tokens from previous blocks through depthwise convolutions. 

- Introduce learnable scale factors (LSFs) to calibrate the statistics of cross tokens before they are integrated with regular tokens.

The central hypothesis is that reusing tokens across blocks and enhancing interactions of tokens from different semantic levels will improve model performance with limited extra computational cost. Experiments on image classification, segmentation and detection verify that the proposed FcaFormer models outperform baseline vision transformers consistently across tasks and scales.

To summarize, the paper proposes a new densified attention pattern that reuse tokens across transformer blocks, and demonstrates its effectiveness empirically on various vision tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new vision transformer called FcaFormer, which improves model performance by densifying the attention pattern rather than sparsifying it like many previous works. The key contributions are:

- It proposes a new FcaFormer block that introduces forward cross attention to reuse and integrate tokens from previous blocks in the same stage. This enhances interactions between tokens of different semantic levels.

- Two new components are introduced - learnable scaling factors (LSFs) and a token merge and enhancement (TME) module. LSFs help calibrate the statistics of cross tokens before integrating them. TME aggregates cross tokens spatially and enhances regular tokens.

- FcaFormer models built with the proposed blocks achieve SOTA accuracy under similar model size constraints. For example, FcaFormer-L1 achieves 80.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 6.2M parameters, outperforming EfficientNet-L1 by 1.1%.

- Experiments on image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of FcaFormer blocks over baseline models like DeiT, Swin Transformers and ConvNeXT.

- Detailed analysis shows the extra computation cost of densified attention is limited, as most cost is in the FFN part. FcaFormer can reuse representations to achieve better accuracy with fewer parameters.

In summary, the key novelty is introducing forward cross attention to reuse and densify connections across transformer blocks, enabled by the proposed LSFs and TME modules. This opens a new direction for designing efficient vision transformer models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new vision transformer architecture called FcaFormer which densifies attention patterns by reusing features from previous blocks as additional inputs to later blocks, and shows this improves accuracy and efficiency versus baseline ConvNet and ViT models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on efficient vision transformers:

- The main difference is that this paper proposes densifying the attention connections, while much previous work focused on sparsifying attention to improve efficiency. So this provides a new direction for designing efficient transformers.

- Most prior work modified the spatial attention patterns within a transformer block, like using local windows or reducing the input tokens. This paper keeps spatial attention global but adds connections across blocks. 

- Many recent papers proposed hybrid ConvNet and transformer models. This paper shows the forward cross attention can improve these hybrid models, complementing those works.

- For model architectures, this paper evaluates the proposed approach on both pure transformers like ViT and hybrid models like LeViT. The consistent improvements across different base models demonstrates the general applicability. 

- The experiments cover classification, segmentation and detection. The improved results on downstream tasks show the backbone improvements transfer well. This is important for practical usages.

- Compared to knowledge distillation methods that require a teacher model, this work improves efficiency via architecture changes. So it provides a complementary way to strengthen vision transformers.

- For model analysis, this paper provides a detailed computational cost analysis showing the overheads of the denser attention are limited. The ablation studies also give insights into the design choices.

Overall, by densifying attention connections across blocks, this paper provides a new direction for efficient vision transformer design with solid experiment analysis. The approach appears generalizable and complementary to other existing work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Combining the forward cross attention design with prior research on sparsifying spatial attention patterns. As discussed in the paper, many previous works have focused on reducing the computational cost of self-attention by using sparse attention patterns spatially (e.g. local window attention). The authors suggest it is worth exploring if their proposed forward cross attention can be combined with these sparse spatial attention mechanisms to develop even more efficient transformer models.

- Applying the forward cross attention to other vision tasks beyond image classification, segmentation and detection. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed attention mechanism on several common vision tasks. However, they suggest it is worth exploring if similar benefits can be achieved when applying it to other vision tasks, such as pose estimation, depth prediction, etc.

- Adapting the forward cross attention design for other modalities such as natural language processing. The authors focus their experiments on vision models in this work, but suggest their cross attention approach may also be beneficial for transformer models in other domains like NLP. Further experiments would be needed to validate the generalization ability of their method.

- Exploring other techniques to generate and integrate cross-level tokens. The authors propose techniques like the token merge and enhancement module in this work, but suggest there may be other effective ways to produce and incorporate cross-level tokens that could be studied.

- Applying the ideas to transformer-based generative models. The authors focus on discriminative vision models in this work, but suggest their cross attention approach could also be relevant for transformer-based generative models, which could be an interesting direction to pursue.

In summary, the authors propose several promising research avenues, including combining their dense cross attention with sparse spatial attention, applying it to other tasks/modalities, and exploring alternative techniques for implementing cross-level attention in transformers.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes FcaFormer, a hybrid vision transformer model that improves efficiency and performance by densifying the attention pattern between blocks. Specifically, it introduces forward cross attention, where tokens from previous blocks are reused as additional input tokens to the multi-head self-attention in subsequent blocks. This densified attention enhances interactions between features from different semantic levels. To enable effective integration of cross tokens, the model uses learnable scaling factors and a token merge and enhancement module. Experiments on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20K semantic segmentation demonstrate that FcaFormer consistently outperforms baselines like DeiT, Swin Transformer, and ConvNeXt, achieving better accuracy and efficiency. For example, FcaFormer-L1 obtains 80.3% ImageNet accuracy using only 6.2M parameters and 1.4B MACs. The paper proposes a novel way of improving vision transformers by densifying rather than sparsifying attention.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new vision transformer block called FcaFormer, which densifies the attention pattern by reusing tokens from previous blocks to create forward cross-attentions between different semantic levels. This is in contrast to many recent works that sparsify attention to improve efficiency. The FcaFormer block has two main new components. First, it uses learnable scale factors (LSFs) to calibrate the reused tokens before they are fed into the attention module. Second, it utilizes a token merge and enhancement (TME) module to reduce and enhance the cross tokens. Together, these components help integrate information across blocks more effectively. 

Based on the FcaFormer block, the authors construct full models for image classification, segmentation, and detection. Experiments show the FcaFormer models consistently outperform baselines like Swin Transformers and ConvNeXT, achieving better accuracy and efficiency. For example, their FcaFormer-L2 achieves 83.1% ImageNet accuracy using only 16.3M parameters and 3.6B MACs, surpassing similarly sized models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of densifying attention patterns and reusing intermediate features, opening a promising research direction.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method proposed in the paper:

The paper proposes a new vision transformer block called FcaFormer that densifies the attention pattern by introducing forward cross attention between blocks in the same stage. Specifically, it reuses tokens from previous blocks as additional input to the multi-head self-attention (MHA) module in subsequent blocks. To enable effective integration of these cross tokens with the regular tokens, two new components are introduced - learnable scale factors (LSFs) that calibrate the cross tokens before inputting to MHA, and a token merge and enhancement (TME) module that aggregates and enhances the cross tokens using depthwise convolutions. By reusing existing tokens and promoting interactions between different semantic levels, the FcaFormer block improves model performance while keeping the computational cost increase limited. The authors incorporate the FcaFormer block into both vanilla ViT and hybrid ConvNet-transformer models, demonstrating consistent improvements across scales and tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing a new vision transformer architecture called FcaFormer that aims to improve model performance by densifying the attention patterns rather than sparsifying them like many recent works. The key ideas and contributions are:

- It proposes forward cross attention (Fca) blocks that connect input tokens to additional tokens from previous blocks to increase interactions across different semantic levels. This is opposite to recent works that use sparse attention.

- Two new components are introduced: learnable scale factors (LSFs) to calibrate the cross tokens before attention, and a token merge and enhancement (TME) module to generate representative cross tokens.

- FcaFormer models built with the proposed blocks achieve better accuracy and efficiency compared to baseline models like DeiT and Swin Transformers across image classification, segmentation and detection tasks.

- For example, FcaFormer-L2 achieves 83.1% ImageNet accuracy using only 16M parameters and 3.6B MACs, outperforming similarly sized models like Swin-Tiny and EfficientFormer-L1.

- The proposed cross attention only increases computational cost linearly rather than quadratically, and experiments show FcaFormer variants can have fewer parameters and FLOPs than baseline models while achieving better accuracy.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing forward cross attention to densify connections in vision transformers, which improves model performance across multiple vision tasks compared to sparse attention based models. The LSFs and TME components help enable an efficient implementation.
