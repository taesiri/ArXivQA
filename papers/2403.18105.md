## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Large Language Models for Education: A Survey and Outlook":

Problem: 
With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, there is great potential to apply them to improve various aspects of education. However, prior work has not provided a comprehensive review of LLM applications in education from a technological perspective. 

Solution:
This paper provides a systematic survey on LLMs for education, presenting a novel taxonomy to categorize LLM applications into: 1) Student assistance (question solving, error correction, confusion helper); 2) Teacher assistance (question generation, automatic grading, material creation); 3) Adaptive learning (knowledge tracing, content personalization); and 4) Commercial tools (chatbots, content creation, teaching aide, quiz generator, collaboration tools). An overview is provided on major datasets, benchmarks, risks and challenges as well.

Contributions:
1) Comprehensive and up-to-date survey on LLM applications across the spectrum of education scenarios, containing both academic research and commercial tools.

2) New technology-centric taxonomy that offers a thorough analysis from the technological angle on how LLMs assist students, teachers, adaptive learning and commercial products. 

3) Discussion on current risks, challenges and highlight future opportunities to urge deeper research into responsible and ethical application of LLMs for education.

Overall, this paper aims to provide a holistic technological landscape of LLMs in education, in order to equip educators, researchers and policymakers with the necessary knowledge to harness LLMs to transform educational practices for more effective personalized learning.
