# [Structure and Content-Guided Video Synthesis with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03011)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a generative model for controllable video editing that modifies the content of videos while retaining their structure? 

The key aspects of this research question are:

- Developing a generative model for video editing, rather than just image editing. This allows modifying video content directly while maintaining temporal consistency.

- Allowing controllable editing, where the user can specify desired modifications through text or images. This provides an intuitive interface for video editing.

- Retaining the structure and dynamics of the original video while modifying its content/appearance. This ensures the output video matches the motions and geometry of the input.

- Avoiding per-video training or processing, enabling fast editing of arbitrary videos. This makes the approach practical for real applications.

To address this overall question, the paper proposes a conditional latent diffusion model for video that is trained on a large dataset of videos and images. The model conditions on extracted structure information from the input video and desired content specified by the user. Key hypotheses include:

- Depth maps can sufficiently represent video structure for this task.

- CLIP embeddings can represent the desired content edits. 

- Joint image and video training will allow control over temporal consistency.

- Varying the structure representation during training will enable control over structure adherence.

So in summary, the central research question is how to build a controllable video editing model that retains structure while modifying content, using a scalable and generalizable approach. The paper proposes a conditional video diffusion model to address this question.
