# [PETScML: Second-order solvers for training regression problems in   Scientific Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12188)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In scientific machine learning (SciML), training deep neural networks typically relies on stochastic gradient methods. These have limitations in optimization efficiency and hyperparameter tuning.  

- Conventional second-order methods like L-BFGS, trust region, and inexact Newton have shown superior optimization performance in many scientific applications, but are rarely used in deep learning.

Methodology:
- The authors build a lightweight Python package called PETScML on top of the PETSc library to expose PyTorch/JAX neural networks to PETSc's suite of optimization solvers.

- They test conventional second-order solvers from PETSc on several SciML problems from recent literature - learning PDE operators with Fourier Neural Operators and DeepONets, discovering Green's functions.

- The solvers are compared against hand-tuned, adaptive stochastic gradient methods used in the original papers, matching all experimental settings.

Results:
- Across problems, second-order methods converge to better local minima with lower generalization error, with 1-2 orders of magnitude improvement over stochastic methods. 

- The trust region method using the Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation performs the best overall in terms of accuracy and computational cost.

- All second-order methods achieve similar or better performance with fewer hyperparameter tweaks than stochastic methods.

Conclusions:
- Conventional second-order methods can substantially improve accuracy in SciML regression tasks like learning surrogate models, with comparable or lower computational cost.

- The results demonstrate their optimization efficacy and ease of use through the PETScML interface. Future work will focus on further acceleration techniques and expanding applications.
