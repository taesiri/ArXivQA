# [Future Directions in Foundations of Graph Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02287)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper argues that while graph neural networks (GNNs) have seen great practical success, the theoretical understanding of their properties remains highly incomplete. It identifies key challenges that persist around developing a more thorough theory of GNNs related to their expressive power, generalization properties, optimization dynamics, and connecting theory to practical applications.

Main Proposal: 
The paper proposes shifting attention to developing a more balanced and realistic theory of graph machine learning that studies the interplay between expressivity, generalization, optimization, and applications. It outlines several concrete challenges within each of these areas that need to be addressed.

Key Challenges Highlighted:

Expressivity:
- Developing more fine-grained, geometric notions of expressivity beyond coarse combinatorial perspectives 
- Understanding the effect of practical architectural choices (activations, aggregations etc.) on expressiveness
- Deriving uniform expressiveness results quantifying model size required
- Studying expressiveness on practical graph classes like planar graphs

Generalization: 
- Linking expressiveness and architectural choices to generalization abilities 
- Understanding the role of graph structure and geometry of feature spaces
- Developing a theory of data augmentation for graphs
- Analyzing extrapolation abilities, especially to larger graphs

Optimization:
- Providing guarantees on convergence quality and rates for GNNs
- Unraveling the effect of architectural choices on optimization
- Analyzing the influence of graph structure on optimization
- Enabling successful training of deeper GNNs

Applications:
- Unified experimental evaluation of theoretical models (the "Theo-practical Dojo")  
- Library of implementations of theoretical GNN architectures
- Adapting theory to domain-specific constraints and needs
- Extending theory to other learning paradigms like self-supervised learning

Main Contributions:
- Identifies critical open challenges in developing a more thorough theory of graph neural networks
- Argues for studying expressivity, generalization, optimization in an integrated manner aligned with applications
- Proposes several concrete research directions within each area to address the challenges
- Calls for tighter integration of theory and practice through unified benchmarks and open-source libraries

The paper makes the case that addressing these challenges will lead to more realistic theoretical models of graph machine learning that also better guide practical applications and architecture choices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper argues that the graph machine learning community needs to develop a more balanced theory focused on understanding the interplay between the expressive power, generalization, optimization, and practical utility of graph neural networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this position paper is arguing for the need to develop a more balanced and practical theory of graph machine learning. Specifically, it highlights four key challenges that need to be addressed:

1. Developing a more fine-grained understanding of graph neural networks' (GNNs) expressive power, going beyond coarse combinatorial notions and considering practical architectural choices. 

2. Studying GNNs' generalization properties more thoroughly, especially understanding the interplay between expressivity, generalization, and graph structure.

3. Gaining a better theoretical grasp of the optimization dynamics and convergence guarantees of GNNs trained with stochastic gradient descent. 

4. Aligning graph machine learning theory better with practical needs and domain knowledge by proposing concrete ways to connect theory and practice.

To address these challenges, the paper outlines several concrete research directions and open problems. Overall, it calls for the graph machine learning community to shift its focus towards developing a more balanced theory that studies expressivity, generalization, optimization, and applications in an integrated manner.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods and proposals in this paper:

1. The authors argue for developing fine-grained expressivity results that provide explicit metric equivalencies between graph distances and feature distances (Challenge II.1). What specific techniques could be used to derive such fine-grained expressivity results? What challenges need to be overcome?

2. Challenge II.2 argues for understanding the effect of various architectural choices on expressive power, like activations, aggregations, and normalizations. What specific theoretical tools could be used to analyze how these choices influence expressivity? How can we extend existing coarse-grained expressivity results to account for these choices?  

3. How can we leverage fine-grained expressivity results connecting graph and feature distances (Challenge II.1) to potentially obtain tighter generalization bounds (Challenge III.2)? What specific techniques need to be developed?

4. Challenge III.1 proposes analyzing conditions under which increased expressive power leads to better generalization. What specific theoretical models and tools are needed to formally study this relationship? What challenges need to be addressed?

5. The authors argue for studying extrapolation, especially to larger graphs (Challenge III.4). What specific theoretical conditions need to be derived to characterize when extrapolation is possible? How can these conditions guide the development of methods to improve extrapolation?

6. Challenge IV.2 focuses on understanding the impact of architectural choices like aggregations and normalizations on optimization dynamics. What specific theoretical analyses from deep learning optimization can be adapted and applied to study this challenge?

7. How can the convergence analyses proposed in Challenge IV.1 be extended to incorporate practical activation functions instead of unrealistic linear assumptions? What new theoretical tools need to be developed?

8. What specific toy models of graph learning tasks solvable only by deep GNNs (Challenge IV.4) would be useful testbeds for developing new optimization techniques? What criteria should these models satisfy?

9. Challenge V.1 proposes a "Theo-practical Dojo" for standardized evaluation of theoretical GNN methods. What specific benchmarks, metrics, and visualization tools should be included? What protocols need to be established?

10. The authors argue for adapting theoretical GNN methods to domain needs (Challenge V.3). What methodology can be used to systematically elicit requirements from domain experts? How can theories and architectures be refined accordingly?
