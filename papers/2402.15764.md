# [Look Before You Leap: Problem Elaboration Prompting Improves   Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15764)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on NLP tasks when prompted appropriately. However, they still face challenges in complex reasoning tasks and can be sensitive to input context. Previous work has focused on enhancing reasoning processes and improving prompt robustness, but overlooking the role of the problem context.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new method called Problem Elaboration Prompting (PEP) to improve LLM reasoning abilities. PEP involves decomposing and elucidating the problem context before reasoning in order to enhance comprehension. Specifically:

- Decomposing breaks down the problem into distinct segments to disentangle complex or intertwined concepts.  
- Elucidating provides explanations or rephrases the segments to be more understandable to the model.

PEP can be easily combined with other prompting methods that focus on the reasoning process.

Main Contributions:
1. Proposes PEP method alongside chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency prompting for improving LLM reasoning.
2. Evaluates PEP extensively using GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT, showing consistent improvements over baselines across 6 datasets. Achieves state-of-the-art on GSM8k and SVAMP datasets.
3. Demonstrates PEP's effectiveness in mitigating the distraction problem, indicating promise for dealing with other ill-formed problems.
4. Provides analysis on the elaboration behaviors and error cases to inspire future work on the role of problem context.

In summary, the paper introduces a new dimension of prompting LLMs by pre-processing the problem context, and shows strong empirical evidence that this can enhance performance. The concept of elaborating the problem before reasoning is promising yet underexplored.
