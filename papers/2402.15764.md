# [Look Before You Leap: Problem Elaboration Prompting Improves   Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15764)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on NLP tasks when prompted appropriately. However, they still face challenges in complex reasoning tasks and can be sensitive to input context. Previous work has focused on enhancing reasoning processes and improving prompt robustness, but overlooking the role of the problem context.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new method called Problem Elaboration Prompting (PEP) to improve LLM reasoning abilities. PEP involves decomposing and elucidating the problem context before reasoning in order to enhance comprehension. Specifically:

- Decomposing breaks down the problem into distinct segments to disentangle complex or intertwined concepts.  
- Elucidating provides explanations or rephrases the segments to be more understandable to the model.

PEP can be easily combined with other prompting methods that focus on the reasoning process.

Main Contributions:
1. Proposes PEP method alongside chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency prompting for improving LLM reasoning.
2. Evaluates PEP extensively using GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT, showing consistent improvements over baselines across 6 datasets. Achieves state-of-the-art on GSM8k and SVAMP datasets.
3. Demonstrates PEP's effectiveness in mitigating the distraction problem, indicating promise for dealing with other ill-formed problems.
4. Provides analysis on the elaboration behaviors and error cases to inspire future work on the role of problem context.

In summary, the paper introduces a new dimension of prompting LLMs by pre-processing the problem context, and shows strong empirical evidence that this can enhance performance. The concept of elaborating the problem before reasoning is promising yet underexplored.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Problem Elaboration Prompting (PEP) that involves decomposing and clarifying the problem context before reasoning to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new method called Problem Elaboration Prompting (PEP) to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). PEP involves decomposing and clarifying the problem context before reasoning in order to enhance the model's comprehension.

2. It evaluates PEP extensively through experiments using GPT-3.5's davinci and turbo models. The results demonstrate that PEP consistently outperforms standard prompting methods like chain-of-thought and program-of-thought across several reasoning datasets. 

3. It shows that PEP can help alleviate the distraction problem where models are sensitive to irrelevant information in the context. This indicates PEP's promise in dealing with other types of ill-formed problems.

4. The paper provides ablation studies and error analyses to give insights into the workings of PEP. It also combines PEP with techniques like self-consistency to achieve state-of-the-art results on datasets like GSM8k and SVAMP.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the PEP method to enhance reasoning in LLMs by elaborating on the problem context. The paper shows strong potential for PEP and hopes it will inspire further work on understanding the role of problem contexts.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Problem Elaboration Prompting (PEP): The proposed method to improve reasoning capacities of large language models by decomposing and elucidating the problem context prior to reasoning.

- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting: An existing method that guides language models to generate solutions in a step-by-step manner to elicit reasoning abilities. PEP is designed to enhance CoT.

- Emergent reasoning abilities: The ability of large language models to perform tasks like reasoning without explicit training, enabled by techniques like prompting. PEP aims to improve this.

- Mathematical reasoning: One of the complex reasoning abilities tested in the paper using datasets like GSM8k. PEP showed good improvements on mathematical reasoning tasks.

- Distraction problem: The tendency of language models to get distracted by irrelevant information in the problem context. PEP helped alleviate this issue. 

- Problem comprehension: A key aspect that PEP focuses on by simplifying and clarifying the problem before reasoning, to enhance language models' understanding.

- Self-consistency: A decoding strategy that generates multiple solutions and selects the consensus one to improve consistency. Used along with PEP.

- Zero-shot prompting: The setting used to evaluate PEP where no gradient updates are made to the language models. Only prompting instructions are provided as input.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Problem Elaboration Prompting (PEP) method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper states that PEP adopts a "look before you leap" approach to reasoning. How might this compare and contrast to other step-by-step reasoning methods like chain-of-thought prompting? What are the unique advantages and disadvantages?

2. The design principles of PEP involve both decomposing and elucidating the problem context. What is the rationale behind each of these principles? What role does diversity of context play?  

3. How does PEP's approach to elaboration compare to existing techniques like semantic parsing or least-to-most prompting? What key differences are there in the goals and formulation?

4. What types of errors or changes in meaning might occur when a problem context is elaborated via PEP? How might the assumptions made in rephrasing affect downstream reasoning?

5. The results show PEP helps alleviate distraction problems. What factors contribute to this? How might the elaboration process mitigate irrelevant context differently than other techniques?

6. Would PEP be as effective when applied to a different domain like commonsense reasoning instead of mathematical word problems? What adaptations might be needed?

7. Could elaboration instructions be generated dynamically on a per-example basis instead of using a single broad prompt? What methods could be used?

8. How well does PEP translate to smaller language models compared to large models? What efficiency or capability issues might arise?

9. What risks or ethical concerns might arise from broader deployment of elaboration-based prompting systems like PEP? How could they be addressed?

10. The paper focuses on zero-shot application, but how could the concepts behind PEP be integrated with training methodologies like instruction tuning to further improve reasoning?
