# [Self-Supervised Point Cloud Completion via Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10701)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research goals of this paper are:1. To develop a self-supervised method for point cloud completion that does not require complete point clouds for supervision. The paper aims to train a model using only partial point clouds.2. To propose an inpainting-based approach where regions are randomly removed from partial point clouds and the model learns to complete the entire cloud. This allows the model to be trained without ground truth completions. 3. To design a multi-scale architecture with global and local encoders/decoders that learns both global shape priors and specialized embeddings for completing local regions. This is aimed at improving generalization.4. To demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to previous unsupervised methods on standard point cloud completion benchmarks like ShapeNet and SemanticKITTI.In summary, the main research goals are developing a self-supervised point cloud completion method using only partial scans, leveraging ideas like inpainting and multi-scale processing, and showing improved performance over prior work. The key hypothesis is that the proposed inpainting approach and architecture can learn effective shape priors and completion without full supervision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a self-supervised method for point cloud completion that can be trained using only partial point clouds, without requiring complete ground truth shapes. The key ideas are:- Using an inpainting-based approach with random region removal to enable the network to complete full shapes in a self-supervised manner. - A multi-level encoder-decoder architecture that partitions the point cloud into local regions to learn specialized embeddings and also reasons globally. This allows combining local and global shape priors.- The inpainting approach makes the method robust to alignment errors in the estimated pose normalization, compared to prior work.- Experiments show the method outperforms prior unsupervised completion techniques on both synthetic (ShapeNet) and real (Semantic KITTI) datasets.In summary, the main contribution is developing a self-supervised point cloud completion method using ideas of inpainting and multi-level reasoning that achieves state-of-the-art results while only requiring partial point clouds during training. This could enable completion on real-world lidar data where ground truth shapes are not available.
