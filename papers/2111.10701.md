# [Self-Supervised Point Cloud Completion via Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10701)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research goals of this paper are:1. To develop a self-supervised method for point cloud completion that does not require complete point clouds for supervision. The paper aims to train a model using only partial point clouds.2. To propose an inpainting-based approach where regions are randomly removed from partial point clouds and the model learns to complete the entire cloud. This allows the model to be trained without ground truth completions. 3. To design a multi-scale architecture with global and local encoders/decoders that learns both global shape priors and specialized embeddings for completing local regions. This is aimed at improving generalization.4. To demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to previous unsupervised methods on standard point cloud completion benchmarks like ShapeNet and SemanticKITTI.In summary, the main research goals are developing a self-supervised point cloud completion method using only partial scans, leveraging ideas like inpainting and multi-scale processing, and showing improved performance over prior work. The key hypothesis is that the proposed inpainting approach and architecture can learn effective shape priors and completion without full supervision.
