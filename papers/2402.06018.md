## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper presents the design and evaluation of a versatile robotic gripper for autonomous manipulation tasks. The key goal is to create an affordable system ($460 in parts) that can robustly perform a wide variety of household, industrial and warehouse automation tasks. 

The proposed gripper has two fingers driven by servo motors, providing independent torque control for active compliance. A camera is integrated into the palm to enable robust vision-based manipulation with minimal occlusion. The fingers, base, and camera are mounted using off-the-shelf components like 3D printed parts, standoffs and bearings for easy manufacturability.  

The gripper can apply forces up to 32N with high precision (0.08N increments). Its perception, planning and control software pipeline combines deep learning-based segmentation, point cloud processing, task planning with PDDL, and behavior trees for sequencing robot skills. The pipeline focuses on modularity andrecovering from failures by replanning, to enable long-term autonomous operation.

The authors demonstrate the gripper's capabilities through pick-and-place tests, characterization of its force control, and two manipulation tasks: 1) reliably assembling the Siemens gear assembly with sub-millimeter tolerances in an open-loop manner, and 2) a closed-loop block stacking demo requiring perceptual feedback and replanning when towers were accidentally hit.

In conclusion, the paper presents an integrated robotic manipulation system using off-the-shelf components that can perform a wide variety of real-world automation tasks in a robust and cost-effective manner. The emphasis on compliance, perception, planning software makes it highly versatile while keeping costs low.
