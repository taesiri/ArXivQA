# [When Do LLMs Need Retrieval Augmentation? Mitigating LLMs'   Overconfidence Helps Retrieval Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11457)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle to accurately perceive the boundaries of their factual knowledge, tending to be overconfident in their answers. This makes it challenging to determine when retrieval augmentation is needed.

- There is a need to enhance LLMs' ability to perceive their own knowledge limitations to facilitate more effective retrieval augmentation only when needed.

Methods & Contributions:

1) Quantitatively assessed LLMs' perception of factual knowledge boundaries:
- Proposed metrics like alignment, overconfidence and conservativeness to measure this.
- Found main issue is LLMs' overconfidence causing poor alignment between confidence and accuracy.

2) Studied correlation between LLM certainty and reliance on retrieved docs: 
- Grouped questions into certainty levels and tested reliance on documents across levels.
- Showed more uncertainty correlates with more reliance on external information.

3) Proposed methods to enhance LLMs' perception of knowledge boundaries:
- Methods to make models more prudent (Punish, Challenge, Think-Step-by-Step) 
- Methods to improve QA accuracy (Generate, Explain)
- Showed Punish and Explain are most effective, combining them works best.

4) Validated methods benefit adaptive retrieval augmentation:
- Trigger retrieval only when LLM expresses uncertainty, across different methods
- Show comparable or better performance than always retrieving, with fewer retrievals

Key outcome is developing prompting strategies to make LLMs better aware of their knowledge limitations. This facilitates more selective and efficient use of retrieval to augment capabilities only when needed.
