# [DINER: Disorder-Invariant Implicit Neural Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07871)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the representation capacity and accuracy of implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling signals. 

The key hypothesis is that the performance of INR is limited by the spectral bias in network training, which makes it difficult for INR to accurately represent high-frequency signal components. To address this, the authors propose a disorder-invariant implicit neural representation (DINER) that uses a hash-table to re-arrange the input signal coordinates. This is hypothesized to map the signal to have more low-frequency components, which can then be more accurately modeled by the INR network.

In summary, the main research question is how to enhance INR through mapping the input signal to reduce high frequencies. The key hypothesis is that adding a hash-table stage before the INR network can achieve this goal and improve overall representation accuracy. The experiments aim to validate whether DINER achieves better performance across different tasks compared to standard INR approaches.
