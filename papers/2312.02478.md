# [RL-Based Cargo-UAV Trajectory Planning and Cell Association for Minimum   Handoffs, Disconnectivity, and Energy Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02478)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based approach for joint trajectory planning and cell association of cargo unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The goal is to minimize energy consumption, number of handoffs, and cellular disconnectivity time along the UAV's path between a retailer warehouse and a customer drop-off location. An RL agent hosted on the UAV explores and learns the optimal policy to pick actions based on the UAV's state, including its 3D location and serving cell, while maximizing a customized reward function. Through simulations using a real dataset from Leuven, Belgium, the authors demonstrate superior performance of the proposed RL algorithm compared to benchmark schemes in terms of reducing handoffs and disconnectivity percentage, at the cost of slightly higher energy consumption. Overall, the flexibility of the RL-based solution allows optimizing cellular reliability and signaling overhead that are crucial for command and control of cargo UAVs during beyond visual line-of-sight operations.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based algorithm for joint trajectory planning and cell association of cargo unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, the key aspects are:

1) Formulating the cargo-UAV trajectory planning and cell association as a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to minimize energy consumption, reduce handoff events, and guarantee reliable cellular connectivity along the trajectory. 

2) Leveraging reinforcement learning to jointly optimize the cargo-UAV's trajectory and cell association policy to solve this problem. The RL agent hosted on the UAV collects state information, takes actions regarding motion direction and cell association, and receives rewards based on the optimization objectives.

3) Defining customized state, action, and reward functions for the RL agent to enable this joint trajectory and cell association optimization.

4) Demonstrating through simulations that the proposed RL-based approach outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of reducing handoff events and disconnectivity percentage, while maintaining reasonable energy consumption.

In summary, the key contribution is using a novel RL-based technique to jointly optimize multiple aspects of cargo-UAV operations - trajectory planning and cell association - to improve the efficiency and reliability of UAV delivery missions.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Cargo unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are promising for last-mile delivery but face challenges like limited battery capacity, unreliable cellular connectivity, and frequent handoffs due to high mobility. 
- Existing cellular networks are designed for ground users and simply reusing them for aerial users is problematic.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel approach for joint cargo UAV trajectory planning and cell association to address the above challenges. 
- They formulate the cargo UAV mission as a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize: (1) energy consumption, (2) handoff events, (3) guarantee connectivity reliability along the trajectory.
- A reinforcement learning (RL) based algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the UAV's trajectory and cell association. The RL agent on the UAV collects state, takes actions on motion and cell association, and gets rewards.
- The RL model is trained over episodes until convergence to learn the optimal policy. The output is the best joint trajectory and associated cells for the mission.
