# [RL-Based Cargo-UAV Trajectory Planning and Cell Association for Minimum   Handoffs, Disconnectivity, and Energy Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02478)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based approach for joint trajectory planning and cell association of cargo unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The goal is to minimize energy consumption, number of handoffs, and cellular disconnectivity time along the UAV's path between a retailer warehouse and a customer drop-off location. An RL agent hosted on the UAV explores and learns the optimal policy to pick actions based on the UAV's state, including its 3D location and serving cell, while maximizing a customized reward function. Through simulations using a real dataset from Leuven, Belgium, the authors demonstrate superior performance of the proposed RL algorithm compared to benchmark schemes in terms of reducing handoffs and disconnectivity percentage, at the cost of slightly higher energy consumption. Overall, the flexibility of the RL-based solution allows optimizing cellular reliability and signaling overhead that are crucial for command and control of cargo UAVs during beyond visual line-of-sight operations.
