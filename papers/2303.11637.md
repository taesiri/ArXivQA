# [Equiangular Basis Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11637)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an effective and scalable classifier for deep neural networks that does not require a large number of trainable parameters. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a method called Equiangular Basis Vectors (EBVs) as an alternative to the commonly used fully-connected (FC) classifier layer with softmax. The key ideas behind EBVs are:

- Predefine a fixed set of normalized vector embeddings ("basis vectors") for each class, with equal angles between the vectors. The number of basis vectors scales sub-linearly with the number of classes.

- Optimize the feature representation to minimize the spherical distance to the corresponding class's basis vector, rather than learning a large FC weight matrix.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that EBVs can achieve competitive accuracy to FC+softmax classifiers while being much more parameter-efficient and scalable as the number of classes grows. The experiments on ImageNet and other datasets aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes Equiangular Basis Vectors (EBVs) to replace the fully connected classifier layer in deep neural networks for image classification tasks. 

2. EBVs predefine fixed normalized vector embeddings (called basis vectors) for each class, with the vectors constrained to have equal angles between each other. The learning objective then becomes minimizing the spherical distance between the embedding of each input and its corresponding categorical basis vector.

3. Compared to regular classifiers, EBVs have fixed parameters that do not increase with number of classes. Compared to metric learning methods, EBVs do not need to compute sample distances. This makes EBVs efficient for large-scale datasets.

4. Experiments on ImageNet, COCO, ADE20K show EBVs can match or outperform regular classifiers, while being more parameter-efficient. Analyses also show EBVs represent images differently than regular classifiers.

5. Theoretical analysis provides constraints on the relation between the angle threshold, embedding dimension, and maximum number of vectors for EBVs. An algorithm is provided to generate EBVs satisfying the constraints.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing EBVs as an alternative to fully connected classifiers, which is more efficient, achieves strong performance on image tasks, and represents images differently. Theoretical and algorithmic analyses support generating the EBVs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Equiangular Basis Vectors (EBVs) as fixed normalized vector embeddings for categories that do not change during training, allowing the model parameters to remain constant as the number of classes grows while still achieving strong performance on image classification tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper on Equiangular Basis Vectors (EBVs) compares to other related work in image classification and metric learning:

- Most prior work uses a trainable fully connected layer with softmax for classification. This causes the number of parameters to scale linearly with the number of classes. EBVs uses fixed normalized vector embeddings for each class, keeping model size constant regardless of number of classes.

- Compared to metric learning methods like triplet loss, EBVs do not require optimizing distances between large sets of sample embeddings. EBVs just optimize each sample to its corresponding class embedding, reducing computational cost. 

- EBVs are more scalable than prior spherical classification methods like Hyperspherical Prototypes, which saw significant accuracy drops when prototype dimension was reduced. EBVs maintain accuracy even with much lower dimension than number of classes.

- EBVs provide a simple but effective alternative to a standard trainable classifier. They achieve strong results without requiring extensive tuning or training tricks. Prior methods like HoTS often need complex training schemes. 

- Most prior work formulates classification as regression to class centers or separation of classes. EBVs take a more direct approach of fitting samples to predefined orthogonal class vectors on a hypersphere.

- Compared to metric learning, EBVs don't update class embeddings during training. This prevents class representations from being disrupted by individual samples.

Overall, EBVs offer a novel classification formulation that is simple, scalable, and achieves strong accuracy. The comparisons suggest EBVs are a promising new approach compared to prior work in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring the relations between each basis vector pair and embedding hierarchies when generating the proposed EBVs. The paper notes that the normal Euclidean space could not naturally embed hierarchies on datasets with known semantic hierarchies. The authors suggest exploring how EBVs could potentially embed such hierarchies.

- Evaluating the performance of EBVs on tasks with a very large number of categories. The paper shows promising results on ImageNet with 1,000 classes, but notes it would be interesting to test how well EBVs scale to much larger category sets.

- Adopting EBVs for other related tasks such as incremental learning and few-shot learning. Since EBVs provide a different classifier approach, the authors suggest it could be beneficial to apply EBVs to other classification-related tasks beyond standard image classification.

- Further analyzing the representations learned by models using EBVs, compared to standard fully connected classifier layers. The authors provide some initial analysis showing differences in learned representations, but suggest more analysis could provide additional insights.

- Exploring variants and extensions of the EBVs approach, such as using different underlying distance/loss functions beyond cosine distance. The authors note some possibilities for extensions of the core EBVs idea.

In summary, the main suggested directions are: exploring hierarchical relationships and scaling to more categories with EBVs, applying EBVs to related classification tasks, analyzing representations learned with EBVs, and developing extensions or variants of the EBVs technique. The authors propose EBVs as a new approach to classification, and suggest several ways to build on this initial work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes Equiangular Basis Vectors (EBVs) for image classification tasks. Instead of using a standard fully-connected classifier layer, EBVs predefines fixed, normalized vector embeddings with equal status (equal angles) for each class. These basis vectors are generated to be as orthogonal as possible to each other on the unit hypersphere. The learning objective is altered to minimize the spherical distance between the embedding of an input image and its corresponding categorical basis vector. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO, and ADE20K show EBVs can outperform regular fully-connected classifiers, especially with limited training data. Unlike metric learning methods, EBVs do not require optimizing distances between sample pairs/triplets, thus reducing training cost. Overall, EBVs provide an effective and efficient alternative to fully-connected classifiers for large-scale classification tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Equiangular Basis Vectors (EBVs) for image classification tasks. EBVs are fixed normalized vector embeddings that are pre-defined for each class. The vectors have equal status (equal angles) and are close to orthogonal to each other. During training, rather than learning a classifier on top of the features, the model minimizes the spherical distance between the learned feature representation and the predefined basis vector for that class. At test time, predictions are made by finding the closest basis vector. 

The benefits of EBVs are that the classifier parameters do not increase as more classes are added, avoiding linear growth of memory and computation. Compared to metric learning approaches, EBVs do not require calculating distances between sample pairs or class centers, reducing training cost. Experiments on ImageNet, COCO, and ADE20K show EBVs outperform models with standard fully connected classifier layers. Ablation studies demonstrate EBVs are effective across various network architectures, optimizers, and training schedules. Analysis of feature similarity indicates EBVs alter representations to increase similarity of early layers versus models with a fully connected classifier.

In summary, the paper introduces EBVs as an efficient alternative to fully connected classifiers that keeps computation constant as classes scale while achieving strong accuracy. By using pre-defined orthogonal embeddings optimized for spherical distance, EBVs provide gains without the cost of metric learning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called Equiangular Basis Vectors (EBVs) for image classification. The key idea is to predefine fixed normalized vector embeddings called "basis vectors" for each category, where the angles between the basis vectors are constrained to be equal. During training, instead of using a standard classifier like a softmax layer, the model is trained to map input images to embeddings that are close to the basis vector of their ground truth category based on cosine distance. The benefits are that the classifier parameters do not grow as the number of classes increases, and it avoids some computational costs compared to methods like metric learning. The basis vectors satisfy constraints on the angles between them to make them equiangular, and the paper discusses methods to generate them. Experiments on ImageNet and other datasets demonstrate benefits over standard classifiers in accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency.
