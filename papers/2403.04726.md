# [A Sub-Quadratic Time Algorithm for Robust Sparse Mean Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04726)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the algorithmic problem of robust sparse mean estimation. In this problem, the goal is to estimate an unknown sparse mean vector $\mu$ from samples corrupted by outliers. Specifically:

- The algorithm is given $n$ samples from a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu,I)$, where $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $k$-sparse vector (at most $k$ non-zero entries). 

- An adversary can corrupt up to an $\epsilon$ fraction of the $n$ samples by replacing them with arbitrary outliers.

- The goal is to output an estimate $\hat{\mu}$ that is close to $\mu$ despite the outliers.

Prior algorithms achieve sample complexities scaling as $\mathrm{poly}(k,\log d, 1/\epsilon)$ but have quadratic runtimes of $O(d^2)$. This can be prohibitive in high dimensions.

Main Contribution:
The paper gives the first algorithm for robust sparse mean estimation with:

- Sample complexity $\mathrm{poly}(k,\log d, 1/\epsilon)$, matching previous work
- Subquadratic runtime of roughly $d^{1.62}$.

Key Ideas:

- Use a subroutine based on recent work in detecting correlations to identify a small subset $H$ of coordinates with large sample covariance.

- If $H$ is small, robustly estimate the mean over $H$ and threshold other coordinates. Else use $H$ to filter outliers.   

- Carefully balance parameters to ensure (a) correlations can be detected quickly and (b) stability over iterations.

The analysis relies on a certificate lemma, filtering lemma, and properties of Gaussian distributions. By avoiding computation of the full sample covariance matrix, the algorithm breaks the quadratic runtime barrier.

In summary, the paper gives the first subquadratic time algorithm for robust sparse estimation under a strong contamination model. This helps bridge the gap between robust and non-robust sparse estimation and addresses an open problem in the field.
