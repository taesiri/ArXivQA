# [VQ-NeRV: A Vector Quantized Neural Representation for Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12401)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional video codecs rely on manually designed encoders/decoders, have high complexity, and are computationally expensive. 
- Implicit neural representations (INRs) are simple and efficient but suffer from low compression ratios and lack of content adaptivity.  
- Hybrid neural representations like HNeRV address content adaptivity but overlook leveraging shallow features and inter-frame residuals.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes VQ-NeRV, a U-shaped architecture with a novel VQ-NeRV Block to capture shallow residuals and inter-frame information.
- VQ-NeRV Block uses a codebook to discretize residuals into tokens for lower bitrate and simulates skip connections in the decoder. 
- Introduces shallow codebook optimization to improve codebook usage and avoid index collapse.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes plug-and-play VQ-NeRV Block to enhance reconstruction via simulated skip connections and inter-frame residuals.
- Leverages Haar transform and invertible blocks for lossless down/up-sampling in the Block.
- Introduces shallow codebook optimization to improve codebook utility by replacing unused codes.  
- Achieves 1-2 dB PSNR gains over state-of-the-art with faster convergence and improved video interpolation.
- Demonstrates rate-distortion gains over hybrid/implicit representations in compression.

In summary, VQ-NeRV advances state-of-the-art in video representation via effectively capturing shallow features and inter-frame information through a novel VQ-NeRV Block with optimized codebook. It shows marked gains in tasks like compression, interpolation and inpainting over prior arts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes VQ-NeRV, a vector quantized neural representation for videos that incorporates a novel VQ-NeRV Block to discretize shallow features and inter-frame residual information into a codebook, enabling improved video reconstruction quality and compression ratio.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) Proposing a novel plug-and-play component called the VQ-NeRV Block that uses a codebook mechanism to discretize shallow features and inter-frame residual information from the neural network. This enhances the network's reconstruction capability and improves video compression performance.

2) Introducing an original codebook optimization technique called "shallow codebook optimization" that is designed to refine the utility and efficiency of the codebook by replacing unused code vectors during training. 

3) Using a U-shaped architecture and the VQ-NeRV Block to effectively leverage both shallow features and inter-frame residual information. This allows simulating skip connections between the encoder and decoder to improve performance.

4) Achieving state-of-the-art results on video reconstruction, compression, inpainting and interpolation tasks compared to previous hybrid and implicit neural representation methods. The method delivers higher quality, better compression ratios, and improved generalization ability.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the VQ-NeRV framework with the VQ-NeRV Block and shallow codebook optimization that advance the capabilities of neural video representations.
