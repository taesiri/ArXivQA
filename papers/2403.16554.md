# [PE: A Poincare Explanation Method for Fast Text Hierarchy Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16554)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models for NLP lack interpretability due to their black-box nature. Hierarchical Attribution (HA) methods have been proposed to explain models by identifying important feature interactions at different levels. 
- However, existing HA methods have limitations: 1) They rely on exhaustive search over all possible feature combinations, which is inefficient, 2) They neglect inherent linguistic structure and relations in the text that could help produce more interpretable hierarchies.

Proposed Solution - PE (Poincar√© Explanation):  
- Leverages hyperbolic geometry to construct hierarchical attributions for a given text sequence.
- Projects word embeddings into hyperbolic spaces to encode semantic and syntactic relations. These spaces have properties useful for modeling hierarchies. 
- Estimates feature contribution scores efficiently in O(n^2) time by directly evaluating impact on model output rather than combinatorial search.
- Formulates the hierarchy construction as a clustering problem of building a minimum spanning tree over a similarity graph induced by projected embeddings and contribution scores. Provides an O(n^2logn) algorithm.

Main Contributions:
- Novel method to generate hierarchical text attributions using hyperbolic geometry to capture linguistic structure.
- Efficient algorithm for hierarchy construction in O(n^2logn) time by exploiting properties of hyperbolic spaces. 
- Evaluations on text classification datasets demonstrate improved efficiency over prior HA techniques while achieving better attribution quality.

In summary, the paper introduces a new approach PE that leverages geometric properties of hyperbolic spaces to efficiently construct hierarchical attributions that provide interpretable explanations of model predictions on text data.
