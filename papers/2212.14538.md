# [Transformer in Transformer as Backbone for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14538)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods focus on innovating the RL algorithms while using standard network architectures like CNNs and MLPs. Recently, methods have started using Transformers, but require combining them with other modules like CNNs and LSTMs. This makes training inconvenient due to needing expertise to train diverse modules jointly. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes using pure Transformer-based networks as backbones for deep RL to avoid having to combine modules. They introduce two Transformer in Transformer (TIT) backbones made of an Inner Transformer to process individual observations and an Outer Transformer to process observation sequences. 

Contributions:
1) First to show pure Transformers can serve as backbones for standard online and offline RL without changing other settings. This provides ready-to-use architectures.

2) Propose two TIT backbones - Vanilla_TIT simply cascades Inner and Outer Transformers while Enhanced_TIT fuses spatial-temporal information in each block and uses dense connections.

3) Empirically demonstrate TIT backbones achieve comparable or better performance than strong baselines in online RL, offline RL and supervised offline settings without needing complex optimization skills.

4) Analyze TIT via ablation studies and attention visualization to show the importance of component designs like the dense connections.

In summary, this paper demonstrates the viability of pure Transformer backbones for deep RL and provides two easy-to-use designs as off-the-shelf options to avoid combining multiple network modules.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes using a pure Transformer-based architecture with two cascaded Transformers, an inner one to process individual observations and an outer one to process observation sequences, as a general purpose backbone network for deep reinforcement learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Transformer in Transformer (TIT) backbones for deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, the paper shows that:

1) Pure Transformer-based networks can serve as off-the-shelf backbones for both online and offline RL methods (e.g. PPO and CQL), without needing complex optimization skills or combining other network modules like CNN and LSTM.

2) The proposed TIT backbones, which cascade two Transformers to process spatial and temporal information, can achieve good performance consistently across different RL settings. The TIT backbones are more stable than previous Transformer-based networks for RL.

3) The paper provides analysis and visualizations to show that TIT can capture spatial-temporal representations well for decision making. Ablation studies also demonstrate the importance of each component of TIT.

In summary, the main contribution is designing and empirically showing the effectiveness of pure Transformer-based TIT backbones for deep RL, which can serve as easy-to-use and high-performing network modules for various RL algorithms and environments.

3. What is the motivation behind using separate inner and outer Transformers in the TIT architecture? What role does each Transformer play in processing spatial and temporal information from observations? 

4. The Enhanced_TIT architecture uses a dense connection design. What is the purpose of this and why is it important for pure Transformer-based networks? How does this connect to previous work on dense connections for CNN and MLP networks?

5. The paper demonstrates strong performance of TIT backbones across a range of online and offline RL benchmarks. What factors do you think contribute most to the effectiveness and stability of TIT across tasks? 

6. An analysis in the paper suggests TIT may have more explainable attention maps than other methods. What evidence supports this and why might it result in better learned spatial representations?  

7. The paper hypothesizes that TIT may be particularly beneficial in more complex, partially observable environments. What properties of Transformers motivate this hypothesis and what steps could be taken to test it?

8. What opportunities exist to further improve on the TIT architecture, such as by enabling temporal-to-spatial information flow or using more advanced Transformer variants? What challenges need to be addressed?

9. The paper focuses on a minimalist implementation of TIT without extra tricks. What dedicated optimization techniques could be beneficial to explore for more complex TIT architectures in future work?
