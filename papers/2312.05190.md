# [Fine Dense Alignment of Image Bursts through Camera Pose and Depth   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05190)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel dense image alignment approach for burst photography that explicitly models the 3D structure of static scenes. In contrast to traditional techniques like optical flow or homographies that operate on image pairs, the proposed method optimizes camera poses and a dense depth map to minimize photometric reprojection errors across all frames. This global formulation better captures the underlying 3D geometry and handles parallax. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real bursts, even with tiny baselines, the method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in alignment accuracy compared to learning-based approaches. Additionally, it provides high-quality pose and depth estimation that surpasses specialized techniques. The versatility and computational efficiency make this a valuable tool for various burst processing tasks involving alignment, 3D reconstruction, or novel view synthesis. Key algorithmic contributions include a block coordinate descent optimization strategy, a method to infer depth at novel views, and the incorporation of differential geometric concepts to precisely optimize over camera poses.Overall, this work sets a new standard for robustly handling the small motion characteristic of burst imagery across a breadth of applications.
