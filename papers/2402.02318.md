# [Diversity Measurement and Subset Selection for Instruction Tuning   Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02318)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Selecting optimal subsets from large instruction tuning datasets to finetune language models is important for improving instruction following while being computationally efficient. 
- Prior subset selection methods rely on heuristics and do not directly measure dataset diversity. Lack tools to understand dataset curation strategies.

Proposed Solution:
- Use determinantal point processes (DPPs) to select diverse, high-quality subsets. DPPs balance quality scores that indicate example importance and a diversity-encouraging determinantal term.
- Propose log determinant distance to quantitatively measure dataset diversity using DPPs. Distance is based on difference in volumes spanned by dataset vs maximally diverse reference set.

Key Contributions:  
- Demonstrate log determinant distance correlates with post-finetuning instruction following performance when using weight gradients as the data representation.
- Log determinant distance provides understanding of (1) when data selection is most impactful, (2) how much data could be pruned without performance drop, (3) implications of dataset curation strategies.
- DPP-based selection outperforms baselines in improving performance, especially on less diverse datasets. Integrating output length as a quality score works best.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective DPP-based approach for selecting instruction tuning subsets. The proposed log determinant diversity measure enables analysis of the dataset curation process and prediction of the value of data selection.
