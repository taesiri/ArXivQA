# [TARGET: Template-Transferable Backdoor Attack Against Prompt-based NLP   Models via GPT4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17429)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel backdoor attack method called TARGET for prompt-based natural language processing models. The key idea is to leverage GPT4 to automatically generate malicious prompt templates with either a strong emotional tone or normal tone to serve as triggers. Specifically, the attacker first uses GPT4 to generate tone-strong templates which are injected during model pre-training to associate them with a target label. Then there are two types of attacks - direct attacks using the same pre-trained trigger templates, and transferable attacks using GPT4 to generate new unseen but similar tone templates. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and BERT models demonstrate TARGET's superior attack success rate and stealthiness over state-of-the-art baselines for direct attacks. Additionally, the transferable attacks via tone-similar templates also exhibit good efficacy. Overall, TARGET presents an effective template-based backdoor attack that is more flexible, stealthy and transferable compared to prior arts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a novel backdoor attack method called TARGET against prompt-based NLP models, which utilizes GPT4 to generate malicious templates with strong tone as triggers and achieves high attack performance and transferability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It presents a novel backdoor attack method called TARGET for prompt-based learning based on template tone via GPT4. This is the first work that focuses on the tone of templates for backdoor attacks.

2. It introduces attack templates that can control the output of the victim model by generating similar but different tone templates with GPT4. This makes the attack more transferable to unseen templates. 

3. Extensive experiments with three BERT models on five datasets demonstrate that TARGET achieves better success rate and stealthiness than baselines on direct attacks, and also exhibits satisfactory attack capability on transferable attacks with different templates.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the TARGET method which can launch effective backdoor attacks on prompt-based models by manipulating the tone of templates, with good transferability to new templates. The attack is shown to be powerful on multiple models and datasets.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Prompt-based learning: The paper focuses on backdoor attacks against prompt-based natural language processing (NLP) models. Prompt-based learning is a technique to adapt pretrained language models to downstream tasks.

- Backdoor attack: The paper proposes a novel backdoor attack method called TARGET against prompt-based models. Backdoor attacks inject triggers into models to cause targeted misclassifications. 

- Transferable attack: One key aspect of the TARGET attack is that it can generate tone-similar templates using GPT4 to carry out transferable attacks, where the attack transfers to unseen but similar templates.

- Template tone: The core idea in TARGET is to utilize GPT4 to generate trigger templates with strong tone and normal tone. The tone of templates is key to the attack.

- GPT4: The paper leverages the generative capabilities of the GPT4 language model to automatically create trigger templates and transferable templates for launching the attacks.

- Stealthiness: The paper evaluates the stealthiness of the attack in terms of perplexity and grammatical errors. Making the attack stealthy is an important consideration.

- Few-shot learning: The attack is evaluated in few-shot learning scenarios on downstream NLP tasks. Performance in low-data regimes is important.

In summary, the key terms revolve around backdoor attacks on prompt-based NLP models using tone-based trigger templates generated by GPT4, with a focus on transferability and stealthiness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using GPT4 to generate trigger templates with different tones. What is the intuition behind using tone as a way to generate effective trigger templates? How does tone allow for transferable attacks?

2. The TARGET attack has two phases - direct attack and transferable attack. Explain the difference between these two attack types and why transferable attacks make the victim model more vulnerable. 

3. What information does the authors provide as input to GPT4 in order to generate the trigger templates? Why is providing clear examples and constraints important for getting high-quality outputs from large language models like GPT4?

4. The paper conducts experiments using three different BERT models. Why was the BERT family chosen for evaluation? How do the results demonstrate the efficacy of TARGET across different model architectures?

5. TARGET is evaluated on both sentiment analysis and spam detection datasets. Why were these two domains chosen? Do the attack results show any differences in vulnerability across the domains? 

6. The paper argues that TARGET has better stealthiness compared to the BTOP baseline. What metrics are used to measure stealthiness? Why does changing the tone lead to higher stealthiness?

7. How does the number of shots impact the effectiveness of the TARGET attack? What does this result imply about potential defenses against such template-based backdoor attacks?

8. What strategies are used to improve the transferability of the attack to unseen trigger templates in the case of the Roberta model? Why was this adjustment needed?

9. The results show TARGET is effective even at a 10% poisoning rate. Why can such backdoor attacks succeed with a relatively small amount of poisoned data? 

10. The paper focuses exclusively on backdoor attacks against manual prompt templates. What are some potential avenues of future work to test TARGET's effectiveness against automated prompt tuning methods?
