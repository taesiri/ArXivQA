# [EMDB: The Electromagnetic Database of Global 3D Human Pose and Shape in   the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16894)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we obtain high-quality 3D human poses, shapes, and trajectories in unrestricted, mobile, in-the-wild settings? To address this question, the paper introduces a new dataset called EMDB (Electromagnetic Database of Global 3D Human Pose and Shape in the Wild) as well as a method called EMP (Electromagnetic Poser) to construct this dataset. The key ideas are:- EMDB provides accurate SMPL pose and shape parameters plus global camera and body trajectories for challenging in-the-wild videos. This is the first comprehensive dataset for mobile, unrestricted capture of 3D human motion.- To construct EMDB, the authors propose EMP, which fuses wireless body-worn electromagnetic sensors, monocular RGB-D data, and iPhone camera poses via a multi-stage optimization.- EMP aligns sensor-based human pose estimates to image observations to achieve accurate and smooth results. It leverages recent neural human modeling techniques for detailed geometry and appearance matching.- Evaluations show EMDB provides more accurate pose and shape annotations than previous in-the-wild datasets like 3DPW. The authors also benchmark state-of-the-art RGB pose estimators on EMDB.In summary, the paper introduces a novel dataset and method to capture high-quality 3D human motion in completely unrestricted settings, advancing research in areas like monocular human pose estimation. The central hypothesis is that fusing electromagnetic sensors, images, and camera poses can produce accurate mobile capture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The introduction of EMDB, a new dataset for 3D human pose and shape estimation in unrestricted, mobile scenarios. The dataset provides accurate SMPL parameters, global camera and body trajectories for in-the-wild videos.2. A multi-stage method called EMP (Electromagnetic Poser) to generate the annotations for EMDB. EMP fuses electromagnetic sensor measurements, RGB-D images, and camera poses to produce high-quality SMPL fits.3. Extensive quantitative evaluations showing EMP produces more accurate annotations than previous in-the-wild datasets like 3DPW. EMDB is shown to have 2.3 cm and 10.6 degree average errors.4. An analysis of state-of-the-art RGB-based pose estimation methods on EMDB, revealing opportunities for improvement on challenges like global trajectory estimation and reducing jitter.In summary, the main contribution appears to be the introduction of the new EMDB dataset to push research on 3D human pose estimation, especially in unrestricted outdoor settings. The multi-stage EMP method is developed to create high quality ground truth data for EMDB.
