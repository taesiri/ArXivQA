# [Viewport Prediction for Volumetric Video Streaming by Exploring Video   Saliency and Trajectory Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16462)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel viewport prediction method called STVP for point cloud video streaming. STVP utilizes both video saliency information and viewport trajectory to improve prediction accuracy. The authors first introduce a new sampling technique called Uniform Random Sampling (URS) to reduce computational complexity while preserving important spatial and temporal video features. They then present a saliency detection model that captures static, dynamic, geometric, and color salient regions in the video by incorporating spatial and temporal information. This is done using a Local Discrepancy Catcher (LDC) module to extract spatial saliency features and a Temporal Contrast (TC) layer to extract temporal saliency features. An LSTM model analyzes historical head trajectories to predict future trajectories. Finally, the saliency and trajectory information are intelligently fused using an attention mechanism to generate the final viewport prediction result. Extensive experiments on point cloud video datasets demonstrate over 90% viewport prediction accuracy and superior performance compared to existing methods. The key innovations are the new URS sampling, LDC and TC modules for enhanced saliency detection, and the multi-modal fusion of saliency and trajectory for accurate prediction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel viewport prediction method for point cloud video streaming that jointly utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory data to achieve highly accurate predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

1) The development of a novel and efficient sampling method (URS) to reduce computational load while preserving video features. 

2) The improvement of the saliency detection method by incorporating temporal and spatial information to capture dynamic, static geometric, and color salient regions.

3) The deep fusion of saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction.

In summary, the paper proposes a viewport prediction scheme for point cloud video that utilizes both video saliency and viewport trajectory information. A key component is the proposed saliency detection method that effectively captures spatial and temporal saliency cues in point cloud video data. This saliency information is then fused with predicted viewport trajectory to predict the user's viewport more precisely. The proposed sampling method URS also helps improve efficiency.
