# [Designing Redistribution Mechanisms for Reducing Transaction Fees in   Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13262)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum use transaction fee mechanisms (TFMs) where users bid to get their transactions included in blocks. Due to high demand and limited block space, transaction fees paid by users have become very high.

- As public blockchains are shared resources, it is desirable to reduce the transaction fees paid by users. However, completely removing fees is infeasible due to the need to prioritize higher value transactions. 

- The paper aims to design TFMs that minimize transaction fees for users while retaining good incentive properties like truthfulness (UIC), allocative efficiency (AE), and participation incentives (IR).

Solution - Transaction Fee Redistribution Mechanisms (TFRMs):

- Inspired by classic Redistribution Mechanisms (RMs) in mechanism design, the paper proposes TFRMs. Here, miners collect VCG-based payments but redistribute surplus back to users as rebates.

- Guaranteeing positive rebates is non-trivial due to strategic miners who can manipulate bids. A key metric is Resilient Redistribution Index (RRI) - the worst-case fraction of payments redistributed to real users.

- The paper first shows the impossibility of ensuring UIC, IR (for miner and users), positive RRI and AE together.

- It then proposes two TFRMs - Robust TFRM (R-TFRM) compromises only on miner IR to ensure positive RRI. Robust & Rational TFRM (R2-TFRM) uses trusted blockchain randomness to ensure positive rebates while also providing miner IR in expectation.  

Contributions:

- Formalizes TFRMs as a way to minimize transaction fees in blockchains using rebates while retaining incentivizes.

- Defines metrics like RRI to measure resilience to strategic manipulation.

- Provides impossibility results that motivate design compromises.

- Proposes two concrete TFRMs with robustness and incentive guarantees. Shows TFRMs are a promising approach for reducing user costs in public blockchains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Transaction Fee Redistribution Mechanisms (TFRMs) that redistribute the surplus collected from transaction fees back to users as rebates in order to minimize the fees paid, while preserving incentive properties like allocative efficiency and (restricted) user incentive compatibility even with strategic miners.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new class of transaction fee mechanisms called Transaction Fee Redistribution Mechanisms (TFRMs). The key idea in TFRMs is to redistribute a portion of the transaction fees collected back to the users in the form of rebates, while preserving desirable properties like allocative efficiency, user incentive compatibility, and individual rationality. 

The paper first shows that it is impossible to achieve non-trivial rebates in an "Ideal-TFRM" that only offers rebates to confirmed transactions. It then analyzes the effect of strategic miners in a general TFRM framework and proves it is impossible to achieve strictly positive rebates. To address these challenges, the paper proposes two novel TFRMs:

1) Robust TFRM (R-TFRM): Guarantees strictly positive rebates by relaxing miner individual rationality. It is shown to redistribute a k/n fraction of payments even under miner manipulation.

2) Robust and Rational TFRM (R2-TFRM): Achieves miner individual rationality in expectation by randomizing the rebates using trusted blockchain randomness. It provides an expected k/n rebate fraction.

The analysis shows TFRMs can effectively reduce transaction fees in blockchains while preserving incentive compatibility. The proposals of R-TFRM and R2-TFRM that are resilient to strategic miners are the main technical contributions.

The paper introduces the idea of TFMs, which govern the transactions fees users pay to have their transactions included in blocks in a blockchain. The goal is to design TFMs that minimize the fees paid by users while retaining good incentive properties. To achieve this, the paper proposes TFRMs, which are TFMs combined with redistribution mechanisms that return some of the collected fees back to users as rebates. Challenges due to strategic miners are analyzed, leading to proposed mechanisms like R-TFRM and R^2-TFRM that are robust to miner manipulation while still providing users fee rebates.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the transaction fee redistribution mechanism (TFRM) proposed in the paper:

1. The paper shows that it is impossible to achieve user incentive compatibility (UIC) while offering non-zero rebates only to confirmed transactions in the Ideal-TFRM model. Can you discuss modifications to the constraints or objective that could make this feasible?

2. Restricted UIC (RUIC) is introduced to ensure truthful bidding is a dominant strategy only for transactions included in the block. What are some ways the mechanism could be adapted to provide incentives for truthful bidding by non-included transactions as well? 

3. The paper analyzes the effect of strategic miners through the Resilient Redistribution Index (RRI). Can you discuss how alternate quantification metrics could capture the impact of manipulation more effectively?

4. Robust TFRM relaxes the miner's individual rationality constraint to ensure positive RRI. How does this impact the sustainability of mining operations and what are potential ways to mitigate this?

5. The randomization parameter α in Robust and Rational TFRM balances the tradeoff between RRI and miner rationality. What adaptive methods could be used to dynamically set α based on current blockchain conditions?  

6. Can you critically analyze the assumptions of myopic miners and users made in the paper? What are some ways the mechanisms would need to be adapted under relaxed assumptions?

7. The paper focuses on a setting with homogeneous transaction sizes. How could the proposed TFRMs be extended for heterogeneous transaction sizes?

8. What empirical analysis could be done with real-world transaction data to validate the feasibility and quantify the benefits of deploying TFRMs in existing blockchains?

9. The paper suggests combining TFRMs with fee-burning methods like in EIP-1559. What are some open challenges in the combined design and analysis of such mechanisms?

10. Can TFRMs be combined with alternative mining reward schemes (e.g. through staking) to offer better sustainability guarantees for the overall mining ecosystem?
