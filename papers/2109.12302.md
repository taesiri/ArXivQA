# Learning Neural Templates for Recommender Dialogue System

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to build an effective conversational recommender system that can naturally incorporate recommendation items into generated responses and generalize to recommend novel items not seen during training. Specifically, the paper proposes a new framework called NTRD to tackle two key challenges:1) Precisely and appropriately incorporating recommended items into generated replies. Existing end-to-end models struggle with this.2) Generalizing to recommend novel items not present in the training data. Current models can only recommend items seen during training.To address these challenges, NTRD decouples dialogue generation from item recommendation via a two-stage process:1) A response template generator uses a seq2seq model to produce a response template containing slots for items. 2) An item selector then fills these slots by selecting appropriate items from a candidate set provided by the recommender module. This approach combines the strengths of slot filling and neural NLG to allow controllable and natural item recommendation. The model is trained end-to-end.The decoupled architecture also enables zero-shot recommendation of new items by plugging in an updated recommender module, without retraining the dialogue generator.In summary, the key hypothesis is that decoupling response generation from item selection will lead to more precise and flexible item recommendation and generalization. The NTRD framework is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel framework called NTRD (Neural Templates for Recommender Dialogue) for building recommender dialogue systems. NTRD decouples the response generation from item recommendation through a two-stage approach.2. It generates response templates with slots explicitly tied to target items using an encoder-decoder model. The slots are then filled by an item selector module using multi-head self-attention to fuse information from dialogue context, generated template, and candidate items.3. It combines the strengths of classical slot filling approaches and modern neural NLG models to allow controllable and natural response generation along with flexible item recommendation. 4. Experiments on the ReDial dataset show NTRD significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both automatic metrics and human evaluation.5. NTRD exhibits the ability to recommend novel items not seen during training, showing promising generalization capability.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new decomposed framework NTRD that generates slotted response templates and fills them with suitable items using self-attention. This allows controllable, accurate and flexible recommendation while improving fluency and diversity. The model also shows zero-shot recommendation ability.
