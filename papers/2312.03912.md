# [Collaboration or Corporate Capture? Quantifying NLP's Reliance on   Industry Artifacts and Contributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03912)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper analyzes the increasing reliance of natural language processing (NLP) research on artifacts and contributions from industry. It surveys 100 papers from EMNLP 2022 to quantify this reliance. 

The key findings are:

- 44% of surveyed papers have at least one industry-affiliated author, up from 22% the previous year, showing rapid growth of industry presence. 

- 72% of papers claim state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on benchmarks, indicating benchmarks are critical for publishing. This favors big companies with more computing power.

- Across citation types (datasets, models, prior SOTA scores), over 50% are now from industry, even though only 13.3% of ACL papers in 2022 were industry-affiliated. This indicates a strong reliance on industry.

- Industry improved SOTA scores by over 3 times more than academia on average. Industry seems more capable of achieving bigger benchmark improvements.  

- Authors tend to cite their own institution type more, showing affiliation-based predispositions. But all groups rely heavily on industry pre-trained models.

The paper discusses whether this reflects a healthy collaboration with industry driving progress, or an unhealthy corporate capture limiting research independence. It provides suggestions to improve transparency around funding sources and computing capabilities.

In conclusion, benchmark reliance and industry advances risk limiting academia's publishing viability and research directions. More transparency and equitable compute access may preserve diversity and strengthen AI research overall.
