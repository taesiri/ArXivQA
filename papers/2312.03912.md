# [Collaboration or Corporate Capture? Quantifying NLP's Reliance on   Industry Artifacts and Contributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03912)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper analyzes the increasing reliance of natural language processing (NLP) research on artifacts and contributions from industry. It surveys 100 papers from EMNLP 2022 to quantify this reliance. 

The key findings are:

- 44% of surveyed papers have at least one industry-affiliated author, up from 22% the previous year, showing rapid growth of industry presence. 

- 72% of papers claim state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on benchmarks, indicating benchmarks are critical for publishing. This favors big companies with more computing power.

- Across citation types (datasets, models, prior SOTA scores), over 50% are now from industry, even though only 13.3% of ACL papers in 2022 were industry-affiliated. This indicates a strong reliance on industry.

- Industry improved SOTA scores by over 3 times more than academia on average. Industry seems more capable of achieving bigger benchmark improvements.  

- Authors tend to cite their own institution type more, showing affiliation-based predispositions. But all groups rely heavily on industry pre-trained models.

The paper discusses whether this reflects a healthy collaboration with industry driving progress, or an unhealthy corporate capture limiting research independence. It provides suggestions to improve transparency around funding sources and computing capabilities.

In conclusion, benchmark reliance and industry advances risk limiting academia's publishing viability and research directions. More transparency and equitable compute access may preserve diversity and strengthen AI research overall.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper surveys 100 papers from EMNLP 2022 to quantify the NLP research community's reliance on industry artifacts and contributions, finding the proportion of industry-affiliated citations to be over 3 times higher than expected.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

Quantifying the degree of reliance on industry artifacts and contributions in recent NLP research by surveying 100 papers from EMNLP 2022. The authors find that across various types of citations (pre-trained models, datasets, prior best results, etc.), the percentage that are industry-affiliated is over 3 times higher than the overall industry publication rate. This indicates a substantial reliance on industry to conduct competitive NLP research. The authors also analyze differences between industry and academia, such as higher relative score improvements by industry for state-of-the-art claims. They conclude by discussing perspectives on whether this reliance should be viewed as collaboration or corporate capture of NLP research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Industry presence/reliance/affiliation in NLP research
- Corporate capture of academic research 
- Benchmark performance and reliance on benchmarks for publication
- State-of-the-art (SOTA) models and claims
- Compute power and the compute divide
- Reproducibility and transparency in research
- Funding sources and conflicts of interest
- Collaboration between industry and academia

The paper analyzes the degree of reliance on industry artifacts, models, and contributions in NLP research by surveying papers from EMNLP 2022. It discusses concerns around potential corporate capture of academic research and limitations of benchmark evaluation. Other key topics include differences in compute power, reproducibility practices, and quantitative analysis of improvements in SOTA claims between industry and academia.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. What motivated the authors to conduct this survey of industry presence and reliance in EMNLP 2022 papers? What gap in the literature or concerning trend did they aim to quantify?

2. The paper categorizes papers by "type" in Table 2. What additional paper categorization schemes could reveal further insights? For example, categorizing by task type or area of NLP. 

3. The authors apply several data processing and analysis techniques such as affiliation grouping, Gaussian smoothing, and relative score increase. What are the limitations or potential drawbacks of each? Could alternative techniques better address the research questions?

4. Figure 1 shows industry affiliation of citations over time. What other visualization or statistical analysis techniques could further unpack this time series data? For example, breaking down by paper section or predicting future values. 

5. In analyzing improvements in state-of-the-art claims between academia and industry, why might absolute score increase be a better metric than relative score increase? What other metrics could supplement these? 

6. Table 3 shows differences between academia and industry in elements like statistical significance testing. What possible explanations are there for industries lower rate? How could this be further analyzed?

7. The authors provide several suggestions regarding funding source transparency and compute equity. What are some potential challenges or counter-arguments to these suggestions? How feasible would they be to implement? 

8. What types of future studies could build upon or enhance this work? For example, analyzing multiple years of EMNLP or expanding the sample size using automation.

9. How reliable are the conclusions given the study's limitations? If the sample size was expanded, what results might change or be further clarified? What limitations are most pressing to address?

10. How could the framework, questions, and findings addressed in this paper be extended to other AI conferences beyond NLP? What differences might emerge at venues focused on computer vision or robotics for example?
