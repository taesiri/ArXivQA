# [A Foundational Multimodal Vision Language AI Assistant for Human   Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07814)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents PathChat, an interactive multimodal AI assistant for pathology powered by a custom finetuned large language model. PathChat utilizes a state-of-the-art self-supervised pathology image encoder called UNI as its vision backbone, which is pretrained on over 100 million histology images. This vision encoder is combined with a 13 billion parameter language model and further pretrained and finetuned on a large dataset of over 250,000 pathology-specific visual-language instructions curated by the authors. When evaluated on diverse pathology use cases involving multiple choice diagnostic questions, open-ended visual question answering, and multi-turn conversations, PathChat demonstrates superior performance compared to publicly available multimodal AI models as well as the commercial solution powering ChatGPT. Specifically, PathChat achieved 87% accuracy on multiple choice diagnosis when clinical context is provided, 86% accuracy on answering open-ended pathology questions, and produces responses preferred by pathologists. The authors demonstrate PathChat's ability to describe morphological features in images, suggest diagnoses, recommend additional tests, and discuss prognosis and treatment options. Overall, PathChat represents a promising step towards an AI assistant that can combine visual understanding of histology images with language understanding to serve pathology education, research, and assist human experts.
