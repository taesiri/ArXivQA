# [Debatrix: Multi-dimensinal Debate Judge with Iterative Chronological   Analysis Based on LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08010)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Judging debates involves understanding lengthy texts, intricate argument relationships, and requiring multi-dimensional assessment. 
- Current research focuses on short dialogues, not on evaluating entire debates.
- Challenges for LLMs to judge debates include: handling long multi-turn debates, needing to deeply analyze argument organization and refutation, and requiring systematic evaluation across multiple quality dimensions.

Proposed Solution:
- Debatrix - a framework to assist LLMs in debate evaluation using iterative chronological analysis and multi-dimensional collaboration
- Iterative Chronological Analysis: Analyze debate speech-by-speech, maintaining context and analysis memory. Provide analysis of previous speeches when judging new ones. Summarize all analyses to make final judgment. Allows concentrating on one speech at a time.
- Multi-Dimensional Collaboration: Allow LLMs to focus on specific judging dimensions (e.g. argument, language) during analysis. Combine individual dimensional analyses into one systematic summary judgment.  

Contributions:
- Debatrix framework for fine-grained debate analysis and judgment using iterative and multi-dimensional approach
- Introduction of PanelBench benchmark for evaluating debate judging systems, covering multi-dimensional voting and multi-debater competitions
- Experiments showing Debatrix significantly improves LLM debate judgment over baseline approaches, handles long debates, and provides more accurate systematic assessment

Key limitations:
- Further refinement of iterative analysis
- Addressing position bias issue in LLMs for certain debate formats


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Debatrix, a framework that uses large language models to judge debates by iteratively analyzing speeches chronologically and evaluating them across multiple dimensions to produce verdicts better aligned with majority preferences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, I would summarize the main contributions as:

1. Proposing Debatrix, a fine-grained debate judging framework based on large language models (LLMs). Debatrix decomposes the debate judging task into iterative chronological analysis to handle long, multi-turn debates and elaborates multiple dimensions to generate systematic judgments.

2. Introducing PanelBench, a novel benchmark for automatic debate judging, covering multi-dimensional and multi-debater scenarios. PanelBench includes two debate collections - DebateArt and BP-Competition.

3. Investigating how well LLMs can judge debates directly or when equipped with the Debatrix framework, enabling either chronological or dimensional analysis or both. Experiments show Debatrix significantly improves ChatGPT at judging long debates and even outperforms GPT-4.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing the Debatrix framework, introducing the PanelBench benchmark, and demonstrating how Debatrix can improve LLM-based debate judging over strong baselines.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Debatrix - The name of the proposed multi-dimensional debate judge framework based on large language models (LLMs).

- Iterative chronological analysis - Debatrix analyzes debates speech-by-speech in chronological order, maintaining context and analysis streams to help LLMs focus better. 

- Multi-dimensional evaluation - Debatrix allows splitting debate judging into dimensions like argument strength, evidence reliability, etc. and combines judgments.

- PanelBench - The novel benchmark introduced to evaluate debate judging systems, covering different debate formats and multidimensional judgments.  

- Large language models (LLMs) - The paper utilizes LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 as core judges and aims to assist them in debate evaluation.

- British Parliamentary (BP) format - One of the competitive debate formats included in PanelBench, involving 4 teams with 2 on each side.

- Argumentation persuasion - Assessing the persuasiveness of arguments is key for debate judging. The paper examines model performance on this dimension.

- Position bias - Analysis shows GPT-4 exhibits position bias, preferring later speakers, preventing good BP debate judging performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a framework called Debatrix for judging debates using large language models (LLMs). Can you explain in more detail how the iterative chronological analysis module works? How does it help the LLM better understand long, multi-turn debates?

2. The paper mentions utilizing memories in Debatrix to provide long-term storage during the debate analysis process. What types of information are stored in the context memory versus the analysis memory? And how do the judge components leverage these memories?

3. Dimensional collaboration is introduced in Debatrix to allow focusing on specific judging dimensions during analysis. Can you elaborate on how analyses from different dimensions are combined at the end to produce a systematic judgment? What are the advantages of this approach?

4. The paper evaluates Debatrix on two debate collections - DebateArt and BP-Competition. Can you summarize the key differences between these collections and why they are complementary in benchmarking automatic debate judging systems?

5. Iterative chronological analysis is shown to be crucial for ChatGPT to handle long debates due to its limited context window. Can you analyze the results in Figure 5 and explain why Debatrix maintains relatively consistent performance regardless of debate length?

6. The paper discovers a position bias issue with GPT-4 on the BP-Competition dataset. What causes this bias and why does GPT-4 tend to prefer debaters speaking later in the debate? Do you have any suggestions to mitigate this bias?

7. One baseline model called NonIterative uses raw speech content instead of previous analysis when analyzing subsequent speeches. Why does the full Debatrix framework outperform NonIterative, as shown in Table 2?

8. For the DebateArt collection, both score comparison and direct prediction are used to generate winner predictions. Can you compare and contrast these two approaches? When would you use one versus the other?

9. The argument dimension is considered the most important for determining persuasiveness. Why does upgrading to GPT-4 not improve performance on this dimension much compared to the chronological analysis in Debatrix?

10. The paper claims dimensional collaboration leads to more precise systematic judgments by improving analysis quality on each dimension. Can you suggest additional experiments or analyses to demonstrate whether this claim holds?
