# [AUFormer: Vision Transformers are Parameter-Efficient Facial Action Unit   Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04697)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Facial Action Unit (AU) detection is an important task in affective computing, but suffers from overfitting due to large number of parameters in models and limited AU-annotated data. 
- Existing methods rely on additional relevant data to mitigate overfitting, which is still insufficient.
- Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) methods have not been explored for AU detection.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose AUFormer, first work to investigate PETL for AU detection.
- Develop a Mixture-of-Knowledge Expert (MoKE) collaboration mechanism to efficiently adapt pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) for AU detection.
- Introduce minimal learnable parameters into ViT via MoKEs specialized for each AU.
- MoKE integrates Multi-Receptive Field (MRF) and Context-Aware (CA) operators to capture multi-scale and correlation knowledge crucial for AU detection.
- MoKEs collaborate within group, aggregate information, and inject it back into frozen ViT to adapt it.
- Design Margin-truncated Difficulty-aware Weighted Asymmetric Loss (MDWA-Loss) focusing more on activated AUs, differentiating difficulty of unactivated AUs, and discarding mislabeled samples.

Main Contributions:
- First to explore PETL paradigm for AU detection and propose AUFormer with MoKE collaboration mechanism.
- Design tailored MoKEs integrating MRF and CA operators to extract multi-scale and correlation knowledge. 
- Propose MDWA-Loss considering properties of AU datasets and difficulty differences among AUs.
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on BP4D and DISFA from within-domain, cross-domain and data efficiency perspectives without using any additional data.
- Demonstrate effectiveness on micro-expression dataset, a novel evaluation for AU detection methods.

In summary, the paper innovatively investigates PETL for AU detection via a specialized MoKE collaboration mechanism and loss function design, achieving superior performance and robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes AUFormer, a novel Vision Transformer-based facial action unit detection method that achieves state-of-the-art performance through an efficient Mixture-of-Knowledge Expert collaboration mechanism and a tailored Margin-truncated Difficulty-aware Weighted Asymmetric Loss.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. The authors propose AUFormer, which investigates the parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) paradigm for facial action unit (AU) detection for the first time. AUFormer develops a novel Mixture-of-Knowledge Expert (MoKE) collaboration mechanism to efficiently leverage a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model.

2. The authors design tailored MoKEs which integrate Multi-Receptive Field (MRF) and Context-Aware (CA) operators to capture multi-scale and correlation knowledge that are essential for AU detection. 

3. The authors introduce a novel Margin-truncated Difficulty-aware Weighted Asymmetric Loss (MDWA-Loss) which focuses more on activated AUs, differentiates the difficulty of unactivated AUs, and discards potentially mislabeled samples.

4. Extensive experiments demonstrate AUFormer's state-of-the-art performance on macro-expression AU datasets (BP4D and DISFA) from multiple perspectives. AUFormer also shows effectiveness on the micro-expression dataset CASME2, which is a novel evaluation.

5. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component of AUFormer, including the PETL paradigm, collaboration mechanism, MoKE structure, and MDWA-Loss. Visualizations further prove that MoKEs capture personalized features for corresponding AUs.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of AUFormer and its specialized designs for facial AU detection, which achieves superior performance in a parameter-efficient manner without relying on extra relevant data.
