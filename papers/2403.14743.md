# [VURF: A General-purpose Reasoning and Self-refinement Framework for   Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14743)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Specialized video models offer isolated visual comprehension capabilities and struggle to provide adaptable and scalable video understanding for complex reasoning tasks.
- Individual off-the-shelf models require distinct frameworks and model configurations for each video task.
- Needed a uniform reasoning framework with plug-and-play architecture to leverage pre-trained CV models to execute diverse video tasks.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce Video Understanding and Reasoning Framework (VURF) that utilizes reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) to decompose complex video queries into executable programs with sub-tasks solvable by specialized models.
- Sub-tasks executed sequentially, enabling integration of new models and mitigation of LLM hallucinations.  
- Employs feedback-generation to correct errors in programs using unsupported functions.
- Implements self-refinement procedure to iteratively improve quality of in-context examples.

Main Contributions:
- First generic visual reasoning framework for video understanding that consolidates specialized video models to answer complex video-related queries.
- Utilizes in-context learning to align LLM behavior for decomposing tasks into visual programs executed by specialized models.
- Introduces self-refinement strategy to boost performance by iteratively refining programs generated by LLM.
- Evaluated on video question answering, anticipation, pose estimation and multi-video QA. Results illustrate efficacy of framework enhancements in improving video programming approaches.

In summary, VURF is a novel video reasoning framework that leverages capabilities of LLMs and specialized models. The self-refinement strategy and plug-and-play architecture enable adaptable and accurate video understanding for complex queries.
