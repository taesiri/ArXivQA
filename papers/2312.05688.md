# [NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 09/23: What are the most influential current   AI Papers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05688)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Keeping up with the rapid progress in AI, especially in subfields like NLP, ML and CV, is challenging. 
- Providing insights and analysis to help navigate these dynamic areas is important for researchers, professionals and the wider public.

Proposed Solution:
- Analyze influential preprint papers posted on arXiv in AI categories from Jan-Sept 2023.
- Identify top-40 papers by normalized citation count (z-score) and compare to previous top-40 list from Jan-June 2023.  
- Examine trends in topics, keywords, geographic distribution of institutions.

Main Contributions:
- Continued dominance of NLP papers focused on large language models (LLMs), especially multimodal LLMs.
- Notable emphasis on evaluating LLMs and applications utilizing LLMs.  
- US institutions, mainly companies, drive most influential research, though academic research is more geographically diverse.  
- Europe lags in top publications, especially industry, compared to dominance of US and rise of China.
- Broader LLM research beyond singular models like ChatGPT, though LLamas and GPT-4 lead influential papers.

In summary, the paper analyzes recent influential AI papers to uncover shifts in research trends. Key findings show a focus on assessing and applying large language models, increased multimodality, and geographic disparities, with waning emphasis solely on ChatGPT.
