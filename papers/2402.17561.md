# [PHNet: Patch-based Normalization for Portrait Harmonization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17561)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Image harmonization aims to make a composite image look authentic by adjusting the foreground object to match the background. This is an ill-posed problem due to ambiguity in human perception.
- Most methods focus on general image harmonization, overlooking portrait harmonization specifically, which is an important practical application. 
- Existing datasets like iHarmony4 lack portrait images or have a small number of samples. There is a need for a large-scale portrait harmonization dataset.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Patch-based Harmonization Network (PHNet) with two main components:
  1) Patch-based Normalization (PN) block: Normalizes image patches based on color statistics of foreground and background. Applies normalization globally and locally.
  2) Patch-based Feature Extraction (PFE): Extracts features using similar statistics as PN. Used to reweight encoder output channels.
- Also introduces FFHQH, a new large-scale synthetic portrait dataset with 70K images based on FFHQ.

Main Contributions:
- Achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results on iHarmony4 and qualitative performance on portraits. Generalizes better to portraits.
- Introduces PN block and PFE module that effectively improve harmonization capability.
- Provides the first large-scale portrait harmonization dataset FFHQH to address data limitations.
- Open-sources code, models and portrait dataset to facilitate research.

In summary, the paper focuses on portrait harmonization, which is overlooked by prior arts. A network is designed using patch-based normalization and feature extraction specifically for portraits. The introduction of a new portrait dataset also addresses data limitations in this domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art harmonization ability.
