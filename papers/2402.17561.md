# [PHNet: Patch-based Normalization for Portrait Harmonization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17561)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Image harmonization aims to make a composite image look authentic by adjusting the foreground object to match the background. This is an ill-posed problem due to ambiguity in human perception.
- Most methods focus on general image harmonization, overlooking portrait harmonization specifically, which is an important practical application. 
- Existing datasets like iHarmony4 lack portrait images or have a small number of samples. There is a need for a large-scale portrait harmonization dataset.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Patch-based Harmonization Network (PHNet) with two main components:
  1) Patch-based Normalization (PN) block: Normalizes image patches based on color statistics of foreground and background. Applies normalization globally and locally.
  2) Patch-based Feature Extraction (PFE): Extracts features using similar statistics as PN. Used to reweight encoder output channels.
- Also introduces FFHQH, a new large-scale synthetic portrait dataset with 70K images based on FFHQ.

Main Contributions:
- Achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results on iHarmony4 and qualitative performance on portraits. Generalizes better to portraits.
- Introduces PN block and PFE module that effectively improve harmonization capability.
- Provides the first large-scale portrait harmonization dataset FFHQH to address data limitations.
- Open-sources code, models and portrait dataset to facilitate research.

In summary, the paper focuses on portrait harmonization, which is overlooked by prior arts. A network is designed using patch-based normalization and feature extraction specifically for portraits. The introduction of a new portrait dataset also addresses data limitations in this domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art harmonization ability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a patch-based harmonization network (PHNet) with novel patch-based normalization blocks and a feature extractor to achieve state-of-the-art performance in portrait image harmonization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) The paper proposes a novel image harmonization method called Patch-based Harmonization Network (PHNet) which introduces a patch-based normalization (PN) block and a feature extractor module to achieve better visual coherence between foreground and background elements.

2) The paper creates a new human portrait harmonization dataset called Flickr-Faces-HQ-Harmonization (FFHQH) which is specifically designed for training and evaluating portrait harmonization models. This helps address the lack of portrait-focused harmonization datasets.

3) The paper conducts comprehensive experiments on public datasets like iHarmony4 as well as the proposed FFHQH dataset. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of PHNet for portrait harmonization. This shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel harmonization method tailored for portraits along with a new portrait dataset, backed by extensive experiments showing superior results. The portrait-specific focus and dataset are the main highlights.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Image harmonization - The main problem the paper aims to solve, making a composite image look more realistic and coherent. 

- Patch-based normalization (PN) - The novel normalization block proposed in the paper that utilizes both global and local color statistics to harmonize images.

- Portrait harmonization - A key application area and subtask of image harmonization that the paper focuses on, harmonizing human portraits. 

- Patch-based feature extraction (PFE) - The module proposed in the paper to extract high-level features from the background to aid harmonization. 

- Flickr-Faces-HQ-Harmonization (FFHQH) - The new large-scale synthetic portrait harmonization dataset created by the authors.

- Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) - A quantitative metric used to evaluate harmonization performance.

- Mean Squared Error (MSE) - Another quantitative metric used to measure harmonization results.

- Foreground normalization - A technique used to ensure fair comparison between images with foreground objects of vastly different sizes.

So in summary, the key terms cover the proposed methods (PN, PFE), task area (portrait harmonization), new dataset (FFHQH), and quantitative evaluation metrics (PSNR, MSE).
