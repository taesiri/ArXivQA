# [DVAE#: Discrete Variational Autoencoders with Relaxed Boltzmann Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07445)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be that relaxations of Boltzmann machine priors can improve the performance of discrete variational autoencoders (DVAEs). Specifically, the authors propose two approaches for relaxing Boltzmann machines to continuous distributions that allow training DVAEs with tighter importance-weighted bounds. The key questions/hypotheses seem to be:

- Can continuous relaxations of Boltzmann machine priors enable training discrete VAEs with tighter importance-weighted bounds compared to previous methods like DVAE and DVAE++? 

- Will the proposed relaxations based on overlapping transformations and the Gaussian integral trick outperform previous DVAE methods with Boltzmann priors?

- Can they develop more general overlapping transformations beyond previous work to provide better approximations of discrete variables? 

- Will their proposed power-function overlapping transformation provide lower variance gradients and improved performance compared to things like exponential transformations?

So in summary, the central hypothesis is around developing better continuous relaxations of Boltzmann machine priors to improve training of discrete VAEs, especially with tighter variational bounds. The key questions focus on whether their proposed relaxations can outperform previous DVAE methods and whether properties like lower variance gradients from the power-function transformation translate to better performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing two continuous relaxations of Boltzmann machines that allow them to be used as priors in variational autoencoders (VAEs) and trained with tighter importance-weighted bounds. The two relaxations are based on overlapping transformations and the Gaussian integral trick.

2. Generalizing overlapping transformations to any pair of distributions with computable PDF and CDF. This allows for new smoothing transformations like mixtures of Gaussians and power functions. 

3. Applying these relaxations and new transformations to train discrete VAEs with Boltzmann machine priors using importance weighting. The proposed models, called DVAE#, outperform previous discrete VAEs with Boltzmann priors like DVAE and DVAE++ on MNIST and OMNIGLOT datasets.

4. Demonstrating that power-function overlapping transformations provide lower variance gradient estimates and improved test log-likelihoods compared to exponential transformations, especially when the inverse temperature is large.

In summary, the main contribution is developing continuous relaxations of Boltzmann machines to enable training discrete VAEs with tighter bounds, proposing more general overlapping transformations, and showing improved performance of the resulting DVAE# models compared to prior discrete VAEs. The key innovations are the relaxations and new transformations that enable tighter training.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper: 

The paper proposes two methods for relaxing discrete Boltzmann machine distributions to continuous distributions that can be used as priors in variational autoencoders, allowing tighter variational bounds and improved performance compared to previous discrete VAE methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related work on training discrete variational autoencoders (VAEs):

- The paper focuses specifically on using Boltzmann machines as priors in discrete VAEs. Boltzmann machines have been used before as priors in DVAEs like in the Discrete VAE (Rolfe 2016) and DVAE++ (Vahdat et al. 2018), but this paper introduces new methods for relaxing the discrete Boltzmann distribution to be continuous to allow for tighter training bounds.

- Previous DVAE methods have used the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for training. A key contribution of this paper is utilizing the tighter importance weighted (IW) bound to train discrete VAEs with Boltzmann priors, which hasn't been done before.

- The relaxations proposed in the paper are based on overlapping transformations and the Gaussian integral trick. Overlapping transformations were introduced in DVAE++, but this paper generalizes them to any distribution with computable PDF/CDF. The Gaussian integral trick is a novel relaxation not used in prior DVAE work.

- The paper proposes using power-function based overlapping transformations, which provide lower variance gradients and improved results compared to the exponential transformations used in DVAE/DVAE++. This is a novel smoothing technique for discrete VAEs.

- Experiments demonstrate improved results over DVAE/DVAE++ baselines, showing the benefit of the IW bound and proposed relaxations. The code is also provided for reproducibility.

Overall, the paper can be seen as advancing discrete VAE research by enabling the use of tighter bounds during training as well as introducing new types of relaxations tailored for Boltzmann machine priors. The techniques help improve performance over related DVAE methods that have used looser ELBO bounds and more limited smoothing approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Exploring other types of continuous relaxations of Boltzmann machines besides the overlapping transformations and Gaussian integral trick proposed in this work. The authors mention this could lead to priors that allow even tighter variational bounds.

- Applying the proposed relaxations and inference techniques to more complex discrete graphical models beyond restricted Boltzmann machines. The authors state their methods could extend to more general Boltzmann machines.

- Evaluating the performance on more complex datasets beyond MNIST and OMNIGLOT. The authors note their model's ability to scale to problems with more discrete variables.

- Developing specialized approximate posteriors that can better capture the correlations present in the priors based on the Gaussian integral trick. The authors mention using shifted Gaussian transformations but other parameterizations could be explored. 

- Further analysis and development of smoothing transformations that balance approximation accuracy and gradient variance. The power-function transformation seems promising in this regard.

- Exploring annealing schedules or other methods to automatically adapt the inverse temperature parameters during training.

- Applying the relaxed inference scheme to discrete latent variable models beyond VAEs, such as adversarial networks.

- Leveraging the relaxed Boltzmann distributions for tasks requiring discrete representations like clustering, partitioning, and relational inference.

So in summary, the authors highlight several interesting directions for both improving the relaxations and inference techniques proposed in this work, as well as applying them to other models and applications involving discrete variables.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes two methods for relaxing discrete Boltzmann machine distributions into continuous distributions that can be used as priors in variational autoencoders (VAEs). The first method uses overlapping transformations, generalizing previous work on exponential and uniform smoothing distributions.

These relaxations allow training discrete VAEs with tighter importance weighted bounds. 

The paper introduces more flexible overlapping transformations based on the power function distribution that provide lower variance gradients. Experiments compare discrete VAEs trained with relaxed Boltzmann machine priors against baselines like the original discrete VAE on MNIST and OMNIGLOT.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes two approaches for relaxing discrete Boltzmann machine priors to continuous distributions in order to train discrete variational autoencoders (DVAEs) using tighter importance-weighted bounds. The first approach uses overlapping transformations, generalizing prior work on mixtures of exponential distributions to enable other smoothing distributions like mixtures of power-functions. The second approach uses the Gaussian integral trick to remove pairwise interactions and obtain a mixture of Gaussians relaxation. Both relaxations involve an inverse temperature parameter to control the sharpness of the approximation. The continuous relaxations allow DVAEs with Boltzmann priors to be trained with the importance-weighted bound using the reparameterization trick. Experiments show that DVAEs with power-function relaxations achieve the best results, outperforming prior DVAEs that used looser evidence lower bounds for training.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing two new methods for relaxing discrete Boltzmann machine priors to be continuous distributions. This allows training discrete variational autoencoders (DVAEs) with Boltzmann priors using the tighter importance weighted bound, which was not possible with previous DVAEs like DVAE and DVAE++. 

The two relaxations proposed are:

1) Overlapping transformations, which generalizes the overlapping exponential transformations used in DVAE++.

2) The Gaussian integral trick, which removes the pairwise interactions in the Boltzmann machine energy function by integrating over auxiliary Gaussian variables.

The motivation is that discrete latent variable models like DVAEs have advantages in interpretability and computational efficiency compared to continuous latent variables, but have been more difficult to train. By enabling tighter variational bounds through these continuous relaxations of the Boltzmann prior, the aim is to improve DVAE training and performance on tasks like generative modeling of images.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Discrete variational autoencoders (DVAEs): The paper focuses on training variational autoencoders with discrete latent variables rather than continuous ones. DVAEs aim to capture the benefits of discrete representations while still allowing gradient-based training.

- Boltzmann machines: Boltzmann machines are a type of stochastic neural network that can represent complex joint distributions over binary variables. The paper uses Boltzmann machines as priors over the discrete latent variables.

- Importance-weighted bounding: The paper trains DVAEs using the tighter importance-weighted (IW) bound rather than the standard evidence lower bound (ELBO). This allows optimizing a better lower bound on the log-likelihood.

- Continuous relaxations: Two techniques are introduced to relax discrete Boltzmann priors to continuous distributions - overlapping transformations and the Gaussian integral trick. This enables applying the IW bound.

- Overlapping transformations: These transform each binary variable to a continuous one while preserving the ability to recover the original binary values. Different smoothing functions like exponential or power-function are used.

- Mean-field approximation: Mean-field is used to approximate the intractable marginalization over discrete variables required when using overlapping transformations.

- Power-function smoothing: A novel overlapping transformation using power-function distributions is introduced. This provides lower variance gradients and improved performance compared to previous DVAEs.

So in summary, the key ideas involve relaxing discrete distributions to enable gradient-based training of DVAEs, using tighter bounds like the IW bound, and introducing better continuous relaxations like power-function smoothing.

This paper introduces two continuous relaxations of Boltzmann machines that enable training discrete variational autoencoders (DVAEs) with tighter variational bounds. The relaxations are based on overlapping transformations and the Gaussian integral trick. Overlapping transformations convert the binary variables in a Boltzmann machine to continuous variables via smoothing distributions like exponentials or power functions.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes two novel continuous relaxations of Boltzmann machines to enable training discrete variational autoencoders (VAEs) using tighter variational bounds. Boltzmann machines are powerful priors for binary latent variables but cannot be directly used in VAEs as they are not differentiable. Previous approaches like DVAE and DVAE++ use smoothing transformations that permit reparameterization but are limited to looser evidence lower bounds. 

This paper introduces overlapping transformations based on generalized inverse CDF sampling and Gaussian integral transformations of the Boltzmann distribution. These relaxations provide differentiable versions of the Boltzmann prior that permit training discrete VAEs with tighter importance weighted bounds. The relaxations are controlled by an inverse temperature parameter that can sharpen the approximation to recover the original binary model.

Experiments on MNIST and OMNIGLOT show superior performance versus prior DVAEs across network architectures. Key results include: 1) Tighter importance weighted bounds improve performance. 2) Power-function smoothing provides lower variance gradients and better log-likelihoods. 3) Mean-field inference accurately approximates the required intractable expectations. 4) Population annealing works better than persistent contrastive divergence for latent variable sampling.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions through novel continuous relaxations of discrete distributions that enable training discrete VAEs with tighter variational bounds. The proposed methods outperform prior state-of-the-art across benchmark datasets.
