# [MSTAR: Multi-Scale Backbone Architecture Search for Timeseries   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13822)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Time series classification (TSC) methods face challenges in effectively capturing useful frequencies across timescales while minimizing noise. 
- Methods focusing on receptive fields for frequency extraction have scalability issues. Manually designing deep learning models is time-consuming and may not find the optimal architecture. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MSTAR, a novel multi-scale CNN backbone search space paired with a framework for neural architecture search (NAS).  
- The search space is inspired by Inception-like models to capture diverse temporal patterns. NAS automates finding architectures tailored for specific datasets.

- The paper argues both frequency and precise time location of features are important for TSC. The search space aims to extract useful frequencies while preserving time resolution.

Key Contributions:
- MSTAR backbone with NAS framework overcomes scalability issues and avoids manual architecture design, outperforming state-of-the-art on 4 datasets.

- Analysis shows the importance of time resolution for extracted frequencies, not just receptive fields. 

- The discovered CNN backbones pair effectively with transformer models like Vision Transformer (VIT), harnessing contextual understanding and pattern recognition abilities.

- Overall, the work provides a broader view of TSC requirements, introduces a robust search space and NAS framework, and shows promise for integrating larger models to handle bigger datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel multi-scale neural architecture search space and framework for time series classification that addresses the challenges of extracting optimal frequencies while preserving time resolution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It introduces MSTAR, a multi-scale convolutional backbone search space that aims to search for the optimal architecture capable of extracting the essential frequencies needed for time series classification. MSTAR found 4 completely different architectures that reached state-of-the-art performance on 4 datasets across different domains.

2. It provides a novel framework along with an effective autoencoder that aids the search space to find novel architectures on any dataset. 

3. It shows through experiments that time resolution is also a critical factor to consider when building time series classification models, in addition to frequency extraction which most prior work focused on. 

4. It shows that the CNN backbone discovered by MSTAR can be paired effectively with pre-trained Vision Transformer (VIT) compared to other 1D CNNs, allowing it to leverage the power of global contextual understanding and sophisticated pattern recognition of large vision models.

In summary, the key innovations are the proposed multi-scale search space, associated framework to find optimal architectures tailored to datasets, and demonstrating the importance of preserving time resolution in addition to handling frequencies for time series classification.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

2. The paper argues that both frequency and time resolution are important for time series classification. How does the proposed search space aim to balance extracting useful frequencies while maintaining reasonable time resolution?

3. What modifications were made to the standard Bayesian Optimization framework for neural architecture search? What is the purpose of using an autoencoder and multiple predictors?

4. What are the advantages of using a convolutional autoencoder compared to a variational autoencoder for encoding the search space? How exactly does the autoencoder boost the accuracy of the predictors?

5. How does the paper evaluate the contribution of different nodes and receptive fields to validate that both frequency and time resolution matter? What ablation study was conducted?

6. How does the framework balance exploration and exploitation during the search process? What mechanisms are in place to prevent overfitting of the predictors?

7. The paper demonstrates strong performance across datasets of varying sizes and domains. What adaptations are made during training and evaluation for each dataset? 

8. What modifications could be made to the search space to incorporate more advanced operations like dilated convolutions or squeeze-and-excitation blocks? How may this impact performance?

9. The method uses a CNN backbone paired with Vision Transformer (ViT). Why is a CNN backbone better suited than ViT alone? How do the pre-trained weights provide useful inductive biases?

10. The paper focuses on classification tasks. How could the search framework and multi-scale backbone be extended to other time series tasks like forecasting or anomaly detection? What changes would need to be made?
