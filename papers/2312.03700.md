# [OneLLM: One Framework to Align All Modalities with Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03700)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces OneLLM, a novel multimodal large language model capable of aligning eight different modalities - image, video, audio, point clouds, depth/normal maps, IMU sensor data, fMRI brain activity, and text - using a unified framework. At the core of OneLLM is a universal encoder (pretrained CLIP-ViT model) and universal projection module to map all modalities into the text embedding space, enabled by learnable modality tokens. OneLLM is trained in a progressive multimodal alignment pipeline, starting from an image-text model and incrementally expanding to more modalities based on data magnitude. To leverage OneLLM's capabilities, the authors curate a comprehensive 2 million item multimodal instruction tuning dataset spanning tasks like captioning, QA, reasoning across the eight modalities. Evaluations on 25 diverse benchmarks show OneLLM outperforming specialized models and prior multimodal LLMs. OneLLM sets a new bar for flexibility and scalability in aligning modalities with language within a single model. The code, data, and models are publicly released.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 OneLLM presents a unified multimodal framework with a shared encoder and projection module to align eight distinct modalities - image, video, audio, point clouds, depth/normal maps, IMU, fMRI, and text - achieving strong performance across diverse multimodal tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing OneLLM, an MLLM that aligns eight modalities to language using a unified framework. It consists of lightweight modality tokenizers, a universal encoder, a universal projection module (UPM), and an LLM.

2. Designing a unified multimodal encoder and progressive multimodal alignment pipeline. It first trains an image-text model, then builds a UPM by mixing image projection modules, and finally aligns more modalities using the UPM.

3. Curating a large-scale multimodal instruction dataset with 2M items across image, video, audio, point cloud, depth/normal map, IMU, and fMRI modalities. Finetuning on this dataset gives OneLLM strong multimodal understanding and instruction-following capabilities.

4. Evaluating OneLLM on 25 diverse benchmarks and showing superior performance over previous specialized models and MLLMs. The code, data, model, and demo are publicly available.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing OneLLM, a unified and scalable framework to align multiple modalities with language, which achieves excellent performance on various multimodal tasks.
