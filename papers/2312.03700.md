# [OneLLM: One Framework to Align All Modalities with Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03700)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces OneLLM, a novel multimodal large language model capable of aligning eight different modalities - image, video, audio, point clouds, depth/normal maps, IMU sensor data, fMRI brain activity, and text - using a unified framework. At the core of OneLLM is a universal encoder (pretrained CLIP-ViT model) and universal projection module to map all modalities into the text embedding space, enabled by learnable modality tokens. OneLLM is trained in a progressive multimodal alignment pipeline, starting from an image-text model and incrementally expanding to more modalities based on data magnitude. To leverage OneLLM's capabilities, the authors curate a comprehensive 2 million item multimodal instruction tuning dataset spanning tasks like captioning, QA, reasoning across the eight modalities. Evaluations on 25 diverse benchmarks show OneLLM outperforming specialized models and prior multimodal LLMs. OneLLM sets a new bar for flexibility and scalability in aligning modalities with language within a single model. The code, data, and models are publicly released.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 OneLLM presents a unified multimodal framework with a shared encoder and projection module to align eight distinct modalities - image, video, audio, point clouds, depth/normal maps, IMU, fMRI, and text - achieving strong performance across diverse multimodal tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing OneLLM, an MLLM that aligns eight modalities to language using a unified framework. It consists of lightweight modality tokenizers, a universal encoder, a universal projection module (UPM), and an LLM.

2. Designing a unified multimodal encoder and progressive multimodal alignment pipeline. It first trains an image-text model, then builds a UPM by mixing image projection modules, and finally aligns more modalities using the UPM.

3. Curating a large-scale multimodal instruction dataset with 2M items across image, video, audio, point cloud, depth/normal map, IMU, and fMRI modalities. Finetuning on this dataset gives OneLLM strong multimodal understanding and instruction-following capabilities.

4. Evaluating OneLLM on 25 diverse benchmarks and showing superior performance over previous specialized models and MLLMs. The code, data, model, and demo are publicly available.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing OneLLM, a unified and scalable framework to align multiple modalities with language, which achieves excellent performance on various multimodal tasks.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely on modality-specific encoders and projection modules, limiting their capability to handle diverse modalities within one framework. It is challenging to build a unified and scalable encoder to align multiple modalities with language models.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes OneLLM, an MLLM that can align 8 distinct modalities (image, video, audio, point clouds, depth/normal maps, IMU, fMRI) using a single unified framework. The key components are:

1) Lightweight modality tokenizers to convert input signals into tokens
2) A universal encoder based on a frozen CLIP model to extract features  
3) A universal projection module (UPM) to project features into the language space. The UPM consists of multiple projection experts and a dynamic router for expert aggregation.
4) An autoregressive language model (LLaMA2) for multimodal understanding.

OneLLM is trained progressively - first aligning image, then video/audio/points, finally less common modalities. A 2M-sample multimodal instruction dataset covering diverse tasks is curated to finetune OneLLM's capabilities.

Main Contributions:
1) A unified framework to align multimodal inputs with language using a universal encoder and projection module 
2) The first MLLM capable of handling 8 distinct modalities within one model
3) Strong performance (SOTA or close to SOTA) on 25 diverse multimodal benchmarks after finetuning on the curated instruction dataset

In summary, OneLLM demonstrates the possibility of building scalable and unified MLLMs with excellent few-shot cross-modal understanding, instead of relying on specialized encoders. The design enables easy expansion to incorporate more modalities.
