# [An Online Hierarchical Energy Management System for Energy Communities,   Complying with the Current Technical Legislation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01688)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Climate change necessitates new energy efficiency strategies for smart grids (SG). In an effort to accelerate renewable energy adoption in a more affordable way, the EU defined the concept of Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) in 2018. A REC is a local electrical grid where participants share self-produced renewable energy and benefit from reduced bills via incentives. However, realizing these benefits requires effective Energy Management Systems (EMS).

Proposed Solution:  
- An online hierarchical EMS (HEMS) is proposed for optimizing REC costs and energy flows. The HEMS methodology is compared to a simple local self-consumption strategy. The solution carefully follows EU technical legislation for RECs, as implemented in Italy. Key elements include:

1) REC Architecture: 7 nodes (homes), each with PV generation, load, and battery storage. Nodes can exchange power flows. An LSTM neural network forecasts PV and load.  

2) Problem Formulation: Nodes maximize self-consumption locally. HEMS overrides local decisions to minimize overall REC costs - comprising battery wear, energy purchase, PV installation costs and incentives.

3) Optimization: Hybrid fuzzy logic - genetic algorithm (GA) approach. GA evolves fuzzy system parameters. Provides model explainability.

Main Contributions:

- HEMS strategy leads to 20% cost savings over self-consumption approach
- Careful modelling of REC policies and costs per latest EU/Italian technical legislation 
- Parameterization enables easy transferability to other country legislations
- Novel battery wear cost modelling
- Explainable AI optimization via fuzzy logic - GA technique

The solution demonstrates the value of optimized hierarchical energy management over a naive self-consumption approach for RECs, enabled by a computationally efficient AI technique. Model explainability also provides insights to interpret the solution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an online hierarchical energy management system for renewable energy communities to minimize costs that outperforms a local self-consumption strategy by about 20% savings through slavish adherence to up-to-date EU regulations, proper system modeling, machine learning forecasting, and an explainable fuzzy logic optimization approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) Demonstrating that a hierarchical energy management strategy for a renewable energy community (REC) outperforms a local self-consumption approach, leading to around 20% more cost savings. 

2) Providing a slavish reference to the up-to-date EU REC legislation framework as inherited by Italy, allowing for a realistic problem formulation.

3) Properly parameterizing the model so that it can be easily adapted to other countries' technical legislation frameworks.

4) Referencing real PV plant and ESS devices as presented in the Italian market to increase realism. 

5) Adopting an ESS wear cost model not commonly found in similar research for Italy.

6) Using a machine learning grey-box computation approach based on a hybrid fuzzy inference system - genetic algorithm to enable explainable AI optimization.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating and quantifying the superior performance of a hierarchical optimization strategy over local self-consumption for an REC, while also providing a highly realistic model formulation and an interpretable AI-based optimization approach.

- AI explainability

The paper presents an online hierarchical energy management system (HEMS) for optimizing costs in a renewable energy community (REC) while complying with technical legislation frameworks. The HEMS utilizes a fuzzy inference system-genetic algorithm (FIS-GA) approach along with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks for power forecasting. A key focus is providing explainability for the AI-based optimization using fuzzy logic. The results demonstrate improved performance over a self-consumption strategy, with good precision and computational efficiency. The model is also parameterized to allow easy adaptation to other countries' regulations. So the main themes relate to intelligent and hierarchical optimization of community renewable energy systems with a focus on explainable AI.
