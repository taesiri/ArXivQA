# [An Online Hierarchical Energy Management System for Energy Communities,   Complying with the Current Technical Legislation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01688)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Climate change necessitates new energy efficiency strategies for smart grids (SG). In an effort to accelerate renewable energy adoption in a more affordable way, the EU defined the concept of Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) in 2018. A REC is a local electrical grid where participants share self-produced renewable energy and benefit from reduced bills via incentives. However, realizing these benefits requires effective Energy Management Systems (EMS).

Proposed Solution:  
- An online hierarchical EMS (HEMS) is proposed for optimizing REC costs and energy flows. The HEMS methodology is compared to a simple local self-consumption strategy. The solution carefully follows EU technical legislation for RECs, as implemented in Italy. Key elements include:

1) REC Architecture: 7 nodes (homes), each with PV generation, load, and battery storage. Nodes can exchange power flows. An LSTM neural network forecasts PV and load.  

2) Problem Formulation: Nodes maximize self-consumption locally. HEMS overrides local decisions to minimize overall REC costs - comprising battery wear, energy purchase, PV installation costs and incentives.

3) Optimization: Hybrid fuzzy logic - genetic algorithm (GA) approach. GA evolves fuzzy system parameters. Provides model explainability.

Main Contributions:

- HEMS strategy leads to 20% cost savings over self-consumption approach
- Careful modelling of REC policies and costs per latest EU/Italian technical legislation 
- Parameterization enables easy transferability to other country legislations
- Novel battery wear cost modelling
- Explainable AI optimization via fuzzy logic - GA technique

The solution demonstrates the value of optimized hierarchical energy management over a naive self-consumption approach for RECs, enabled by a computationally efficient AI technique. Model explainability also provides insights to interpret the solution.
