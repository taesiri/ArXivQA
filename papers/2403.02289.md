## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are useful for solving differential equations and modeling physical systems, but have limitations for control problems like open-ended prediction, changing inputs over time, and long-range extrapolation.  

- The recently introduced PINC framework extends PINNs for control problems, but still has difficulties with highly complex and nonsmooth dynamic systems like gas-lifted oil wells. These systems have nonlinear ODEs with functions like square roots and logarithms that cause issues.

- Thus, there is a need for an enhanced PINC framework that can effectively model and control complex physical systems with nonsmooth behaviors.

Solution:
- The authors propose an improved PINC architecture with:

1) Skip connections to improve gradient magnitude and avoid vanishing gradients during training. This is based on prior work showing skip connections address gradient pathologies in normal PINNs.

2) Modifications to problematic ODE terms used in the loss function during training to avoid pitfalls. For example, using max operators and polynomial approximations.   

3) A hierarchical architecture with the PINC module predicting states, and a separate feedforward neural network predicting algebraic variables. This avoids costly retraining.

Contributions:  

- The enhanced PINC demonstrates superior modeling capability, reducing validation error by 67% on average for the oil well system.

- It also significantly improves gradient flow, increasing magnitude by four orders relative to normal PINC.    

- Experiments showcase the efficacy of model predictive control with the improved PINC for regulating bottom-hole pressure, even with noisy measurements.

In summary, the authors presented an improved PINC architecture that enables effective modeling and control of complex physical systems with nonsmooth ODEs. This is demonstrated on gas-lifted oil wells.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes improvements to the Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Control (PINC) framework, including skip connections and modifications to the physics-based loss function, to enable accurate modeling and model predictive control of complex dynamic systems like gas-lifted oil wells.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an improved version of the Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Control (PINC) framework that is suitable for modeling and control of complex dynamic systems characterized by highly nonlinear and nonsmooth functions. Specifically, the improvements include:

1) Using a neural network architecture with skip connections to avoid vanishing gradients during training and improve the magnitude of gradients by four orders of magnitude. This facilitates modeling complex systems like gas-lifted oil wells. 

2) Modifying problematic terms in the system's ODEs to avoid issues during training. For example, replacing nonlinear functions that are not defined for negative numbers with suitable approximations.

3) Introducing a hierarchical architecture with the PINC module predicting states and a separate feedforward neural network predicting algebraic variables. This avoids costly retraining of the entire model when new outputs are needed.

4) Demonstrating that the improved PINC framework enables accurate long-term predictions and effective nonlinear model predictive control of gas-lifted oil wells, a challenging dynamic system, even in the presence of noisy measurements. On average across different oil well models, the prediction error was reduced by 67% compared to the original PINC.

In summary, the key innovation is an enhanced PINC architecture that extends the applicability of physics-informed neural networks to complex real-world systems, enabling precise modeling for simulation and control.
