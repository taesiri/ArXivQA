# [Unsupervised Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03649)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve the transfer performance of vision-language models like CLIP on downstream image classification tasks in an unsupervised manner, without requiring manual prompt engineering or labeled data from the target datasets?The key hypothesis is that by generating pseudo-labels on target dataset images using CLIP, and then optimizing a learnable prompt representation in a self-training manner on these pseudo-labels, the transfer performance of CLIP can be significantly improved for image classification on the target dataset. The authors propose an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) framework to address this question. UPL avoids the need for manual prompt engineering by learning a prompt representation directly from pseudo-labels on the target dataset. It also avoids the need for labeled data from the target dataset by using a self-training approach on pseudo-labels. The central hypothesis is that this UPL framework can boost CLIP's transfer performance in an unsupervised way, without relying on annotations or laborious prompt engineering for new target datasets. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis on ImageNet and 10 other image classification datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. The authors propose an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) framework to avoid laborious prompt engineering and better adapt vision-language models like CLIP to downstream image classification tasks. As far as I can tell, this is the first work to introduce unsupervised learning into prompt learning for vision-language models. 2. They thoroughly analyze the characteristics of CLIP for pseudo-labeling and based on the observations, propose techniques like top-K pseudo-labeling, pseudo label ensemble, and prompt representation ensemble to improve transfer performance.3. Extensive experiments show their UPL significantly outperforms the original CLIP with prompt engineering on ImageNet and 10 other image classification datasets. An enhanced version of UPL is competitive with supervised methods like 8-shot CoOp and 8-shot Tip-Adapter on most datasets.In summary, the key contribution appears to be the proposal of an unsupervised prompt learning framework that can avoid manual prompt engineering and adapt pre-trained vision-language models to new datasets, while achieving strong performance compared to supervised approaches. The proposed techniques to handle CLIP's biases are also important contributions.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:- This paper explores unsupervised prompt learning for vision-language models, which is a relatively new direction compared to supervised prompt learning approaches like CoOp, CLIP-Adapter, and Tip-Adapter. The key novelty is introducing unsupervised learning into prompt optimization, avoiding the need for labeled data from the target datasets.- The proposed UPL method outperforms the original CLIP and is competitive with few-shot supervised methods like 8-shot CoOp and Tip-Adapter. This demonstrates the promise of unsupervised prompt learning as an alternative to supervised approaches.- Most prior work has focused on supervised few-shot learning for prompt optimization. By not needing any labels, UPL could potentially have better scalability and applicability to new domains. However, the performance is slightly lower than the fully supervised methods.- For the unsupervised setting, the techniques used in UPL like pseudo-labeling, confidence calibration, and prompt ensembling are reasonable and validated to work well empirically. However, there may be room to explore more advanced unsupervised learning techniques in future work.- Overall, UPL makes a unique contribution as the first unsupervised prompt learning approach, achieving competitive performance to few-shot methods without using any labeled data. The results are promising and highlight the potential of unsupervised techniques for adapting vision-language models. More work can build off this direction in the future.In summary, UPL carves out a novel niche as an unsupervised alternative to supervised prompt learning. The techniques and performance demonstrate its viability, despite slightly lower accuracy than state-of-the-art few-shot approaches. Future work can likely close this gap and further expand the utility of unsupervised prompt optimization.
