# [Unsupervised Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03649)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we improve the transfer performance of vision-language models like CLIP on downstream image classification tasks in an unsupervised manner, without requiring manual prompt engineering or labeled data from the target datasets?

The key hypothesis is that by generating pseudo-labels on target dataset images using CLIP, and then optimizing a learnable prompt representation in a self-training manner on these pseudo-labels, the transfer performance of CLIP can be significantly improved for image classification on the target dataset. 

The authors propose an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) framework to address this question. UPL avoids the need for manual prompt engineering by learning a prompt representation directly from pseudo-labels on the target dataset. It also avoids the need for labeled data from the target dataset by using a self-training approach on pseudo-labels. The central hypothesis is that this UPL framework can boost CLIP's transfer performance in an unsupervised way, without relying on annotations or laborious prompt engineering for new target datasets. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis on ImageNet and 10 other image classification datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors propose an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) framework to avoid laborious prompt engineering and better adapt vision-language models like CLIP to downstream image classification tasks. As far as I can tell, this is the first work to introduce unsupervised learning into prompt learning for vision-language models. 

2. They thoroughly analyze the characteristics of CLIP for pseudo-labeling and based on the observations, propose techniques like top-K pseudo-labeling, pseudo label ensemble, and prompt representation ensemble to improve transfer performance.

3. Extensive experiments show their UPL significantly outperforms the original CLIP with prompt engineering on ImageNet and 10 other image classification datasets. An enhanced version of UPL is competitive with supervised methods like 8-shot CoOp and 8-shot Tip-Adapter on most datasets.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be the proposal of an unsupervised prompt learning framework that can avoid manual prompt engineering and adapt pre-trained vision-language models to new datasets, while achieving strong performance compared to supervised approaches. The proposed techniques to handle CLIP's biases are also important contributions.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper explores unsupervised prompt learning for vision-language models, which is a relatively new direction compared to supervised prompt learning approaches like CoOp, CLIP-Adapter, and Tip-Adapter. The key novelty is introducing unsupervised learning into prompt optimization, avoiding the need for labeled data from the target datasets.

- The proposed UPL method outperforms the original CLIP and is competitive with few-shot supervised methods like 8-shot CoOp and Tip-Adapter. This demonstrates the promise of unsupervised prompt learning as an alternative to supervised approaches.

- Most prior work has focused on supervised few-shot learning for prompt optimization. By not needing any labels, UPL could potentially have better scalability and applicability to new domains. However, the performance is slightly lower than the fully supervised methods.

- For the unsupervised setting, the techniques used in UPL like pseudo-labeling, confidence calibration, and prompt ensembling are reasonable and validated to work well empirically. However, there may be room to explore more advanced unsupervised learning techniques in future work.

- Overall, UPL makes a unique contribution as the first unsupervised prompt learning approach, achieving competitive performance to few-shot methods without using any labeled data. The results are promising and highlight the potential of unsupervised techniques for adapting vision-language models. More work can build off this direction in the future.

In summary, UPL carves out a novel niche as an unsupervised alternative to supervised prompt learning. The techniques and performance demonstrate its viability, despite slightly lower accuracy than state-of-the-art few-shot approaches. Future work can likely close this gap and further expand the utility of unsupervised prompt optimization.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other unsupervised learning techniques in addition to self-training for prompt learning. The authors propose self-training in an unsupervised manner for prompt learning, but suggest exploring other unsupervised learning approaches as well.

- Applying the unsupervised prompt learning idea to other vision-language models besides CLIP. The authors focus on using CLIP in their method, but suggest expanding unsupervised prompt learning to other vision-language models. 

- Leveraging unlabeled multi-modal data. The authors use unlabeled images for unsupervised prompt learning, but suggest utilizing large amounts of unlabeled image-text data could further improve prompt learning.

- Studying theoretical understandings. The authors suggest more theoretical analysis on why unsupervised prompt learning works well and how the optimized prompt representations capture semantic meanings would be valuable.

- Deploying unsupervised prompt learning to other downstream tasks. The authors focus on image classification but suggest exploring deploying unsupervised prompt learning to other vision tasks like object detection and segmentation.

- Combining supervised and unsupervised learning. The authors propose a purely unsupervised method, but suggest combining supervised and unsupervised learning for prompt optimization could be promising.

In summary, the main future directions are exploring other unsupervised techniques for prompt learning, applying it to other models and tasks, leveraging unlabeled multi-modal data, gaining theoretical understandings, and combining supervised and unsupervised learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) approach to adapt vision-language models like CLIP for downstream image classification tasks without needing labeled data. UPL has two main steps - first it uses CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for target dataset images. Based on observations about CLIP's biased per-class preferences, it selects top-K confident samples per class rather than using a confidence threshold. Next, it defines and optimizes a learnable prompt representation on the pseudo-labeled images via a self-training procedure. This prompt representation is shared across classes. At inference time, the hand-crafted prompt in CLIP is simply replaced with the optimized prompt representation. Experiments on ImageNet and 10 other datasets show UPL outperforms prompt-engineered CLIP, and an ensemble version is competitive with few-shot supervised adaptation methods like CoOp and Tip-Adapter. The main novelty is introducing unsupervised learning to prompt optimization for vision-language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) method to improve the transfer performance of vision-language models like CLIP for image classification, without needing any labeled data from the target dataset. Current methods like CoOp, CLIP-Adapter and Tip-Adapter require some labeled examples from the target dataset to adapt the model via prompt learning. However, UPL avoids this by using the pretrained CLIP model itself to generate pseudo-labels on the unlabeled target data, and then optimizes a learnable prompt representation using these pseudo-labels. Specifically, it selects the top-K most confident pseudo-labels per class rather than using a confidence threshold, since CLIP exhibits biased per-class accuracy. The optimized prompt representation simply replaces the original handcrafted prompts during inference. Experiments on ImageNet and 10 other datasets show UPL outperforms prompt-engineered CLIP, and an enhanced version with pseudo-label ensembling is competitive with supervised CoOp and Tip-Adapter.

In summary, the key ideas are: 1) Using CLIP's own predictions on unlabeled target data as pseudo-labels for self-training, avoiding the need for real labels; 2) Selecting top-K per class rather than thresholding to handle CLIP's biased predictions; 3) Optimizing a learnable prompt representation on the pseudo-labels; 4) Replacing handcrafted prompts with this learned representation. The unsupervised nature allows prompt optimization to scale, while providing accuracy competitive with supervised approaches.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) approach to improve the transfer performance of vision-language models like CLIP for image classification, without requiring any labeled data from the target dataset. First, CLIP is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled target images using a simple prompt like "a photo of a [CLASS]". Then top-K most confident samples per class are selected for subsequent training, instead of using a confidence threshold. This gives a balanced set of pseudo-labeled data. Next, a learnable prompt representation, shared across classes, is defined and optimized on the pseudo-labeled images by minimizing cross-entropy loss. The gradients update the prompt representation while keeping CLIP's parameters fixed. For inference, the optimized prompt representation is used in place of hand-crafted prompts. Enhancements like pseudo label and prompt representation ensembling further improve performance. The key aspects are generating pseudo-labels for target data in an unsupervised manner and optimizing a shared prompt representation through self-training on selected pseudo-labeled images.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem it is trying to address is how to adapt vision-language models like CLIP for downstream image classification tasks without relying on laborious prompt engineering or requiring labeled data from the target datasets. 

Specifically, the paper focuses on avoiding two issues:

1) Prompt engineering: Typically CLIP needs carefully designed text prompts like "a photo of a [CLASS]" to classify images in the inference stage. However, identifying the proper prompt requires a lot of effort and domain expertise. Even small changes to the prompt can hugely impact performance.

2) Labeled target data: Recent methods like CoOp, CLIP-Adapter, and Tip-Adapter have shown promise in adapting CLIP to new datasets by using a small labeled sample from the target dataset. However, this requires annotations and may limit scalability.

To tackle these issues, the authors propose an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) approach that can optimize prompt representations for a new target dataset without any labeled data. The key ideas are:

- Use CLIP to pseudo-label target dataset images 

- Select top-K confident samples per class for prompt optimization

- Optimize a shared learnable prompt representation on the pseudo-labeled images

- At inference time, replace hand-crafted prompts with the learned prompt

So in summary, the paper aims to improve CLIP's transfer performance in a scalable unsupervised way, avoiding both prompt engineering and dependence on labeled target data.
