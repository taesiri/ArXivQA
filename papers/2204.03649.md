# [Unsupervised Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03649)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve the transfer performance of vision-language models like CLIP on downstream image classification tasks in an unsupervised manner, without requiring manual prompt engineering or labeled data from the target datasets?The key hypothesis is that by generating pseudo-labels on target dataset images using CLIP, and then optimizing a learnable prompt representation in a self-training manner on these pseudo-labels, the transfer performance of CLIP can be significantly improved for image classification on the target dataset. The authors propose an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) framework to address this question. UPL avoids the need for manual prompt engineering by learning a prompt representation directly from pseudo-labels on the target dataset. It also avoids the need for labeled data from the target dataset by using a self-training approach on pseudo-labels. The central hypothesis is that this UPL framework can boost CLIP's transfer performance in an unsupervised way, without relying on annotations or laborious prompt engineering for new target datasets. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis on ImageNet and 10 other image classification datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. The authors propose an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) framework to avoid laborious prompt engineering and better adapt vision-language models like CLIP to downstream image classification tasks. As far as I can tell, this is the first work to introduce unsupervised learning into prompt learning for vision-language models. 2. They thoroughly analyze the characteristics of CLIP for pseudo-labeling and based on the observations, propose techniques like top-K pseudo-labeling, pseudo label ensemble, and prompt representation ensemble to improve transfer performance.3. Extensive experiments show their UPL significantly outperforms the original CLIP with prompt engineering on ImageNet and 10 other image classification datasets. An enhanced version of UPL is competitive with supervised methods like 8-shot CoOp and 8-shot Tip-Adapter on most datasets.In summary, the key contribution appears to be the proposal of an unsupervised prompt learning framework that can avoid manual prompt engineering and adapt pre-trained vision-language models to new datasets, while achieving strong performance compared to supervised approaches. The proposed techniques to handle CLIP's biases are also important contributions.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:- This paper explores unsupervised prompt learning for vision-language models, which is a relatively new direction compared to supervised prompt learning approaches like CoOp, CLIP-Adapter, and Tip-Adapter. The key novelty is introducing unsupervised learning into prompt optimization, avoiding the need for labeled data from the target datasets.- The proposed UPL method outperforms the original CLIP and is competitive with few-shot supervised methods like 8-shot CoOp and Tip-Adapter. This demonstrates the promise of unsupervised prompt learning as an alternative to supervised approaches.- Most prior work has focused on supervised few-shot learning for prompt optimization. By not needing any labels, UPL could potentially have better scalability and applicability to new domains. However, the performance is slightly lower than the fully supervised methods.- For the unsupervised setting, the techniques used in UPL like pseudo-labeling, confidence calibration, and prompt ensembling are reasonable and validated to work well empirically. However, there may be room to explore more advanced unsupervised learning techniques in future work.- Overall, UPL makes a unique contribution as the first unsupervised prompt learning approach, achieving competitive performance to few-shot methods without using any labeled data. The results are promising and highlight the potential of unsupervised techniques for adapting vision-language models. More work can build off this direction in the future.In summary, UPL carves out a novel niche as an unsupervised alternative to supervised prompt learning. The techniques and performance demonstrate its viability, despite slightly lower accuracy than state-of-the-art few-shot approaches. Future work can likely close this gap and further expand the utility of unsupervised prompt optimization.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) approach to adapt vision-language models like CLIP for downstream image classification tasks without needing labeled data. UPL has two main steps - first it uses CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for target dataset images. Based on observations about CLIP's biased per-class preferences, it selects top-K confident samples per class rather than using a confidence threshold. Next, it defines and optimizes a learnable prompt representation on the pseudo-labeled images via a self-training procedure. This prompt representation is shared across classes. At inference time, the hand-crafted prompt in CLIP is simply replaced with the optimized prompt representation. Experiments on ImageNet and 10 other datasets show UPL outperforms prompt-engineered CLIP, and an ensemble version is competitive with few-shot supervised adaptation methods like CoOp and Tip-Adapter. The main novelty is introducing unsupervised learning to prompt optimization for vision-language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) method to improve the transfer performance of vision-language models like CLIP for image classification, without needing any labeled data from the target dataset. Current methods like CoOp, CLIP-Adapter and Tip-Adapter require some labeled examples from the target dataset to adapt the model via prompt learning. However, UPL avoids this by using the pretrained CLIP model itself to generate pseudo-labels on the unlabeled target data, and then optimizes a learnable prompt representation using these pseudo-labels. Specifically, it selects the top-K most confident pseudo-labels per class rather than using a confidence threshold, since CLIP exhibits biased per-class accuracy. The optimized prompt representation simply replaces the original handcrafted prompts during inference. Experiments on ImageNet and 10 other datasets show UPL outperforms prompt-engineered CLIP, and an enhanced version with pseudo-label ensembling is competitive with supervised CoOp and Tip-Adapter.In summary, the key ideas are: 1) Using CLIP's own predictions on unlabeled target data as pseudo-labels for self-training, avoiding the need for real labels; 2) Selecting top-K per class rather than thresholding to handle CLIP's biased predictions; 3) Optimizing a learnable prompt representation on the pseudo-labels; 4) Replacing handcrafted prompts with this learned representation. The unsupervised nature allows prompt optimization to scale, while providing accuracy competitive with supervised approaches.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) approach to improve the transfer performance of vision-language models like CLIP for image classification, without requiring any labeled data from the target dataset. First, CLIP is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled target images using a simple prompt like "a photo of a [CLASS]". Then top-K most confident samples per class are selected for subsequent training, instead of using a confidence threshold. This gives a balanced set of pseudo-labeled data. Next, a learnable prompt representation, shared across classes, is defined and optimized on the pseudo-labeled images by minimizing cross-entropy loss. The gradients update the prompt representation while keeping CLIP's parameters fixed. For inference, the optimized prompt representation is used in place of hand-crafted prompts. Enhancements like pseudo label and prompt representation ensembling further improve performance. The key aspects are generating pseudo-labels for target data in an unsupervised manner and optimizing a shared prompt representation through self-training on selected pseudo-labeled images.
