# [MixRED: A Mix-lingual Relation Extraction Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15696)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Relation extraction (RE) is an important NLP task but existing research has focused on monolingual or cross-lingual scenarios. There is a gap in understanding RE performance in mix-lingual (code-switching) contexts where content from different languages is intermixed within sentences or documents.

- Lack of dedicated datasets makes it hard to evaluate existing RE models in mix-lingual contexts. It is unclear if these models can effectively handle the challenges of comprehending diverse linguistic content and capturing cross-language entity dependencies.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new mix-lingual RE task (MixRE) and construct the first human-annotated mix-lingual RE dataset (MixRED) to support this task. 

- Systematically blend English and Chinese documents using a hierarchical mix module operating at inter-sentence, intra-sentence and entity levels. Vary language concentration across samples.

- Annotators refine and label samples. Dataset has 8k documents, 238k sentences, 3.6M words, 44k entities, 91k mentions and 21 relations.

- Evaluate state-of-the-art supervised models and large language models on MixRED. Also analyze impact of mix strategies and language concentration.

Key Contributions:

1) A new mix-lingual RE task (MixRE) and supporting dataset MixRED constructed via a systematic framework.

2) Evaluation of various models on MixRED, comparisons between supervised and unsupervised models. Analysis of factors affecting model performance.

3) Identification of promising directions to improve supervised and large language model performance for the MixRE task.
