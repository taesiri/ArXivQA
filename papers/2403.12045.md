# [Determining Intent of Changes to Ascertain Fake Crowdsourced Image   Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12045)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Crowdsourced images on social media can be untrustworthy and contain modifications that make them "fake" in certain contexts. 
- Existing scene analysis approaches assume images are trustworthy and don't consider potential modifications.
- Traditional fake image detection relies on computationally expensive image processing.
- Lightweight trust assessment methods based on metadata are limited.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel service-oriented framework to determine fake crowdsourced images using only metadata. 
- Images abstracted as "image services" with functional and non-functional (metadata) attributes.
- Define "intention of changes" in metadata as key to ascertain fakes. 
- Formalize intention based on change in image semantics using latent semantic analysis (LSA) on metadata.
- Use cosine similarity on LSA image vectors to quantify semantic changes.
- Categorize metadata changes as extrinsic or intrinsic.
- Estimate intention spectrum well-intentioned vs ill-intentioned changes.
- Translate intention into context-sensitive "fakeness" score.

Contributions:
- Lightweight fake detection framework using only non-functional metadata.
- Novel "intention of changes" concept to quantify trustworthiness.
- Innovative use of LSA to extract image semantics from metadata. 
- Intention estimation method using semantic changes.
- Clustering and machine learning to classify intentions.
- Evaluation on real datasets shows high accuracy and efficiency.

In summary, it's a metadata-based service-oriented approach to ascertain fake crowdsourced images without needing image processing, using a novel concept of "intention" derived from semantic analysis of changes. The key idea is that not all changes make an image fake, it depends on the context and intention behind the changes.
