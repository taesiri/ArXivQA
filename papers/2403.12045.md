# [Determining Intent of Changes to Ascertain Fake Crowdsourced Image   Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12045)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Crowdsourced images on social media can be untrustworthy and contain modifications that make them "fake" in certain contexts. 
- Existing scene analysis approaches assume images are trustworthy and don't consider potential modifications.
- Traditional fake image detection relies on computationally expensive image processing.
- Lightweight trust assessment methods based on metadata are limited.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel service-oriented framework to determine fake crowdsourced images using only metadata. 
- Images abstracted as "image services" with functional and non-functional (metadata) attributes.
- Define "intention of changes" in metadata as key to ascertain fakes. 
- Formalize intention based on change in image semantics using latent semantic analysis (LSA) on metadata.
- Use cosine similarity on LSA image vectors to quantify semantic changes.
- Categorize metadata changes as extrinsic or intrinsic.
- Estimate intention spectrum well-intentioned vs ill-intentioned changes.
- Translate intention into context-sensitive "fakeness" score.

Contributions:
- Lightweight fake detection framework using only non-functional metadata.
- Novel "intention of changes" concept to quantify trustworthiness.
- Innovative use of LSA to extract image semantics from metadata. 
- Intention estimation method using semantic changes.
- Clustering and machine learning to classify intentions.
- Evaluation on real datasets shows high accuracy and efficiency.

In summary, it's a metadata-based service-oriented approach to ascertain fake crowdsourced images without needing image processing, using a novel concept of "intention" derived from semantic analysis of changes. The key idea is that not all changes make an image fake, it depends on the context and intention behind the changes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel service-oriented framework to determine the likelihood of a crowdsourced image being fake based on analyzing changes in the image's metadata to estimate the intention behind the changes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A novel services-based framework is proposed to determine fake image services. The framework only relies on the non-functional attributes (metadata) of an image service and does not require processing the actual image.

2. The concept of "intention" is introduced as a key parameter to ascertain fake image services. A method is proposed to formalize intention based on the change in semantics of an image service, quantified using latent semantic analysis. 

3. Latent semantic analysis is employed in a unique way to determine the semantics of an image and quantify the semantic changes to estimate intention.

4. The framework achieves high accuracy (80-95%) and time efficiency in determining fake image services on real datasets.

In summary, the key innovation is using only non-functional attributes and formalizing the notion of intention to identify fake image services, without needing to process the actual image content. This allows a lightweight and efficient approach. The accuracy results on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
