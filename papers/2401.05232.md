# [Measuring Natural Scenes SFR of Automotive Fisheye Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05232)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Image quality metrics like Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) are important for computer vision performance, but are often unknown for public datasets, especially for wide field-of-view (FOV) automotive cameras. 
- Existing methods like ISO 12233 Slanted Edge rely on test charts, which are difficult to replicate across datasets. 
- The Natural Scenes Spatial Frequency Response (NS-SFR) avoids test charts but has limitations analyzing wide FOV images with ego-vehicle occlusion and vignetting.

Proposed Solution:
- Apply regional masking to remove ego-vehicle occlusion and vignetting from wide FOV images.  
- Develop a valid/invalid ROI selection system to select edges with minimal noise and enhancement.
- Propose an Adaptive Radial Distance Analysis to evaluate image quality in radial segments adapted to the image regions.
- Analyze multiple real and simulated dynamic driving datasets with FOVs from 90° to 190°.

Main Contributions:
1. Regional masking around scenes in wide FOV images
2. Valid/invalid ROI Selection System for clean edge selection 
3. Adaptive Radial Distance Analysis customized to regional masks
4. First analysis of multiple automotive datasets using adapted NS-SFR

The adapted NS-SFR framework was demonstrated on four driving datasets, analyzing the spatial distribution and image quality of selected edges. The analysis showed scene-dependent patterns in edge selection. The real-world 190° FOV Woodscape dataset provided the best MTF measurements overall, with quality degrading towards the center of wide FOV images.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes adaptations to the Natural Scenes Spatial Frequency Response algorithm to measure image quality across automotive datasets with varying fields of view, including regional masking to isolate the natural scene, an automated region of interest selection system, and an analysis using adaptive radial segments adapted to each camera's perspective.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing adaptations to the Natural Scenes Spatial Frequency Response (NS-SFR) algorithm to measure the image quality of automotive datasets, particularly for wide field-of-view cameras. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing regional masking around scenes in wide FOV images to remove ego-vehicle occlusion and mechanical vignetting. 

2) Proposing a valid and invalid Region of Interest (ROI) selection system to choose edges with minimal edge enhancement and noise.

3) Proposing an Adaptive Radial Distance Analysis to evaluate optical measurements with radial segments adapted to the regional mask of the scene.

4) Providing the first analysis across multiple dynamic automotive scenes where each scene has a unique camera lens, including real-life datasets with 90°, 185°, and 190° FOV and a simulated 190° FOV dataset.

In summary, the main contribution is adapting the NS-SFR algorithm to measure the optical quality of automotive datasets, especially for wide field-of-view cameras, by addressing challenges like removing ego-vehicle occlusion and analyzing quality in the radially distorted image.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using regional masking around scenes in wide FOV images to remove ego-vehicle occlusion and mechanical vignetting. What is the rationale behind this pre-processing step and how does it help improve the adapted NS-SFR method?

2. The paper categorizes the ROI locations into center, middle, and edge regions using adaptive radial distances. How are these adaptive radial distances calculated? What is the intuition behind having 3 categories instead of more granular categorization? 

3. The paper reuses the optimized NS-SFR algorithm with some changes to parameters like contrast range and edge angle range. Why were these specific parameters changed compared to default values? How do these parameters impact the quality of slanted edge selection?

4. The paper applies additional constraints of local maxima < 1.4 SFR and local minima < 0.4 SFR to identify valid ROIs. What is the reasoning behind choosing these specific thresholds? How do they help eliminate noisy or enhanced edges?  

5. For the KITTI dataset experiments, what differences do you observe in the spatial distribution of selected edges and mean MTF compared to wide FOV datasets? What factors contribute to these differences?

6. Between the 4 datasets analyzed, which one had the best slanted edge selection in terms of density and measured MTF50? What scene properties or other factors could explain this? 

7. What impact does the choice of ST and esfW parameters have on the slanted edge selection process? How did the selections differ for Woodscape vs SynWoodscape using the same parameters?

8. What trends do you observe in the MTF50 measurements across radial segments, especially from center to periphery of images? What optical factors might explain this radial fall-off in sharpness?

9. How does the distribution of selected edges in the LMS dataset differ from the other 3? Why does it show poorer MTF50 despite higher density of selected edges?

10. The paper mentions applying automated regional masking using techniques like in Hogan et al. How can this be implemented? What challenges need to be addressed in automating custom regional masks?
