# [CORP: A Multi-Modal Dataset for Campus-Oriented Roadside Perception   Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03191)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Existing roadside perception datasets focus primarily on urban roads and traffic, overlooking campus/residential areas which have different characteristics (more pedestrians/bikes, irregular layouts, lack of traffic rules).  
- When state-of-the-art urban roadside perception models are tested on a real campus setting, they fail to effectively distinguish objects from background elements like vegetation. This indicates a need to improve generalization capability.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose CORP, the first large-scale, multi-modal roadside perception dataset tailored for campus scenarios.  
- CORP contains over 205k images and 102k point clouds captured by diverse cameras and LiDARs mounted on roadside poles across a university campus.
- The campus area is divided into 3 regions with different sensor layouts based on complexity.
- Precise annotations are provided including 2D/3D boxes, pixel masks for moving instances, and cross-device tracking IDs.

Key Contributions:
- CORP serves as a valuable benchmark to facilitate multi-modal perception research in campus/residential settings.
- It is the first campus-based roadside dataset with pixel-level segmentation and seamless tracking across devices.
- Baseline experiments identify distinct challenges compared to urban roadside perception, such as accurately distinguishing objects from lush vegetation. 
- A learning-free distance estimation method is proposed and outperforms IPM baseline.

In summary, CORP pushes roadside perception research beyond high-density urban areas to diverse campus environments, supporting advanced tasks with its rich annotations. Initial experiments expose the challenges in this domain compared to traditional urban roadside perception.
