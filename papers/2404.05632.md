# [Fighting crime with Transformers: Empirical analysis of address parsing   methods in payment data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05632)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In financial transactions, identifying location of parties involved is critical for regulatory compliance. Address parsing from free text is needed to extract fields like street, postal code, city, country. 
- While new payment standards have structured address formats, large volume of messages still have addresses in free text form. Existing solutions have limitations in robustness, domain, or country coverage.

Proposed Solution:
- Create open-sourced augmented dataset based on real payment data to enable research on noisy transactional addresses. 
- Empirically analyze and compare various techniques like rule-based, CRFs, LSTM, Transformers, and generative language models.
- Develop customized Transformer model using early stopping and cross-entropy loss to get state-of-the-art performance.

Key Contributions:
- Augmented multinational address parsing dataset for payment data
- Analysis and benchmarking of address parsing techniques on distorted financial data
- State-of-the-art customized Transformer model for production systems, outperforming other approaches
- Analysis showing potential of generative models like Llama and Mistral for zero-shot performance
- Open-sourced data, models, and code to advance research and applications in address parsing

In summary, the paper tackles address parsing on noisy payment data by creating a robust dataset and model, benchmarking various techniques, and showing promise of generative language models. The open-sourced resources significantly advance research for practical applications across industries.
