# [Learn To be Efficient: Build Structured Sparsity in Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06126)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and OPT have achieved remarkable success but also incur extremely high inference costs due to their billion-scale parameters. Existing methods utilize the naturally occurring activation sparsity in LLMs to accelerate inference, but overlook the potential to further amplify this inherent sparsity. Moreover, they require replacing soft activations with ReLU, which can hurt performance.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Learn-To-Be-Efficient (LTE), a novel training algorithm that enables LLMs to learn structured sparsity awareness for efficient inference. LTE trains an additional efficiency loss to encourage models to activate fewer neurons. It also employs a threshold-based sigmoid routing strategy and a two-stage training process to train routers more stably. Unlike prior works, LTE works for both ReLU and soft-activation models.

Key Contributions:
- Propose LTE, a new method to train efficiency-aware LLMs with more structured sparsity for fast inference
- Introduce an efficiency loss term that enables models to activate fewer neurons with marginal accuracy drops
- Design a threshold-based sigmoid routing for flexible expert selection instead of a fixed number
- Achieve 1.83-2.59x FLOPs reductions on LLaMA via LTE, outperforming state-of-the-arts

In summary, this paper presents Learn-To-Be-Efficient to effectively build structured sparsity in LLMs by training them to be efficiency-aware, achieving better trade-offs between accuracy and inference efficiency. Evaluations on various datasets and models demonstrate the efficiency improvement of LTE over state-of-the-art methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel algorithm called Learn-To-be-Efficient (LTE) to train large language models to achieve more structured activation sparsity in feed-forward network layers, enabling faster inference while preserving task performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel algorithm called Learn To be Efficient (LTE) to train large language models (LLMs) to achieve more structured activation sparsity for faster inference. Specifically:

- LTE introduces an efficiency loss penalty during training to encourage LLMs to activate fewer neurons in feedforward network layers while preserving performance. This helps LLMs learn to be more efficient.

- LTE employs a threshold-based sigmoid routing strategy and a two-stage training mechanism to select experts more adaptively and stably convert pretrained LLM feedforward layers into mixture-of-experts layers.

- LTE can be applied to LLMs with both ReLU and soft activation functions like GPT and LLaMA, unlike prior work on MoEfication that focuses mainly on ReLU models.

- Extensive experiments on 4 LLMs and 11 datasets demonstrate LTE consistently achieves better tradeoffs between sparsity and quality than baselines. For example, LTE provides 1.83-2.59x FLOPs speedups for LLaMA on language generation tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the LTE algorithm to train efficiency-aware LLMs that learn structured sparsity for faster inference while preserving quality.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an efficiency loss penalty to introduce competition among experts and drive routers to distinguish the importance of different experts. What other techniques could be used to achieve a similar effect of distinguishing expert importance during router training?

2. The paper adopts a two-stage training approach - first joint training the model and routers, then freezing routers to train the model. What are the trade-offs with end-to-end joint training of both components together? Could any optimizations help stabilize such end-to-end training?

3. The threshold-based routing strategy adaptively selects experts based on the router outputs. How sensitive is model performance to the choice of threshold value? Are there techniques to automatically determine a good threshold per layer? 

4. The paper hypothesizes that models can learn to be efficient via structured sparsity objectives. Are there any insights into what the models are specifically learning to achieve this? E.g. are certain pathways being pruned or is redundancy being introduced?

5. How does the inductive bias from pretraining affect model amenability to efficiency optimization objectives? Do models with certain architectural attributes optimize better for efficiency?

6. The efficiency loss drives competition across layers, but all layers still maintain high overall sparsity. Are there ways to specialize different layers for efficiency vs accuracy to get better trade-offs? 

7. The expert grouping uses parameter clustering of weights. How does this compare to other possible grouping techniques like clustering neuron activations or gradients?

8. The routers use a simple single layer design. What is the impact of using more complex, multi-layer routers instead? Is there a sweet spot in terms of router model capacity?

9. The method focuses on sparsifying FeedForward layers. What is the relative importance of also sparsifying attention or other components for overall efficiency gains?

10. The evaluations are on a limited set of datasets and models. How do the efficiency vs accuracy trade-offs generalize to other data domains and model sizes or architectures?
