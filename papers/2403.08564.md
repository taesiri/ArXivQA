# [Non-discrimination Criteria for Generative Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08564)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the issue of bias, specifically gender bias, in generative AI models such as large language models. As these models are trained on real-world data, they tend to amplify existing societal biases. The authors highlight the need for methods to systematically uncover and quantify bias in generative models. 

Proposed Solution  
The main contribution is the proposal of quantitative criteria for bias assessment in generative models, adapted from well-established non-discrimination criteria used for classifiers: independence, separation, and sufficiency. The criteria are reinterpreted to enable statistical quantification of bias from free-form textual outputs of generative models.  

The independence criterion compares selection rates between groups, separation compares error rates, and sufficiency compares predictive values. Prompts are carefully designed to elicit responses that can be categorized and analyzed with respect to these criteria. The prompts focus on occupational gender stereotypes. 

Results
Experiments on GPT models demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed criteria for quantifying different aspects of bias from free-form outputs. The results confirm substantial gender bias in the models related to occupations, interests, and gender perceptions in healthcare. The analysis also shows that the different criteria capture complementary information about model biases. Additionally, bias is shown to increase from GPT 3.5 to later GPT versions.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in formally extending non-discrimination criteria to enable quantitative bias assessments for generative AI, and demonstrates their usefulness on state-of-the-art models. The analysis reveals significant continuing issues with gender biases.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes methods to quantify gender bias in generative AI by generalizing three non-discrimination criteria from classification models - independence, separation, and sufficiency - designs prompts to demonstrate occupational gender stereotypes, and shows that GPT models exhibit and even amplify such biases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose methods for quantifying gender bias in generative AI models by adopting and reinterpreting three well-known non-discrimination criteria from classification models: independence, separation, and sufficiency. This enables statistical bias assessment that goes beyond simple selection rates.

2. They design prompts focused on occupational gender stereotypes to demonstrate the proposed criteria. The prompts utilize questions from a medical exam (MedQA-USMLE) to establish ground truth, combined with gendered references to individuals answering the questions. 

3. Their results on GPT models show that the models amplify real-world biases, consistent with overfitting behavior. They also find that while generalized separation and sufficiency capture information about the same types of biases, they are sensitized differently. Using them together thus provides a more thorough bias assessment.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing adapted non-discrimination criteria for generative AI, designing tailored prompts to demonstrate them, and showing that these criteria can effectively quantify different aspects of gender bias in language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Generative AI/generative language models: The paper focuses on evaluating bias and fairness in generative AI systems like large language models. This is a key focus.

- Non-discrimination criteria: The paper proposes adopting the three well-known non-discrimination criteria from classification models (independence, separation, and sufficiency) to generative AI to enable statistical bias quantification.  

- Prompt design: The paper discusses different approaches to prompt design to elicit biased responses from models, including open-ended prompts and prompts with expected outputs to establish a "ground truth."

- Occupational gender stereotypes: Much of the prompt design focuses on occupational roles and gender stereotypes related to certain professions being perceived as masculine or feminine.  

- Bias measurement: Key goals are measuring gender bias in model outputs through the lens of the three non-discrimination criteria. Things like mutual information, false positive/negative rates, and predictive values are calculated.

- Model comparisons: An analysis is done comparing bias in GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4-turbo models.

Does this summary appropriately capture some of the core terminology and concepts discussed in the paper? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes generative AI analogies of three classical statistical non-discrimination criteria - independence, separation, and sufficiency. Can you elaborate on how each of these criteria were adapted to the generative AI context? What new definitions were proposed?

2. Template prompt #1 illustrates how model outputs can be partitioned to enable an equalized odds assessment. Can you walk through how the variables Y, A, and C were defined in this prompt and how they enabled the calculation of false positive and false negative rates? 

3. What were some key differences between the two types of prompts designed - ones with open-ended responses versus ones with an expected correct response? How did these prompt types link to different non-discrimination criteria?

4. When evaluating independence for occupational gender stereotypes, normalized mutual information was used as the metric. Can you explain what this metric represents and why it was an appropriate choice to quantify dependence between profession and gender?

5. The paper argues that generalized separation and sufficiency criteria, while carrying information about the same types of biases, are sensitive to biases in different ways. Can you expand on some examples that illustrate how the two criteria capture nuances of unfairness differently?

6. What were some advantages of focusing the prompts specifically on occupational gender stereotypes? How did this context enable testing of specific hypotheses around gender biases held by the models? 

7. The DeBERTa model was used for zero-shot classification of the open-ended responses on high school student hobbies/interests. What was the intuition behind choosing the six candidate labels used?

8. In the across-models comparison focused on high school interests, sentence scores were computed using word embeddings and projections. Can you walk through the details of how these scalar projections were calculated? What information did they capture about gender polarity?

9. One experiment result was that model performance decreased substantially when counter-stereotypical gender assignments were made in the prompts. What might be some reasons driving this performance gap? 

10. The paper argues that fairness of newer models does not necessarily improve over time. What results support this argument? Why might this be happening with sequential updates to foundation models?
