# [Long-Term Photometric Consistent Novel View Synthesis with Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10700)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is: 

How can we develop a generative model that is able to produce a sequence of photorealistic novel views from a single input view and desired camera trajectory, while ensuring consistency between the generated views?

The key points are:

- The paper focuses on the challenging task of novel view synthesis from a single input image, where the goal is to generate new views separated by large motions. This is called view extrapolation.

- Existing methods have limitations in generating consistent and photorealistic novel views, especially for large motions.

- The paper proposes a novel generative model based on diffusion models that can sample multiple plausible and consistent novel views by conditioning on a single input view and the relative camera poses.

- The model uses a specialized architecture with geometry-aware conditioning to ensure consistency between views.

- They introduce a new metric called Thresholded Symmetric Epipolar Distance (TSED) to directly measure the geometric consistency between generated views based on epipolar geometry, independent of image quality.

- Experiments show their method generates more photorealistic and geometrically consistent views compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, even for novel camera trajectories not seen during training.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that a properly designed conditional diffusion model with explicit geometric conditioning can generate consistent and high-quality novel views from a single image across large viewpoint changes. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a novel method for long-term photorealistic novel view synthesis from a single input image. The key contributions are:

- They propose a conditional diffusion model for novel view synthesis that can generate multiple plausible and consistent novel views from a single image conditioned on the relative camera pose. 

- The model uses a two-stream architecture with cross-attention to process the conditioning image and novel view which improves consistency.

- They introduce a new metric called Thresholded Symmetric Epipolar Distance (TSED) to quantitatively measure the geometric consistency of generated views based on feature matching and epipolar geometry.

- Experiments demonstrate their method generates more photorealistic and geometrically consistent views compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, especially for longer trajectories and out-of-distribution camera motions. 

- They show the ability of their method to generate consistent image sequences even when the final frame has little overlap with the initial conditioning image.

In summary, the key contribution is a conditional diffusion model architecture and training approach that can generate multiple plausible and geometrically consistent novel views for long trajectories from just a single image. The proposed TSED metric allows measuring consistency independent of image quality.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel generative model based on diffusion models that can sample multiple photorealistic and geometrically consistent novel views of a scene from a single input image and specified camera poses.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in novel view synthesis:

- The paper focuses on the challenging setting of generating novel views from a single input image, where large portions of the output view are disoccluded and not visible in the input. This is more difficult than the typical novel view synthesis setting where multiple input views are available.

- Most prior work has focused on view interpolation, where novel views remain close to the input views. This paper tackles the extrapolation case where there can be large viewpoint changes.

- The paper proposes using conditional diffusion models, which is a relatively new generative modeling approach. Most prior work has used other types of generative models like GANs or autoregressive models. The diffusion modeling approach seems well-suited to capturing the inherent uncertainty in the view extrapolation problem.

- A key contribution is the introduction of a new consistency metric called TSED that directly measures how well generated views respect the provided camera geometry, independent of image quality. Most prior metrics focus only on image quality.

- The experiments demonstrate advantages over strong baselines like GeoGPT and LookOut in terms of both image quality and consistency. The ablation studies also validate the design choices made in the diffusion modeling approach.

- The paper studies generalization by evaluating on novel camera trajectories not seen during training. Most prior work has only considered in-distribution trajectories.

- The focus is on indoor scene view extrapolation which is more complex and practically relevant compared to other domains like objects or faces.

Overall, the paper makes nice contributions in terms of the problem setting, technical approach, evaluation metrics, and experiments studied. The proposed diffusion model approach seems to advance the state-of-the-art in this challenging single-view novel view synthesis domain.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Investigating conditioning on more source views during generation. The paper notes limitations from only conditioning on a single source image, and suggests conditioning on an arbitrary number of frames could help maintain consistency for disoccluded regions. Developing models that can leverage multiple source views remains an open challenge.

- Generalizing to large scenes with complex geometry. The paper focuses on indoor scenes, but suggests extending the approach to outdoor scenes with more complex geometry as future work.

- Developing alternatives to autoregressive sampling. The paper notes issues arising from the sequential nature of autoregressive generation, such as accumulation of errors over long trajectories. Exploring non-autoregressive or latent variable models is suggested as an avenue for future work. 

- Incorporating explicit 3D scene representations. The authors note concurrent work exploring explicit 3D scene representations to help enforce consistency. Integrating these types of structured representations into the model could be a promising direction.

- Applying the ideas to related domains like novel view synthesis for human bodies. The method is presented for general scenes, but could likely be adapted to human-centric view synthesis tasks.

- Scaling up the model and training methodology. The paper focuses on 256x256 resolution images. Scaling up the model and training data could allow for higher resolution image generation.

In summary, some of the key future directions mentioned are: leveraging multiple source views, generalizing to more complex scenes, alternatives to autoregressive sampling, using explicit 3D representations, applying the approach to related tasks, and scaling up the models. The paper provides a strong proof-of-concept but highlights many interesting avenues for extending the work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel generative model for photorealistic novel view synthesis from a single input image. The goal is to generate plausible and consistent image sequences along specified camera trajectories, even when large portions of the scene are unobserved in the input view. The authors formulate this as learning the conditional distribution over novel views given an input image and relative camera pose. They utilize a conditional denoising diffusion model capable of interpolating visible elements and extrapolating unobserved regions in a geometrically consistent manner. The model uses a two-stream architecture with cross-attention to process the input and output views jointly. To evaluate consistency, they propose a new metric called thresholded symmetric epipolar distance (TSED) based on feature matching and epipolar geometry. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the method can generate high quality novel views that are more consistent than prior image-to-image and video prediction baselines. The model also shows improved generalization to novel camera motions compared to prior work.
