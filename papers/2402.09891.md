# [Predictors from causal features do not generalize better to new domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09891)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies whether machine learning models trained on causal features generalize better across domains compared to models trained on all features. The ability to generalize to new domains is an important capability for machine learning models. Some researchers believe that models utilizing causal relationships may generalize better since causal mechanisms tend to be more stable across different environments. This paper empirically tests this hypothesis.

Methodology: 
The authors consider 16 prediction tasks on tabular datasets covering applications in health, employment, education, social benefits, and politics. For each task, they manually label features as either causal, arguably causal or anti-causal based on domain knowledge and advice from experts. Causal features have a clear causal influence on the target variable. Arguably causal features have a plausible but uncertain causal relationship. Anti-causal features are caused by the target variable. The tasks have predefined shifts across domains.

For each task, the authors compare the in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy of models trained on different feature sets: all features, causal features, arguably causal features and anti-causal features. They also evaluate special-purpose causal machine learning methods like Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM). A total of 38K models were trained.

Key Results:
- Models using all features had the best in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy in all 16 tasks. Causal features performed worse.
- The drop in accuracy from in-domain to out-of-domain was smaller for models with all features compared to causal models. 
- Adding anti-causal features to causal features improved out-of-domain performance.
- Causal machine learning methods mostly performed similar to models trained only on causal features.
- The conclusions were robust to potential mislabelings of single features.

Main Contributions:
- First large-scale empirical study evaluating if causal features generalize better out-of-domain on real-world tabular datasets.
- Key finding across 16 datasets that models using all features had better accuracy than causal models, contradicting common beliefs.
- Highlights difficulty of effectively applying causal modeling for better domain generalization in practice.
