# [Version age-based client scheduling policy for federated learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Federated learning (FL) involves collaborative training of a global model across multiple clients without sharing local data. However, communication bottlenecks mean only a subset of clients can update parameters upon each aggregation, leading to the issue of stragglers. Existing client scheduling strategies in FL predominantly focus on either timeliness of updates or content staleness, but not both.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces the concept of Version Age of Information (VAoI) to FL. Unlike traditional Age of Information metrics that only consider timeliness, VAoI accounts for both timeliness and content staleness. Each client's version age is updated discretely to indicate information freshness. A higher version age means lower timeliness and higher content staleness. The scheduling policy aims to minimize the average VAoI of the system.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces the concept of VAoI to FL which considers both timeliness and content staleness, unlike prior works. 
- Proposes a scheduling policy that selects clients based on their VAoI to minimize the average VAoI of the system. This enhances model convergence and stability.
- Validates the effectiveness of the VAoI-based scheduling through simulations on CIFAR-100 dataset. Results show higher test accuracy and lower average VAoI compared to standard Federated Averaging.
- Demonstrates VAoI can serve as a valid metric to evaluate effectiveness and stability of federated systems.

In summary, the key novelty is the introduction and application of VAoI for client scheduling in FL to address limitations of prior arts and enhance system performance. Both timeliness and content are jointly considered for scheduling through the VAoI metric.
