# [Some Might Say All You Need Is Sum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11603)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research focus of this paper seems to be examining the expressive power and limitations of graph neural networks (GNNs) with different aggregation functions, specifically sum, mean, and max aggregation. Some key questions the paper seems to address are:- Do GNNs with sum aggregation subsume/approximate the expressivity of mean and max aggregation GNNs?- Are there functions that can be computed exactly with mean or max aggregation but cannot be approximated by sum aggregation GNNs?- How does the expressive power compare between these aggregation functions in different settings like bounded vs unbounded input features?- Can sum aggregation combined with other aggregations like mean or max express functions not achievable by sum alone?- What are the limitations in expressive power even for GNNs with multiple aggregation functions?So in summary, the main focus seems to be theoretically characterizing and comparing the expressive capabilities of GNNs with different aggregation functions, especially sum, mean, and max, under various conditions.
