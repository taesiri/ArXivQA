# [ScaleDet: A Scalable Multi-Dataset Object Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04849)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to train an object detector that can effectively leverage multiple heterogeneous datasets in order to improve generalization performance. Specifically, the paper proposes a new method called ScaleDet for scalable multi-dataset object detection. The key hypothesis is that by unifying the label spaces of different datasets into a single semantic label space and learning visual-textual alignments, ScaleDet can effectively learn across diverse datasets and generalize well to both upstream and downstream datasets.The research questions examined in this paper include:- How can we unify the heterogeneous label spaces of different datasets in a scalable way? The paper proposes using semantic text embeddings and concatenating label sets.- How can we train a single detector effectively on the unified label space? The paper proposes hard and soft label assignments for visual-textual alignment. - Does ScaleDet improve in performance as more datasets are used for training? Experiments show consistent gains as more datasets are added.- How does ScaleDet compare to state-of-the-art single dataset detectors and other multi-dataset methods? Experiments demonstrate ScaleDet achieves new state-of-the-art results on COCO and other benchmarks.- Does ScaleDet transfer well to diverse unseen downstream datasets? Results on the challenging ODinW benchmark containing 13 unseen datasets show strong performance.In summary, the central hypothesis is that visual-textual alignment on a unified semantic label space can enable effective multi-dataset learning for object detection. The paper provides extensive experimental validation of this idea and the proposed ScaleDet method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a scalable multi-dataset object detector called ScaleDet. The main contributions are:1. ScaleDet introduces a simple yet scalable formulation to unify the label spaces of multiple datasets by concatenating them and relating the labels with semantic similarities derived from text embeddings. This avoids the need for manual relabeling or merging labels across datasets. 2. ScaleDet is trained with a novel loss formulation that includes hard label assignment to disambiguate labels and soft label assignment to relate labels based on their semantic similarity. This enables effective learning across datasets in the unified label space.3. Experiments demonstrate the scalability of ScaleDet - its performance consistently improves as more datasets are added for training. ScaleDet achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple upstream datasets like LVIS, COCO, Objects365, OpenImages and downstream datasets in Object Detection in the Wild benchmark.4. Compared to other multi-dataset detectors, ScaleDet requires less training data and learns fewer concepts, yet attains better generalization. This demonstrates the efficacy of its training formulation and the unified semantic label space for scalable learning across datasets.In summary, the key innovation of ScaleDet is its simple yet scalable training recipe that can effectively learn across multiple datasets in a unified semantic label space. This enables ScaleDet to improve its generalization as more datasets are used for training.
