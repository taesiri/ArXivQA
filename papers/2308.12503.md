# CGMI: Configurable General Multi-Agent Interaction Framework

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop a configurable multi-agent interaction framework that can simulate complex social phenomena by enabling anthropomorphic interactions and collaborations between agents?In particular, the paper seems to focus on addressing three key challenges:1) How to trigger the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT to solve complex societal problems through multi-agent interactions? 2) How to ensure agents have stable roles and behaviors when using LLMs, without forgetting or becoming inconsistent over long conversations?3) How to design a communication mechanism for LLM-based agents to truly simulate collaborative human-like interactions?To address these challenges, the paper introduces the Configurable General Multi-Agent Interaction (CGMI) framework. The goal is to develop agents that can replicate human social interactions and collaborations in virtual scenarios like classrooms. The central hypothesis appears to be that by equipping agents with human-like qualities (e.g. personality, skills, memory, cognition), and allowing flexible configurations of agent roles and interactions, the CGMI framework can enable more realistic multi-agent simulations of complex social phenomena compared to existing approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The introduction of a cognitive architecture equipped with a skill library for agents. This combines human cognition and skill library retrieval to enable agents to engage in deeper reflection and planning. 2. A tree-structured approach for assigning, detecting and maintaining personal traits of agents. This reduces memory pressure on agents and improves stability.3. The construction of a Configurable General Multi-Agent Interaction (CGMI) framework that supports simulating social phenomena in specific scenarios by coordinating interactions between role agents and general agents.In summary, the key contributions are:- A cognitive architecture with skill library for deeper agent reflection and planning- A tree-structured model for agent personality assignment, detection and maintenance - A CGMI framework for simulating scenario-specific social interactions using configurable general and role agentsThe core ideas are developing more human-like agents via cognitive architectures and personas, and using these advanced agents within a flexible multi-agent framework to recreate realistic social scenarios like classrooms. This enables new possibilities for social simulation, training and research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a Configurable General Multi-Agent Interaction (CGMI) framework to simulate human interactions in real-world scenarios by assigning unique personas to agents, equipping them with a cognitive architecture and skill library, and integrating general assistant agents to support role agents in accomplishing domain-specific tasks.
