# [Custom-Edit: Text-Guided Image Editing with Customized Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15779)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve precise text-guided image editing using customized diffusion models. Specifically, the paper proposes "Custom-Edit", a two-step approach involving:1) Customizing a diffusion model using a few reference images by optimizing only the language-relevant parameters (custom embedding and attention weights).2) Performing text-guided editing on source images using the customized model. The key hypothesis is that customizing only the language-relevant parameters with augmented prompts will significantly improve the model's ability to transfer visual concepts from the reference images to the source images during text-guided editing. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of Custom-Edit's customization approach and editing methods compared to other baselines. The results support the hypothesis that customizing only language-relevant parameters leads to better preservation of reference similarity while maintaining source similarity during editing.In summary, the central research question is how to achieve precise text-guided image editing through customization, and the key hypothesis is that optimizing only language-relevant parameters is crucial for transferring visual concepts from references to sources. The proposed Custom-Edit approach aims to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Custom-Edit, a two-step approach for high-fidelity text-guided image editing using customized diffusion models. The key ideas are:- Customize a diffusion model using a few reference images by only training the language-relevant parameters (custom embedding and attention weights). This allows transferring the visual concepts from the references to source images. - Utilize text-guided editing methods like Prompt-to-Prompt and SDEdit on the customized model. This allows editing the source image to match the text description while preserving source content.- Discover that customizing only language-relevant parameters significantly improves reference similarity compared to full fine-tuning approaches like Dreambooth. - Provide design choices and recipes for the customization and editing processes. For example, using prompt refinement instead of word swap in P2P produces better results.- Analyze the source-reference similarity trade-off in diffusion-based image editing. Higher strength leads to higher source or reference similarity in P2P and SDEdit respectively.In summary, the key contribution is presenting Custom-Edit, a new approach for high-fidelity text-guided image editing using customized diffusion models. The paper provides insights into how to effectively customize and edit with diffusion models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes Custom-Edit, a two-step approach for high-fidelity text-guided image editing that first customizes a diffusion model on a few reference images by training only language-relevant parameters, and then applies effective editing techniques like Prompt-to-Prompt while controlling the trade-off between maintaining source similarity and achieving reference similarity.
