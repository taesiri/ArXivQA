# [Custom-Edit: Text-Guided Image Editing with Customized Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15779)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve precise text-guided image editing using customized diffusion models. 

Specifically, the paper proposes "Custom-Edit", a two-step approach involving:

1) Customizing a diffusion model using a few reference images by optimizing only the language-relevant parameters (custom embedding and attention weights).

2) Performing text-guided editing on source images using the customized model. 

The key hypothesis is that customizing only the language-relevant parameters with augmented prompts will significantly improve the model's ability to transfer visual concepts from the reference images to the source images during text-guided editing. 

The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of Custom-Edit's customization approach and editing methods compared to other baselines. The results support the hypothesis that customizing only language-relevant parameters leads to better preservation of reference similarity while maintaining source similarity during editing.

In summary, the central research question is how to achieve precise text-guided image editing through customization, and the key hypothesis is that optimizing only language-relevant parameters is crucial for transferring visual concepts from references to sources. The proposed Custom-Edit approach aims to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Custom-Edit, a two-step approach for high-fidelity text-guided image editing using customized diffusion models. The key ideas are:

- Customize a diffusion model using a few reference images by only training the language-relevant parameters (custom embedding and attention weights). This allows transferring the visual concepts from the references to source images. 

- Utilize text-guided editing methods like Prompt-to-Prompt and SDEdit on the customized model. This allows editing the source image to match the text description while preserving source content.

- Discover that customizing only language-relevant parameters significantly improves reference similarity compared to full fine-tuning approaches like Dreambooth. 

- Provide design choices and recipes for the customization and editing processes. For example, using prompt refinement instead of word swap in P2P produces better results.

- Analyze the source-reference similarity trade-off in diffusion-based image editing. Higher strength leads to higher source or reference similarity in P2P and SDEdit respectively.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting Custom-Edit, a new approach for high-fidelity text-guided image editing using customized diffusion models. The paper provides insights into how to effectively customize and edit with diffusion models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes Custom-Edit, a two-step approach for high-fidelity text-guided image editing that first customizes a diffusion model on a few reference images by training only language-relevant parameters, and then applies effective editing techniques like Prompt-to-Prompt while controlling the trade-off between maintaining source similarity and achieving reference similarity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on text-guided image editing and diffusion model customization:

- The main contribution is using diffusion model customization as a preprocessing step before text-guided editing. Most prior work has focused on just one of these areas. Combining both allows more precise editing guided by user-provided reference images.

- For customization, they only fine-tune the text embeddings and attention weights rather than the full model like in DreamBooth. This makes customization more efficient and helps preserve the original capabilities. 

- For editing, they adapt Prompt-to-Prompt and compare to other methods like SDEdit. Their approach of only using prompt refinement and source image masks leads to better preservation of the source image structure.

- They perform extensive experiments to analyze tradeoffs, like between source vs. reference similarity. This provides insights into controlling the strength of customization and editing. 

- The approach is demonstrated on diverse image types - pets, objects, artwork. But there are some limitations like inaccurately editing background regions.

- Overall, the paper makes nice connections between customization and editing. The two-step framework allows for precise editing control via reference images. The analysis provides concrete guidance on model customization for editing tasks.

In summary, the paper combines and adapts recent advances in diffusion model customization and text-guided editing. The experiments offer insights into the tradeoffs and design choices involved in using customization to enhance editing precision. The framework and analysis help advance research at the intersection of these two areas.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Applying Custom-Edit on text-to-image models with larger text encoders (e.g. Imagen) or extended controllability (e.g. GLIGEN) to improve editing of complex scenes and backgrounds. The limitations of Stable Diffusion's attention maps and text controllability contributed to some failure cases. 

- Exploring other methods to balance the source-reference tradeoff, which is a key challenge in image editing. The authors empirically found certain strength parameters that worked well, but more principled approaches could help users better control this tradeoff.

- Experimenting with other text-guided editing methods in the editing process beyond P2P and SDEdit. The authors provide a good recipe for choosing prompt refinement over word swap and using only source masks, but other techniques may further improve editing.

- Evaluating the effectiveness of only training language-relevant parameters with more model architectures and datasets. This is a core contribution of the paper, so validating this finding more extensively could be impactful.

- Developing better quantitative evaluation metrics and datasets for image editing tasks, to complement the qualitative results and CLIP similarity metrics used in the paper.

- Exploring interactive or iterative editing interfaces building on Custom-Edit, to allow users to efficiently refine the editing process.

In summary, the key directions are improving controllability and editing quality, systematically evaluating design choices, and developing more advanced interfaces and metrics for text-guided image editing. The Custom-Edit approach shows promise but can benefit from future work in these areas.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Custom-Edit for high-fidelity text-guided image editing using diffusion models. Custom-Edit involves two main steps: (1) Customizing the diffusion model on a few reference images by fine-tuning only the language-relevant parameters related to the text embedding and attention. This allows the model to learn the visual concepts from the references. (2) Performing text-guided editing on a source image using methods like Prompt-to-Prompt or SDEdit. The customized model from step 1 allows the text guidance to better capture the visual details from the references. 

The key findings are: Customizing only the language-relevant parts of the model is crucial for transferring visual concepts from references while maintaining language understanding. Using modifier tokens in prompts helps focus the model on learning the appearance. Controlling the editing strength balances similarity to the source vs reference. Comparisons to baselines like Dreambooth and Textual Inversion validate the effectiveness of the proposed Custom-Edit approach for high-fidelity editing guided by text and reference images. Limitations include issues with complex backgrounds and attention map inaccuracies. Overall, Custom-Edit enables precise image editing based on user-provided visual references.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes Custom-Edit, a two-step approach for text-guided image editing using diffusion models. The key steps are:

1) Customization: The diffusion model is customized on a few reference images by only training the language-relevant parameters - the text embeddings and attention weights. This allows the model to learn the visual concepts in the references while preserving its language understanding capability. Augmented prompts with modifiers are used to focus learning on the appearance. A prior preservation loss maintains the original capabilities. 

2) Editing: The customized model is used to edit a source image given a textual prompt, using methods like Prompt-to-Prompt or SDEdit. Attention injection and null-text inversion help preserve source structure and similarity. The trade-off between source and reference similarity can be controlled by tuning the editing strength. Qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the effectiveness of customizing only language-relevant parameters and the overall editing approach.

In summary, the key idea is to customize a diffusion model on references by training only language-relevant parts, and then leverage the customized model for precise text-guided editing of images. The method allows transferring fine-grained visual concepts from references to sources using just a few examples and text prompts.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper proposes a method called Custom-Edit for high-fidelity text-guided image editing given a few reference images. The key problem it aims to address is:

- How to perform precise image editing according to a user's complex visual instructions, conveyed through reference images rather than just text prompts. 

The paper argues that directly using text prompts for editing often fails to capture the precise appearance desired by the user, as shown in their Figure 1. To address this, Custom-Edit consists of two main steps:

1) Customizing a diffusion model using a few reference images, to teach it the desired fine-grained visual concepts. 

2) Performing text-guided editing on source images using the customized model, to transfer the reference visual concepts while preserving source structure.

So in summary, this paper tackles the problem of how to enable precise text-guided image editing according to complex user instructions given through reference images. It proposes customizing diffusion models as a way to teach them complex visual concepts for more controllable and high-fidelity editing guided by text prompts.
