# [Custom-Edit: Text-Guided Image Editing with Customized Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15779)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve precise text-guided image editing using customized diffusion models. Specifically, the paper proposes "Custom-Edit", a two-step approach involving:1) Customizing a diffusion model using a few reference images by optimizing only the language-relevant parameters (custom embedding and attention weights).2) Performing text-guided editing on source images using the customized model. The key hypothesis is that customizing only the language-relevant parameters with augmented prompts will significantly improve the model's ability to transfer visual concepts from the reference images to the source images during text-guided editing. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of Custom-Edit's customization approach and editing methods compared to other baselines. The results support the hypothesis that customizing only language-relevant parameters leads to better preservation of reference similarity while maintaining source similarity during editing.In summary, the central research question is how to achieve precise text-guided image editing through customization, and the key hypothesis is that optimizing only language-relevant parameters is crucial for transferring visual concepts from references to sources. The proposed Custom-Edit approach aims to address this question.
