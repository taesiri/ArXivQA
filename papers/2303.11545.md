# [Fix the Noise: Disentangling Source Feature for Controllable Domain   Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11545)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we perform high-quality domain translation with better controllability over preserving source domain features using a single model? 

The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:

- Proposes a new training strategy called "FixNoise" to disentangle source and target features within the feature space of a single target model. This allows controllable cross-domain interpolation.

- The key idea is to preserve source features in a disentangled subspace of the target feature space by fixing the noise input when applying feature matching loss. 

- This creates an "anchored subspace" that preserves source features, while the rest of the space learns target features. The noise input disentangles the domains.

- Linear interpolation between the fixed "anchor point" noise and random noise allows smooth cross-domain feature control in a single model.

- Experiments show the method produces more consistent, realistic, and controllable results than previous domain translation techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces a way to perform high-quality and controllable domain translation using a novel training strategy to disentangle source and target features within a single model. This allows smooth cross-domain interpolation.
