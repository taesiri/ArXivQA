# [Fix the Noise: Disentangling Source Feature for Controllable Domain   Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11545)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we perform high-quality domain translation with better controllability over preserving source domain features using a single model? 

The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:

- Proposes a new training strategy called "FixNoise" to disentangle source and target features within the feature space of a single target model. This allows controllable cross-domain interpolation.

- The key idea is to preserve source features in a disentangled subspace of the target feature space by fixing the noise input when applying feature matching loss. 

- This creates an "anchored subspace" that preserves source features, while the rest of the space learns target features. The noise input disentangles the domains.

- Linear interpolation between the fixed "anchor point" noise and random noise allows smooth cross-domain feature control in a single model.

- Experiments show the method produces more consistent, realistic, and controllable results than previous domain translation techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces a way to perform high-quality and controllable domain translation using a novel training strategy to disentangle source and target features within a single model. This allows smooth cross-domain interpolation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new approach for high-quality domain translation with better controllability. The key ideas are:

- Preserving source features within a disentangled subspace of the target feature space. This allows controlling the degree to which source features are preserved when generating images from a new domain using a single model. 

- Using the noise input in StyleGAN to achieve disentanglement between source and target features. The noise input expands the feature space into different subspaces. By fixing the noise when applying feature matching loss, source features are only mapped to a particular "anchored" subspace. 

- Enabling smooth cross-domain interpolation by linearly interpolating between the fixed "anchor" noise and random noise. This allows fine-grained control over the degree of preserved source features.

In summary, the main contribution is a new training strategy called FixNoise that produces a single model for controllable cross-domain translation. It preserves source features in a disentangled subspace and enables smooth interpolation between domains using the noise input.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new training method called FixNoise that preserves source domain features in a disentangled subspace when transferring a pre-trained unconditional GAN like StyleGAN to a new target domain, enabling controllable and consistent cross-domain image translation using a single model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work on controllable domain translation:

- This paper proposes a new training strategy called FixNoise that allows for disentangling and preserving source features in a specific subspace when fine-tuning a target model. This enables smooth interpolation between source and target domains using a single model, unlike previous methods that require multiple models. 

- Previous unconditional GANs based methods like Freeze-D [1], Layer-Swap [2], and UI2I StyleGAN2 [3] allow controlling source feature preservation by freezing/swapping layers. But they have limited discrete control steps and generate inconsistent results across models. This paper overcomes those limitations.

- Compared to recent domain translation methods like UNIT [4], MUNIT [5], StarGAN v2 [6] etc., this paper shows superior image quality and consistency in interpolation between domains. Those methods often have artifacts or identity changes.  

- A key advantage is the disentanglement of source/target features within the feature space of a single target model. This is achieved by using a fixed noise input (the anchor point) when applying feature matching loss. Previous works did not explicitly disentangle features.

- The use of noise interpolation for cross-domain control is also novel, based on the observation that noise expands the feature space. This enables smooth transitions unlike previous discrete layer-based control.

In summary, the proposed FixNoise strategy and noise-based interpolation allow for fine-grained and consistent cross-domain control within a single model, overcoming limitations of prior arts. The disentanglement of source/target features is a key contribution.
