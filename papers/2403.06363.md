# [Say Anything with Any Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06363)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating talking face videos with natural-looking stylized expressions and head motions is challenging. 
- Existing methods either capture speaking styles via regression, resulting in averaged and coarse styles, or use a single universal network for different styles, causing suboptimal performance. 
- They also do not consider generating diverse stylized head poses.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose SAAS (Say Anything with Any Style) to generate talking faces with synchronized lip motions, and stylized expressions and head poses resembling a style reference video.
- Learn a style codebook via a multi-task VQ-VAE to extract discrete speaking style representations from style clips.
- Design a residual architecture with a canonical branch for lip sync and a style-specific branch to transfer source style to target style. 
- Introduce HyperStyle to produce style-specific weights for the style branch based on extracted style. This allows handling diverse styles with a single branch.
- Construct a pose codebook and cross-modal pose generator to produce diverse stylized head poses conditioned on audio and style.
- Extend to video-driven style editing by transferring style of input video to match a style clip.

Main Contributions:
- Learn explicit speaking styles via a style codebook and multi-task VQ-VAE.
- Achieve transfer to arbitrary styles and generate stylized motions using HyperStyle modulated style branch. 
- Generate diverse stylized head poses using pose codebook and generator conditioned on audio and style.
- State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance on talking face generation.
- Extension to challenging video-driven style editing task.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel approach to generate talking face videos with accurate lip synchronization and natural stylized expressions and head motions resembling any style reference video. The use of discrete representation learning and HyperStyle allows handling diverse and arbitrary speaking styles effectively.
