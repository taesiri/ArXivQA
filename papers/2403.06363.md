# [Say Anything with Any Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06363)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating talking face videos with natural-looking stylized expressions and head motions is challenging. 
- Existing methods either capture speaking styles via regression, resulting in averaged and coarse styles, or use a single universal network for different styles, causing suboptimal performance. 
- They also do not consider generating diverse stylized head poses.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose SAAS (Say Anything with Any Style) to generate talking faces with synchronized lip motions, and stylized expressions and head poses resembling a style reference video.
- Learn a style codebook via a multi-task VQ-VAE to extract discrete speaking style representations from style clips.
- Design a residual architecture with a canonical branch for lip sync and a style-specific branch to transfer source style to target style. 
- Introduce HyperStyle to produce style-specific weights for the style branch based on extracted style. This allows handling diverse styles with a single branch.
- Construct a pose codebook and cross-modal pose generator to produce diverse stylized head poses conditioned on audio and style.
- Extend to video-driven style editing by transferring style of input video to match a style clip.

Main Contributions:
- Learn explicit speaking styles via a style codebook and multi-task VQ-VAE.
- Achieve transfer to arbitrary styles and generate stylized motions using HyperStyle modulated style branch. 
- Generate diverse stylized head poses using pose codebook and generator conditioned on audio and style.
- State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance on talking face generation.
- Extension to challenging video-driven style editing task.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel approach to generate talking face videos with accurate lip synchronization and natural stylized expressions and head motions resembling any style reference video. The use of discrete representation learning and HyperStyle allows handling diverse and arbitrary speaking styles effectively.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel model called SAAS that can generate talking face videos with stylized expressions and head motions synchronized with the audio while imitating the speaking style of any given style video.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel model called SAAS (Say Anything with Any Style) to generate talking face videos with stylized expressions and head motions that match a given style clip, while ensuring lip synchronization with the audio. 

2. Learning a style codebook using a multi-task VQ-VAE to extract a discrete representation of speaking style, which improves style extraction accuracy and robustness. Another pose codebook and pose generator are constructed to generate diverse stylized head motions.

3. Developing a HyperStyle module that effectively reduces the branches required for each new style, allowing a single style-specific branch to transfer source style to any target style and generate stylized videos. 

4. Extending the method to video-driven style editing by transferring speaking style from input videos while maintaining lip synchronization.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the SAAS model to generate stylized talking faces with accurate lip sync and diverse motions by learning discrete style and pose representations, as well as using a HyperStyle to enable transfer between arbitrary styles with a single branch.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel dynamic-weight method called SAAS. What is the key intuition behind using a dynamic-weight method instead of a static network to synthesize videos with different styles?

2. The paper constructs a style codebook using a multi-task VQ-VAE. Why is a multi-task learning strategy effective here compared to just focusing on style code extraction? What are the auxiliary tasks and how do they help enhance style extraction?

3. Explain the residual architecture with the canonical branch and style-specific branch in detail. What is the responsibility of each branch and how do they complement each other? 

4. What is a HyperStyle and how does it help adapt the network to different speaking styles without requiring multiple style-specific branches? Explain its working in detail.

5. What is the purpose of having separate pose codebook and generator modules? Why is it important to have style-guided pose sampling rather than just random sampling?

6. The paper claims the learned discrete latent codes help generate more stable and coherent motions in long-term predictions. Elaborate why discrete codes have this advantage over continuous codes.  

7. What modifications were made to the original VQ-VAE framework to make it more suited for extracting speaking styles?

8. What are the different objective functions employed to guide stylized facial motion generation? Explain their roles.

9. How is the method extended for video-driven style editing? What changes were required compared to the audio-driven pipeline?

10. The paper demonstrates superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. Analyze the results and explain which factors contribute to the better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
