# [MasonTigers at SemEval-2024 Task 1: An Ensemble Approach for Semantic   Textual Relatedness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14990)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Addressed:
The paper presents approaches to address SemEval-2024 Task 1 - determining semantic textual relatedness (STR) across sentence pairs in 14 languages. The task has three tracks across supervised, unsupervised and cross-lingual settings across diverse languages. The aim is to develop models to effectively measure semantic relatedness between sentences for a wide range of languages.

Proposed Solution: 
The MasonTigers team proposes an ensemble approach combining statistical machine learning models, transformer-based embeddings, language-specific BERT models and sentence BERT for the three tracks. The core methodology involves:

- Supervised Track: Using TF-IDF, PPMI, LaBSE sentence BERT and language-specific BERTs to encode sentences. Models like ElasticNet and linear regression are applied on embeddings. Weighted ensemble is done based on dev set performance. 

- Unsupervised Track: Employs TF-IDF, PPMI and language-specific BERTs for encodings. Cosine similarity scores are used directly for prediction. Ensemble averaging is done.

- Cross-Lingual Track: Leverages training data from 5 other languages, with TF-IDF, PPMI and unrelated language BERTs used for encoding. Models like ElasticNet and Linear regression make final predictions. Ensemble averaging is utilized.

Main Contributions:
- One of only two teams participating in all 14 languages across the 3 tracks
- Rankings ranging from 11th to 21st in Track A, 1st to 8th in Track B and 5th to 12th in Track C
- Demonstrates ensemble approaches combining statistical ML and neural models for determining STR
- Provides systematic exploration of techniques for supervised, unsupervised and cross-lingual semantic textual similarity
- Analysis highlights challenges like limited data, domain specificity and choice of encodings as scope for future work

The paper provides a comprehensive study of semantic relatedness modeling under different settings using ensemble methodologies for multiple languages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents the MasonTigers system and approach which uses an ensemble of statistical machine learning and transformer models to determine semantic textual relatedness across multiple tracks and 14 languages for the SemEval-2024 shared task, achieving varied rankings from 1st to 21st across the different tracks and languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

The paper presents the MasonTigers entry to the SemEval-2024 Task 1 on Semantic Textual Relatedness across three tracks - supervised, unsupervised, and cross-lingual. The MasonTigers team participated in all languages across the three tracks, using ensemble approaches combining statistical machine learning, language-specific BERT models, and sentence transformers. Their approaches achieved rankings ranging from 11th to 21st in the supervised track, 1st to 8th in the unsupervised track, and 5th to 12th in the cross-lingual track. A key contribution is showing competitive performance using ensemble methods across diverse languages and with different constraints on model training.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and evaluating ensemble approaches for semantic textual relatedness across multiple tracks and languages in the SemEval-2024 shared task.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper utilizes both statistical machine learning approaches and BERT-based models. What is the motivation behind using an ensemble of these two types of methods? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of this approach?

2. For the supervised track, the authors use Elastic Net and Linear Regression on different embeddings to make predictions, and then ensemble these predictions. Why did they choose Elastic Net and Linear Regression specifically? How do these complement each other?  

3. The authors use a weighted ensemble based on the Spearman correlation coefficients on the development set. What is the rationale behind using a weighted rather than a simple average ensemble? What are the limitations of this weighting scheme?

4. The paper experimented with several language-specific BERT models. Why did they opt for language-specific over multilingual BERTs? What challenges did they face in finding suitable language-specific models for low-resource languages?

5. In the unsupervised track, only embeddings and cosine similarity are used. Why did the authors not attempt prediction models like in the supervised track? Would that have been beneficial or not?

6. For the cross-lingual track, BERT models unrelated to the target language are used. Why is this and how does it impact performance compared to the language-specific models? Could machine translation have helped improve embeddings?  

7. The error analysis indicates decreased performance when test set size is much larger than dev set size. What solutions could address this issue of overfitting on small dev sets?

8. The linear models used make assumptions about linear relationships in text semantics. When might this be problematic? What alternative non-linear models could be experimented with?  

9. The paper identifies subjectivity, ambiguity and lack of data as key challenges. How do the proposed models account for these? What improvements could handle these better?

10. The ensemble approach gives strong results, but has its limitations. What other ensemble techniques like stacking or blending could have been explored? Would that have advantages over simple averaging?
