# [Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02993)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating natural language when provided with well-designed prompts. However, manually crafting optimal prompts is time-consuming and suboptimal. 
- Existing automated prompt optimization methods prioritize global optimization to find a single optimal prompt. However, the global optimum is often scarce and many locally optimal prompts can perform well. Over-emphasizing global search is inefficient.
- The choice of input domain, including prompt generation and representation, significantly impacts optimization performance but is overlooked by existing methods.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper first provides an empirical study on the landscape and characteristics of the prompt optimization problem. The key findings are:
   (1) Local optima are more prevalent and worthwhile to obtain than the scarce global optimum.  
   (2) Choice of input domain affects identification of high-performing local optima.
- Based on these insights, the paper develops "Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization (ZOPO)", an efficient localized search algorithm, to find well-performing local optima instead of a global optimum.
- ZOPO incorporates three key components:
   (1) A domain transform utilizing both black-box LLM's generation and sentence embedding's representation.
   (2) A derived Gaussian process with neural tangent kernel for gradient estimation.
   (3) An uncertainty-informed local exploration technique.

Main Contributions:
- First empirical study providing insights on the importance of local optima and input domain choice in prompt optimization.
- A new perspective of localized prompt optimization that significantly outperforms global optimization methods.
- A novel algorithm ZOPO that achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks with higher query efficiency.
- Demonstration of connecting black-box LLMs like ChatGPT with advanced sentence embeddings for flexible prompt optimization.

In summary, this paper provides useful insights on prompt optimization and develops an efficient localized search algorithm ZOPO to find well-performing prompts for black-box LLMs. The localized perspective and input domain transform in ZOPO are the main innovations leading to its superior efficiency and performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel algorithm called Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization (ZOPO) that efficiently searches for well-performing local optima in prompt optimization for large language models by incorporating a derived Gaussian process with Neural Tangent Kernel into standard zeroth-order optimization and introducing an uncertainty-informed local exploration technique.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel algorithm called Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization (ZOPO) for efficient and effective prompt optimization. Specifically:

1) The paper provides an empirical study on prompt optimization, drawing two key insights:
(a) Local optima are more prevalent and worthwhile pursuing compared to the global optimum. 
(b) The choice of input domain (prompt generation and representation) impacts optimization performance.

2) Inspired by these insights, ZOPO is proposed, which incorporates a derived Neural Tangent Kernel Gaussian Process into zeroth-order optimization to efficiently search for well-performing local optima. 

3) ZOPO also proposes a general domain transformation to leverage different language models for prompt generation and representation, providing flexibility.

4) An uncertainty-informed local exploration technique is introduced to refine gradient estimation and enhance ZOPO's practical performance.

5) Extensive experiments demonstrate ZOPO's superior optimization performance and query efficiency over existing methods on instruction induction and reasoning tasks. Ablation studies also validate the algorithmic design principles.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and empirical validation of the novel ZOPO algorithm for improved prompt optimization.
