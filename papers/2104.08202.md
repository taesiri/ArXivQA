# [$Q^{2}$: Evaluating Factual Consistency in Knowledge-Grounded Dialogues   via Question Generation and Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08202)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: 

How can we automatically evaluate the factual consistency of knowledge-grounded open-domain dialogue systems?

Specifically, the authors aim to develop an automatic metric that can score dialogue system outputs in terms of their factual consistency with respect to a given knowledge source, without requiring gold reference responses. 

The key hypothesis is that an evaluation approach using question generation and question answering will be effective for this purpose. The intuition is that if a dialogue response is factually consistent with the provided knowledge, then questions generated based on that response should yield similar answers when answered using the knowledge source.

The authors propose a pipeline called Q2 that implements this idea. It extracts informative spans from the dialogue response, generates questions for those spans, answers the questions using the knowledge source, and compares the response-based answers to the knowledge-based answers using natural language inference. 

The paper presents experiments on several dialogue datasets to test whether Q2 correlates well with human judgments of factual consistency compared to other metrics. The results support the hypothesis, showing that Q2 achieves higher correlation than other reference-free metrics.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that factual consistency in knowledge-grounded dialogue can be effectively evaluated in a reference-free manner using question generation and question answering. The proposed Q2 metric aims to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an automatic evaluation metric ($Q^2$) for measuring the factual consistency of knowledge-grounded dialogue systems. The key points are:

- $Q^2$ uses question generation and question answering to compare the information expressed in a dialogue system's response with the given knowledge source it is conditioned on. 

- It compares answer spans using natural language inference instead of simple token matching, making it more robust to lexical variability.

- The authors construct a new dataset of system responses annotated for factual consistency to evaluate $Q^2$ and other metrics. Experiments show $Q^2$ correlates better with human judgments than other metrics on this dataset as well as existing dialogue benchmarks.

- Overall, the paper presents a novel automatic evaluation approach tailored for knowledge-grounded open-domain dialogues. The metric and dataset could facilitate research on improving the factual consistency of dialogue systems.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and validating a new automatic evaluation metric for knowledge-grounded dialogues using question generation, question answering, and natural language inference. The paper also provides new resources including a dataset annotated for factual consistency.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a 1 sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an automatic evaluation metric for factual consistency in knowledge-grounded dialogues by using question generation and question answering to compare key information extracted from the dialog response to answers obtained from the knowledge source.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The key novel contribution of this paper is the development of an automatic evaluation metric ($Q^2$) for measuring factual consistency in knowledge-grounded dialog systems. This metric uses question generation and question answering to compare information expressed in the dialog response to the grounding knowledge. 

- Prior work on evaluating factual consistency has focused mainly on summarization rather than dialog systems. The papers by Durmus et al. (2020) and Wang et al. (2020) proposed similar QG+QA approaches for evaluating factual consistency in abstractive summarization. This paper adapts that intuition to the more challenging problem of open-domain dialog, where responses mix knowledge with other content like chit-chat.

- Compared to prior dialog evaluation metrics, $Q^2$ has the advantage of specifically measuring factual consistency without requiring reference responses. Many existing metrics like BLEU rely on comparing to ground truth responses, which is not suitable for open-ended dialog tasks. $Q^2$ also showed higher correlation with human judgments than existing metrics.

- The paper makes a novel contribution in constructing a dataset of system dialog responses annotated for factual consistency, to enable direct evaluation of metrics. Prior dialog datasets have not explicitly annotated factual consistency.

- The comparison of answering based on dialog response vs knowledge using NLI is more advanced than prior token-matching between spans. This allows capturing semantic equivalence despite lexical variability.

- Overall, the paper makes solid incremental progress on an important challenge. The results are promising and the metric seems to generalize across different dialog datasets. A limitation is the reliance on brittle NLP components like question generation. But the paper shows the approach is reasonably robust.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative application of recent ideas from summarization evaluation to the more challenging and understudied problem of evaluating factual consistency in dialog systems. The new dataset and extensive analyses are also valuable contributions to this space.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Map parts of a response to different types like chit-chat, persona and factual, in order to evaluate each against its appropriate source of truth. This could allow for more sophisticated evaluation when responses combine multiple types of content.

- Apply the proposed metric $Q^2$ to additional tasks where factual consistency is essential, such as automated fact checking or summarization. 

- Use the evaluation signal from $Q^2$ to improve the factual consistency of generative dialogue models, for example through optimizing/fine-tuning the models based on the $Q^2$ metric.

- Improve the identification and separation of general chit-chat responses from more "knowledgeable" responses, to reduce cases where $Q^2$ asks irrelevant questions about the chit-chat parts.

- Further address gaps caused by unresolved pronouns through improvements to the coreference resolution component.

- Design a more efficient implementation of the $Q^2$ pipeline to reduce runtime.

- Experiment with using $Q^2$ for dialogue evaluation in additional domains beyond the current experiments on Wikipedia/news-based dialogues.

In summary, the main directions are improving the precision of the metric in dialogue settings, using the metric to improve faithfulness of models, expanding to additional use cases and tasks, and improving efficiency. The authors frame $Q^2$ as an extensible evaluation framework with room for improvement along multiple dimensions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new automatic evaluation metric called $Q^2$ for measuring the factual consistency of knowledge-grounded dialog systems. The metric uses question generation and question answering to compare key information expressed in a system's generated response against the knowledge used to ground the response. Specifically, it first generates questions based on informative spans in the response using a question generation model. It then uses a question answering model to find answers to those questions in the knowledge text. Finally, it compares the response-based answer spans to the knowledge-based answer spans using natural language inference instead of just token matching, making the comparison more robust. To evaluate their metric, the authors collect a new dataset of system responses annotated for factual consistency and run experiments showing that $Q^2$ correlates better with human judgments than other metrics across multiple dialog datasets. The paper demonstrates that $Q^2$ is an effective way to automatically evaluate the factual consistency of knowledge-grounded dialog systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new automatic metric, denoted Q^2, for evaluating the factual consistency of generative knowledge-grounded dialogue systems. Q^2 uses question generation (QG) and question answering (QA) to compare key information expressed in a system's generated response against facts expressed in the knowledge source it was conditioned on. 

First, Q^2 identifies informative noun phrases in the response and uses a QG model to generate questions for which these noun phrases are the answers. It then employs a QA model to find answers to these questions in the knowledge source. Finally, it compares the response-based answers to the knowledge-based answers using natural language inference, which is more robust than simple string overlap. Experiments on the Wizard of Wikipedia, Topical-Chat, and DialogueNLI datasets show that Q^2 has significantly higher correlation with human judgments of factual consistency compared to several baselines. The paper also introduces a new manually annotated evaluation benchmark of system responses from Wizard of Wikipedia. Overall, Q^2 represents an effective framework for automatically evaluating factual consistency in knowledge-grounded dialogue systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called $Q^2$ for evaluating the factual consistency of knowledge-grounded dialogue systems. The $Q^2$ method works by generating questions based on informative spans in the dialogue response using a question generation (QG) model. It then uses a question answering (QA) model to find answers to those questions in the knowledge text the response was grounded on. To compare the similarity of the response-based answer spans and knowledge-based answer spans, it employs natural language inference (NLI) instead of simple token matching. The NLI component makes the comparison more robust to lexical variability. For each generated question, the similarity score of the response span and knowledge span is computed. These scores are aggregated to produce an overall factual consistency score for the response. The motivation is that a factually consistent response should result in the QG/QA procedure retrieving similar answers from the response itself and from the grounding knowledge.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is addressing the problem of evaluating factual consistency in knowledge-grounded dialog systems. Dialogue systems that are grounded on external knowledge often generate responses that are factually inconsistent with that knowledge, making them unreliable. 

- The paper proposes an automatic evaluation metric called Q^2 that uses question generation and question answering to assess the factual consistency between a system's generated response and the knowledge it was grounded on.

- Q^2 generates questions based on informative spans in the response using a question generation model, then finds answers to those questions in the knowledge using QA. It compares the similarity of the response-based answers and knowledge-based answers to get a factual consistency score.

- The paper introduces a new dataset of system responses annotated for factual consistency to test their metric. Experiments on this and other dialogue datasets show Q^2 has higher correlation with human judgements of factual consistency compared to other metrics.

- The contributions are: (1) a new framework using QG and QA for evaluating grounded dialogue; (2) a new annotated dataset for this task; (3) experiments validating the effectiveness of Q^2 against other metrics.

In summary, the paper addresses the important problem of factual inconsistency in dialogue systems by proposing a new automatic evaluation method based on question generation and answering. Experiments demonstrate this is a promising approach compared to prior metrics.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The proposed $Q^2$ method uses a combination of question generation, question answering, and natural language inference to evaluate the factual consistency of knowledge-grounded dialog systems. How does using NLI to compare answer spans allow for more robust evaluation compared to simple token-level similarity measures used in prior work?

2. The paper introduces a new dataset of 600 knowledge-grounded dialogue responses manually annotated for factual consistency to foster research in this area. What are some ways this dataset could be expanded or improved in future work to create an even more useful resource for evaluating factual consistency?

3. The proposed pipeline filters out questions relating to personal statements or opinions in the dialog response before using them to evaluate factual consistency. What are some ways to handle these filtered portions to enable a more complete evaluation of the overall dialog response?

4. For responses where no valid questions are generated, the method falls back to using end-to-end natural language inference between the knowledge and response. In what ways could the question generation process be improved to increase coverage and reduce dependence on this fallback method? 

5. The paper demonstrates that the proposed $Q^2$ method generalizes well to different dialog tasks involving varying types of knowledge sources and dialog history context. What enhancements could make the method even more robust to different domains and knowledge sources?

6. Error analysis revealed that lack of context and coreference resolution sometimes leads to low-quality questions in the pipeline. How could the method better leverage dialog context and resolve ambiguous pronouns to generate more meaningful questions?

7. The proposed pipeline requires running computationally intensive NLP models like T5, BERT, and RoBERTa. What optimizations could reduce the runtime while maintaining strong evaluation performance?

8. The paper focuses on evaluating factual consistency, but dialog systems must exhibit many other qualities. How could the $Q^2$ framework be extended to evaluate other attributes like empathy, engagingness, and consistency?

9. Human evaluations of system outputs are costly. How could $Q^2$ scores be incorporated into an active learning framework to select the most informative samples for human annotation?

10. The paper demonstrates correlation of $Q^2$ scores with human judgments of factual consistency. How could the metric be integrated directly into dialog system training to improve factual grounding, as in recent work on summarization?
