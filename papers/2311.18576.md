# [Fingerprint Matching with Localized Deep Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18576)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a localized deep representation for fingerprints (LDRF) that is robust to variations in visible area and impression type. After aligning the fingerprint using pose estimation, LDRF focuses on extracting discriminative features from local regions while incorporating global constraints via positional embedding. It also predicts the valid ridge area to eliminate irrelevant data during matching. Matching is performed only on feature embeddings within the overlapping valid area. The method exhibits intuitive statistical properties, enabling the proposal of a score normalization technique that unifies reliability for pairs with varying overlap. Extensive experiments on 21 datasets and over 140K prints of multiple types demonstrate superiority over prior fixed-length methods. LDRF retains high accuracy even after binarization, enabling efficient search and template security. Score normalization significantly reduces false matches in a 5M print database. The method achieves comparable accuracy to a state-of-the-art commercial minutiae matcher, with greater efficiency and modeling capabilities. Key limitations include reliance on pose accuracy and higher complexity than minutiae extraction. Future work will explore integrating LDRF with minutiae and enhancing efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a localized deep fingerprint representation extracted from aligned fingerprints to achieve efficient and accurate fingerprint matching, especially for fingerprints with diverse visible areas, and introduces a matching score normalization method to improve large-scale fingerprint identification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a localized deep representation for fingerprints (LDRF) that focuses on extracting distinctive features from local regions rather than a global representation. This makes the representation more robust to fingerprints with different visible areas.

2) It incorporates a 2D positional embedding module to introduce global constraints into the local features, which helps the network pay attention to distinct characteristics across different regions. 

3) It estimates a valid area mask simultaneously with the feature extraction to eliminate irrelevant or invalid information that could negatively impact matching performance.

4) It shows that the proposed representation exhibits intuitive statistical properties that allow modeling the distribution of impostor scores. This enables proposing a matching score normalization method to handle uncertainty for comparisons with small overlapping areas.

5) It demonstrates superior performance over prior fixed-length representation methods as well as robustness across multiple datasets with different impression types (rolled, plain, latent, contactless) and over 140k fingerprints.

6) It shows that the proposed matching score normalization technique significantly reduces false match rates, by up to 5 orders of magnitude compared to prior works, in large-scale identification experiments with over 5 million fingerprints.

In summary, the core innovations are around developing a localized representation that is robust to variable visible areas, exploiting the statistical properties to enable reliable score normalization, and demonstrating exceptional accuracy and scalability across diverse and challenging datasets.
