# [Towards Explainability in Legal Outcome Prediction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16852)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Current legal outcome prediction models can predict outcomes well but do not explain their reasoning, limiting real-world use. Lawyers/judges reason using precedent (past case law), so precedent is a natural way to enable explainability. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper develops a method to identify precedent used by models to make decisions. They create a taxonomy of precedent types (applied/distinguished, positive/negative) and use influence functions to quantify each training case's influence on test case decisions. This shows which types of precedent the models rely on.

Contributions:
1) New method to identify precedent used by models to explain decisions 

2) Taxonomy of precedent types to categorize cases and compare human vs model reasoning

3) Analysis showing current models rely heavily on applied positive precedent, much less on other types, unlike human reasoning

4) Results indicate higher model accuracy does not equal more human-like reasoning regarding precedent

5) Doubts utility of current outcome prediction models; better legal inductive biases needed to induce precedential reasoning

In summary, the paper develops a precedent-based explanation method for outcome prediction models. Experiments reveal models predominantly use one type of precedent, unlike human judges. This demonstrates current models' limitations in legal reasoning and aims to motivate more legally-faithful model development.
