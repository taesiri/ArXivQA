# [Towards Building Multilingual Language Model for Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most current medical language models are focused on English, limiting their benefit globally. There is a lack of open-source, multilingual medical language models.
- There is no large-scale multilingual medical-specific corpus to facilitate advanced training. 
- There is no comprehensive multilingual medical QA benchmark with rationale to evaluate model's reasoning ability.

Proposed Solutions:
- Construct MMedC, a 25.5B-token multilingual medical corpus covering 6 languages to enable robust medical-domain pretraining. Data is compiled from 4 sources: filtering general corpora, textbooks, websites and existing datasets.

- Develop MMedBench, a 53K QA benchmark with answers and rationales spanning 6 languages and 21 medical domains. Rationales further verified manually. Enables eval on choice accuracy and reasoning ability.  

- Evaluate various LLMs on MMedBench under zero-shot, PEFT and full fine-tuning. Assess choice accuracy and rationale generation through both automated metrics and human ratings.

- Propose MMedLM and MMedLM 2 by further pretraining strong multilingual models InternLM and InternLM 2 on MMedC medical data.

Main Contributions:
- MMedC: Large-scale multilingual corpus tailored for medical domain
- MMedBench: Comprehensive multilingual medical QA benchmark with rationale
- Analysis: Thorough benchmarking of SOTA models' accuracy and reasoning ability 
- Models: Developed and open-sourced MMedLM 2, the most competitive open medical multilingual LLM

The paper addresses major gaps in open multilingual medical LLMs by constructing specialized datasets and models, with rigorous analysis. The public availability of these resources will facilitate future research.
