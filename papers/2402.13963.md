# [Towards Building Multilingual Language Model for Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most current medical language models are focused on English, limiting their benefit globally. There is a lack of open-source, multilingual medical language models.
- There is no large-scale multilingual medical-specific corpus to facilitate advanced training. 
- There is no comprehensive multilingual medical QA benchmark with rationale to evaluate model's reasoning ability.

Proposed Solutions:
- Construct MMedC, a 25.5B-token multilingual medical corpus covering 6 languages to enable robust medical-domain pretraining. Data is compiled from 4 sources: filtering general corpora, textbooks, websites and existing datasets.

- Develop MMedBench, a 53K QA benchmark with answers and rationales spanning 6 languages and 21 medical domains. Rationales further verified manually. Enables eval on choice accuracy and reasoning ability.  

- Evaluate various LLMs on MMedBench under zero-shot, PEFT and full fine-tuning. Assess choice accuracy and rationale generation through both automated metrics and human ratings.

- Propose MMedLM and MMedLM 2 by further pretraining strong multilingual models InternLM and InternLM 2 on MMedC medical data.

Main Contributions:
- MMedC: Large-scale multilingual corpus tailored for medical domain
- MMedBench: Comprehensive multilingual medical QA benchmark with rationale
- Analysis: Thorough benchmarking of SOTA models' accuracy and reasoning ability 
- Models: Developed and open-sourced MMedLM 2, the most competitive open medical multilingual LLM

The paper addresses major gaps in open multilingual medical LLMs by constructing specialized datasets and models, with rigorous analysis. The public availability of these resources will facilitate future research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces MMedC, a large-scale multilingual medical corpus, and MMedBench, a comprehensive multilingual medical QA benchmark, to develop open-source multilingual language models for medicine.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The construction of MMedC, a large-scale multilingual medical corpus containing over 25 billion tokens across 6 languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, French, Russian, Spanish) from diverse sources. This is aimed to help adapt general multilingual language models to the medical domain.

2. The introduction of MMedBench, a comprehensive multilingual medical question answering benchmark with over 50,000 QA pairs and accompanying rationales across the 6 languages. This enables evaluating language models on both multiple choice accuracy and rationale generation ability.

3. Comprehensive benchmarking experiments evaluating 11 language models on MMedBench under different settings. Models trained on MMedC (MMedLM, MMedLM 2) achieve the best results among open source models, demonstrating the value of the constructed multilingual medical corpus.

So in summary, the main contributions are the new multilingual medical corpus, benchmark, and models to help advance multilingual language models for healthcare.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multilingual language model - The paper focuses on developing an open-source, multilingual language model for the medical domain that can benefit linguistically diverse audiences.

- Medical corpus (MMedC) - A new 25.5 billion token multilingual medical corpus constructed to train language models, covering 6 languages from 4 data sources.

- Medical QA benchmark (MMedBench) - A new comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multilingual medical language models, with over 50k QA pairs across 6 languages and accompanying rationales. 

- Auto-regressive training - The process of further pre-training existing language models on the MMedC corpus to adapt them to the medical domain.

- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) - A technique to fine-tune only a small subset of model parameters to save on compute resources.

- Rationale generation - The ability of models to provide explanations justifying their answers to medical questions. Both accuracy and rationale generation ability are evaluated.

- Model evaluation - Various existing multilingual models are benchmarked, including proprietary models like GPT-3.5 and open-source ones. Models trained on MMedC show clear improvements.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper constructs a new large-scale multilingual medical corpus (MMedC). What were the key data sources utilized to build this corpus and what pre-processing steps were taken for sources like medical textbooks?

2. What was the motivation behind creating a specialized multilingual medical corpus? How does MMedC address deficiencies in existing multilingual corpora when applied to the medical domain? 

3. The paper introduces a new comprehensive, multilingual medical QA benchmark (MMedBench). What was the process for augmenting the initial QA pairs with explanatory rationales? How was GPT-4 leveraged in this process?

4. What were some of the key criteria used during the human verification phase to assess the quality of the rationales generated by GPT-4? What percentage of rationales met the verification standards?

5. The paper benchmarks numerous existing LLMs on MMedBench. What were the major LLM categories compared? How did models trained on MMedC compare to their base versions not trained on this corpus?

6. What evaluation settings were used to benchmark model performance on MMedBench (zero-shot, PEFT, full fine-tuning)? What do these settings represent and what constraints did each impose?

7. Beyond accuracy, what metrics were introduced to assess the models' ability to generate rationales? What findings emerged from the human rating experiment concerning metric reliability?  

8. What techniques were applied during the auto-regressive training phase on MMedC (optimization objectives, input segmentation, distributed training)? How were these optimized for large parameter models?

9. What overall conclusions can be drawn from the ablation studies concerning the impact of various data sources on model performance? How did the inclusion of rationales during fine-tuning influence outcomes?

10. What opportunities exist for future work to build upon the datasets, benchmarks, and models proposed in this paper? What limitations currently exist that could be addressed in follow-up efforts?
