## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-based games serve as important benchmarks for testing natural language and reasoning capabilities of AI agents. Such games involve complex challenges like language comprehension, common sense reasoning, long-term planning, etc. Performance in text-based games that require symbolic reasoning involving mathematical, sorting, navigation or common sense tasks remains a challenge. 

- Although large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 show strong natural language understanding and knowledge encoding, their application for symbolic reasoning tasks is relatively unexplored. Effective integration of symbolic modules into language agents also remains an open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using LLMs as neurosymbolic reasoners for text-based games involving symbolic tasks. A prompting approach is used to guide the LLM agent, eliminating the need for extra training.

- The LLM agent is initialized with a role and task description. At each timestep, it receives the current observation, inventory state, valid action set and reward. Based on this context, the LLM reasons to choose an appropriate action.  

- The agent can leverage external symbolic modules (calculator, navigator, etc.) as part of the action space. Appropriate prompting strategies constrain the agent's actions.

Main Contributions:
- First work to demonstrate LLMs can serve as effective neurosymbolic reasoners for complex text-based games involving symbolic tasks.

- Proposing suitable prompting mechanisms to enable LLM agent to leverage symbolic modules and enhance its decision making performance.

- LLM agent outperforms strong baselines like Deep Reinforcement Relevance Network and Behavior Cloned Transformer, achieving 88% average accuracy with improved sample efficiency.

- Showcases the potential of large language models in symbolic reasoning - an relatively under-explored but important area of research.
