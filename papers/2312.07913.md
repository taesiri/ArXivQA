# [A Survey of Text Watermarking in the Era of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07913)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects covered in the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled high-quality text generation, raising concerns of misuse like fake news and copyright infringement. 
- Text watermarking techniques can address this by embedding invisible yet detectable patterns to track text origins. 

Existing Methods:
- Watermarking for existing text modifies texts to embed watermarks via format, lexical, syntactic or generative approaches.  
- Watermarking for LLMs alters model training, logits generation, or token sampling to produce watermarked outputs.

Evaluation Metrics: 
- Success rate using accuracy, F1, or bit error rate.  
- Text quality via perplexity, semantic scores, and task performance.
- Robustness against character, word, or document-level attacks.  
- Unforgeability by testing imperceptibility and resisting statistical attacks.

Applications:
- Copyright protection for texts, datasets and LLMs against unauthorized usage.  
- Fake news detection by tracking AI-generated text spread on social media.
- Ensuring academic integrity by distinguishing human vs LLM generated content.

Key Contributions:
- First comprehensive survey of text watermarking methods in the era of large language models.  
- Thorough analysis of watermarking approaches, evaluation metrics, applications.
- Identification of open challenges and future directions for advancement of text watermarking field.

The summary covers the key problem motivating text watermarking research, the main existing solutions and taxonomy of methods, metrics to evaluate watermarks, applications demonstrating real-world usefulness, and the primary contributions made by the survey paper in advancing understanding and future work in this space especially in light of recent progress in large language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper on text watermarking in the era of large language models:

1. The paper discusses various types of watermarking methods for existing text, including format-based, lexical-based, syntactic-based and generation-based approaches. Can you elaborate on the key strengths and weaknesses of each method in balancing robustness, payload, and impact on text quality? 

2. The survey explores three main approaches for watermarking large language models: training time watermarking, watermarking during logits generation, and watermarking during token sampling. What are the trade-offs between these methods in terms of watermark scope, modification complexity, and impact on model functionality?

3. Unbiased watermarking methods for logits modification are proposed to enhance imperceptibility. However, the paper notes that unbiased distribution does not guarantee theoretical imperceptibility. Can you suggest some statistical tests to rigorously validate the imperceptibility of an unbiased watermarking scheme?  

4. The emoji attack is discussed as an effective word-level attack to remove watermarks by prompting LLMs to generate emojis between tokens. What countermeasures may be adopted during model training or prompting formulation to mitigate such attacks?

5. For multi-bit payload watermarks, the paper suggests that enhancing payload typically compromises text quality or robustness to attacks. What novel encoding or embedding mechanisms can you propose to expand payload without significantly affecting other metrics?  

6. The survey highlights that current watermarking methods still lack robustness to rewrite attacks when applied to short text segments. What modifications can be incorporated in existing algorithms to improve robustness for short texts?

7. Most current methods demonstrate removable watermarks under white-box attack settings. Can you conceive defense strategies to enhance watermark security even when attackers have sufficient knowledge about the watermarking scheme?  

8. For publicly detectable watermarks, the paper advocates using neural networks over exposed rule-based detectors. However, details of the neural network architecture may still be reverse-engineered. Suggest additional precautions to fortify unforgeability.

9. While the survey focuses on NLP domains, can you identify other data modalities like tabular data, source code, or graphs where similar watermarking principles may be applicable? What changes would be necessitated?

10. The applications emphasize copyright protection, academic integrity and fake news detection. Can you propose other novel use cases where text watermarking can address pressing real-world problems? What ethical concerns need deliberation before large-scale deployment?
