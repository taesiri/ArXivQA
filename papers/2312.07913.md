# [A Survey of Text Watermarking in the Era of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07913)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This comprehensive survey explores the landscape of text watermarking techniques in the era of large language models (LLMs). It discusses various methods for watermarking existing text through format, lexical, syntactic and generation-based approaches, as well as techniques for watermarking the training or inference process of LLMs. The paper thoroughly covers evaluation metrics like success rate, text quality, robustness against attacks, and unforgeability. It highlights the need to balance robustness, payload, and quality when designing algorithms. Applications in copyright protection, academic integrity and fake news detection are explored. The survey finds that advancements in LLMs necessitate increasingly sophisticated watermark designs that can withstand advanced removal strategies and forgeries. Key challenges include adapting to evolving LLMs, integration into real-world use cases, and balancing effectiveness with ethical implications. Overall, text watermarking is a rapidly developing field with significance for ensuring responsible AI use, but further progress is needed in developing robust and adaptable techniques.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive survey of text watermarking algorithms in the era of large language models (LLMs). Its main contributions include:

1) It categorizes text watermarking methods into two broad types - watermarking for existing text and watermarking for LLMs. It then further classifies techniques under these two categories based on the granularity of modifications (format-based, lexical-based, syntactic-based, generation-based for existing text) and the stage at which watermarks are added in LLMs (training time, logits generation, token sampling). 

2) It introduces four key perspectives to evaluate text watermarking algorithms - success rate, text quality, robustness and unforgeability. It discusses various metrics and attack scenarios corresponding to each perspective.

3) It explores the applications of text watermarking across three crucial domains - copyright protection, academic integrity and fake news detection. It highlights the role of watermarking methods in safeguarding intellectual property, ensuring authenticity of academic works, and aiding the detection of AI-generated fake content.

4) It comprehensively summarizes the current landscape of text watermarking and provides insights into key challenges and future directions, such as balancing robustness, payload and quality, adapting to evolving LLMs, and integration into real-world systems.

In essence, this paper delivers a holistic overview of text watermarking methods, evaluation techniques and applications specifically catering to the modern context involving large language models. It seeks to further research by highlighting promising areas for exploration.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper on text watermarking:

1. The paper discusses both watermarking for existing text and watermarking for large language models (LLMs). What are the key differences in the approaches between these two types of text watermarking methods? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages?

2. The paper categorizes watermarking for existing text into format-based, lexical-based, syntactic-based and generation-based approaches. Can you explain the key idea behind each of these approaches and how they embed watermarks in text? What are their limitations? 

3. For watermarking during logits generation in LLMs, the paper discusses methods to address challenges in four distinct scenarios - low entropy text, multi-bit payload, preventing removal attacks, and defending against forgeries. Can you summarize the core ideas proposed in each case to tackle these challenges?

4. The emoji attack is discussed as an effective word-level attack to remove watermarks from LLM text. How exactly does this attack work? What are its limitations? Can you propose any potential solutions to defend against such attacks?

5. Rewrite attacks and copy-paste attacks are introduced as document-level attacks to remove watermarks. How do these attacks function? What factors influence the robustness of watermarking algorithms against them?

6. Unbiased watermarking algorithms are proposed to enhance imperceptibility of watermarks in LLMs. What causes biases in methods like KGW? How do the delta-reweight and gamma-reweight approaches achieve unbiased watermarking?  

7. What are the differences in evaluating unforgeability of watermarking algorithms under private detection versus public detection scenarios? What mechanisms can improve unforgeability under each case?

8. Three major applications of text watermarking are covered - copyright protection, academic integrity and fake news detection. For each case, summarize the role of watermarking and key methods adopted in current literature.

9. The paper discusses watermarking during token sampling as an approach for LLM watermarking. How does this method work? What are its advantages and current limitations? How can it be improved?

10. Several evaluation metrics are introduced in the paper - success rate, text quality, robustness and unforgeability. For each metric, outline the typical techniques used for evaluation and the relevant challenges.
