## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper on text watermarking in the era of large language models:

1. The paper discusses various types of watermarking methods for existing text, including format-based, lexical-based, syntactic-based and generation-based approaches. Can you elaborate on the key strengths and weaknesses of each method in balancing robustness, payload, and impact on text quality? 

2. The survey explores three main approaches for watermarking large language models: training time watermarking, watermarking during logits generation, and watermarking during token sampling. What are the trade-offs between these methods in terms of watermark scope, modification complexity, and impact on model functionality?

3. Unbiased watermarking methods for logits modification are proposed to enhance imperceptibility. However, the paper notes that unbiased distribution does not guarantee theoretical imperceptibility. Can you suggest some statistical tests to rigorously validate the imperceptibility of an unbiased watermarking scheme?  

4. The emoji attack is discussed as an effective word-level attack to remove watermarks by prompting LLMs to generate emojis between tokens. What countermeasures may be adopted during model training or prompting formulation to mitigate such attacks?

5. For multi-bit payload watermarks, the paper suggests that enhancing payload typically compromises text quality or robustness to attacks. What novel encoding or embedding mechanisms can you propose to expand payload without significantly affecting other metrics?
