# [Connecting Vision and Language with Video Localized Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11217)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we create high-quality multimodal video annotations that connect vision and language by having annotators provide detailed spoken narrations and mouse traces on keyframes to capture complex events with multiple interacting actors?

The key hypothesis appears to be that a new annotation protocol based on disentangling narrations for individual actors on selected keyframes, along with careful instructions to annotators, can result in rich, accurate, and dense spatio-temporal groundings for video narrations. 

The authors then demonstrate the value of these Video Localized Narrative annotations by using them to generate benchmarks for video narrative grounding and video question answering tasks.
