# [Connecting Vision and Language with Video Localized Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11217)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we create high-quality multimodal video annotations that connect vision and language by having annotators provide detailed spoken narrations and mouse traces on keyframes to capture complex events with multiple interacting actors?

The key hypothesis appears to be that a new annotation protocol based on disentangling narrations for individual actors on selected keyframes, along with careful instructions to annotators, can result in rich, accurate, and dense spatio-temporal groundings for video narrations. 

The authors then demonstrate the value of these Video Localized Narrative annotations by using them to generate benchmarks for video narrative grounding and video question answering tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of Video Localized Narratives (VidLNs), a new form of multimodal video annotation that connects vision and language. The key ideas are:

- They introduce a new annotation protocol that allows annotators to tell the story of a video by speaking narrations while moving the mouse to localize objects, actions, and attributes on selected keyframes. This results in long, detailed narrations grounded to spatio-temporal locations. 

- The protocol disentangles complex events involving multiple actors by having separate narrations from the point of view of each actor. This enables cleanly capturing interactions between multiple actors and objects.

- They use this protocol to annotate 20k videos from 3 datasets (OVIS, UVO, Oops) with over 1.7 million words, creating the largest and richest collection of general-domain video datasets with dense grounded narrations.

- They demonstrate the usefulness of VidLNs by constructing new benchmarks for Video Narrative Grounding and Video Question Answering, and provide baseline methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the VidLN annotation procedure and using it to create a large-scale dataset of videos paired with grounded, detailed narrations describing the events, which enables new video-language tasks to be studied.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes Video Localized Narratives, a new form of multimodal video annotation that connects vision and language by having annotators speak naturally about videos while tracing objects with a mouse, and uses this data to create benchmarks for video narrative grounding and question answering.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper on Video Localized Narratives to other related work:

- The paper focuses on annotating general domain videos with complex interactions between actors and objects. In contrast, many existing video+language datasets are in narrow domains like cooking or first-person videos. 

- The annotations capture entire stories about the videos by disentangling narratives from different actors' perspectives. This results in richer, longer descriptions compared to datasets with short single captions per video.

- The annotations provide dense grounding by tracing mouse movements over objects while narrating the video keyframes. This grounds every word, unlike datasets that only ground nouns. The traces are also more accurate than in prior work on image-based Localized Narratives.

- The paper demonstrates the value of Video Localized Narratives by constructing new challenging benchmarks for Video Narrative Grounding and Video Question Answering. These require deeper understanding compared to existing tasks and datasets in these areas.

- The paper establishes baseline results on the new benchmarks using state-of-the-art models. But there is significant room for improvement, showing these are not yet solved and can drive further research progress.

In summary, this work provides uniquely rich narrations of complex videos with accurate grounding, enables new challenging tasks, and will support advancing video+language research. The large scale annotation effort stands out compared to existing video annotation datasets.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more advanced models for the Video Narrative Grounding (VNG) and Video Question Answering (VideoQA) tasks proposed in the paper. The authors present baseline results using adaptations of existing models, but there is room for improvement. Specifically, they suggest developing models that can better disambiguate between multiple instances of the same object class in a video for VNG. 

- Exploring other applications and tasks enabled by the Video Localized Narratives annotations. The authors demonstrate the usefulness for VNG and VideoQA, but suggest the data could support other future vision-and-language tasks as well.

- Collecting Video Localized Narratives for additional video datasets. The authors annotated three diverse datasets in this work, but suggest extending the annotation protocol to other video domains could be valuable.

- Improving the annotation protocol and interface to make it even more efficient. The current protocol produces high quality annotations, but requires multiple manual steps. The authors suggest further optimizations to simplify and streamline the process could be explored.

- Studying the narratives themselves, for example to do linguistic analysis of the language and explore the story structures. The narratives could enable research directions beyond just grounding words in the video.

- Using the localized narratives for video summarization, either generating summaries directly or as supervision. The narratives describe the key events in each video and could guide summarization.

Overall, the authors propose new high-quality multimodal annotations in the form of Video Localized Narratives, and demonstrate they enable constructing challenging new vision-and-language tasks. But they suggest many promising future directions, including developing more advanced models for the tasks, collecting more data, improving the annotation protocol, and exploring other applications for this data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Video Localized Narratives (VidLNs), a new form of multimodal video annotation that connects vision and language. The authors introduce an annotation protocol where annotators watch a video, identify key actors and events, select representative keyframes for each actor, and describe the events each actor is involved in using natural language while moving the mouse to trace objects being described. This results in narrations disentangled by actor that provide dense grounding for every word through synchronization of speech and mouse traces. The authors use this protocol to annotate 20k videos from OVIS, UVO, and Oops datasets with over 1.7 million words. Based on the annotations, they construct new benchmarks for Video Narrative Grounding (VNG), which requires localizing nouns in an input narrative on video frames, and Video Question Answering (VideoQA), featuring text-output and location-output questions. They implement baseline models and report initial results, demonstrating the complexity of the tasks. Overall, the paper presents a rich video annotation method and applies it to create challenging new tasks connecting vision and language.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Video Localized Narratives (VidLNs), a new form of multimodal video annotation that connects vision and language. The authors extend the existing Localized Narratives framework, where annotators describe images by speaking while moving their mouse to localize objects, to the video domain. They develop a protocol where annotators first identify key actors in a video, select representative keyframes for each actor, and then describe the events and actions involving each actor on their keyframes with synchronized mouse movements. This results in narrations from the point of view of each actor, disentangling complex interactions. The authors use this protocol to annotate 20k videos from 3 datasets with over 1.7 million words, creating grounded narrations with on average 75 words per video. 

Based on the VidLN annotations, the authors construct new benchmarks and models for the tasks of Video Narrative Grounding and Video Question Answering. For the former, the goal is to localize nouns from an input narrative in the video frames. They create datasets based on OVIS and UVO videos, comprising over 45k objects in 8k videos. For the latter, they generate a VideoQA benchmark on the Oops dataset, with 62k questions on 9.5k videos. The questions include text-output questions asking about events in the video, and location-output questions that require localizing an object. Overall, this work connects vision and language in videos through a new dense annotation procedure and demonstrates its utility by constructing large-scale video understanding benchmarks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes Video Localized Narratives (VidLNs), a new form of multimodal video annotation that connects vision and language. The key method is a new annotation protocol that allows annotators to tell the story of a video by speaking and moving the mouse pointer on keyframes to ground each word to a region in the video. 

Specifically, the annotators first watch and understand the video, then select the main "actors" and keyframes covering their actions. For each actor, the annotator describes the events it is involved in through full natural language sentences, while moving the mouse on the keyframes to localize the objects and actions they are mentioning. This is done separately for each actor to disentangle their stories and capture complex interactions. After transcribing the audio, automatic alignment is used to link words to mouse trace segments and provide grounding. 

The authors use this protocol to annotate 20k videos from 3 datasets with Video Localized Narratives. They demonstrate the applicability of this data by constructing new benchmarks for Video Narrative Grounding and Video Question Answering, and provide baseline experiments. The key novelty is the annotation protocol to obtain grounded narrations for actors in complex videos.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem the authors are addressing is how to create high-quality multimodal video annotations that connect vision and language in a detailed and accurate way. 

Specifically, they propose a new annotation approach called "Video Localized Narratives" (VidLNs) that allows annotators to tell rich stories about videos by speaking narrations while tracing objects on keyframes with the mouse. This connects language descriptions to visual grounding in the video.

The key challenges they aim to address are:

- Directly extending image-based Localized Narratives to video results in a "race against time" where annotators can only track a single object. Their new protocol avoids this.

- Capturing complex events in videos involving multiple actors and objects interacting, which requires disentangling their storylines. Their per-actor narrations achieve this. 

- Obtaining accurate spatial-temporal localization of words in the narrations. Their protocol results in higher quality localization than prior work on image-based Localized Narratives.

To demonstrate the value of their Video Localized Narratives, they use the annotations to generate new benchmarks for Video Narrative Grounding and Video Question Answering.

In summary, the main problem is creating high-quality video annotations that capture complex events and precisely ground language descriptions in the visual content. Their Video Localized Narratives approach aims to address this.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Video Localized Narratives (VidLNs), a new form of multimodal video annotation that connects vision and language. The authors propose an annotation protocol where annotators watch a video, identify the main actors, select keyframes for each actor, and describe the events each actor is involved in using natural language while tracing mouse segments on the keyframes to localize each word. This results in narrations disentangled by actor that describe complex interactions and events in detail. Using this protocol, the authors annotate 20k general domain videos from OVIS, UVO and Oops datasets with over 1.7 million words. Based on these narrations, they construct benchmarks for Video Narrative Grounding (VNG), which requires localizing nouns in an input narrative on the video frames, and Video Question Answering (VideoQA). For VNG they present two datasets on OVIS and UVO with over 45k objects. For VideoQA they create a dataset with two types of questions on Oops videos: text-output questions about events in the video, and location-output questions asking where objects are. They propose baseline methods for both tasks and analyze results. Overall, this work introduces high-quality narrations for complex videos disentangled by actor, and leverages them to create challenging new benchmarks connecting vision and language.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Video Localized Narratives (VidLNs), a new form of multimodal video annotation that connects vision and language. The annotation protocol involves annotators watching a video, identifying the main actors, selecting keyframes for each actor, and describing the events each actor is involved in using natural language while simultaneously tracing mouse segments on the keyframes to ground each word. This results in narrations that disentangle complex interactions between multiple actors and objects, with dense spatio-temporal grounding.

Overall, this work enables connecting vision and language in a detailed way for complex video understanding.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The Video Localized Narratives (VidLNs) annotation protocol involves selecting keyframes and then creating separate stories/transcriptions for each main actor in the video. Why is it beneficial to separate the stories per actor rather than have one combined story for the whole video? How does this allow the annotation to capture more complex events and interactions?

2. The VidLNs annotations provide spatial grounding by having annotators move the mouse cursor over objects while narrating the video. What techniques are used to ensure accurate alignment between words and mouse traces (segmentation/localization)? How is this an improvement over prior work like ImLNs? 

3. Explain the 5 main steps involved in creating the VidLN annotations in detail. What is the purpose of each step? How do they work together to create high quality narrations? 

4. The paper introduces a new task called Video Narrative Grounding (VNG). How is this different from prior tasks like referring video object segmentation (R-VOS)? What additional challenges does VNG introduce by taking a full narrative as input rather than a short phrase?

5. Explain how the authors repurposed the ReferFormer model for the VNG task. What modifications were made to the model architecture and input/output to adapt it from R-VOS to VNG?

6. The paper also introduces a VideoQA benchmark with two types of questions: text-output and location-output. Discuss the automatic generation and manual verification steps used to create high quality QA pairs from the VidLN annotations. 

7. Explain the evaluation protocol designed for the location-output questions in VideoQA. Why is it necessary to estimate approximate bounding boxes from the mouse traces rather than use the traces directly?

8. How effective were the baseline methods on the VNG and VideoQA tasks? What do the initial benchmark results reveal about the complexity and challenge of these new tasks?

9. Discuss some potential limitations of the VidLN annotation protocol. Are there certain complex video events or interactions it may not be able to capture effectively?

10. What new research directions are enabled through the introduction of VidLNs and the associated VNG and VideoQA benchmarks? What future work could build off of this?
