# [Connecting Vision and Language with Video Localized Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11217)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we create high-quality multimodal video annotations that connect vision and language by having annotators provide detailed spoken narrations and mouse traces on keyframes to capture complex events with multiple interacting actors?

The key hypothesis appears to be that a new annotation protocol based on disentangling narrations for individual actors on selected keyframes, along with careful instructions to annotators, can result in rich, accurate, and dense spatio-temporal groundings for video narrations. 

The authors then demonstrate the value of these Video Localized Narrative annotations by using them to generate benchmarks for video narrative grounding and video question answering tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of Video Localized Narratives (VidLNs), a new form of multimodal video annotation that connects vision and language. The key ideas are:

- They introduce a new annotation protocol that allows annotators to tell the story of a video by speaking narrations while moving the mouse to localize objects, actions, and attributes on selected keyframes. This results in long, detailed narrations grounded to spatio-temporal locations. 

- The protocol disentangles complex events involving multiple actors by having separate narrations from the point of view of each actor. This enables cleanly capturing interactions between multiple actors and objects.

- They use this protocol to annotate 20k videos from 3 datasets (OVIS, UVO, Oops) with over 1.7 million words, creating the largest and richest collection of general-domain video datasets with dense grounded narrations.

- They demonstrate the usefulness of VidLNs by constructing new benchmarks for Video Narrative Grounding and Video Question Answering, and provide baseline methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the VidLN annotation procedure and using it to create a large-scale dataset of videos paired with grounded, detailed narrations describing the events, which enables new video-language tasks to be studied.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes Video Localized Narratives, a new form of multimodal video annotation that connects vision and language by having annotators speak naturally about videos while tracing objects with a mouse, and uses this data to create benchmarks for video narrative grounding and question answering.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper on Video Localized Narratives to other related work:

- The paper focuses on annotating general domain videos with complex interactions between actors and objects. In contrast, many existing video+language datasets are in narrow domains like cooking or first-person videos. 

- The annotations capture entire stories about the videos by disentangling narratives from different actors' perspectives. This results in richer, longer descriptions compared to datasets with short single captions per video.

- The annotations provide dense grounding by tracing mouse movements over objects while narrating the video keyframes. This grounds every word, unlike datasets that only ground nouns. The traces are also more accurate than in prior work on image-based Localized Narratives.

- The paper demonstrates the value of Video Localized Narratives by constructing new challenging benchmarks for Video Narrative Grounding and Video Question Answering. These require deeper understanding compared to existing tasks and datasets in these areas.

- The paper establishes baseline results on the new benchmarks using state-of-the-art models. But there is significant room for improvement, showing these are not yet solved and can drive further research progress.

In summary, this work provides uniquely rich narrations of complex videos with accurate grounding, enables new challenging tasks, and will support advancing video+language research. The large scale annotation effort stands out compared to existing video annotation datasets.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more advanced models for the Video Narrative Grounding (VNG) and Video Question Answering (VideoQA) tasks proposed in the paper. The authors present baseline results using adaptations of existing models, but there is room for improvement. Specifically, they suggest developing models that can better disambiguate between multiple instances of the same object class in a video for VNG. 

- Exploring other applications and tasks enabled by the Video Localized Narratives annotations. The authors demonstrate the usefulness for VNG and VideoQA, but suggest the data could support other future vision-and-language tasks as well.

- Collecting Video Localized Narratives for additional video datasets. The authors annotated three diverse datasets in this work, but suggest extending the annotation protocol to other video domains could be valuable.

- Improving the annotation protocol and interface to make it even more efficient. The current protocol produces high quality annotations, but requires multiple manual steps. The authors suggest further optimizations to simplify and streamline the process could be explored.

- Studying the narratives themselves, for example to do linguistic analysis of the language and explore the story structures. The narratives could enable research directions beyond just grounding words in the video.

- Using the localized narratives for video summarization, either generating summaries directly or as supervision. The narratives describe the key events in each video and could guide summarization.

Overall, the authors propose new high-quality multimodal annotations in the form of Video Localized Narratives, and demonstrate they enable constructing challenging new vision-and-language tasks. But they suggest many promising future directions, including developing more advanced models for the tasks, collecting more data, improving the annotation protocol, and exploring other applications for this data.
