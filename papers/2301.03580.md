# [Designing BERT for Convolutional Networks: Sparse and Hierarchical   Masked Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03580)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we extend the success of BERT-style masked image modeling pre-training from vision transformers to convolutional neural networks (convnets)?

The key challenges identified are:

1) Convolution operations cannot handle irregular, randomly masked input images like transformers can. 

2) The single-scale nature of BERT pre-training is inconsistent with the hierarchical structure of convnets.

To address these challenges, the main contributions of the paper are:

1) Using sparse convolution to encode the unmasked image patches, treating them as sparse voxels in a 3D point cloud. This allows handling of irregular masked inputs.

2) Designing a hierarchical decoder to reconstruct images from multi-scale encoded features. This takes advantage of the hierarchical representation in convnets. 

3) Proposing the SparK (Sparse masKed modeling) framework that integrates these solutions into a BERT-style pre-training approach for convnets.

By evaluating SparK on ImageNet classification and COCO detection/segmentation, the authors demonstrate superior transfer learning performance compared to prior self-supervised methods for both convnets and transformers. This shows the promise of extending masked modeling to convnets through solutions tackling their architectural differences from transformers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes SparK (Sparse masked modeling with hierarchy), the first BERT-style pre-training method that can be directly applied to convolutional neural networks (convnets) without any backbone modifications. 

2. It identifies and overcomes two key obstacles in applying masked image modeling to convnets: (a) convnets cannot handle irregular, randomly masked input images; (b) the single-scale nature of BERT pre-training is inconsistent with the hierarchical structure of convnets.

3. It introduces two key techniques to overcome the above issues:

- Uses sparse convolution to encode the unmasked image patches, treating them as sparse voxels in 3D point clouds. This is the first work using sparse convolution for 2D masked modeling.

- Employs a hierarchical decoder to reconstruct images from multi-scale encoded features, embracing the advantage of convnet's hierarchy.

4. Extensive experiments show SparK significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art contrastive learning and transformer-based masked modeling methods on various downstream tasks. It demonstrates the promise of extending BERT-style pre-training to convnets.

5. Ablation studies validate the importance of the two key techniques (sparse convolution and hierarchical decoding) introduced in SparK.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a general framework SparK that makes BERT-style masked modeling suitable for convolutional networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results and showing the potential of generative pre-training on convnets.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes SparK, a method to adapt BERT-style masked image modeling pre-training to convolutional neural networks by using sparse convolutions to handle irregular masked inputs and a hierarchical decoder to reconstruct multi-scale features.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper proposes SparK, a new self-supervised learning method for pre-training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using sparse masked modeling and a hierarchical decoder. The key novelties are using sparse convolution to handle irregular masked images as input to CNNs, and designing a hierarchical decoder to reconstruct images from multi-scale encoded features.

- Most prior work on self-supervised pre-training for CNNs has focused on contrastive learning methods like MoCo, SimCLR, BYOL, etc. SparK is the first to show successful application of BERT-style masked modeling to CNNs. So it demonstrates a new direction for self-supervised CNN pre-training.

- For vision transformers (ViTs), masked image modeling has become popular recently with BEiT, MAE, SimMIM, etc. But extending these methods directly to CNNs is difficult due to CNNs' requirements for regular grid inputs. SparK provides a solution via sparse convolution.

- Compared to transformer-based methods like MAE and SimMIM, SparK achieves better performance when pre-trained and transferred to downstream tasks based on CNNs like ResNet and ConvNeXt. This shows the effectiveness of designing self-supervised pre-training specifically tailored for CNN architectures.

- The hierarchical design in SparK is motivated by prior work on hierarchical visual systems and multi-scale feature learning in CNNs. But SparK is the first to incorporate this inductive bias into self-supervised pre-training.

- For sparse convolution, prior work has used it for 3D vision tasks or accelerating 2D CNNs. SparK innovatively leverages it to enable masked modeling for CNN pre-training.

- Overall, SparK advances the state-of-the-art in self-supervised learning for CNNs by adapting masked modeling in an architecture-aware way. The designs are well-motivated by prior work, while the approach and its strengths are novel.

In summary, SparK makes important contributions that highlight the potential of extending BERT-style pre-training to CNNs by handling their architectural inductive biases. The comparisons show SparK's advantages over existing methods on self-supervised CNN learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing more advanced sparse convolution techniques and frameworks to further improve the efficiency and scalability of SparK. The paper points out that sparse convolution was crucial for adapting BERT-style masking to convnets, but there is room for improvement in terms of computational and memory optimization.

- Exploring other masking strategies besides the uniform random patching masking used in SparK. The authors suggest trying different masking distributions like block-wise or semantic masking. This may allow capturing different levels of visual semantics.

- Applying SparK to pre-train an even wider range of convnet architectures beyond ResNets and ConvNeXTs. The favorable scaling behavior shown indicates SparK could potentially benefit other recent convnet models.

- Testing the combination of SparK with contrastive learning techniques. The paper hypothesizes that adding contrastive objectives on top of the reconstruction loss may provide complementary benefits.

- Developing new decoder architectures to better take advantage of the hierarchical features from the convnet encoder. The simple lightweight decoder used in SparK may not be optimal.

- Exploring semi-supervised and transfer learning settings for SparK pre-training. The paper focuses on self-supervised pre-training on a single large dataset, but extending to other scenarios could be valuable.

- Applying SparK for pre-training in other visual domains like video, point clouds, medical images, etc. This could reveal the generalizability of SparK's designs.

In summary, the major directions are around improving the efficiency, flexibility and scalability of SparK's core techniques, as well as testing the limits of its applicability across models, datasets, and tasks. The results so far seem very promising for advancing masked modeling on convnets.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper identifies two key challenges in extending masked image modeling, which has been highly successful for vision transformers, to convolutional neural networks (CNNs): (1) CNNs cannot handle the irregular, randomly masked inputs used in approaches like BERT, and (2) the single-scale nature of BERT-style pre-training is inconsistent with the hierarchical structure of CNNs. To address the first issue, the authors treat the unmasked image patches as sparse voxels in a 3D point cloud and use sparse convolutions to encode them. This allows CNNs to accurately eliminate the masked information while handling the irregular inputs. For the second issue, they employ a hierarchical decoder that reconstructs the image from multi-scale encoded features, embracing the CNN hierarchy. Their proposed approach, called Sparse masKed modeling (SparK), works with any CNN architecture without modification. Experiments on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection/segmentation show SparK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods for both CNNs and transformers. The gains are especially large for object detection and segmentation, demonstrating SparK learns highly transferable representations. Overall, the work illustrates a promising direction of using masked modeling techniques like BERT to pre-train CNNs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called SparK (Sparse masKed modeling with hierarchy) for pre-training convolutional neural networks (convnets) using a BERT-style masked image modeling approach. The authors identify two key challenges in adapting BERT pre-training to convnets: (1) convnets cannot handle the irregular, randomly masked input images that transformer models like BERT can, and (2) BERT's single-scale pre-training is inconsistent with the hierarchical structure of convnets. To address the first issue, the authors propose treating the unmasked image patches as sparse voxels in a 3D point cloud and using sparse convolutions to encode them. This allows convnets to accurately remove information from masked patches. For the second issue, they propose a hierarchical decoder that reconstructs the image from multi-scale encoded features. 

The proposed SparK method is evaluated by pre-training ResNet and ConvNeXt models on ImageNet then fine-tuning on downstream tasks. Results show SparK outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods and transformer-based masked modeling by large margins on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. For example, a ConvNeXt model pre-trained with SparK achieves over 3.5% higher COCO object detection and instance segmentation accuracy compared to the supervised baseline. Additional analyses demonstrate SparK's ability to scale to larger models and its favorable computational efficiency. The results indicate SparK provides the first effective way to adapt BERT-style pre-training to convnets, unlocking their potential for self-supervised learning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes SparK, a method for extending masked image modeling, which has been successful for vision transformers, to convolutional neural networks (convnets). The key ideas are (1) to use sparse convolution to handle the irregular masked input images, treating the visible patches as sparse 3D point clouds, and (2) to use a hierarchical decoder with multi-scale features to reconstruct the image, embracing the advantage of convnets' hierarchical structure. Specifically, images are masked in a patch-wise manner, with visible patches gathered into a sparse image and encoded by sparse convolution. The multi-scale encoder features are "densified" by filling empty positions with learned mask embeddings, then fed into a hierarchical decoder to reconstruct the original image, with loss computed only on the masked patches. After pre-training, only the convolutional encoder is used for downstream tasks. This allows masked modeling to be effectively applied to any convnet without modifying the backbone architecture. Experiments show SparK outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on various downstream tasks.
