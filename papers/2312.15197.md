# [TransFace: Unit-Based Audio-Visual Speech Synthesizer for Talking Head   Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15197)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Talking head translation aims to convert speech from one language into a talking head video (synchronized audio-visual speech) in another language. 
- Existing methods rely on cascading multiple models (ASR, NMT, TTS, wav2lip), resulting in slow inference speed, cascading errors, and lack of ability to handle textless languages.  
- Talking head translation also suffers from lack of parallel visual corpus, and fixed number of reference frames leading to duplicate frames.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes TransFace, a direct talking head translation framework with two components:
  - Speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) model to translate source speech into target discrete units.
  - Unit-based audio-visual speech synthesizer (Unit2Lip) to convert units into synchronized audio-visual speech in parallel.
- Unit2Lip achieves faster inference by parallel audio and visual synthesis, instead of serial synthesis.
- S2UT learns cross-lingual speech mappings, enabling talking head translation without parallel visual data.
- A bounded duration predictor is introduced to ensure isometric translation and prevent duplicate frames.

Main Contributions:
- First direct talking head translation framework without relying on text or audio speech
- A unit-based audio-visual synthesizer (Unit2Lip) that synthesizes audio and visual speech in parallel, accelerating inference
- Bounded duration predictor to achieve 100% isometric translation and avoid abrupt video transitions
- Experiments show Unit2Lip improves synchronization and achieves 4.35x speedup
- TransFace obtains state-of-the-art 61.93 BLEU on LRS3-T and 100% isometric translations

In summary, TransFace provides an effective framework for direct talking head translation that eliminates issues with existing cascading methods like slow inference and lack of visual data. Key innovations like the unit-based parallel audio-visual synthesizer and bounded duration predictor address important challenges in this domain.
