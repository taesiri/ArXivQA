# [TransFace: Unit-Based Audio-Visual Speech Synthesizer for Talking Head   Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15197)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Talking head translation aims to convert speech from one language into a talking head video (synchronized audio-visual speech) in another language. 
- Existing methods rely on cascading multiple models (ASR, NMT, TTS, wav2lip), resulting in slow inference speed, cascading errors, and lack of ability to handle textless languages.  
- Talking head translation also suffers from lack of parallel visual corpus, and fixed number of reference frames leading to duplicate frames.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes TransFace, a direct talking head translation framework with two components:
  - Speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) model to translate source speech into target discrete units.
  - Unit-based audio-visual speech synthesizer (Unit2Lip) to convert units into synchronized audio-visual speech in parallel.
- Unit2Lip achieves faster inference by parallel audio and visual synthesis, instead of serial synthesis.
- S2UT learns cross-lingual speech mappings, enabling talking head translation without parallel visual data.
- A bounded duration predictor is introduced to ensure isometric translation and prevent duplicate frames.

Main Contributions:
- First direct talking head translation framework without relying on text or audio speech
- A unit-based audio-visual synthesizer (Unit2Lip) that synthesizes audio and visual speech in parallel, accelerating inference
- Bounded duration predictor to achieve 100% isometric translation and avoid abrupt video transitions
- Experiments show Unit2Lip improves synchronization and achieves 4.35x speedup
- TransFace obtains state-of-the-art 61.93 BLEU on LRS3-T and 100% isometric translations

In summary, TransFace provides an effective framework for direct talking head translation that eliminates issues with existing cascading methods like slow inference and lack of visual data. Key innovations like the unit-based parallel audio-visual synthesizer and bounded duration predictor address important challenges in this domain.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes TransFace, a direct audio-visual speech-to-speech translation system that synthesizes a talking head video in the target language by translating from input speech into discrete units and generating synchronized audio and visual speech in parallel, while addressing challenges like slow cascaded systems, lack of parallel data, and inconsistent output lengths.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing the first direct talking head translation framework, TransFace, that can synthesize talking heads without relying on audio speech and text. This avoids the slowdown and cumulative error typically associated with model cascading.

2) Proposing the first unit-based audio-visual speech synthesizer, Unit2Lip, which can synthesize audio and visual speech in parallel while maintaining synchronization with the audio. This achieves a 4.35x speedup in inference.  

3) Proposing a bounded duration predictor that achieves 100% isometric (same length) talking head translation. This is important for streaming translation scenarios and avoids jarring video transitions by preventing duplicate frames.

4) Demonstrating through experiments that Unit2Lip achieves improved synchronization between original and generated speech compared to other methods. And TransFace achieves state-of-the-art BLEU scores and user acceptance on the LRS3-T dataset for Spanish to English and French to English translation.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing the first direct talking head translation system, TransFace, that synthesizes talking heads without relying on cascaded models, improves speed through parallel audio-visual synthesis, and enables isometric translation. The experiments validate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work on direct talking head translation include:

- TransFace - The name of the proposed direct talking head translation framework.

- Unit2Lip - The name of the proposed unit-based audio-visual speech synthesizer model which can generate synchronized audio and visual speech from discrete units.

- Discrete units - Self-supervised learned representations that encode audio speech signals. Used to train speech-to-unit translation model. 

- Speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) - Model that translates source speech into target language discrete units. Enables direct translation without text.

- Bounded duration predictor - Proposed module that ensures generated translated talking head matches length of original video by adjusting unit durations. Enables isometric translation.  

- Isometric translation - Translated talking head has same length/duration as original talking head video. Prevents duplicate frames and jitter.

- Parallel synthesis - Unit2Lip performs parallel audio and visual speech synthesis from units, unlike cascaded textual synthesis. Faster inference.

- Zero-shot talking head translation - Cross-lingual discrete unit mapping allows Unit2Lip to perform talking head translation without parallel visual data.

In summary, the key ideas relate to direct speech-to-speech translation for talking heads via discrete units, parallel AV synthesis, and bounded duration control for isometric translation. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
