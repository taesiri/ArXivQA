# [ItD: Large Language Models Can Teach Themselves Induction through   Deduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05789)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many NLP tasks but still have limited ability for inductive reasoning - i.e. discovering consistent transformations from input-output examples. 
- Existing methods try to improve LLMs' induction ability using post-processing approaches like hypothesis search and refinement, but are still constrained by the models' inherent limitations.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new framework called Induction through Deduction (ItD) to enable LLMs to teach themselves induction through leveraging their stronger deductive capabilities.

- ItD has two main components:
   1) Deductive Data Generation: Uses the LLM's deductive ability to generate synthetic data resembling the task distribution. 
   2) Naive Bayesian Induction: Fine-tunes the LLM on single input-output pairs and uses a Naive Bayesian approach to combine predictions, optimizing sample usage.

- Together this allows improving inherent inductive capability of LLMs by using their deductive strengths.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of the novel ItD framework to improve LLMs' inductive powers through deductive reasoning.
- Deductive Data Generation method to create effective fine-tuning data in a self-supervised way, needing no human annotations.
- Naive Bayesian Induction to optimize sample usage and performance with more observed samples.
- Experiments showing state-of-the-art performance gains over previous induction methods on two benchmarks.
- Analysis verifying benefits of the two key ItD components.

In summary, the paper presents a way for LLMs to teach themselves to better perform induction via deduction through the introduction of the ItD framework and its associated techniques. Experiments demonstrate clear improvements in inductive reasoning over prior approaches.
