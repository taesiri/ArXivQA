# [VAD: Vectorized Scene Representation for Efficient Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12077)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to develop an end-to-end autonomous driving system that achieves both high performance and high efficiency. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new vectorized paradigm called VAD for end-to-end autonomous driving. The key hypotheses are:

1) Modeling the driving scene with vectorized representation (vectorized agent motion and map) instead of dense rasterized representation can improve efficiency and preserve useful structure information. 

2) The vectorized scene representation can be effectively utilized to improve planning performance, both implicitly via query interaction and explicitly via proposed vectorized planning constraints.

3) The vectorized paradigm can achieve state-of-the-art end-to-end autonomous driving performance with high efficiency.

In summary, this paper explores a new vectorized representation and planning paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. The central hypothesis is that with proper modeling and utilization of the vectorized scene information, the autonomous driving system can achieve better performance and efficiency compared to previous paradigms relying on dense rasterized representations. The experiments verify the advantages of the proposed VAD method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes VAD, an end-to-end vectorized paradigm for autonomous driving that models the driving scene using a fully vectorized representation instead of dense rasterized representations. 

- VAD uses vectorized map elements and agent motions to provide explicit instance-level constraints and guidance for trajectory planning, improving safety and efficiency.

- It introduces techniques like query interaction and vectorized planning constraints to effectively incorporate vectorized scene information into planning.

- VAD achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end planning performance on the nuScenes dataset, significantly reducing collision rate and planning error compared to prior methods while also improving inference speed.

In summary, the key ideas are using a vectorized rather than rasterized scene representation for efficiency, and leveraging the vectorized information explicitly through techniques like planning constraints to improve planning safety and accuracy in an end-to-end driving model. The impressive results demonstrate the potential of vectorized representations and constraints for autonomous driving systems.
