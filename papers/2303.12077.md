# [VAD: Vectorized Scene Representation for Efficient Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12077)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to develop an end-to-end autonomous driving system that achieves both high performance and high efficiency. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new vectorized paradigm called VAD for end-to-end autonomous driving. The key hypotheses are:

1) Modeling the driving scene with vectorized representation (vectorized agent motion and map) instead of dense rasterized representation can improve efficiency and preserve useful structure information. 

2) The vectorized scene representation can be effectively utilized to improve planning performance, both implicitly via query interaction and explicitly via proposed vectorized planning constraints.

3) The vectorized paradigm can achieve state-of-the-art end-to-end autonomous driving performance with high efficiency.

In summary, this paper explores a new vectorized representation and planning paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. The central hypothesis is that with proper modeling and utilization of the vectorized scene information, the autonomous driving system can achieve better performance and efficiency compared to previous paradigms relying on dense rasterized representations. The experiments verify the advantages of the proposed VAD method.
