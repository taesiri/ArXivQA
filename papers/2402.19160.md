# [Effective Message Hiding with Order-Preserving Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19160)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing CNN-based approaches for image steganography struggle to achieve high accuracy in recovering hidden messages while maintaining imperceptibility and high capacity. This stems from two main limitations - CNNs disrupt the sequential order of message bits during encoding, and they inadequately fuse message and image features due to modality differences.  

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes StegaFormer, an MLP-based framework to enhance message recovery through order preservation and effective cross-modality fusion. It has three key components:

1) Order-Preserving Message Encoder (OPME) and Decoder (OPMD): Encode and decode messages by segmenting into equal-length chunks, mapping each chunk separately using MLPs to retain order locally. Incorporate positional embeddings and self-attention to maintain global order across chunks.

2) Global Message-Image Fusion (GMIF): Employ windowed multi-head self-attention to enable global interactions between message and image features for effective fusion into stego image features. 

3) Custom message preparation and multi-scale fusion between image and message features.

Main Contributions:

- Identify limitations of CNNs for image steganography related to order disruption and inadequate fusion.

- Propose shift from CNN to MLP approach and introduce novel OPME, OPMD modules to preserve message order using segmentation, positional encodings and self-attention.

- Design GMIF module for enhanced cross-modality fusion using windowed multi-head self-attention.

- Achieve new state-of-the-art in accuracy (>99%), capacity (up to 8 bpp) and imperceptibility on COCO and Div2K datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of the approach.

In summary, StegaFormer presents an MLP-based steganography method with specialized modules for order preservation and global fusion to advance message hiding performance. Experiments validate remarkable improvements over previous CNN-based techniques.
