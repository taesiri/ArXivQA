# [Barkour: Benchmarking Animal-level Agility with Quadruped Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14654)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we develop controllers that enable legged robots to achieve animal-like agility and versatility?Specifically, the authors aim to address the lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation methods for measuring agility in legged robots. To tackle this, they propose the "Barkour" benchmark, which is an obstacle course inspired by dog agility competitions. The paper then explores two learning-based methods to establish strong baselines on this benchmark:1) Training specialist policies for individual skills like jumping, then combining them. 2) Distilling the specialist policies into a single generalist "Locomotion-Transformer" policy using a transformer architecture.The overall goal is to demonstrate that by optimizing for performance on the Barkour benchmark, they can make progress towards more agile and versatile quadruped robot controllers that begin to approach animal-like abilities. Evaluating the simulation-trained policies on real hardware helps validate the feasibility of their methods.In summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed Barkour benchmark, along with the learning-based control methods, can enable enhanced agility and versatility in quadruped robots. The paper aims to demonstrate this through strong baseline results on the benchmark tasks using both specialist and generalist approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Barkour, a new benchmark for measuring agility in quadruped robots. The key ideas are:- Barkour is an obstacle course inspired by dog agility competitions. It consists of diverse obstacles like weave poles, an A-frame, and a broad jump that require agile locomotion skills like running, turning, jumping, etc. - Barkour provides a standardized environment and intuitive scoring based on completion time to quantify overall agility. This allows for comparing different algorithms and hardware platforms.- The authors present two learning-based methods as baselines - training specialist policies for each obstacle type and distilling them into a generalist transformer policy called Locomotion-Transformer. - They demonstrate their methods on a custom quadruped robot, completing the Barkour course at about half the speed of a dog. This shows progress towards animal-level agility but also highlights gaps that remain.In summary, the key contribution is proposing Barkour as a benchmark to push research towards more agile legged robots by requiring the combination of diverse locomotion skills in a measurable way. The learning-based baselines also showcase methods to tackle the benchmark.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces Barkour, an obstacle course benchmark for quantifying agility in quadruped robots, and demonstrates two learning-based methods (specialist policies and a generalist Locomotion-Transformer policy) that can complete the benchmark tasks in simulation and on real hardware.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces Barkour, a new quadruped robot agility benchmark inspired by dog agility competitions. Here are some key ways this work compares to prior research on benchmarking legged robot agility:- Most prior benchmarking efforts like the metrics proposed by Eckert et al. focus on quantifying performance on individual skills like jumping, balancing, etc. Barkour aims to evaluate overall agility through a full obstacle course requiring a diverse skillset. - Barkour provides a concrete standardized environment and scoring system. Many previous benchmarks only proposed metrics without a standardized setup. Having a common environment and tasks makes it easier to directly compare different methods.- The paper shows strong initial results from learning-based controllers, scoring 0.91 and completing the course in around 20 seconds. This is still far from animal agility, suggesting ample room for improvement. Many prior quadruped agility skills like jumping were only shown in isolation.- The learning-based methods rely on full state information. Future work could explore solving Barkour with only on-board sensing. The standardized setup makes it easy to study different perception modalities.- Barkour currently tests reactive skills. An exciting direction is incorporating long-horizon planning, as animals skillfully plan their movements over the full course.Overall, Barkour advances quadruped agility benchmarking through its standardized course setting and intuitive time-based scoring metric. By open-sourcing the environment and establishing learning-based baselines, the authors enable the community to easily build upon this benchmark to drive further progress in agile legged locomotion research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Improving the performance and robustness of the Locomotion-Transformer policy to achieve dog-level agility in completing the Barkour course. The authors note there is still a significant gap between the robot's performance and the agility of real dogs. - Developing methods to handle the Barkour tasks using only on-board sensing, without relying on motion capture systems or CAD models of the environment. This includes low-level control as well as high-level navigation.- Exploring the impact of different robot hardware designs and form factors on performance in the Barkour benchmark. This could involve testing different leg configurations, adding spine flexibility, improving proprioception, etc.- Evaluating Barkour performance in interactive settings with a human handler leading and directing the robot, similar to how dog agility competitions operate.- Extending the framework to learn more complex behaviors beyond low-level motor skills, as demonstrated by their experiment training a course-specific policy directly from hardware data.- Continuing to expand the complexity of the Barkour benchmark by adding more obstacles, increasing the size, and adapting the scoring system.- Using Barkour to benchmark sim-to-real transfer techniques and dynamics randomization methods.- Leveraging faster simulators like Brax to accelerate policy training and hyperparameter tuning.In summary, the key directions are developing more capable policies, moving to fully onboard sensing and control, studying the impacts of hardware design, increasing the complexity of behaviors learned, and expanding the Barkour benchmark itself. The authors present this as an open challenge to drive further research and improvements in agile legged robot locomotion.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces Barkour, a new benchmark for evaluating agility in quadruped robots. Barkour is an obstacle course inspired by dog agility competitions, consisting of obstacles like weave poles, an A-frame ramp, and a broad jump. The goal is for a quadruped robot to complete the course as quickly as possible, with penalties for failing obstacles or exceeding the allotted time. The benchmark is designed to require a diverse set of locomotion skills like running, jumping, balancing, and turning. The scoring system, based on dog agility rules, incentivizes developing versatile and maneuverable locomotion controllers.To establish strong baselines on Barkour, the authors present two learning-based methods trained in simulation. The first trains specialist policies for each obstacle type using reinforcement learning, then combines them with a high-level controller. The second distills these skills into a single generalist policy called Locomotion-Transformer, based on a Transformer architecture. Both methods are tested on a custom quadruped robot, completing the course at about half the speed of a dog. While not yet solved, the work demonstrates the potential of Barkour as a benchmark and the authors' methods as a step towards animal-level agility in legged robots. Overall, the paper makes a case for standardized benchmarks like Barkour to drive progress in agile and versatile robot locomotion.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents two learning-based methods for controlling a quadruped robot to complete an obstacle course (Barkour) inspired by dog agility competitions. The first method trains three specialist policies using reinforcement learning in simulation to perform omnidirectional walking, slope climbing, and jumping. These policies are combined using a high-level navigation controller that switches between them based on the robot's location. The second method collects data from the specialist policies and distills it into a single generalist policy called Locomotion-Transformer. This transformer-based model takes as input proprioceptive states, terrain information, and velocity commands over a history window. It is trained via behavioral cloning to predict motor actions. The generalist policy removes the need for explicitly switching between specialists.Both methods are evaluated on a physical quadruped robot. The specialist policies complete the course at half the speed of a dog, while the generalist policy achieves a slightly lower but still respectable performance. The work provides standardized benchmarks and strong baselines for developing agile quadruped robot controllers.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the lack of standardized benchmarks for measuring agility in legged robots. Specifically, it proposes a new benchmark called "Barkour" to quantify agility in quadruped robots. The key elements of the problem statement are:- There is growing interest in developing legged robots that can move like animals and exhibit agile locomotion skills. However, the field lacks systematic benchmarks to measure the agility performance of controllers and hardware.- Existing metrics and test environments for legged robot agility are ad-hoc and make it difficult to compare results across different research efforts. - A good benchmark for agile locomotion should require a diverse set of skills, be non-trivial to exploit, and encourage development of controllers that can move quickly yet controllably.- Well-established agility benchmarks exist for animals, such as dog agility competitions. These provide inspiration for developing robotic benchmarks.- There is a need for a standardized agile locomotion benchmark for quadruped robots, akin to dog agility competitions, that can serve as a common testbed to evaluate different algorithms and hardware designs.In summary, the key problem is the lack of standardized benchmarks to measure agility in legged robots. The paper aims to address this by proposing "Barkour", a new quadruped agility benchmark inspired by dog agility competitions.
