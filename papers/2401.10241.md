# [Zero Bubble Pipeline Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10241)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Pipeline parallelism is a key technique for distributed training of large neural network models. However, its efficiency suffers from pipeline bubbles which were previously thought to be inevitable. This work aims to achieve zero pipeline bubbles to unlock the full potential of pipeline parallelism.

Proposed Solution: 
- The key idea is to split the backward pass into two parts - one that computes gradient w.r.t input, and another w.r.t parameters. This exposes more parallelism and flexibility in scheduling.
- Based on this, the authors design novel scheduling strategies called ZB-H1 and ZB-H2 that significantly reduce bubbles compared to prior 1F1B baseline. ZB-H2 achieves close to zero bubbles.
- They further develop an automatic scheduling algorithm that finds the optimal schedule based on model configuration and memory constraints. This performs better than hand-designed schedules. 
- To truly achieve zero bubbles, they introduce a post-update validation strategy to remove the need for synchronization during optimizer step.

Main Contributions:
- First work to achieve close to zero pipeline bubbles under synchronous training semantics. Previous works only reduce bubbles under asynchronous settings.  
- Introduces the key idea of splitting backward pass to enable more efficient scheduling.
- Proposes both hand-designed and automatic scheduling strategies that outperform prior 1F1B baseline by up to 23% in throughput.
- Develops techniques like post-update validation that remove optimizer synchronization and enable zero bubble scheduling.
- The ideas proposed are simple yet effective, and mark a major step towards harnessing the true potential of pipeline parallelism.

In summary, this work makes significant contributions through innovative ideas to unlock the efficiency of pipeline parallel training via zero bubble scheduling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel pipeline parallelism scheduling strategy that splits the backward pass into computing gradients w.r.t. inputs and parameters, enabling the first zero-bubble synchronous pipeline training, significantly improving efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is introducing a novel pipeline parallelism scheduling strategy that, to the authors' knowledge, is the first to successfully achieve zero pipeline bubbles under synchronous training semantics. Specifically:

- They split the backward computation into two parts - one that computes gradient for the input and another for the parameters. Based on this, they design new pipeline schedules like \zbh{1} and \zbh{2} that significantly reduce bubbles compared to prior methods like 1F1B.

- They develop an automatic scheduling algorithm that finds the optimal schedule based on model configuration and memory limits, outperforming handcrafted schedules. This makes the method adaptable to realistic scenarios.

- To truly achieve zero bubble, they introduce a technique to bypass synchronizations during the optimizer step while still preserving semantics. 

- They propose a \zbv schedule that achieves zero bubble within the same memory limits as 1F1B by dividing the model into 2p chunks and assigning 2 chunks per worker in a "V" pattern.

In summary, the key innovation is splitting backward pass and developing schedules, algorithms, and techniques to minimize or eliminate pipeline bubbles, which helps unlock the true potential of pipeline parallelism.

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and contents, here are some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper:

- Pipeline parallelism - Splitting a neural network model across different devices to train in a pipelined fashion. A key technique for distributed training.

- Pipeline bubbles - Idle time when some devices in the pipeline are waiting due to dependencies, which reduces training efficiency.

- Synchronous training - Training where forward and backward passes are executed in lockstep across devices to ensure consistency.

- Scheduling strategies - Methods to schedule the ordering of forward, backward, and weight update passes to optimize pipeline efficiency.

- Zero bubble - The key innovation in this paper, achieving no idle bubbles during synchronous pipelined training through novel scheduling.

- Activation memory - Memory required to store activations between forward and backward passes, a key constraint.

- Microbatches - Small batches used internally in the pipeline to enable parallelism, while accumulating gradients over multiple steps.

- Automatic scheduling algorithm - Proposed method to automatically search for an optimal schedule based on model specifics to minimize bubbles.

- Optimizer synchronization - Global synchronization during weight updates, avoided through proposed post-validation approach.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The key idea behind the proposed method is to split the backward computation into two parts - one that computes gradient for the input and another for the parameters. Can you explain the intuition behind why this leads to reduced pipeline bubbles?

2. The paper introduces two handcrafted schedules - ZB-H1 and ZB-H2. Can you analyze the tradeoffs between these schedules in terms of bubble size, peak memory usage and ease of implementation? 

3. The automatic scheduling algorithm relies on accurate profiling of T_F, T_B, T_W and T_comm. How sensitive is the schedule efficiency to errors or changes in these profiled times? Are there ways to make the algorithm robust to such changes?

4. Explain the memory limit analysis done in Section 5.3 and Appendix C. What is the threshold of memory limit beyond which further bubble rate reductions have diminishing returns?  

5. The ZB-V schedule is designed specifically to reduce memory consumption. Analyze the tradeoffs involved in terms of bubble rate, ease of implementation and scalability compared to ZB-H2.

6. The post-validation strategy is proposed to replace synchronizations during the optimizer step. What are the risks involved? Under what conditions might this strategy fail or compromise training correctness?

7. The method targets improving strong scaling efficiency for pipeline parallelism. How well would it transfer to the weak scaling setting? What modifications might be needed?

8. The experiments are done on Transformer-based architectures. How would the efficiency gains transfer over to other architectures like CNNs or MLPs?  

9. The method is evaluated on model sizes up to 28 billion parameters. Can you analyze how the efficiency might evolve for even larger models with 100s of billions of parameters?

10. The paper targets synchronous pipeline parallelism specifically. Can the ideas proposed here be extended to asynchronous pipelines as well? What might be the challenges?
