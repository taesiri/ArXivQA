# [Context-Based Multimodal Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04650)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal fusion models are effective at combining information from different modalities but have limitations in aligning data distributions across modalities, causing inconsistencies and difficulties in learning robust representations. 
- Multimodal alignment models address this issue but often require training large models from scratch with extensive datasets, which is computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a model called Context-Based Multimodal Fusion (CBMF) that combines both multimodal fusion and alignment in an efficient manner. 
- CBMF utilizes a frugal approach - it aligns large pre-trained modality-specific models by freezing them during training. Only a small Deep Fusion Encoder (DFE) is trained, which fuses the context vector and embedding output of each frozen aligned model.

Main Contributions:
- Frugal approach to alignment that reduces computational costs by freezing large pre-trained models and only training a small DFE.
- Incorporates context-based fusion where each modality has a context vector that is fused with the embeddings to help the DFE differentiate between modalities.
- Can leverage benefits of large pre-trained models while aligning them on small datasets, avoiding extensive data requirements.
- Versatile - can align any models on small or large scale datasets and transfer learned DFE to downstream tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is an efficient context-based multimodal fusion approach that integrates both fusion and alignment. By only training a small DFE, it provides a cost-effective way to leverage large pre-trained models. The context-based fusion also helps handle multimodality.
