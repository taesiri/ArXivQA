# [CLIPping the Deception: Adapting Vision-Language Models for Universal   Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12927)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Recent advancements in generative models like GANs and Diffusion models have made it easy to synthesize highly realistic fake imagery. This has increased the need for effective fake image detection methods.  

- Existing detection models fail to generalize well across different fake image distributions, since they focus on artifacts present in images from the distribution they are trained on.

Proposed Solution  
- Leverage vision-language models like CLIP that are pre-trained on diverse image distributions and adapted via transfer learning for fake detection. This allows tapping into rich generalizable representations.

- Explore four transfer learning strategies to adapt CLIP - Linear Probing, Fine-Tuning, Adapter Networks and Prompt Tuning. Assess their effectiveness for fake detection.

- Use a single GAN dataset (ProGAN) for training, and test extensively on unseen data from 21 distinct generators (GANs, Diffusions, Commercial tools).

Key Contributions
- Empirical analysis revealing Prompt Tuning as the optimal strategy to adapt CLIP for superior fake detection performance. 

- Proposed model with Prompt Tuning surpasses state-of-the-art by 5.01% mAP, using only 200k training images unlike 720k used in prior works.

- Assess model robustness via training with limited data, few-shot experiments and evaluation on compressed/blurred images across diverse test datasets.

- Plan to release code and models to aid further research on adapting vision-language models for generalized fake detection.
