# [Evaluating the Utility of Model Explanations for Model Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06032)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explainable AI methods like saliency maps are motivated to help humans make better decisions about AI models. But it's unclear if they actually improve human decision-making in practical scenarios like model development. 

- Prior work has limitations: focused on algorithmic metrics rather than human studies, subjective usefulness measures without grounding, or tasks that may not reflect real-world needs.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct a mixed-methods user study to evaluate if saliency maps improve performance on model selection and counterfactual simulation tasks.

- Test SmoothGrad, GradCAM (popular methods) and an "oracle" synthetic explanation (upper bound on usefulness). 

- Study two interfaces: explanations provided only during training, or during both training and evaluation.

- Users are ML engineers working on image classification tasks.

Key Findings:
- Did not find significant improvement from any explanation method on either task accuracy. This includes the oracle explanation.

- However, explanations did help users more accurately describe model behaviors in some cases.

- Even for the simplified oracle method designed to directly reveal answers, interpretations varied widely between users.

Main Contributions:  
- Rigorous evaluation grounded in realistic ML development scenarios showing lack of evidence for usefulness of saliency maps on these tasks.

- Reveals potential for misunderstanding and over-trusting in saliency explanations, despite intuitiveness. 

- Suggests need for caution and further research into what makes explanations truly "interpretable" for robust human decision-making.
