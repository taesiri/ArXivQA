## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Faithfully modeling the space of realistic and plausible articulated poses (e.g. human, animal or hand poses) is crucial for tasks like pose generation, estimation and solving inverse kinematics. However, it remains a challenging problem. Prior works using Gaussians, VAEs or GANs have limitations in either making restricting assumptions or training instability. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Neural Riemannian Distance Fields (NRDFs), implicit neural distance fields constructed on the high-dimensional product manifold of joint rotations to model the space of realistic articulated poses. The pose prior is represented as the zero level set of the distance field. 

Key contributions:

1) A principled framework to learn distance fields on Riemannian manifolds, with links to recent generative models like Riemannian Flow Matching.

2) A novel wrapped sampling algorithm on Riemannian manifolds that allows explicit control over the resulting distance distribution for robust distance field learning.

3) An adaptive-step Riemannian gradient descent algorithm, RDFGrad, to map arbitrary poses onto the learned manifold while respecting the product manifold structure. This ensures faster convergence compared to prior projection methods.

4) Versatile framework that can effectively model articulations of humans, hands and animals. Outperforms previous pose priors across diverse tasks like pose generation, estimation and inverse kinematics.

In summary, the paper introduces a robust way to learn data-driven articulated pose priors with several technical innovations. The NRDF formulation is shown to be effective for modeling and generating realistic and diverse articulated poses.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents Neural Riemannian Distance Fields (NRDFs), a principled framework to learn data-driven priors over articulated poses by modeling the manifold of plausible poses as the zero level set of a neural distance field defined on a high-dimensional product manifold of rotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing Neural Riemannian Distance Fields (NRDFs), a principled framework for learning neural distance fields on Riemannian manifolds to model the space of plausible articulations. 

2) Introducing a novel sampling algorithm on Riemannian manifolds that allows explicit control over the resulting distance distribution of the training data. This is crucial for effectively learning the pose manifold.

3) Developing an adaptive-step Riemannian gradient descent algorithm, called RDFGrad, to map arbitrary poses onto the learned manifold while adhering to the manifold structure. This leads to accelerated convergence compared to prior work.

4) Establishing connections between the proposed NRDF framework and recent generative models like Riemannian Flow Matching, showing similarities in the gradients obtained via backpropagation and the flows predicted in flow matching models.

5) Demonstrating the effectiveness of NRDFs as pose priors in diverse applications like pose generation, solving inverse kinematics, and 3D pose estimation from images. The experiments show improved performance over previous pose priors.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a theoretically grounded framework to learn neural distance fields on Riemannian manifolds as pose priors, along with innovations like the sampling algorithm and RDFGrad that are crucial for effectively modeling the intricate articulation manifold.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, here are some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper:

- Neural Riemannian Distance Fields (NRDFs) - The main concept proposed in the paper for learning articulated pose priors. Models the space of plausible poses as the zero level set of a neural distance field in a product quaternion space.

- Articulated pose modeling - Modeling the poses of articulated 3D shapes like humans, animals, hands. NRDFs are proposed as a versatile way to model articulated pose spaces. 

- Product manifold of rotations - Models pose as a point on a product manifold, with each joint's rotation being a point on the quaternion manifold $SO(3)$. Allows optimization that respects the product manifold structure.  

- Pose generation - Sampling realistic and diverse poses from the learned NRDF pose manifold. One of the applications of NRDFs.

- Inverse kinematics - Fitting an articulated model to sparse observations like 2D joints. NRDFs used as a pose prior in an optimization framework for IK.  

- Pose estimation - Refining predicted poses from images using NRDF-based optimization. Another application considered.

- Riemannian optimization - Optimization algorithms that respect the underlying Riemannian manifold structure, like the product manifold structure of articulated poses. Used for projection onto the NRDF.

- Flow matching - Establishes connections between NRDFs and recent generative flow matching models on Riemannian manifolds.
