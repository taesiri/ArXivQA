# [SnapFusion: Text-to-Image Diffusion Model on Mobile Devices within Two   Seconds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00980)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is how to enable text-to-image diffusion models to run efficiently on mobile devices. Specifically, the authors aim to develop techniques to speed up the inference time of diffusion models so they can generate images within 2 seconds on mobile phones. The key hypotheses appear to be:1) The architecture of the denoising UNet can be optimized to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency without compromising image quality.2) The number of denoising steps can be reduced through improved step distillation techniques.3) Combining architecture optimizations with improved step distillation can enable high-quality text-to-image generation on mobile devices within 2 seconds.So in summary, the central research question is how to optimize diffusion models to run fast on mobile devices while maintaining high image quality. The key hypotheses focus on improving the model architecture and denoising process to achieve efficient on-device inference within 2 seconds.
