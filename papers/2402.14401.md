# [Diffusion Model Based Visual Compensation Guidance and Visual Difference   Analysis for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14401)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) methods struggle to balance learning low-level pixel-level features and high-level perceptual features. They also have difficulties in effectively utilizing the obtained high-level features for quality assessment. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a new NR-IQA method called Diff$V^2$IQA that incorporates a diffusion model for image restoration to obtain enhanced images and nonlinear features. It has two visual evaluation branches - a visual compensation guidance branch and a visual difference analysis branch - to comprehensively analyze the extracted high-level visual features.

Key Details:
- A novel diffusion restoration network is designed to produce an enhanced image and noise-containing images using the diffusion model. This captures nonlinear features during diffusion model denoising.
- The visual compensation guidance branch integrates the original distorted image features with high-level visual features from diffusion using a vision transformer and a new noise embedding strategy. It emphasizes the original features guided by high-level features.  
- The visual difference analysis branch learns the difference between the distorted and restored images using ResNet50 and a proposed Residual Transposed Attention Block (RTAB). It focuses on differentiating distorted and enhanced images.

Main Contributions:
- First application of diffusion model for NR-IQA to obtain enhanced images and nonlinear features as high-level visual guidance.
- Two visual evaluation branches that comprehensively analyze high-level visual features - one for visual guidance of original features and one for visual difference analysis.
- Overall framework and individual components demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on seven benchmark NR-IQA datasets.

In summary, the paper pioneers a diffusion model based image restoration approach to obtain high-level visual features for guiding an NR-IQA method with two dedicated visual analysis branches. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness over existing methods.
