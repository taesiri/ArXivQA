# [AttentionViz: A Global View of Transformer Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03210)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we gain a deeper understanding of the self-attention mechanism in transformer models through interactive visualization techniques? More specifically, the authors propose a new visualization approach to help researchers explore and analyze the patterns learned by the query and key vectors used in transformer self-attention calculations. Their technique involves creating a joint embedding space for the queries and keys from multiple input sequences, then visualizing this space to reveal global attention trends across many examples. The main hypothesis behind this work seems to be that visualizing query and key vectors in this joint embedding will provide new insights into transformer self-attention that previous visualization methods, focused on single input sequences, could not offer. The authors implement their technique in an interactive tool called AttentionViz and apply it to study attention in major language models like BERT and GPT as well as vision transformers.Through case studies and expert interviews, they aim to demonstrate that their visualization approach and AttentionViz tool can:- Help researchers better understand how self-attention informs model behavior in general- Allow easy comparison and contrasting of attention heads - Facilitate the identification of attention anomalies or unexpected model behavior- Provide a flexible platform to study attention across various models, tasks, and modalitiesIn summary, the central research question is about gaining insights into transformer self-attention through a new multi-sequence visualization approach, embodied in the AttentionViz system. The utility of this technique is evaluated through usage scenarios and domain expert feedback.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a new visualization technique for exploring self-attention in transformer models. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Visualizing a joint embedding space of the query and key vectors used in the self-attention computation. This creates a visual signature for each attention head that reveals patterns across multiple input sequences. - Applying this technique to build an interactive tool called AttentionViz that allows users to explore attention patterns in language (BERT, GPT-2) and vision (ViT) transformers. The tool provides a global view of all heads as well as the ability to drill down into details.- Demonstrating how AttentionViz can offer insights about attention mechanisms through several application scenarios, including:    - Finding visual traces linked to positional attention patterns in BERT        - Uncovering hue/brightness specialization in ViT's visual attention        - Detecting potential anomalies in GPT-2's attention patterns- Collecting feedback from domain experts that supports the utility of this approach for understanding and analyzing self-attention in transformers. The experts also proposed additional applications for visualizing other types of embeddings at scale.In summary, the main contribution is a novel visualization technique for studying transformer self-attention across multiple inputs, its implementation in an interactive tool, and evidence that this approach can provide new insights about attention mechanisms in state-of-the-art models. The joint query-key embedding view allows researchers to explore attention patterns at a higher, more global level compared to previous instance-based techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new visualization technique to understand transformer self-attention by creating a joint embedding space of query and key vectors, and applies this in an interactive tool called AttentionViz to gain insights about attention mechanisms in language and vision transformers.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on visualizing and interpreting transformer models:- The focus on visualizing query and key vectors jointly across multiple inputs is novel. Most prior work has visualized attention weights or embeddings from single inputs. Creating a joint query-key embedding space provides a global view of attention patterns across many sequences.- The technique of visualizing embeddings at scale using matrix view and allowing drilling down into details is powerful. Many previous systems are limited to visualizing a few embeddings at a time. Matrix view enables quick comparison across layers/heads.- Applying bipartite graph style visualizations to vision transformers is a new direction. Most prior bipartite visualizations focused on NLP transformers. Extending this to images provides new ways to explore visual attention.- The tool allows custom model and data inputs. Many previous systems visualize patterns for specific datasets or models. The flexibility here allows exploring attention diversity across models and modalities.- Identifying visual traces linked to attention functions is insightful. The spirals, clumps, etc. provide signatures of positional vs semantic attention. This goes beyond describing attention qualitatively.- Revealing potential irregularities like the GPT-2 anomalies is practically impactful. Understanding unexpected behaviors can inform debugging, pruning, training improvements.Overall, I think the main strengths are the novel joint query-key embedding view, the large scale matrix overview, and the multifaceted discoveries enabled by the flexible system. It advances model understanding and provides concrete benefits for researchers and practitioners working with transformers.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Improving scalability of AttentionViz to handle larger datasets and models. They mention this could reveal additional insights, as larger models exhibit more complex behaviors. They suggest trying different data sampling approaches as well.- Exploring how to visualize and incorporate information from the value vectors in each attention head, not just the queries and keys. This could provide a more comprehensive view of how attention heads function.- Adapting AttentionViz for hypothesis testing and causal tracing to provide support for practical debugging and interventions, beyond just exploration.- Finding ways to focus users on key features of interest in the visualizations, rather than showing all heads/layers at once. This could make the tool more digestible and avoid overwhelming users.- Allowing users to directly upload new datasets into AttentionViz, rather than relying on pre-processed data. This could make the tool more flexible.- Generalizing the joint query-key embedding technique to other types of attention like cross-attention. The vector normalization process would likely need to be modified.- Incorporating syntactic metadata, like part-of-speech tags, into AttentionViz to facilitate studying linguistic patterns and relationships.- Evaluating the technique on a broader range of transformers and tasks beyond BERT, GPT-2, and ViT.In summary, the main suggested directions are around improving scalability, flexibility, and usability of AttentionViz, exploring additional types of data like value vectors, and adapting the tool to support more interventions and research workflows.
