# [Self-Supervised Relational Reasoning for Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05849)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:- Can relational reasoning be formulated as a self-supervised pretext task to learn useful visual representations without labeled data? The authors propose a new formulation of relational reasoning for self-supervised learning, involving relating views of the same object (intra-reasoning) and relating different objects (inter-reasoning).- Is the proposed self-supervised relational reasoning approach effective for representation learning across different datasets, protocols, and backbones? The authors evaluate their method rigorously using standard datasets, protocols, backbones, and baselines, demonstrating superior performance over competing self-supervised methods. - Does training a relation module via intra/inter-reasoning induce useful representations in the neural network backbone? The authors hypothesize that optimizing the relation module objective will result in rich, descriptive representations in the backbone that transfer well to downstream tasks. Their results support this hypothesis.- Can the approach be linked to maximizing mutual information as an efficient proxy? The authors connect the intra/inter-reasoning formulation to maximizing mutual information between representations and targets, proposing it is a more effective objective than contrastive losses.- Is a binary classification loss better than contrastive losses for this self-supervised approach? The authors demonstrate superior results using binary cross-entropy over contrastive losses, hypothesizing the relation module is key to its effectiveness.In summary, the key hypotheses are around formulating self-supervised relational reasoning for representation learning, its effectiveness across settings, and connections to mutual information maximization and binary classification objectives. The rigorous experiments and results support these hypotheses.
