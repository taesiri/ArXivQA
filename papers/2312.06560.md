# [Automatic Regularization for Linear MMSE Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06560)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an automatic approach for determining the regularization parameter in minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) linear filters. The method exploits the relationship between MMSE filters and statistical machine learning techniques. Specifically, the linear model is reformulated in a probabilistic framework which enables maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters, including the regularization term. An iterative procedure is presented, based on the expectation-maximization algorithm, that finds the optimal regularization directly from the observed signals. This avoids the need for manual tuning based on signal-to-noise ratio or other heuristics. The automatic regularization is shown to provide near-optimal filter performance on system identification examples. A key benefit is the ability to automatically adapt the regularization to varying noise levels and model mismatch. Implementation complexity is managed by utilizing the eigenvalue decomposition. The simplicity of the proposed data-driven regularization makes it an attractive plug-in replacement for conventional, manually-tuned approaches.
