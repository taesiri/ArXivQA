# [Training and Predicting Visual Error for Real-Time Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09125)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can convolutional neural networks be used to predict complex perceptual image error metrics in real-time without requiring reference images, to enable new applications of these metrics in real-time rendering?

The key points are:

- The paper aims to predict perceptual image error metrics like FLIP, PSNR, etc. using neural networks. 

- The goal is to do this prediction in real-time without needing reference images, only using readily available screen-space data like G-buffers.

- This enables new applications of perceptual metrics in real-time rendering like content-adaptive shading and variable rate shading.

- Current methods are limited to simple metrics and can't generalize well across scenes. A learning approach could lift these restrictions.

So in summary, the central research question is how to use neural networks to predict perceptual image error metrics in real-time without reference images, to enable new applications in real-time rendering. The paper explores a convolutional network architecture, training techniques, and applications to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a method to train and use convolutional neural networks to predict visual error metrics for real-time computer graphics applications. Specifically:

- They propose a compact CNN architecture that can predict complex perceptual error metrics like FLIP, LPIPS, etc. between a reference image and an approximation, without needing to actually render the images. This allows predicting metrics at speeds orders of magnitude faster than computing them directly.

- They show how to handle common issues when training CNNs for this task, like data imbalance. They propose techniques like clamping or logistic transforms on the output to get a more balanced training distribution. 

- They demonstrate how to integrate perceptual thresholds like just-noticeable differences directly into the training, removing the need to compute them separately at runtime.

- They analyze what screen-space data from deferred rendering pipelines is most useful as input to the CNN, and show a compact set of 4 channels can work well.

- They demonstrate an application of using the CNN predictions to drive content-adaptive variable rate shading in real-time, selecting shading rates for image regions based on predicting the visual error. This can provide significant performance gains.

- They evaluate the approach on a range of test scenes, showing the CNN can generalize well across environments and predict a variety of error metrics accurately.

In summary, the key contribution is developing CNN-based prediction of complex visual metrics to enable new optimizations and applications in real-time graphics and rendering. The methods to effectively train the networks and integrate perceptual thresholds are also notable contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper proposes a convolutional neural network approach to efficiently predict perceptual image quality metrics for unseen image regions in real-time graphics applications like adaptive variable rate shading.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper on training and predicting visual error for real-time rendering compares to other related work:

- It focuses on predicting perceptual image metrics like FLIP, PSNR, and LPIPS directly from screen-space data, without needing reference images. This is different from most prior work on perceptual metrics that compare a reference and test image. 

- The goal is to enable real-time prediction of perceptual errors during rendering. This allows applications like content-adaptive shading with variable rate shading (VRS) to adjust rendering dynamically based on predicted perceived quality. Other works have not focused as much on real-time prediction.

- The method trains a compact convolutional neural network to predict quality metrics. This is different from some other learning-based approaches that focus more on using deep learning for post-processing of rendered images.

- It introduces techniques like reparameterization of the prediction targets and Weber correction to improve training and handle perceptual thresholds. These help the method generalize better across scenes and metrics.

- For VRS specifically, the paper shows how to extrapolate quality predictions across different shading rates. This is unique compared to other content-adaptive VRS methods. 

- The approach relies on both temporal reprojection and current G-buffer data as inputs. Using both seen and unseen data is different from prior adaptive methods that just used reprojected previous frames.

- It provides more rigorous analysis of generalization across scenes and metrics compared to related adaptive rendering papers. The method seems to robustly predict for novel environments not in the training data.

Overall, the paper presents a novel learning-based approach to quality prediction for real-time graphics applications. The methods for training and integration seem differentiated from prior work in this field. The results also suggest the technique can enable new applications for perceptual metrics and content-adaptive rendering.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing techniques to provide the network with additional, inexpensive approximations of scene information (e.g. light source positions, reflections, etc) to improve its ability to handle complex effects like lighting changes and reflections. This could allow the network to adapt immediately to sudden changes instead of reacting with a delay.

- Exploring selective reuse of predictions from previous frames to help reduce the overhead of running the network every frame in real-time applications.

- Improving the reprojection techniques used, such as exploring non-screen-space reprojection methods, to avoid issues like duplicated thin objects that can sometimes occur with the simple reprojection used in their proof-of-concept.

- Training specialized networks for different rendering styles (e.g. artistic toon shaders vs realistic GGX shading) to improve metrics prediction for specific shader types.

- Investigating under which circumstances reprojection can be omitted and replaced with additional inputs that encode important scene features like light sources and reflections. This could provide a unified solution for predicting metrics in both seen and unseen regions.

- Applying the approach to other use cases beyond their VRS example, such as foveated rendering, decoupled shading, and other applications that could benefit from efficient perceptual metric prediction.

- Leveraging future improvements in dedicated hardware for neural network inference to help reduce the prediction overhead and improve real-time performance.

In summary, some of the key future directions involve improving generalization, reducing overhead, handling complex effects, specializing for rendering styles, replacing reprojection with better scene encodings, and applying the approach to new use cases. The authors suggest their method shows promise for enabling new perceptual metrics and optimizations in real-time rendering if these areas can be further improved.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method for training a convolutional neural network to predict perceptual image quality metrics for use in real-time rendering applications. The network takes readily available screen-space information like material properties and temporal color reprojection as input, and can estimate complex perceptual metrics like FLIP and LPIPS without needing reference images. This enables applications like content-adaptive shading and variable-rate shading to optimize rendering performance while maintaining visual quality. The authors describe solutions for common deep learning challenges like unbalanced training data and embedding perceptually-based thresholds. They demonstrate the approach by implementing a variable rate shading system that selects shading rates based on the network's just-noticeable difference predictions. The method achieves up to 2x speedups compared to previous techniques by more accurately predicting quality in disoccluded regions. A key advantage is the ability to estimate arbitrary metrics at near-interactive rates without reference images.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a method for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict perceptual image similarity metrics in real-time graphics applications without needing reference images. The authors focus on enabling content-adaptive algorithms, like variable rate shading (VRS), to make locally optimized rendering decisions by predicting the perceptual error of using different shading rates across image regions. They design a compact CNN architecture that takes readily available screen-space buffers as input and efficiently predicts quality metrics between a reference rendering and approximations like lower shading rates. The network is trained with specialized techniques to handle common data imbalance problems and predict metrics adapted to human perception. At runtime, the CNNâ€™s quality predictions for different shading rates help guide an adaptive rendering approach to focus computation on perceptually important areas. The method is evaluated on several test scenes and can predict multiple error metrics (e.g. FLIP, PSNR) with high accuracy and $2-10\times$ speedup over traditional implementations. Applications are demonstrated for VRS on current GPUs, where their technique provides a $10-50\%$ performance improvement over full shading and compares favorably to prior adaptive methods. Key benefits are the ability to predict complex perceptual metrics efficiently without reference images and the generalization to unseen image regions.

In summary, this paper presents a CNN-based approach to predict perceptual image quality metrics from readily available screen-space data at runtime. This enables efficient content-adaptive rendering techniques like VRS to make optimized local decisions by predicting the visual error of different shading rates across image regions. Evaluations demonstrate an order of magnitude speedup over traditional metrics and improved performance over prior adaptive rendering methods. The core contributions are real-time prediction of perceptual metrics without reference images and generalization to disoccluded scene regions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a deep learning approach to predict perceptual image error metrics in real-time for content-adaptive rendering optimizations. The key idea is to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate error metrics like FLIP, PSNR, etc. between a reference image and approximations like lower resolution renders. 

The CNN takes as input screen-space scene data like material properties, normals, and temporal color reprojections. This allows estimating errors without explicitly rendering images, even for disoccluded regions. The network architecture uses grouping and early downsampling for efficiency. Two transforms are proposed to produce balanced training data from potentially skewed metric distributions. The network can also directly predict Weber-corrected metrics to match human sensitivity.

Experiments demonstrate the CNN can predict multiple metrics consistently, even generalizing to new scenes. The method is applied to content-adaptive variable rate shading, outperforming previous reprojection-only techniques. Overall, the paper shows learned perceptual error prediction as a promising approach to enable sophisticated metrics for real-time graphics at low cost.
