# [Decoding News Narratives: A Critical Analysis of Large Language Models   in Framing Bias Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11621)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Framing bias in news headlines influences public perception and policy decisions. Detecting such bias is challenging due to the nuances of language and context involved.  
- Prior work has used various NLP methods for automatic framing detection, but the reliability of large language models (LLMs) like GPT on this complex task remains unknown.

Objective and Contributions 
- The paper investigates the capabilities of LLMs - specifically GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Flan-T5 models - in identifying framing bias through zero-shot, few-shot and explainable prompting.
- Key findings: Explainable prompting enhances reliability; GPT-4 shows best performance with diverse in-domain examples; Flan-T5 struggles without task-specific fine-tuning.  
- Analysis highlights GPT-4's tendency to misinterpret emotional language as framing bias.
- Clear vs contested headline subsets used to showcase models' utility in flagging annotation inaccuracies. 
- Models also evaluated on real-world "in the wild" headlines dataset.

Proposed Solution and Experiments
- Models evaluated on Gun Violence Framing Corpus using uniform prompt design under zero-shot, few-shot and explainable settings.
- Few-shot settings tested impact of example quantity, domain relevance.  
- Additional analysis conducted on subsets with clear and contested annotations, and new out-of-domain evaluation set.

Limitations and Future Work
- Evaluation limited to English language headlines. Multi-lingual analysis remains as future work.
- Access constraints to GPT models affects reproducibility. Focus on improving open-source models needed.
- More nuanced datasets required covering non-framed headlines with emotional language.
