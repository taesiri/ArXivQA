# [FlashFace: Human Image Personalization with High-fidelity Identity   Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing human image customization methods struggle to achieve two key capabilities - preserving fine details of face identity and accurately following text prompts, especially when the text contradicts the reference images. This is due to:
1) Encoding face identity into a few tokens leads to loss of spatial details like face shape, scars, tattoos. 
2) Treating text and image guidance equally leads to entanglement, failing to follow prompts that conflict with references (e.g. customizing an adult to a "child").

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents FlashFace, a practical human image customization method with two key improvements:

1) Encode face identity into feature maps (instead of tokens) using a Face ReferenceNet, retaining spatial details better.

2) Disentangled integration of text and image guidance using separate attention layers, balancing between identity preservation and text following.  

Additionally, a new data collection pipeline is proposed to ensure facial variation between reference and target images, avoiding directly copying references.

Main Contributions:

1) Encoding face identity into feature maps preserves fine details like face shape, scars, tattoos better.

2) Disentangled text/image guidance integration achieves precise text control even when prompts contradict references.

3) Overall, FlashFace demonstrates exceptional ability in human image customization tasks like face swapping, creating real images from virtual characters, seamless face inpainting, etc. while maintaining high fidelity and accurately following text prompts.
