# [The Benefits of a Concise Chain of Thought on Problem-Solving in Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05618)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves large language model (LLM) performance on problem-solving tasks but increases response length, costing more in compute resources.  
- Concise prompting reduces resource costs but can negatively impact LLM performance.
- It's unclear how a balance between conciseness and CoT impacts LLM cost and performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce Concise Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) prompting that combines CoT reasoning with conciseness to optimize cost and performance.
- Test CCoT against standard verbose CoT on a benchmark with 1,000 multiple-choice QA problems across 10 domains, using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

Key Results:
- CCoT reduced response length by 48.70% on average while maintaining near equivalent accuracy to verbose CoT for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.  
- For GPT-3.5, CCoT incurred a 27.69% drop in accuracy specifically on math problems. GPT-4 saw no accuracy drop.
- CCoT yielded per problem cost reductions of 21.85% for GPT-3.5 and 23.49% for more expensive GPT-4.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction and empirical evaluation of Concise Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) prompting 
- Demonstration that conciseness can reduce LLM costs without sacrificing accuracy
- Insight that only some tokens in a CoT directly contribute to an LLM's problem-solving performance

In summary, the paper proposes and tests a new prompting technique that optimizes the cost-performance trade-off for using LLMs to solve problems. The results have practical implications for reducing LLM usage costs as well as providing theoretical insight into LLM reasoning processes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Concise Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) prompting, which combines chain-of-thought and concise prompting to reduce LLM response length by 48.70% while maintaining problem-solving accuracy, thus decreasing per-token LLM costs by 22.67% on average.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction and evaluation of Concise Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) prompting. Specifically, the paper shows that CCoT can reduce the response length of LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 by approximately 50% compared to standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, while maintaining similar levels of accuracy on a multiple-choice QA benchmark. The exception is that GPT-3.5 incurred a 27.69% reduction in accuracy on math problems when using CCoT compared to standard CoT. Overall, the results demonstrate that CCoT can substantially reduce the cost of using LLMs to solve problems requiring step-by-step reasoning, with little to no reduction in accuracy for most problem domains.

The paper introduces the concept of Concise Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) prompting, which combines chain-of-thought prompting with concise prompting to reduce the response length of large language models without sacrificing accuracy. It tests this on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using a benchmark of multiple-choice question-answering problems across various domains. Key results show CCoT reduces response length by 48% while maintaining accuracy, except for a drop in performance on math problems specifically for GPT-3.5. There is also a cost analysis showing potential savings. Overall, it has implications for prompt engineering, reasoning, and problem solving with large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new prompt engineering technique called Concise Chain-of-Thought (CCoT). How is CCoT different from standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting? What specific instructions or examples make the CCoT prompt more concise?

2. The paper tests two main hypotheses - one related to response length and one related to problem-solving performance. What statistical tests were used to evaluate these hypotheses? Why was a non-parametric test like the Mann-Whitney U test used instead of a t-test?

3. For the response length hypothesis, the results showed a statistically significant reduction in tokens for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Was this reduction consistent across all 10 problem domains tested? If not, for which domains was the reduction more or less pronounced? 

4. For the problem-solving performance hypothesis, the results showed no statistically significant difference except for GPT-3.5 on math problems. What was the drop in performance on math problems for GPT-3.5? Why do you think GPT-4 did not show the same performance drop on math problems?

5. The paper discusses implications for AI systems engineers and AI researchers. What are some specific ways an engineer could benefit from using CCoT instead of standard CoT when deploying an LLM-based solution? How might an AI researcher dig deeper into these results?

6. Several limitations of the study are listed such as only testing GPT models. What other large language models would be good to test? Do you think transformer-based models like GPT behave differently than other types of networks?

7. The prompts used a one-shot example to illustrate the CoT and CCoT formats. Do you think using more examples may have changed the results? Why or why not? How might the nature of the examples impact the conciseness or completeness of the LLM's reasoning process?

8. The study used a multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) benchmark across 10 problem domains. Do you think these results could generalize to other task formats like open-ended question answering or document summarization? Why or why not?

9. For the math problems, GPT-3.5 showed a drop in accuracy but GPT-4 did not. What aspects of GPT-4's architecture make it more capable at mathematical reasoning than GPT-3.5? Do you think this advantage will hold up across other math problem types?

10. The cost analysis shows a roughly 22% drop in total cost when using CCoT due to the pricing model being linked to number of tokens. How might a pricing model based on different metrics like query compute time change the cost savings value? Could CCoT provide other unexplored benefits like faster response times?
