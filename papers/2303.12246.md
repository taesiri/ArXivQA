# [Object Pose Estimation with Statistical Guarantees: Conformal Keypoint   Detection and Geometric Uncertainty Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12246)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that by injecting two key changes - conformal keypoint detection and geometric uncertainty propagation - into the standard two-stage object pose estimation pipeline, it is possible to develop the first pose estimator that provides provable and computable worst-case error bounds. Specifically, the two key changes are:1. Conformal keypoint detection: Applies inductive conformal prediction to convert heuristic keypoint detections (heatmaps) into circular or elliptical prediction sets that are guaranteed to cover the groundtruth keypoints with a user-specified marginal probability (e.g. 90%).2. Geometric uncertainty propagation: Propagates the uncertainty in the keypoints to the 6D object pose, leading to a Pose UnceRtainty SEt (PURSE) that guarantees coverage of the groundtruth pose with the same probability. The paper then develops algorithms like RANdom SAmple averaGing (RANSAG) to sample from the PURSE and compute an average pose, and uses semidefinite relaxation to upper bound the worst-case rotation and translation errors between the average pose and groundtruth.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by integrating conformal prediction and geometric uncertainty propagation into the standard pose estimation pipeline, it is possible to develop the first approach that provides statistical guarantees and computable worst-case error bounds on the estimated pose. The experiments then aim to verify the correctness of this theory.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a two-stage object pose estimation framework with statistical guarantees. The key ideas are:1. Conformal keypoint detection: Applies inductive conformal prediction to convert heuristic keypoint detections (heatmaps) into circular or elliptical prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the groundtruth keypoints with a user-specified marginal probability (e.g. 90%).2. Geometric uncertainty propagation: Propagates the uncertainty in the keypoints to the 6D object pose, leading to a Pose UnceRtainty SEt (PURSE) that guarantees coverage of the groundtruth pose with the same probability. 3. Algorithms for sampling and computing error bounds: Proposes RANdom SAmple averaGing (RANSAG) to sample from the nonconvex PURSE and compute an average pose. Uses semidefinite relaxation to upper bound the worst-case rotation and translation errors between the average pose and groundtruth.4. Experiments: Validates the theory on the LineMOD Occlusion dataset - shows the PURSE achieves valid coverage probabilities, the error bounds are mostly correct, and the average pose accuracy is competitive or better than other keypoint-based methods.In summary, this is the first object pose estimator that provides probabilistic guarantees on keypoint detection, propagates the uncertainty to pose through a statistically principled framework, and offers computable worst-case error bounds. The key novelty is conformalizing heuristic vision algorithms to obtain prediction sets with valid coverage guarantees.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage object pose estimation framework with statistical guarantees by (1) conformalizing keypoint detections into prediction sets that provably cover the ground truth keypoints with high probability, and (2) propagating the keypoint uncertainty to obtain a nonconvex pose uncertainty set that is sampled from to quantify worst-case pose estimation errors.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper provides a new approach for object pose estimation with statistical guarantees. Here are some key ways it compares to related work:- It utilizes conformal prediction to provide probabilistic coverage guarantees on the detected keypoints and propagated pose, which is novel. Most prior work focuses on accuracy benchmarks without formal guarantees.- It proposes new algorithms like RANSAG and techniques to compute worst-case error bounds. This allows quantifying uncertainty in a principled way, whereas most methods do not provide tools for uncertainty quantification. - It builds on and adapts ideas like inductive conformal prediction and geometric uncertainty propagation. The conformal prediction framework has seen limited use in computer vision. Propagating geometric uncertainty through 3D constraints is also less common.- It achieves competitive accuracy to sparse keypoint methods like PVNet on the LineMOD dataset. So the guarantees do not seem to come at a huge cost of accuracy.- It relies on existing heatmap keypoint detectors, so it demonstrates the value of conformal prediction as a wrapper. The ideas could likely extend to other keypoint detectors.- It focuses on worst-case analysis via optimization and relaxations. Some related work looks at probabilistic frameworks like Gaussian uncertainty propagation. This work provides a complementary view.In summary, the key innovations are in providing formal coverage guarantees and uncertainty quantification tools by adapting statistical and optimization machinery in a novel way for the visual pose estimation problem. The accuracy results suggest it could be a practically useful approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing better nonconformity functions to tighten the prediction sets for conformal keypoint detection. The paper acknowledges that the prediction sets can be overly conservative, so improving the nonconformity functions could lead to tighter prediction sets while still providing valid coverage guarantees.- Applying the methodology to other types of heuristic detectors beyond just the heatmap approach studied in the paper. The authors suggest their methodology can be generalized to conformalize other existing pose estimation methods.- Exploring different optimization methods like differentiable optimization or bilevel polynomial optimization to solve the minimax problem in Equation 16. This could allow computing tighter worst-case error bounds compared to just using the average pose from RANSAG.- Applying conformal prediction more broadly in computer vision for probabilistic guarantees, beyond just object pose estimation. The paper notes conformal prediction is still in its infancy for computer vision.- Addressing limitations like the assumption of exchangeability, which may not hold for some real-world video data. The authors suggest this is an important direction for deploying conformal prediction more broadly.- Tightening the error bounds, which can be loose in some cases as noted in the experiments. The paper suggests this is an important challenge and opportunity.So in summary, the main suggestions are developing better nonconformity functions, applying the methodology more broadly, using more advanced optimization for tighter error bounds, addressing assumptions like exchangeability, and tightening the bounds in general. The key goal is to expand the methodology to more vision tasks while also improving its performance.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a probabilistically correct two-stage framework for 6D object pose estimation from a single RGB image. The first stage applies inductive conformal prediction to convert heuristic keypoint detections (e.g. from heatmaps) into circular or elliptical prediction sets that are guaranteed to cover the groundtruth keypoints with high probability. The second stage propagates the geometric uncertainty in the keypoints to the 6D object pose, resulting in a nonconvex Pose UnceRtainty SEt (PURSE) that is proved to contain the groundtruth pose with the same high probability. To compute an estimated pose and worst-case error bounds, the paper develops RANdom SAmple averaGing (RANSAG) to sample plausible poses from the PURSE, and applies semidefinite relaxation to bound the maximum distance from the RANSAG average pose to the PURSE. Experiments on the LineMOD dataset validate the statistical guarantees and demonstrate the average pose achieves competitive accuracy compared to existing pose estimation pipelines. Overall, the paper provides the first object pose estimator with correct uncertainty quantification and worst-case error bounds.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage object pose estimation framework with statistical guarantees. In the first stage, it applies inductive conformal prediction to convert heuristic keypoint detections from a heatmap into circular or elliptical prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the groundtruth keypoints with a specified probability (e.g. 90%). In the second stage, it propagates the geometric constraints on the keypoints to the 6D object pose, leading to a Pose UnceRtainty SEt (PURSE) that guarantees coverage of the groundtruth pose with the same probability. However, the PURSE is a nonconvex set that does not directly provide estimated poses or uncertainties. Therefore, the authors develop RANdom SAmple averaGing (RANSAG) to sample poses from the PURSE and compute an average pose. They also apply semidefinite relaxation to compute worst-case error bounds between the average pose and groundtruth pose. Experiments on the LineMOD Occlusion dataset demonstrate three main results: (1) The PURSE achieves valid coverage of the groundtruth pose according to the specified probability. (2) The worst-case error bounds correctly quantify the estimation uncertainty when the PURSE covers the groundtruth. (3) The average pose accuracy is better or comparable to representative keypoint-based methods like PVNet. Overall, the proposed framework offers the first object pose estimator with statistical guarantees in the form of computable worst-case error bounds. A limitation is that the prediction sets can be conservative, leading to loose error bounds in some cases. The paper discusses opportunities to tighten the guarantees in future work.
