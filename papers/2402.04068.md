# [Retrieve to Explain: Evidence-driven Predictions with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04068)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models, especially large language models, are difficult to interpret and lack transparency into their reasoning. This is an issue for human-in-the-loop use cases where trust in model predictions is critical.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors introduce "Retrieve to Explain" (R2E), a retrieval-based language model that scores possible answers to a query based on relevant evidence extracted from a document corpus. 
- R2E uses Shapley values to attribute the prediction to the most important pieces of evidence, enabling explainability. 
- The approach allows new evidence to be incorporated without retraining, and can leverage both free text and structured data templated into text.

Use Case & Results:
- The authors apply R2E to identifying promising drug targets from biomedical literature, to treat diseases. This is used as a test case for assessing model explainability and performance.
- R2E outperforms standard genetics-based and language model baselines at predicting outcomes of historical clinical trials, demonstrating practical usefulness. 
- Explanations are shown to correlate with expert and LLM assessments of evidence relevance.
- Explanations also enable auditing false positive predictions using LLM feedback, further improving performance.

Main Contributions:
- A new retrieval-based language model architecture optimized for explainability via evidence attribution.
- State-of-the-art performance at an important real-world task of drug target identification using scientific literature.
- Demonstration of how model explanations can be leveraged to improve predictions in a human- or LLM-in-the-loop setup.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Retrieve to Explain (R2E), a retrieval-based language model for making and explaining predictions by scoring candidate answers based on relevant supporting evidence passages, which enables updating predictions as new evidence is added without retraining.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces Retrieve to Explain (R2E), a retrieval-based language model approach for making explainable predictions. The key ideas and contributions are:

1) R2E retrieves relevant evidence from a corpus for each possible answer to a query, then scores the answers based on the supporting evidence using a reasoning module. This allows it to provide an explanation for its predictions by attributing the score to the most important pieces of evidence using Shapley values.

2) The evidence directly impacts the predictions, so updating the evidence corpus allows the model's predictions to adapt without retraining. R2E can also incorporate structured data like genetics associations by templating them into natural language sentences.

3) R2E is applied to the problem of predicting successful drug targets for diseases, using a corpus of biomedical literature. It outperforms baselines including genetics-based methods at predicting historical clinical trial outcomes. Explanations allow an AI assistant to audit false positive evidence.

4) The overall contribution is an interpretable neural architecture that leverages retrieval to make evidence-based predictions. This improves transparency and trust for users to act on model suggestions in risky, impactful settings like drug discovery.

The paper introduces the "Retrieve to Explain" (R2E) approach, which is a retrieval-based language model that prioritizes answers to a query based on evidence in a document corpus. Key aspects include using Shapley values to identify the contribution of evidence to predictions, the ability to adapt to new evidence without retraining, and incorporating structured data through natural language templates. The method is evaluated on tasks like predicting genes related to diseases and clinical trial outcomes in drug discovery. So keywords relate to language models, explainability, retrieval, drug discovery, genetics, etc.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new model called "Retrieve to Explain" (R2E). Could you elaborate on why combining retrieval with explanation was an important goal of this model? How does it improve over standard language models?

2. One key aspect of R2E seems to be using Shapley values to attribute predictions back to pieces of evidence. What are the main benefits of this explainability approach? How does it help with things like updating predictions based on new evidence?

3. R2E is applied to the problem of drug target identification. Why is explainability especially important in the context of drug discovery research? How might R2E's explanations help drive trust and scientific progress? 

4. The paper shows R2E outperforming genetics-based methods for predicting clinical trial outcomes. What limitations of genetics data might R2E help overcome by using scientific literature as evidence instead?

5. How does the cloze-style query formulation used in R2E constrain the types of questions and answers relative to free-form natural language queries? What are the trade-offs?

6. One interesting aspect is the multi-modality, combining genetics and literature data. How might the templating approach generalize to incorporate other structured data sources into R2E?

7. The paper focuses specifically on scoring and ranking potential drug targets. How might the R2E approach extend to more open-ended scientific hypothesis generation rather than scoring a pre-defined target set?

8. The explanations seem intrinsically aligned with human reasoning by design. But the paper also shows performance gains from having an LLM audit the explanations. What does this suggest about areas for further improving the reasoning? 

9. What other scientific or medical applications beyond drug discovery might benefit from an evidence-driven approach like R2E? What adjustments would need to be made?

10. The paper mentions scaling model and passage sizes as an area for future work. How might larger transformer models impact the overall approach? What types of challenges might arise?
