# [Group Benefits Instances Selection for Data Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15694)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Manually labeling large datasets for training deep neural networks (DNNs) is expensive and time-consuming. 
- Using web images with keyword searches as labels is a scalable solution, but these labels contain significant noise which degrades model performance.
- Existing methods for dealing with noisy labels are typically only evaluated on synthetic noisy datasets and fail on real-world noisy datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes GRIP - Group Regularization and Instance Purification - a method that combines noise robustness techniques at the group/class level with instance level noise cleaning.

- Group Regularization:
    - Estimates "soft labels" for each class over the course of training by taking the average prediction probabilities on correctly classified examples.
    - Uses the soft labels as additional supervision to improve noise robustness and prevent overfitting.
    - Applies maximum entropy regularization to smooth the predicted probabilities.

- Instance Purification:
    - Measures difference between each instance's prediction probability and its class soft label using JS divergence. 
    - Instances with high divergence are classified as noisy.
    - Noisy instances with low divergence to predicted class are relabeled and reused.

- By operating at both the group and instance levels, GRIP combines the strengths of noise-robust and noise-cleaning methods.

Contributions:
- Proposes a group regularization strategy to estimate reliable soft class labels for improving noise robustness.
- Develops an instance purification method using class soft labels to globally identify noisy labels.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on both synthetic noisy datasets and real-world web noisy datasets.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate GRIP's effectiveness over existing methods in learning with noisy labels.
