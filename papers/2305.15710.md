# [CUEING: a lightweight model to Capture hUman attEntion In driviNG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15710)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we develop a lightweight gaze prediction model that is highly generalizable across diverse driving datasets and can be efficiently deployed on resource-constrained platforms like mobile devices?

The authors identify three main challenges in existing driving gaze prediction research:

1) The presence of unrelated gaze data or noise in current datasets, which hampers training of effective models. 

2) Lack of generalizability of existing gaze prediction models across diverse driving scenarios and datasets.

3) High complexity and computational demands of current models, which restricts their deployment in autonomous vehicles.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes and evaluates:

1) An adaptive cleansing technique to remove unrelated gaze from datasets.

2) A novel lightweight convolutional self-attention gaze prediction model for enhanced generalizability. 

3) Benchmarking of the model on a real mobile device to assess computational efficiency.

Through experiments on multiple datasets, the authors demonstrate their cleansing technique can enhance model performance, while their proposed attention model achieves state-of-the-art generalizability with significantly reduced parameters. Testing on an embedded platform validates the model's applicability for efficient deployment.

In summary, the central research contribution is a highly generalizable and efficient gaze prediction model enabled by a data cleansing approach, with real-world applicability in self-driving vehicles. The research questions evaluate the model's generalizability, performance under their data cleansing method, and computational efficiency on resource-constrained devices.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. An adaptive cleansing method to remove unrelated/noisy gaze data from existing driving gaze datasets. This involves using object detection to identify important driving-related objects and mask out other areas in the images and gaze maps. 

2. A lightweight convolutional self-attention gaze prediction model that shows improved generalizability across diverse datasets compared to prior approaches. The model uses techniques like tokenization and self-attention to better capture relationships between image regions.

3. Extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed cleansing method and attention model. Key results include:

- The cleansing method improves model performance by up to 8.75% and generalizability by over 4% on the DADA-2000 dataset.

- The attention model increases generalizability by up to 12.13% over state-of-the-art models on the DADA-2000 and Dr(eye)VE datasets. 

- The attention model uses only 1.8% of the parameters of current state-of-the-art models, making it suitable for efficient mobile deployment. Experiments show it operates successfully on a Jetson Nano while other models fail.

Overall, the core innovations seem to be in developing targeted techniques to address key challenges in driving gaze prediction - removing unrelated gaze data and designing models that generalize well across diverse environments while being lightweight. The experiments provide evidence these techniques work well compared to other approaches.

This paper proposes a new approach for gaze prediction in autonomous driving systems, aiming to improve model performance and generalizability. The authors first present an adaptive cleansing technique to refine existing driving gaze datasets by removing unrelated gaze data using object detection. This allows models to focus on driving-relevant objects during training.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a pipeline to cleanse noise in existing driving gaze datasets and a novel convolutional self-attention model for gaze prediction. To filter noise, they first detect bounding boxes of important objects using YOLOv5. Then masked inputs and gaze maps are generated by masking pixels outside the bounding boxes. For the model, they tokenize the input image into patches and assign positional encodings. The tokens are then stacked and convolved to extract features before applying self-attention layers to capture inter-token relationships. The model outputs a gaze intensity value for each token which is upsampled to create the full gaze map. Loss is calculated against a downsampled version of the ground truth gaze map. The model achieves strong performance while being very lightweight, making it suitable for efficient deployment. The cleansing pipeline is shown to boost performance of various gaze models when tested on the original datasets.
