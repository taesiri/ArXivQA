## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related work in building agent systems powered by large language models:- Focuses on building agents with open-source LLMs as the controller: Most prior work like VisualChatGPT, HuggingGPT, and Transformers Agent rely on proprietary LLMs like ChatGPT or Claude. This paper explores using open-source LLMs like LLaMA and ChatGLM.- Provides a flexible framework supporting diverse tools: The paper introduces a framework to integrate both common APIs like search as well as neural model APIs across modalities. Other work has focused more narrowly on specific types of APIs.- Customizable system designed for real applications: The goal is a customizable library and framework for building practical agents, including data, training strategies, and deployment. Other work has been more conceptual or research-focused.- Comprehensive tool learning methodology: The paper proposes extensive tool training data, weighted LM fine-tuning, and both automatic and human evaluation frameworks for optimizing tool use. Prior work has lacked this full pipeline.- Showcases application in ModelScope community: Developing the ModelScopeGPT agent demonstrates applying the framework to a real-world scenario with over 1000 APIs and localized knowledge.In summary, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in building general-purpose agent systems powered by open-source LLMs, through its flexible design, extensive tool support, customizability, comprehensive training and evaluation methodology, and real-world application example. The customizable library and best practices introduced could significantly advance research and development of LLMs for practical agent systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more sophisticated training strategies and model architectures that are optimized for tool use. The authors propose a simple weighted LM training strategy, but more advanced methods could likely further improve tool use capabilities. Architectural modifications like having separate tool planning and generation modules may also be beneficial.- Expanding the tool library and capabilities. The current tool library focuses mainly on common APIs and neural model APIs, but could be expanded to support more diverse tools like databases, spreadsheets, etc. - Improving tool generalization and few-shot learning. While the authors show some generalization through registering new tools, future work could explore meta-learning or other techniques to rapidly adapt to new unseen tools with minimal examples.- Enhancing knowledge retrieval and memory capabilities. The knowledge retrieval currently relies on a basic dense retriever, but more advanced neural retrievers or knowledge bases could improve performance. The prompt-based memory is also limited, so exploring more structured forms of memory could be useful.- Benchmarking and analysis. The authors provide initial evaluation, but developing more comprehensive benchmarks and analysis to deeply understand model behaviors and limitations would be valuable.- Safety and robustness. As with any generative model, safety and avoiding harmful behaviors is critical. Future research on adversarial testing, safe stopping mechanisms, etc. would be important.- Deployment of real-world systems. While a prototype system is presented, large-scale deployment and testing of tool-using agents in real-world applications would provide further insights.In summary, the paper lays a solid foundation, but substantial future work remains in developing more powerful, robust and safe tool-using agent systems. Key directions include advances in training, expanding tool capabilities, improving generalization and memory, benchmarking progress, and real-world deployment.
