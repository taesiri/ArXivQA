# [Federated Learning is Better with Non-Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02074)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework for federated learning that enables the use of classical cryptography techniques like AES encryption to provide privacy and security, while also allowing communication compression through the use of permutation-based compressors like PermK. The key insight is that PermK compressors have the unique property that their aggregated average remains unbiased, allowing the server/master to simply concatenate the encrypted compressed gradients from clients rather than needing to perform aggregation computations. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the approach matches the accuracy of uncompressed and unencrypted federated learning, while significantly reducing communication overhead compared to alternatives like homomorphic encryption (HE). Unlike HE-based approaches, it also enables computational flexibility like asynchronous execution and tolerance of stragglers. The framework thus demonstrates, contrary to claims in prior works, that classical cryptography can feasibly be adapted for practical federated learning implementations. Limitations include the assumption of trusted clients and restriction to problem dimensions no smaller than the number of clients.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel federated learning framework that uses classical cryptography techniques like AES encryption along with correlated compressors like PermK to provide privacy, security, communication efficiency, and flexibility compared to methods based on homomorphic encryption.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes an innovative framework for providing privacy and security in federated learning that synergizes permutation-based compressors with classical cryptography. The main contributions are:

1) It addresses the challenge that usage of AES was previously considered difficult or impossible for federated learning. The paper shows how AES can be effectively used with permutation compressors like PermK.

2) It demonstrates operational advantages of the proposed algorithm over homomorphic encryption schemes like CKKS which are typically used for privacy in federated learning. The experiments show performance gains in computation time, communication overhead, flexibility, etc.

3) It shows how the framework can train complex deep learning models like ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, opening up more flexibility for model training. 

4) It discusses how the approach provides resilience against various attacks, flexibility in communication topologies, and the ability to overlap communication and computation.

In summary, the main contribution is an innovative method to enable privacy and security in federated learning using classical cryptography rather than homomorphic encryption, with performance and flexibility advantages.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper claims that classical cryptography was previously assumed to be unsuitable for federated learning. What are the specific technical reasons stated in prior work for this claim? Does the proposed method address these limitations?

2. The PermK compressor is highlighted as having properties that enable the use of classical cryptography. What are these key properties? How exactly do they facilitate encryption while allowing computation communication overlap?

3. How does the proposed AES encryption scheme compare to CKKS in terms of throughput, latency, scalability to high dimensions, and security? What are the quantitative tradeoffs?

4. The method partitions the optimization variable into blocks corresponding to clients. How does this impact the convergence rate compared to methods that compress/encrypt the full gradient? Is there a theoretical analysis?

5. For deep learning, model parallelism is proposed to leverage the partial gradients. How does this integrate with existing parallelism strategies? What are the implementation challenges? 

6. The scheduler model aims to capture computation, communication, and heterogeneity characteristics. What simplifying assumptions does it make and what are ideas to relax them in future work?

7. How robust is the method against common attacks like reconstruction attacks from gradients or side-channel attacks? Are there security limitations still needing improvement?

8. For future work, lossless compression techniques are mentioned as having compatibility with PermK due to operating on bits. What modifications would be needed to integrate them?

9. The method currently requires the number of clients to exceed dimensionality. How can this requirement be relaxed in further research?

10. What other applications beyond federated learning can benefit from the proposed synergistic usage of correlated compressors and classical cryptography?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative machine learning model training across decentralized data without exposing raw data. However, model updates transmitted during training can still reveal sensitive information.
- Existing privacy solutions like homomorphic encryption (HE) have high computation/communication cost. Classical cryptography was considered unsuitable for FL aggregation previously.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes using the AES block cipher with permutation-based compressors like PermK for secure and efficient FL. 
- PermK compressors have useful properties: unbiasedness, bounded variance, correlation allowing concatenation instead of averaging.
- This allows replacing HE schemes with faster classical AES encryption and reduces communication via compression, while preserving privacy, security and accuracy.

Contributions:
- Addresses limitation of using classical cryptography like AES for FL.
- Shows operational benefits over HE for FL: lower overhead, flexibility, asynchrony.
- Validates approach by training ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, reducing communication 10x vs FedAvg.
- Demonstrates computation/communication overlap and handling stragglers.
- Discusses deployment flexibility in communication topologies.  

In summary, the paper makes AES encryption viable for FL by using PermK compressors. This reduces communication and computation cost of privacy-preserving FL dramatically compared to HE schemes, while providing security, accuracy and more flexibility.
