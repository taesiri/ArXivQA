# [Federated Learning is Better with Non-Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02074)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework for federated learning that enables the use of classical cryptography techniques like AES encryption to provide privacy and security, while also allowing communication compression through the use of permutation-based compressors like PermK. The key insight is that PermK compressors have the unique property that their aggregated average remains unbiased, allowing the server/master to simply concatenate the encrypted compressed gradients from clients rather than needing to perform aggregation computations. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the approach matches the accuracy of uncompressed and unencrypted federated learning, while significantly reducing communication overhead compared to alternatives like homomorphic encryption (HE). Unlike HE-based approaches, it also enables computational flexibility like asynchronous execution and tolerance of stragglers. The framework thus demonstrates, contrary to claims in prior works, that classical cryptography can feasibly be adapted for practical federated learning implementations. Limitations include the assumption of trusted clients and restriction to problem dimensions no smaller than the number of clients.
