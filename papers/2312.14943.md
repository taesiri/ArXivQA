# [Flood Event Extraction from News Media to Support Satellite-Based Flood   Insurance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14943)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Floods cause major damage worldwide every year, but insurance to help recover financially is often unavailable in vulnerable regions like Bangladesh. Index-based flood insurance using satellites to estimate damage is being piloted, but satellite data has limitations in spatial and temporal resolution.

Proposed Solution:  
- Extract high-resolution spatio-temporal flood event information from news media to support satellite-based flood index insurance.

Contributions:
1) Created a dataset of 40,000 annotated news articles on Bangladesh floods from 2000-2020 and satellite flood estimates. 

2) Evaluated flood event classification techniques - keyword models are inadequate, while context-based BERT classifier performs best by capturing complex flood descriptions.

3) Constructed news media time series with flood events that have high correlation (Spearman's œÅ=0.70) to satellite flood estimates, outperforming Twitter data.  

4) Demonstrated potential of news media to provide finer spatial and temporal resolution compared to disaster databases, and higher quality rural coverage compared to Twitter for index insurance applications.

In summary, this paper explores using news media analysis to extract detailed flood event information to support satellite-based flood insurance indexes. A dataset of annotated news articles and satellite data is published. Advanced deep learning text classifiers are shown to effectively extract flood events from news. Ultimately, news media time series showed significant correlation to satellite estimates of flood inundation.
