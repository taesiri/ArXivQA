## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Efficient Large Language Models: A Survey":

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown impressive capabilities in language understanding, generation, and reasoning. However, the scale and performance of LLMs come at a huge cost in terms of compute resources, energy consumption, and carbon emissions needed for training and inference. There is a critical need to develop efficient techniques to improve the accessibility and sustainability of LLMs. 

Key Ideas and Contributions:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey organizing efficient LLM techniques into three main categories:

1. Model-Centric Methods: This covers techniques like model compression (quantization, pruning), efficient pre-training (mixed precision, scaling methods), efficient fine-tuning (parameter-efficient, memory-efficient), and efficient inference (speculative decoding, attention optimizations). It also surveys efficient model architectures such as efficient attention mechanisms, mixture-of-experts models, and long-context models.

2. Data-Centric Methods: This focuses on data selection techniques to choose high-quality datasets for efficient pre-training and fine-tuning. It also covers prompt engineering methods like few-shot prompting, prompt compression, and prompt generation to steer LLM behavior using limited data.  

3. LLM Frameworks: The paper surveys specialized frameworks like DeepSpeed, Megatron, Alpa, ColossalAI etc. that enable efficient distributed training of LLMs using optimizations like zero redundancy, activation recomputation, and model parallelism. It also discusses serving systems like vLLM, ParallelFormers, OpenLLM that focus specifically on efficient LLM inference.

The paper organizes 140+ state-of-the-art efficient LLM papers in an intuitive taxonomy. It highlights key ideas, comparisons, and takeaways through figures and tables. The authors have also open-sourced a literature repository to track advances in this space. Overall, this paper provides a valuable guide for researchers and practitioners aiming to improve LLM efficiency.
