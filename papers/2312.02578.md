# [Empathy and Distress Detection using Ensembles of Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02578)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents an approach for detecting empathy and distress in essays as part of the WASSA 2023 Shared Task. The authors experiment with several BERT-based language models, including RoBERTa, Twitter-RoBERTa models pre-trained on tweets with emotion and sentiment analysis tasks, and an unsupervised SimCSE model using sentence embeddings. They find the unsupervised SimCSE model performs best individually with a Pearson's r score of 0.352. They also ensemble the models using averaging and regression techniques, with averaging achieving the best performance of 0.346 Pearson's r. This places the authors in 3rd place in the empathy prediction subtask. They identify pre-training on relevant data and exploring additional ensembling techniques as areas for future improvement. Overall, the paper demonstrates competitive performance for empathy and distress detection using BERT-based models and ensembles. Key results highlight the utility of the unsupervised SimCSE sentence embedding approach and simplicity of averaging for ensembling with limited data.
