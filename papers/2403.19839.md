# [The New Agronomists: Language Models are Experts in Crop Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19839)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Optimizing crop management practices like fertilizer and irrigation is critical for boosting yields, profitability and sustainability, but finding optimal strategies is complex with changing conditions. 
- Prior reinforcement learning (RL) methods with crop simulators have limitations in state representations and agent architectures.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a novel intelligent crop management framework integrating RL, language models (LMs) and the DSSAT crop simulator.
- Convert numeric state variables into descriptive sentences to leverage LMs' linguistic capabilities. 
- Use a distilled BERT model as the RL agent instead of MLPs to enable better comprehension of crop states.
- Train policies with deep Q-learning on simulated crop environments.

Evaluations:
- Conduct experiments on maize crops for two real-world case studies - Florida, USA and Zaragoza, Spain.
- Compare five distinct reward functions to showcase adaptability to various objectives.
- Demonstrate superior performance over baseline methods and previous state-of-the-art approaches on metrics of yield, costs, profit and environmental impact. 
- Show robustness to measurement noises in state variables.

Main Contributions:
- First work to integrate descriptive language and LMs for crop management optimization.
- Empirically validate LMs as viable alternatives over MLPs for RL agents in this domain.  
- Achieve new state-of-the-art results, with over 49% more profit and 67% higher economic outcomes.
- Establish effectiveness across geographic regions, reward criteria and uncertainties.

The paper makes a compelling case for using advanced LMs in agricultural decision making to discover improved and robust crop management strategies.
