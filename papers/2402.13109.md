# [CIF-Bench: A Chinese Instruction-Following Benchmark for Evaluating the   Generalizability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13109)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in instruction-following for unseen natural language tasks. However, their effectiveness often diminishes when switched to low-resource languages like Chinese.  
- Existing Chinese LLM benchmarks have limitations in fully assessing cross-task generalization abilities due to constrained output formats.
- There are also concerns over potential benchmark data leakage/contamination when using web-scale datasets, causing evaluation biases.

Proposed Solution - CIF-Bench:
- Introduces a new Chinese instruction-following benchmark (CIF-Bench) specifically designed to evaluate LLM generalizability to Chinese.
- Comprises 150 diverse tasks with 15,000 human-annotated input-output pairs testing complex reasoning and cultural nuances. 
- Mitigates data leakage by publicly releasing only half of the data, keeping the rest private. 
- Enhances robustness using 5 variations of instructions per task to reduce score variance.
- Pioneers a model-based automatic pipeline for open-ended output evaluation.

Key Contributions:
- Identifies clear limitations of current LLMs in handling Chinese language tasks, guiding future improvements.
- Provides an extensive benchmark for Chinese instruction-following with rigorous design to enable unbiased assessments.
- Analysis of 28 selected LLMs reveals noticeable performance gap, with top score only 52.9%, highlighting major challenges for LLM language transfer capabilities.
- Released benchmark and findings aim to facilitate more culturally/linguistically diverse and adaptive LLMs.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards uncovering and overcoming the limitations of LLMs on Chinese language instruction-following through the carefully constructed CIF-Bench suite and extensive experiments.
