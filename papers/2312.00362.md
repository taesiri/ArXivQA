# [Dancing with Images: Video Distillation via Static-Dynamic   Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00362)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper provides the first systematic study of video dataset distillation, where the goal is to compress large video datasets into smaller ones while maintaining training effectiveness. The authors introduce a taxonomy to categorize video distillation methods based on key factors like number of frames and segment length. Through extensive experiments, they find that more frames only provide marginal performance gains at greatly increased costs. To efficiently exploit video temporal redundancy, they propose a novel paradigm that disentangles static and dynamic video information - first distilling videos into still images to capture static content, then using a learnable dynamic memory block to compensate for lost motion. Their method combines existing image distillation techniques with this static-dynamic approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on video datasets with substantially lower storage costs. For instance, they improve performance with 50% less storage compared to prior video distillation. By revealing unique properties of video data for distillation and proposing an efficient distillation framework, this paper provides important insights that can guide the development of video dataset condensation.
