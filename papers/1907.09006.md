# [Forward-Backward Decoding for Regularizing End-to-End TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09006)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be:

How can forward-backward decoding be utilized to regularize end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) models and improve their robustness and naturalness?

The key points are:

- End-to-end TTS models like Tacotron suffer from "exposure bias" where errors accumulate during autoregressive generation.

- The paper proposes using forward-backward decoding to leverage past and future context and minimize the mismatch between the two directions. 

- Two methods are introduced: 1) regularizing divergence between left-to-right (L2R) and right-to-left (R2L) models, 2) adding regularization between forward and backward decoder hidden states.

- A joint training strategy is used to enable the forward and backward models to improve each other interactively.

- Experiments show the proposed methods, especially bidirectional decoder regularization, significantly improve robustness and naturalness on challenging test cases while maintaining efficiency at inference time.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that forward-backward decoding regularization can improve end-to-end TTS model performance by reducing exposure bias. The paper introduces two methods to test this hypothesis and provides experimental results demonstrating their effectiveness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing two novel methods to improve the robustness and naturalness of end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis by integrating forward and backward decoding sequences. 

Specifically, the two proposed methods are:

1. Model regularization by bidirectional agreement: Train two directional models - L2R (left-to-right) and R2L (right-to-left) and introduce regularization terms to minimize the mismatch between them. This helps alleviate the exposure bias problem.

2. Bi-directional decoder regularization: Train forward and backward decoders with shared encoder and add regularization to make their hidden states close. This allows leveraging future context during training. 

Both methods aim to improve agreement between forward and backward decoding to help the model better predict future outputs. A joint training strategy is proposed for both methods. 

Experiments show the methods, especially the bidirectional decoder regularization, achieve significant gains in robustness and naturalness on both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets. The bidirectional decoder model achieves a MOS close to human recordings.

In summary, the key contribution is using forward-backward decoding agreement as a novel form of regularization to improve end-to-end TTS models. The proposed methods are shown to be effective in improving robustness and naturalness.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key things I noticed about how this paper compares to other research in end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis:

- The paper focuses on improving the robustness and naturalness of end-to-end TTS models, a key challenge as these models are scaled to more diverse test sets. This goal aligns with much other recent work.

- The proposed methods aim to leverage future/global output information during training to address the "exposure bias" limitation of autoregressive models. This is a common approach in other sequence generation tasks but novel for TTS.

- The two proposed methods are: 1) Divergence regularization between forward and backward models, and 2) Bi-directional decoder regularization. The first method is similar to prior work, but the second method is more novel in exploiting bi-directional decoders.

- Experiments comprehensively evaluate the methods on both in-domain and challenging out-of-domain test sets. The bidirectional decoder method provides significant gains in robustness and naturalness. This demonstrates the efficacy of the approach.

- The results are state-of-the-art for end-to-end TTS working with limited training data. The proposed model achieves near human-level scores, outperforming the Tacotron 2 baseline.

- The techniques are compatible with other recent advances in end-to-end TTS, such as robust training, data augmentation, and neural vocoders.

Overall, the proposed bidirectional regularization approach makes an important contribution of improving robustness for end-to-end TTS models. The second method is elegant and achieves strong results. The techniques align well with prevailing approaches in the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Improve the stability and robustness of end-to-end TTS models on more challenging test cases. The paper mentions that the proposed methods help with robustness but the end-to-end model can still have issues on some very rare cases. Further research could focus on enhancing stability for those cases.

- Explore other ways to integrate forward and backward decoding to improve agreement. The two proposed methods in the paper are initial attempts at using bidirectional decoding, but other approaches could be explored as well. 

- Apply the ideas to other sequence generation tasks. The concepts of using bidirectional decoding and agreement could potentially benefit other tasks like machine translation, speech recognition, etc. The authors suggest exploring applications in those domains.

- Investigate long-term dependencies and contexts beyond short future segments. The current method looks at limited future contexts during decoding. Expanding the context could further improve results.

- Reduce computational overhead during training. The bidirectional decoding does add computation cost during training, so research on optimizing the efficiency would be useful.

In summary, the main suggestions are to build on the ideas presented to improve stability, look at other tasks and sequence modeling methods that could benefit, and optimize the approach to be more efficient computationally. The core ideas show promise but further research is needed to fully realize their potential.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes two novel methods to improve the robustness and naturalness of end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis using forward-backward decoding regularization. The first method trains bidirectional left-to-right (L2R) and right-to-left (R2L) TTS models and introduces divergence regularization terms into the training objective to minimize the mismatch between them. The second method shares an encoder between forward and backward decoders with their own attentions, and adds a regularization term to bring their hidden states closer. Both methods employ joint training to improve agreement between forward and backward decoding. Experiments show both methods, especially the second bidirectional decoder method, significantly improve robustness and naturalness on challenging test sets, outperforming the Tacotron 2 baseline. The bidirectional decoder model achieves a MOS score of 4.42 on general tests, close to human quality, and is much more stable on long, out-of-domain sequences.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes two novel methods to improve the robustness of end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) models by integrating forward and backward decoding sequences. The first method trains left-to-right (L2R) and right-to-left (R2L) TTS models and introduces a regularization term into the training objective to minimize the divergence between the models' outputs. This helps address the exposure bias issue in autoregressive TTS models. The second method uses a shared encoder with bidirectional decoders, and adds a regularization term to encourage agreement between the forward and backward hidden states. This allows the unidirectional decoder to leverage future context information. Both methods use a joint training strategy to improve the models iteratively. 

The methods were evaluated on challenging in-domain and out-of-domain test sets. Results showed the proposed methods, especially the bidirectional decoder regularization, significantly improved robustness and naturalness compared to the Tacotron 2 baseline. The bidirectional decoder model achieved a 0.14 MOS gap over the baseline on general test data and had near human-level performance. It also improved intelligibility on challenging test cases. Overall, the results demonstrate that integrating forward-backward decoding is an effective approach to improve end-to-end TTS model robustness.
