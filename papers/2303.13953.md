# [AssetField: Assets Mining and Reconfiguration in Ground Feature Plane   Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13953)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that representing 3D scenes with explicit ground feature planes enables intuitive object-level and group-level editing of neural radiance fields. 

The key claims are:

- Factorizing radiance fields into ground feature planes and a shared vertical axis encourages ground planes to encode more informative scene contents and layout.

- Modeling scene density, color, and semantics in integrated RGB-DINO planes makes them more robust to vertical object displacement, enabling cross-scene analogue discovery. 

- Assets can be directly mined and grouped from the ground planes in an unsupervised manner. 

- Storing template feature patches in a shared asset library allows efficient group editing by manipulating category templates.

- The ground plane representation provides an intuitive "canvas" for users to manipulate individual objects or entire scene layouts.

- Realistic novel views can be rendered for new scene configurations by combining edited ground planes with original vertical axes and decoder networks.

In summary, the ground plane radiance field representation enables object-level and group-level editing flexibility reminiscent of traditional graphics pipelines, while retaining the realism of neural rendering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing AssetField, a novel neural scene representation that can learn a set of object-aware ground feature planes to represent a 3D scene. Key aspects of AssetField include:

- It represents a 3D scene with a 2D ground feature plane aligned with the bird's eye view and a shared vertical feature axis. This allows intuitive manipulation and editing of objects on the ground plane.

- It can discover and extract assets (object neural representations) from the learned ground feature planes in an unsupervised manner. The assets can be grouped into categories to enable efficient group editing. 

- It constructs a cross-scene asset library by sharing vertical axes and decoders across scenes. This allows discovering common objects, expanding the library, and reusing assets for scene composition.

- The ground feature planes are informative, encoding density, color and semantics. This enables tasks like assets mining, categorization, and layout estimation directly on the planes.

- It provides a flexible way to edit and reconfigure scenes by manipulating assets on the ground plane. Operations like insertion, deletion, translation, rotation, duplication are supported at object, category and scene levels.

- It can render high-quality novel views of new scene configurations composed from the asset library, without needing to retrain models.

In summary, AssetField resembles traditional 3D modeling workflows that use reusable asset libraries, while providing neural rendering, allowing easy and intuitive editing of scenes to compose new configurations. The explicit ground feature planes are more user-friendly compared to other implicit neural representations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes AssetField, a novel neural scene representation that learns object-aware ground feature planes representing scene density, color and semantics, enabling unsupervised discovery and manipulation of objects and construction of a reusable cross-scene asset library for intuitive editing at object, category, and scene levels and realistic rendering of novel configurations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in neural 3D scene representations and editing:

- The key idea of representing a 3D scene with a ground plane feature map plus a shared vertical axis is novel. Most prior work uses full 3D grids or implicit representations like NeRF. The ground plane representation provides an intuitive interface for object manipulation.

- The idea of unsupervised mining of object assets and constructing a reusable asset library is not explored much before. This is analogous to classic graphics pipelines and provides efficiency. Prior work like ObjectNeRF requires masks.

- For scene editing capabilities, this paper allows object insertion, deletion, translation, rotation etc like some prior work. The main advantage is the intuitive interface via ground plane features. Group editing of objects is also possible by changing the category templates. 

- Scene reconfiguration by composing objects from the asset library is demonstrated. This is related to some concurrent work like GRAF and CMR that compose scenes from a dictionary of neural radiance fields. The ground plane representation provides more explicit control.

- The cross-scene consistency of features using shared vertical axis is unique to this work and enables discovering object analogues across scenes for the asset library.

- For view synthesis quality, AssetField achieves competitive results with NeRF and TensorRF baselines. The compact ground plane representation does not seem to compromise quality much.

Overall, I think the ground plane scene representation and the use of explicit asset libraries in AssetField are its main novel contributions. The interface for object manipulation is more intuitive than many prior implicit scene representations. The ideas of unsupervised asset mining and cross-scene consistency for transfer are also promising directions for future work on scalable scene modeling and editing.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

1. Improving the ability to separate connected objects in the scene. The current method struggles with separating objects that are attached or overlapping. Developing techniques to better isolate individual objects would improve the flexibility of editing.

2. Handling stacked and overlapped objects. The ground plane representation makes it difficult to manipulate objects that are vertically stacked or overlapping. Extending the approach to allow editing of 3D relationships between objects would be beneficial. 

3. Enabling vertical object translations. The ground plane representation concentrates editing operations in the horizontal plane. Allowing objects to be translated vertically would make manipulation more flexible.

4. Rendering quality improvements for complex real-world scenes. The background complexity and lighting variations in real scenes can degrade the rendering quality. More research into effectively modeling background and lighting would help.

5. Exploring the asset-based scene representation for large-scale procedural modeling of environments based on floorplans or programming frameworks. The reusable asset representation could be beneficial for efficiently constructing very large scenes.

6. Developing better techniques for refining object template patches to improve consistency across instances. Addressing lighting and occlusion variations would yield cleaner reusable template features.

7. Extending the approach for video and dynamic scenes involving moving objects and viewpoint changes. The current work focuses on static scenes but video editing would be a valuable extension.

In summary, the authors point to limitations involving object separation, stacking, and translation as well as challenges in complex real-world scenes. They suggest exploring procedural generation of large environments and refining techniques for learning reusable template features. Extending to video editing is also noted as a promising direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes AssetField, a novel neural scene representation for modeling 3D scenes. It represents the scene using a set of ground feature planes aligned with the physical ground plane and a shared vertical feature axis. The ground feature planes encode scene contents like density, color, and semantics, which allows intuitive manipulation and editing of objects by operating directly on the 2D planes. An asset library can be constructed by extracting feature patches of recurring objects from the feature planes. Objects can then be inserted, duplicated, grouped, and composed between scenes using the asset library. Compared to other neural rendering methods, AssetField achieves competitive novel view synthesis quality while also enabling object-level and category-level editing of both individual scenes as well as across scenes. The ground feature plane representation and asset library construction allow intuitive editing operations and realistic rendering of novel scene configurations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes AssetField, a novel neural scene representation for modeling indoor and outdoor environments. The key idea is to factorize a 3D neural radiance field into a 2D ground feature plane aligned with the bird's eye view of the scene, and a 1D vertical feature axis. The ground feature plane encodes scene density, color, and semantics, providing an intuitive interface for manipulating objects. An asset mining framework is developed to detect objects and group them into categories directly on the ground plane. Representative objects are selected as templates for each category. Their neural feature patches on the ground plane are stored in a cross-scene asset library. At rendering time, users can flexibly edit objects by manipulating their templates, enabling object-level, category-level, and scene-level editing. Realistic novel views can be synthesized for new scene configurations using the original model without retraining.

Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate AssetField's high rendering quality and versatile editing capability. Both indoor and outdoor environments can be easily reconfigured by intuitively composing asset templates on the ground plane visualization. Batch editing operations like changing colors for an entire object category are also supported. The cross-scene asset library allows discovering and reusing object templates across different scenes. Limitations include handling overlapping objects and complex backgrounds. But overall, AssetField offers an editable neural scene representation that resembles traditional graphical workflows built upon reusable asset libraries. The ground feature plane provides an intuitive interface for manipulating objects and layouts to design new environments.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes AssetField, a novel neural scene representation that learns a set of object-aware ground feature planes to represent the scene. The ground feature planes are aligned with the bird's eye view of the scene and encode information about scene density, color, and semantics. Asset mining and categorization can be performed directly on the ground planes to construct an asset library storing template feature patches of objects. This allows for intuitive object-level, category-level, and scene-level editing of the neural scene representation by manipulating the ground planes and asset library. For example, objects can be inserted, deleted, moved, rotated, and resized by editing their corresponding feature patches on the ground planes. The edited ground planes are then decoded into a 3D scene representation using shared neural decoders to produce realistic novel views of the edited scene. A key component is the proposed occupancy-guided RGB-DINO feature plane which captures object semantics and enables robust cross-scene analogue discovery and asset grouping.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing a new neural scene representation called AssetField. The main goals and contributions of AssetField seem to be:

1. It learns a set of ground feature planes that are aligned with a bird's eye view of the scene and allow intuitive manipulation of objects. 

2. It offers a way to discover and categorize assets (objects) in scenes in an unsupervised manner, by analyzing the learned ground feature planes.

3. It enables constructing a cross-scene asset library, storing template feature patches of objects that can be reused across scenes. This allows versatile editing at the object, category, and scene levels.

4. It aims to provide realistic novel view synthesis while also enabling intuitive editing of object layouts and scene configurations. 

So in summary, the key focus is on developing a neural scene representation that not only produces high quality renderings, but also supports easy and flexible editing of scenes by manipulating reusable assets. This is motivated by real world applications like interior design and urban planning that require visualizing different configurations.
