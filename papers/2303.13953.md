# [AssetField: Assets Mining and Reconfiguration in Ground Feature Plane   Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13953)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that representing 3D scenes with explicit ground feature planes enables intuitive object-level and group-level editing of neural radiance fields. 

The key claims are:

- Factorizing radiance fields into ground feature planes and a shared vertical axis encourages ground planes to encode more informative scene contents and layout.

- Modeling scene density, color, and semantics in integrated RGB-DINO planes makes them more robust to vertical object displacement, enabling cross-scene analogue discovery. 

- Assets can be directly mined and grouped from the ground planes in an unsupervised manner. 

- Storing template feature patches in a shared asset library allows efficient group editing by manipulating category templates.

- The ground plane representation provides an intuitive "canvas" for users to manipulate individual objects or entire scene layouts.

- Realistic novel views can be rendered for new scene configurations by combining edited ground planes with original vertical axes and decoder networks.

In summary, the ground plane radiance field representation enables object-level and group-level editing flexibility reminiscent of traditional graphics pipelines, while retaining the realism of neural rendering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing AssetField, a novel neural scene representation that can learn a set of object-aware ground feature planes to represent a 3D scene. Key aspects of AssetField include:

- It represents a 3D scene with a 2D ground feature plane aligned with the bird's eye view and a shared vertical feature axis. This allows intuitive manipulation and editing of objects on the ground plane.

- It can discover and extract assets (object neural representations) from the learned ground feature planes in an unsupervised manner. The assets can be grouped into categories to enable efficient group editing. 

- It constructs a cross-scene asset library by sharing vertical axes and decoders across scenes. This allows discovering common objects, expanding the library, and reusing assets for scene composition.

- The ground feature planes are informative, encoding density, color and semantics. This enables tasks like assets mining, categorization, and layout estimation directly on the planes.

- It provides a flexible way to edit and reconfigure scenes by manipulating assets on the ground plane. Operations like insertion, deletion, translation, rotation, duplication are supported at object, category and scene levels.

- It can render high-quality novel views of new scene configurations composed from the asset library, without needing to retrain models.

In summary, AssetField resembles traditional 3D modeling workflows that use reusable asset libraries, while providing neural rendering, allowing easy and intuitive editing of scenes to compose new configurations. The explicit ground feature planes are more user-friendly compared to other implicit neural representations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes AssetField, a novel neural scene representation that learns object-aware ground feature planes representing scene density, color and semantics, enabling unsupervised discovery and manipulation of objects and construction of a reusable cross-scene asset library for intuitive editing at object, category, and scene levels and realistic rendering of novel configurations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in neural 3D scene representations and editing:

- The key idea of representing a 3D scene with a ground plane feature map plus a shared vertical axis is novel. Most prior work uses full 3D grids or implicit representations like NeRF. The ground plane representation provides an intuitive interface for object manipulation.

- The idea of unsupervised mining of object assets and constructing a reusable asset library is not explored much before. This is analogous to classic graphics pipelines and provides efficiency. Prior work like ObjectNeRF requires masks.

- For scene editing capabilities, this paper allows object insertion, deletion, translation, rotation etc like some prior work. The main advantage is the intuitive interface via ground plane features. Group editing of objects is also possible by changing the category templates. 

- Scene reconfiguration by composing objects from the asset library is demonstrated. This is related to some concurrent work like GRAF and CMR that compose scenes from a dictionary of neural radiance fields. The ground plane representation provides more explicit control.

- The cross-scene consistency of features using shared vertical axis is unique to this work and enables discovering object analogues across scenes for the asset library.

- For view synthesis quality, AssetField achieves competitive results with NeRF and TensorRF baselines. The compact ground plane representation does not seem to compromise quality much.

Overall, I think the ground plane scene representation and the use of explicit asset libraries in AssetField are its main novel contributions. The interface for object manipulation is more intuitive than many prior implicit scene representations. The ideas of unsupervised asset mining and cross-scene consistency for transfer are also promising directions for future work on scalable scene modeling and editing.
