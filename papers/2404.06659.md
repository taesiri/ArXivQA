## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Conversational Task Assistants (CTAs) guide users step-by-step to perform activities like cooking recipes. However, ensuring user engagement over long complex tasks is challenging - users can easily get bored and abandon the task. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose enhancing user engagement by incorporating relevant, entertaining contextual facts into the CTA conversations, grounded in psychological theories of human interest.

They design a schema to assess interestingness of facts, covering dimensions like novelty, relevance, conciseness. Using this, they create a dataset of 1,379 cooking facts extracted from websites, cleaned and linked to recipe steps. 

They design a policy to inject facts into user-CTA dialogues, considering frequency, recency, voice-friendliness. Facts are shown during both task search and execution, after seeking user permission.  

Contributions:

- Novel schema to objectively examine interestingness of facts for CTAs, mitigating annotation subjectivity 

- Dataset of 1,379 cooking facts annotated for interestingness as per the schema

- Dialogue policy for effectively presenting facts to users to improve engagement

- Live testing showing 40% increase in user satisfaction ratings and 37% longer conversations with facts

- Framework provides a useful starting point to maintain user interest across CTA domains, reducing task abandonment
