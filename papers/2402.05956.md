# [Pathformer: Multi-scale transformers with Adaptive Pathways for Time   Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05956)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Real-world time series exhibit diverse variations and fluctuations at different temporal scales, calling for multi-scale modeling to capture features and dependencies across scales. 
- Existing Transformer-based methods for time series forecasting mainly model limited or fixed scales, making it difficult to capture complex characteristics across various scales.
- Two main challenges limit effective multi-scale modeling in Transformers: (1) Incompleteness of modeling temporal resolution and temporal distance; (2) Fixed multi-scale modeling process unable to adapt to varying dynamics.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Pathformer, multi-scale Transformers with adaptive pathways for time series forecasting.

Key Contributions:

1. Multi-scale Transformer Block:
   - Integrates perspectives of temporal resolution and distance 
   - Multi-scale division: Divides input into patches of different sizes (temporal resolutions)
   - Dual attention: Inter-patch attention models global correlations; Intra-patch attention models local details (temporal distances)
   
2. Adaptive Pathways:
   - Multi-scale router: Decomposes trend and seasonality, selects patch sizes based on input dynamics
   - Multi-scale aggregator: Aggregates multi-scale outputs from Transformer weighted by router
   - Enables adaptive modeling of critical scales for each input sample
   
3. Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on 11 benchmark datasets and shows stronger generalization under various transfer scenarios.
   - Outperforms existing Transformer variants and multi-scale models 
   - Demonstrates effectiveness of modeling temporal resolution and distance
   - Validates benefits of adaptive modeling different scales per input sample

In summary, the key innovation is an adaptive multi-scale Transformer architecture that models time series across scales of temporal resolution and distance, with adaptive pathways to select critical scales based on input dynamics. This achieves improved accuracy and generalization for time series forecasting.
