# [A mathematical model for simultaneous personnel shift planning and   unrelated parallel machine scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15670)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses a production scheduling problem involving unrelated parallel machines with sequence-dependent setup times and limited availability of personnel (auxiliary resource) needed to operate the machines. Key aspects of the problem are:

- Multiple jobs need to be scheduled on parallel machines that can process jobs at different speeds (unrelated). 

- Setup times are required when switching between jobs on a machine, with the setup time dependent on both the machine and the job sequence (sequence-dependent setup times).

- Personnel are needed to supervise machine operations and setups, with the number of personnel less than the number of machines. So personnel availability constrains the number of machines that can operate.

- Personnel have variable shift hours and availability within discrete time periods in the scheduling horizon. 

- Other constraints: machine eligibility for jobs, release times, delivery times.

- Objective is to minimize total production time.

Proposed Solution:

- A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed that incorporates all the problem constraints. 

- Novel concepts introduced: "Positions" to allow handling cases where a machine operates multiple times within a period, ensuring connectivity of production sequence.

- Separate constraints for personnel allocation, sequencing, timing in addition to those for jobs.

- A two-step solution approach proposed to improve solving speed:
  
    1) Maximizes number of scheduled jobs
  
    2) Minimizes production time (uses solution from step 1 for warm start)

Main Contributions:

- Handles variability in personnel availability and shift hours across scheduling horizon. Prior works assume constant resource availability.

- Comprehensive MILP model incorporating sequence-dependent setups, machine eligibility, release/delivery constraints.

- Model scales to problem sizes of 120 jobs, 8 machines, 7 personnel based on computational experiments.

- Analysis shows machine eligibility and time windows can increase production time by 46% and 40% respectively.

- Demonstrates practical utility through application to an industrial case study in food processing. Enables shift scheduling to improve worker utilization from 66% to over 95%.

In summary, the paper makes both modeling and practical contributions in production scheduling under personnel availability constraints. The model and solution method can generate optimal or near-optimal solutions efficiently. When applied to real-world problems, valuable insights are provided to improve operational efficiency.
