# [ShapeGPT: 3D Shape Generation with A Unified Multi-modal Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17618)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes ShapeGPT, a novel unified multimodal framework for diverse shape-centric tasks guided by language instructions. The key motivation is developing a versatile generative shape model leveraging large language models, which can benefit shape-related applications through flexibility. 

The core methodology involves constructing a shape-language codebook by discretizing continuous shapes into shape words using VQ-VAEs, assembling them into shape sentences following linguistic rules, and integrating textual instructions to form multimodal paragraphs. This shape-text alignment facilitates comprehension of inter-modal relationships.  

A three-stage training strategy is introduced - pretraining the shape tokenizer and basic language model, multimodal alignment on limited data, and generalization to diverse tasks/data. This enables the model to handle various inputs like text, images, shapes and output shapes, text or edited shapes based on instructions.

Experiments conducted on ShapeNet and Objaverse benchmarks demonstrate ShapeGPT's effectiveness across text-to-shape, shape-to-text, conditional/multimodal shape generation, shape editing and other task types. Comparative assessments show performance rivaling specialized state-of-the-art techniques. Ablations also validate modeling choices regarding tokenization, architecture and pretraining.

To summarize, ShapeGPT establishes a unified shape-language model using transformations and training techniques tailored for this multimodal domain. Both qualitative and quantitative results exhibit its versatility and competence across diverse shape-centric generative tasks purely based on language instructions.
