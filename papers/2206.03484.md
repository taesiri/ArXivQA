# [Detection Hub: Unifying Object Detection Datasets via Query Adaptation   on Language Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03484)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we unify multiple object detection datasets to train a single general object detector that works well across different datasets?

The key challenges they identify in doing this are:

1) Taxonomy differences - different datasets use different class names and taxonomies. 

2) Annotation inconsistencies - objects labeled as foreground in one dataset may be background in another.

To address these challenges, the main ideas proposed in the paper are:

1) Use a category-aligned embedding based on language models to map class names into a unified semantic space. This helps align the taxonomies.

2) Use dataset-specific adapted object queries to make the detector dataset-aware. This helps handle annotation inconsistencies.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by using a category-aligned embedding and dataset-adapted queries, they can train a single general object detector that works well across multiple diverse datasets with different taxonomies and annotations.
