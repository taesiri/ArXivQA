# [DIVERSE: Deciphering Internet Views on the U.S. Military Through Video   Comment Stance Analysis, A Novel Benchmark Dataset for Stance Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03334)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Stance detection (determining expressed opinions towards a target) is critical for computational social science tasks like analyzing marketing campaign reception. 
- Existing stance detection datasets have limitations: from single platforms (Twitter), have single stance labels per text, are small-scale (few thousand samples), and require extensive human annotation.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduces a new stance detection dataset called DIVERSE with 173k YouTube comments on US Army videos. 
- Comments labeled for stance towards video and towards US Army using a human-guided, machine-assisted methodology called Data Programming. 
- Weak labels that capture different signals of stance are created, like presence of hate speech and sarcasm (indicates against stance) or positive keywords (indicates support stance).
- Weak labels also obtained from sentiment analysis and inferences of two Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned on multi-dataset.
- Data Programming model combines weak labels to produce final stance labels. Enables large-scale labeling.

Main Contributions:
- Novel stance detection benchmark dataset with comments from new platform (YouTube vs only Twitter before), multiple stance labels per text, controversial content, and over 3x more labeled texts than prior datasets.
- Demonstration of human-guided, machine-assisted labeling pipeline to create large stance detection datasets efficiently using weak supervision signals and Data Programming.
- Analysis of dataset properties over time and differences in stance reception across videos to enable future research directions.
- Validation of produced stance labels via Leave-One-Out evaluation on existing benchmarks.

The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset to advance stance detection research that mitigates limitations of current datasets. It also proposes a methodology to rapidly create labeled stance data at scale by transforming manual labeling into easier weak labeling tasks. Analysis of the dataset properties is also provided to inform future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel stance detection dataset of 173,000 YouTube comments towards U.S. military videos, labeled using a human-guided, machine-assisted methodology that combines weak signals like hate speech and sentiment with inferences from Large Language Models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of DIVERSE, a novel benchmark stance detection dataset comprising over 173,000 YouTube comments annotated for their stance towards videos posted by the U.S. Army. The key novelties of this dataset are:

1) It is based on YouTube comments rather than the commonly used Twitter data. 

2) The comments have labeled stances towards two targets - the U.S. Army and the video itself. Most other stance datasets only have stances labeled towards a single target.

3) The methodology uses a human-guided, machine-assisted labeling process based on the data programming paradigm. This allows the creation of a large labeled dataset more efficiently than pure manual annotation.

4) The dataset exhibits a high degree of controversial content and stance-taking behavior compared to other benchmarks. There is a balance of "support", "against" and "neutral" stances.

In summary, the key contribution is a new form of stance detection benchmark that pushes the boundaries of existing datasets through its dual targets, controversial domain content, large size, and novel human-machine labeling. It enables new research directions in stance detection.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using weak labels such as the presence of hate speech, sarcasm, sentiment, keywords, and stance inferences from Large Language Models (LLMs). Could you expand more on the methodology and decision process behind selecting these specific weak labels? What other potential weak labels were considered and why were they not selected?  

2. In combining the weak labels to determine the final stance label, did you experiment with different aggregation methods or weighting schemes for the weak labels? If so, what led you to select the particular Data Programming model used? If not, would exploring different aggregation methods be an area for future work?

3. The paper states two variations were used for the prompting of the LLMs when labeling stance - one with and one without incorporating reply structure. Could you elaborate on if and how the results differed between these two prompting strategies?  Does prompting scheme design represent an impactful area for improvement?

4. You used two different LLMs for labeling stance - Flan-UL2 and Mistral-7B. What were the key differences you observed between these models in terms of stance labeling performance and output? Would the use of other state-of-the-art LLMs lead to further enhancements?

5. The Data Programming methodology leverages machine assistance for labeling. Could you discuss if you established guidelines or mechanisms to prevent algorithmic bias from impacting the labeling? How do you ensure fair, accurate and representative labels?

6. With machine-assisted labeling, traceability is important. Could you describe the transparency procedures in place that allow one to understand or audit why a particular label was applied to a given comment?

7. You utilized both dataset-specific traits as well as the linguistic capabilities of LLMs. In your view, what are the pros and cons of each method? When would you recommend using one over the other?

8. What methodology did you use to evaluate the overall quality of the final stance labels produced? Are there other validation approaches you would recommend for future work?  

9. One limitation mentioned is the computational constraints that restricted LLM choice. How do you envision advances in efficient LLM architectures transforming this labeling approach over time?

10. Beyond enhancing stance detection, what other potential applications do you envision this methodology and dataset contributing towards, such as in areas of misinformation detection or natural language understanding?
