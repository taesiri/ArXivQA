## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing video individual counting (VIC) methods require expensive per-target trajectory annotations to associate identities across frames. This limits scaling up datasets and models. 

- To address this, the authors propose a new weakly supervised VIC (WVIC) task, which only requires identity-agnostic annotations of inflows and outflows instead of individual trajectories.

Method:
- The authors propose a Contrastive learning with Group-level Matching (CGNet) method as a strong baseline for WVIC.

- CGNet contains a frame-level crowd locator, an encoder network and a Memory-based Count Predictor (MCP). 

- The encoder uses a novel Group-level Matching Loss (GML) to distinguish between matched groups vs unmatched groups across frames based on inflow/outflow labels. GML contains a soft contrastive loss to pull matched groups closer and a hinge loss to push unmatched groups apart.

- MCP stores appearance templates of recent individuals to handle variations and re-entries.

Contributions:
- Propose a new weakly supervised VIC (WVIC) task that only requires inflow/outflow annotations instead of trajectories.

- Develop an automatic pipeline to generate WVIC annotations from existing datasets. Re-annotate SenseCrowd and CroHD datasets. 

- Collect a new large-scale WVIC dataset captured from UAVs with 398K boxes over 5K frames.

- Propose CGNet as a strong baseline for WVIC, using a novel contrastive learning method with group-level matching. 

- Extensive experiments show CGNet outperforms supervised methods on WVIC task over 3 datasets. Weak supervision causes little performance drop.
