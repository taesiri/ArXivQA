# [Chain of Explanation: New Prompting Method to Generate Higher Quality   Natural Language Explanation for Implicit Hate Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04889)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we generate high-quality natural language explanations (NLE) for implicit hate speech using prompting methods with sequence-to-sequence models?

The key points about the research question:

- The paper focuses on generating NLEs specifically for implicit hate speech, rather than explicit hate speech. Implicit hate speech is more subtle and requires reasoning about implied meanings.

- The authors propose using prompting methods to provide additional context and guidance to models to generate better NLEs. This includes providing information about whether the text is hateful, the target group, etc. 

- They focus on exploring sequence-to-sequence models for NLE generation, rather than just auto-regressive models like GPT-2 which have been used in prior work.

- The goal is to generate high-quality NLEs, which they evaluate through both automatic metrics and human evaluations of informativeness and clarity.

So in summary, the central research question is about enhancing NLE generation for implicit hate speech by using prompting methods and sequence-to-sequence models to achieve higher quality explanations. The quality is assessed through automatic metrics and human evaluations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new prompting method called Chain of Explanation (CoE) to generate high-quality natural language explanations for implicit hate speech. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- They propose the CoE prompting method that uses heuristic words and target group information to guide the model to generate better explanations. 

- They demonstrate that CoE prompting significantly improves the quality of generated explanations compared to a baseline without prompting, improving BLEU score from 44.0 to 62.3.

- They comprehensively evaluate the quality of generated explanations using various automatic metrics as well as human annotations of informativeness and clarity. 

- They provide an ablation study showing the importance of each component of the CoE prompt design.

- They analyze the correlation between automatic metrics and human annotations, finding semantic similarity metrics like BLEURT correlate better with human scores.

Overall, the key novelty is introducing and evaluating the CoE prompting method to improve natural language explanation generation for implicit hate speech detection. The comprehensive analysis provides insights into better evaluating such generated explanations.
