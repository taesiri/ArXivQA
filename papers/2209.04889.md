# [Chain of Explanation: New Prompting Method to Generate Higher Quality   Natural Language Explanation for Implicit Hate Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04889)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we generate high-quality natural language explanations (NLE) for implicit hate speech using prompting methods with sequence-to-sequence models?

The key points about the research question:

- The paper focuses on generating NLEs specifically for implicit hate speech, rather than explicit hate speech. Implicit hate speech is more subtle and requires reasoning about implied meanings.

- The authors propose using prompting methods to provide additional context and guidance to models to generate better NLEs. This includes providing information about whether the text is hateful, the target group, etc. 

- They focus on exploring sequence-to-sequence models for NLE generation, rather than just auto-regressive models like GPT-2 which have been used in prior work.

- The goal is to generate high-quality NLEs, which they evaluate through both automatic metrics and human evaluations of informativeness and clarity.

So in summary, the central research question is about enhancing NLE generation for implicit hate speech by using prompting methods and sequence-to-sequence models to achieve higher quality explanations. The quality is assessed through automatic metrics and human evaluations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new prompting method called Chain of Explanation (CoE) to generate high-quality natural language explanations for implicit hate speech. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- They propose the CoE prompting method that uses heuristic words and target group information to guide the model to generate better explanations. 

- They demonstrate that CoE prompting significantly improves the quality of generated explanations compared to a baseline without prompting, improving BLEU score from 44.0 to 62.3.

- They comprehensively evaluate the quality of generated explanations using various automatic metrics as well as human annotations of informativeness and clarity. 

- They provide an ablation study showing the importance of each component of the CoE prompt design.

- They analyze the correlation between automatic metrics and human annotations, finding semantic similarity metrics like BLEURT correlate better with human scores.

Overall, the key novelty is introducing and evaluating the CoE prompting method to improve natural language explanation generation for implicit hate speech detection. The comprehensive analysis provides insights into better evaluating such generated explanations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new prompting method called Chain of Explanation to generate high-quality natural language explanations for implicit hate speech, and shows improvements over baseline methods through automatic and human evaluations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other research on generating natural language explanations for hate speech detection:

- The paper focuses on generating explanations specifically for implicit hate speech, rather than explicit hate speech. Many previous studies have looked at explaining explicit hate speech by highlighting offensive words/phrases. Explaining implicit hate speech is more challenging and requires generating new text to convey the implied meaning. 

- The authors propose a novel prompting method called Chain of Explanation (CoE) to guide text generation models in producing high-quality explanations. Other recent work has used autoregressive models like GPT-2 without specialized prompting techniques. The CoE prompt incorporates heuristic words, hate speech labels, and target groups.

- The paper comprehensively evaluates generated explanations using automatic metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore as well as human evaluations of informativeness and clarity. Many prior studies rely solely on automatic metrics. The human evals provide a useful complement assessing quality.

- The authors experiment with different model architectures like autoregressive, seq2seq, and T5 models. They find BART performs the best overall. Prior work in this space has focused more narrowly on just GPT-2 style models. Exploring different architectures is a nice contribution.

- For datasets, the paper uses the LatentHatred benchmark dataset. This is a fairly standard dataset used by other recent papers on hate speech explanation as well.

Overall, the prompts and human evaluations are innovative aspects of this paper. The comprehensive experiments on multiple models also strengthen the contributions compared to prior work. The focus on implicit hate speech explanations addresses an important problem not fully solved by previous methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigate the origin of the differences between the correlations of automatic metrics like BLEU and ROUGE with human annotations of informativeness and clarity. The authors found that these metrics correlated more strongly with informativeness than clarity, which differed from prior work. Understanding these differences could help improve automatic evaluation metrics.

- Explore potential solutions to filter out or rephrase harmful expressions in generated explanations, since the current models may produce toxic or hateful outputs. The authors suggest applying a "shepherding system" for this purpose.

- Continue developing prompting methods tailored for generating explanations of implicit hate speech, as prompt engineering is still an open challenge. The effectiveness of prompts can vary across different data instances.

- Expand human evaluations with more annotators and data to further assess the quality of generated explanations. The authors had to do substantial pre-processing of annotations to reach inter-rater agreement.

- Test the generalizability of the Chain of Explanation prompting approach on other tasks and datasets that require reasoning-based text generation.

- Examine if and how pre-trained language models learn implicit biases or logic expressed in hate speech data during training. This could affect the faithfulness of the generated explanations.

In summary, the key suggestions are to better understand the gaps between automatic and human metrics, handle potential risks of harmful outputs, refine prompt engineering, collect larger human judgments, and probe models for unhealthy biases picked up during training.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new prompting method called Chain of Explanation (CoE) to generate high-quality natural language explanations (NLE) for implicit hate speech. The CoE prompt provides the model with heuristic words, demonstrations of the hateful intention, and target group information to help guide the generation. The input sequence contains the original tweet, heuristic text "Given Text:", hate label "Is the text hateful? Yes", target group "The target group is: {target}", heuristic text "It is hateful because:", and then the NLE to be generated. They experiment with different pre-trained language models including GPT-2, GPT-Neo, OPT, BART, and T5. Results show the CoE prompting method significantly improves automatic evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE. An ablation study demonstrates providing the target group is the most important factor. The generated explanations are also evaluated via human annotations of informativeness and clarity, with results comparable to human written explanations.
