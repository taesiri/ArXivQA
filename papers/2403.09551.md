# [WeakSurg: Weakly supervised surgical instrument segmentation using   temporal equivariance and semantic continuity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09551)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Surgical instrument segmentation (SIS) is an important prerequisite for automated surgery and surgical assistance systems. 
- Current SIS methods rely on full supervision which requires large amounts of precise pixel-level annotations, limiting their practicality. 
- Weakly supervised SIS with only image-level instrument presence labels has been rarely explored due to the highly under-constrained challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes WeakSurg, a novel weakly supervised SIS architecture that only relies on instrument presence annotations. 
- It extends a two-stage weakly supervised semantic segmentation paradigm by incorporating temporal information from surgical videos in two ways:
  1) Temporal Equivalence: A prototype-based temporal equivariance regulation (PTER) loss enhances pixel-wise consistency between adjacent features.
  2) Semantic Continuity: A class-aware temporal semantic continuity (CTSC) loss constrains semantic consistency between global target frames and local non-discriminative regions from adjacent frames.
- These help activate more target regions and maintain robustness against appearance changes.

Main Contributions:
- First exploration of surgical instrument segmentation with only instrument presence supervision.
- Incorporation of temporal information via two novel losses - PTER and CTSC losses.
- State-of-the-art performance on the Cholec80 dataset for both semantic and instance segmentation metrics.
- Additional instance-level annotation of 40 videos in Cholec80 that is manually labeled and clinician-validated.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel weakly supervised architecture for surgical instrument segmentation that only relies on instrument presence labels. It significantly advances the state-of-the-art by being the first to incorporate temporal information for this problem via specially designed losses. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach.
