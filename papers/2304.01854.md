# [A Fully-automatic Side-scan Sonar SLAM Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01854)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper addresses the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using only a side-scan sonar (SSS). SSS is useful for producing high resolution seafloor images but using the images for SLAM is challenging due to lack of 3D information and indistinct features. Existing methods rely on manual annotation of landmarks or make simplifying assumptions about dead-reckoning drift. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a fully automatic SLAM framework using SSS. The key components are:

1) Preprocess SSS images to reduce distortions and create a geo-referenced image to aid data association. 

2) Robustly detect keypoints in each SSS image and match them between overlapping images using a combination of visual descriptors and geometric constraints.

3) Formulate a two-ping measurement model to estimate the relative pose between pairs of matched keypoints. This is combined with dead-reckoning odometry constraints in a factor graph optimization to refine the ping poses.  

4) Add all the relative pose constraints in a pose graph SLAM formulation to globally optimize the entire AUV trajectory.

Main Contributions:

- A complete open-source SSS SLAM framework requiring no manual intervention, demonstrating feasibility of using only SSS for SLAM.

- A reliable method to evaluate underwater SLAM using manually annotated keypoints and multibeam echosounder data, overcoming the difficulty in getting ground truth.

- Quantitative analysis on real AUV data showing the proposed method reduces dead-reckoning drift, with lower landmark consistency errors and trajectory errors compared to baselines.

In summary, the paper presents a novel automatic SSS SLAM system to improve AUV localization along with a feasible evaluation approach. The open-source framework and analyses advance the state-of-the-art in underwater SLAM using only lightweight side-scan sonar sensors.
