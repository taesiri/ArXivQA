# [Learning method for S4 with Diagonal State Space Layers using Balanced   Truncation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15993)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models like S4 with Diagonal State Space (DSS) layers show excellent capability in capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, but have a large number of parameters. This makes inference computationally expensive, limiting their practical use in edge devices with constraints on memory, computational resources, and power consumption. 

- Existing training methods using Skew-HiPPO initialization enhance model performance, but do not address the computational costs during inference.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a training method that applies balanced truncation, a model reduction technique from control theory, to pre-trained DSS layers. This derives a reduced DSS model with fewer parameters.

- Parameters from the reduced DSS are then used to initialize retraining the original model. This improved initialization outperforms Skew-HiPPO initialization in accuracy with the same model size.

- Evaluated on Long Range Arena (LRA) tasks, models trained with the proposed method achieve higher accuracy than Skew-HiPPO models with the same number of parameters.

Main Contributions:
- A novel training method for S4 models with DSS layers that enhances initialization using balanced truncation on pre-trained models, improving accuracy with fewer parameters.

- Demonstrates superior performance versus Skew-HiPPO initialization on LRA tasks. Models trained with the proposed technique surpass Skew-HiPPO models of the same size in accuracy.

- Reveals a positive correlation between pre-training accuracy and post-training accuracy after retraining with parameters from reduced model.

- Addresses computational costs of inference for practical edge deployment by achieving better accuracy with reduced parameters.

In summary, the paper makes effective use of model reduction to improve initialization and train performant S4 models with DSS layers that have lower computational costs, well-suited for edge devices. The proposed training technique consistently outperforms conventional methods.
