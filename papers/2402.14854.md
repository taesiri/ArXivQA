# [A Dual-Prompting for Interpretable Mental Health Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14854)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is increasing demand for AI tools to monitor mental health, but their practical use is limited by a lack of interpretability. 
- Recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for mental health analysis but suffer from unreliability and inconsistency.
- The CLPsych 2024 Shared Task introduces challenges to enhance LLM interpretability for detecting suicidality from linguistic content. This includes highlighting key phrases from posts (Task A) and summarizing evidence of suicide risk across posts (Task B).

Proposed Solution: 
- A dual prompting approach with (1) Knowledge-aware evidence extraction and (2) Evidence summarization with an LLM-based consistency evaluator
- For Task A:
  - Use the mental health LLM MentaLLaMA 
  - Assign an expert identity (psychiatrist)
  - Utilize a suicide dictionary to capture relevant context
- For Task B:  
  - Incorporate extractive summaries from Task A ("Extract then Generate")
  - Generate multiple candidate summaries and score consistency with an LLM evaluator to select the best

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates combining domain knowledge improves evidence extraction 
- Highlights importance of few-shot learning examples in clinical domains
- Finds general LLMs outperform domain-specific LLMs for consistency in summarization 
- Shows potential to aid clinicians in assessing mental state progression through enhanced interpretability

In summary, the key innovation is a dual prompting strategy to improve LLM reliability in mental health analysis for both highlighting evidence phrases and summarizing risk across texts. The experiments reveal performance gains and potential clinical utility.
