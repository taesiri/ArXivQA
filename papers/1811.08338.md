# [Causal Inference by String Diagram Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08338)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to use categorical and diagrammatic methods to identify causal effects from observational data. Specifically, the paper develops a technique called "string diagram surgery" to compute interventional distributions and infer causal relationships.The key ideas are:- Representing causal structures syntactically as string diagrams in a category. This distinguishes the syntax (string diagrams) from the semantics (probabilistic models).- Modeling interventions as "surgery" on the string diagrams, implemented categorically as an endofunctor. This severs incoming arrows to a variable, destroying dependencies.- Introducing "comb factorizations" to isolate parts of an observational distribution. This is a generalization of categorical disintegration. - Applying comb factorizations and diagram surgery to compute interventional distributions from observational data in certain cases. This provides a diagrammatic version of existing causal identifiability criteria.So in summary, the main research contribution is developing the semantic framework and surgical techniques to identify causal effects from data, under certain assumptions, using categorical string diagrams. This provides a new perspective on causal inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing a new categorically-oriented framework for causal inference, based on distinguishing between syntax (string diagrams) and semantics (stochastic matrices). The key ideas are:- Representing causal structures syntactically as string diagrams in a free category generated by a DAG. Bayesian networks are then functors from this free category to stochastic matrices.- Modeling interventions as "string diagram surgery", implemented as an endofunctor that cuts a variable's connections. This propagates through the interpretation functor to compute interventional distributions. - Introducing "comb disintegration", a generalization of disintegration, as a tool for calculating interventional distributions from observational data in certain cases. Comb factorizations isolate different parts of a causal structure.- Applying these tools to a canonical example of inferring if smoking causes cancer in the presence of a confounder. The comb factorization allows computing the interventional distribution after intervening on smoking.- Showing these techniques apply more broadly to graphical criteria for identifiability of interventional distributions involving a single intervention.In summary, the paper develops a new categorical perspective on causal inference, with string diagram surgery and comb disintegration as the key techniques for relating syntax and semantics. This provides both conceptual clarity and practical graphical calculational tools.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper develops a categorical framework for causal inference that clearly distinguishes between the syntax of causal structures (string diagrams) and their semantics (stochastic matrices), enabling interventions to be modeled as syntactic surgery on string diagrams which then induces new semantic distributions via interpretative functors.
