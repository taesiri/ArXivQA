# [LitE-SNN: Designing Lightweight and Efficient Spiking Neural Network   through Spatial-Temporal Compressive Network Search and Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14652)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are highly energy-efficient and well-suited for low-power edge devices. However, pursuing high accuracy leads to large, long-timestep SNN models that conflict with the resource constraints of these devices. Therefore, there is a need to design lightweight and efficient SNNs that achieve high performance under limited memory and computing resources.

Solution:
The paper proposes LitESNN, a novel approach to incorporate both spatial and temporal compression into the automated SNN design process using neural architecture search (NAS). 

Spatial compression: A new Compressive Convolution (CompConv) block expands the NAS search space to support weight pruning and mixed-precision quantization. It shares weights and masks across branches to reduce computation.

Temporal compression: A compressive timestep search is introduced to identify the optimal timesteps under computational cost constraints, tailored to the temporal domain of SNNs.

Joint optimization: A multi-objective formulation simultaneously optimizes the architecture parameters along with spatial-temporal compression strategies to minimize resource costs while maximizing accuracy.

Main Contributions:
1) Novel CompConv to enable efficient integration of pruning and mixed-precision quantization in NAS for SNNs.

2) First work to propose compressive timestep search in NAS framework tailored for SNN temporal domain. 

3) Joint optimization algorithm that simultaneously learns compression strategies and architecture parameters.

4) Extensive experiments showing LitESNNs achieve competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art SNNs with remarkably compact model sizes and fewer computation costs.

5) Analysis validating effectiveness of LitESNN for balancing accuracy and resource costs, superiority over sequential optimization, and energy efficiency.

The paper's spatial-temporal compression integrated in the NAS pipeline offers an effective approach to design lightweight and efficient SNNs well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes LitESNN, a method to jointly optimize the neural architecture search along with spatio-temporal compression strategies like pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and compressive timestep search to design lightweight and efficient spiking neural networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new approach named LitESNN that incorporates both spatial and temporal compression into the automated network design process for spiking neural networks (SNNs). Specifically:

1) It presents a novel Compressive Convolution (CompConv) block to expand the search space to support pruning and mixed-precision quantization while reducing computation through weight and mask sharing. 

2) It proposes a compressive timestep search tailored for the temporal domain of SNNs to identify the optimal number of timesteps under specific computational cost constraints. 

3) It formulates a joint optimization to simultaneously learn the architecture parameters and spatial-temporal compression strategies to achieve high accuracy while minimizing memory and computation costs.

Through experiments, the paper shows LitESNN can achieve competitive or even higher accuracy with remarkably smaller model sizes and fewer computation costs compared to state-of-the-art lightweight SNN models. It also validates the effectiveness of LitESNN in balancing accuracy and resource costs, and the superiority of the joint optimization approach over sequential optimization.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a holistic approach to incorporate spatial and temporal compression into NAS to automatically design lightweight and efficient SNNs for resource-constrained applications.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The Compressive Convolution (CompConv) block expands the search space to support pruning and mixed-precision quantization. How does CompConv utilize shared weights and shared pruning masks to reduce computation compared to a naive solution?

2) The compressive timestep search is proposed to identify the optimal number of timesteps under specific computation cost constraints. How is the spike rate modified to incorporate trainable weights for each candidate number of timesteps?

3) The loss function formulated for joint optimization contains three terms - cross-entropy loss, memory loss, and computational cost loss. Explain the formulation of each of these terms and how they balance accuracy against resource costs.  

4) What is the two-step joint optimization algorithm proposed in this paper? Explain how the update of network weights and compression factors (pruning masks, quantization bitwidths, etc.) is coordinated across these two steps.

5) After the architecture search process, how are the final architecture parameters, bitwidths, number of timesteps etc. determined for the decoded network?

6) How does the temperature parameter in the differentiable spike (Dspike) function contribute to enabling the joint optimization process?

7) The compressive timestep search is motivated by the insight that longer timesteps improve accuracy but increase computations. Discuss how the formulation in Equation 8 balances this tradeoff during architecture search.  

8) Why can sequential optimization of architecture, pruning, quantization lead to suboptimal solutions compared to the joint optimization approach proposed in this paper? Explain with an example scenario.

9) The small-scale sequential baseline model in Table 3 suffers a substantial accuracy drop compared to the small-scale LitESNN model. Provide an explanation for why this occurs.

10) In addition to computational energy, memory access also contributes to energy consumption. Qualitatively discuss how the model compression techniques used in LitESNN can help reduce memory access-related energy.
