# [Few-Shot Bot: Prompt-Based Learning for Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08118)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How effective is prompt-based few-shot learning for dialogue systems compared to traditional full-shot training of neural models?The authors investigate using prompt-based few-shot learning, where only a few examples are provided in the context to the language model, to perform various dialogue tasks. This is compared to standard approaches that require full-shot training with gradient updates on large datasets. The key hypotheses appear to be:- Prompt-based few-shot learning can achieve competitive performance to fully trained models in dialogue tasks, without any gradient-based fine-tuning.- Larger language models will perform better at prompt-based few-shot learning for dialogue.- A small number of examples (e.g. 1-10 shots) provided in the prompt context is sufficient, and more shots may not always improve performance.So in summary, the central research question is assessing if prompt-based few-shot learning can match or exceed the performance of traditional full-shot trained models for conversational AI tasks. The authors systematically test this across a wide range of dialogue datasets and models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. The authors benchmark prompt-based few-shot learning on a variety of dialogue-related datasets, including both chit-chat and task-oriented dialogues. They test on a total of 11 datasets spanning 15 different tasks.2. They propose a novel prompt-based few-shot classifier for skill selection that can map dialogue histories to the most appropriate prompt/skill without requiring any fine-tuning. 3. They introduce the Few-Shot Bot (FSB) which combines prompt-based few-shot learning and the skill selector to create an end-to-end chatbot. The FSB can dynamically select skills, query knowledge bases, and generate human-like responses using only a few examples per skill, without any model training.4. They show that prompt-based few-shot learning using large language models like GPT-3 can achieve competitive results to state-of-the-art fully trained dialogue models across many tasks. The performance generally improves with more shots and larger model size.5. They demonstrate the feasibility of creating multi-skill chatbots with minimal training by leveraging capabilities of large pre-trained LMs via prompt engineering. The FSB can easily incorporate new skills just by adding prompt examples.In summary, the key innovation is showing the potential of prompt-based few-shot learning for building dialogue systems without expensive model training, through comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple datasets and introduction of the FSB chatbot framework.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes and benchmarks a prompt-based few-shot learning approach for dialogue systems, showing it can achieve competitive performance to fully trained state-of-the-art models using only a few examples in the context of large language models like GPT-3, without any gradient updates.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in prompt-based learning for dialogue systems:- This paper provides the first comprehensive benchmark of prompt-based few-shot learning across a wide variety of dialogue tasks, including both chit-chat and task-oriented dialog. Prior work has focused more narrowly on specific tasks like DST.- The paper introduces a novel prompt-based few-shot classifier for skill selection, allowing the model to dynamically choose the appropriate prompt/skill without any fine-tuning. This is a new contribution not explored in prior work. - The results demonstrate that prompt-based learning can achieve competitive results to fully fine-tuned models on many dialogue tasks using the largest publicly available LMs like GPT-J. Prior work has generally used smaller LMs.- The proposed Few-Shot Bot combines prompt-based learning for response generation, conversational parsing like DST, and the prompt-based skill selector in an end-to-end system. This is the first demonstration of a fully prompt-based dialogue agent.- Compared to concurrent work by Zheng et al. on prompt learning for dialogue, this work uses strictly prompt-based methods without any prompt tuning or fine-tuning.Overall, this paper provides significant new evidence for the viability of prompt-based learning in dialogue systems using the capabilities of large language models. The comprehensive benchmarking and novel skill selector contribution advance the state-of-the-art in this emerging research area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring larger language models for dialogue tasks, such as GPT-3 and GPT-J, since the results show a correlation between model size and performance. However, the authors were limited by compute resources and model availability.- Additional human evaluation of the few-shot bot (FSB), to compare it to state-of-the-art chatbots like Meena and BlenderBot. The authors only conducted automatic evaluations.- Applying prompt-based few-shot learning to more dialogue tasks and datasets, such as conversational semantic parsing, multilingual dialogues, continual learning settings, etc. The authors explored a good variety but there are many other datasets and skills that could be examined.- Improving the prompts further, either manually or automatically, since performance is sensitive to prompt design. This could involve learning optimal prompt orderings or selecting optimal examples to include.- Using more advanced decoding strategies like beam search during generation, instead of just greedy decoding, which could improve performance.- Exploring prompt tuning and adapter tuning as alternatives to pure prompt-based learning, to overcome limits on number of shots.- Applying methods like Neural Path Hunter to improve knowledge graph grounding and reasoning within the few-shot bot.- Implementing safety measures to avoid inappropriate responses, which is needed before any real-world deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper explores prompt-based few-shot learning in dialogue systems. Prompt-based few-shot learning uses a language model (LM) conditioned on a few input-output examples, without any gradient updates. The authors benchmark LMs of varying sizes on 9 response generation tasks and 5 conversational parsing tasks. The tasks cover knowledge grounded dialogues, open chit-chat, controlled generation, etc. For response generation, the largest LM (GPT-J 6B) achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art models trained on full datasets. For parsing tasks, there is still a gap in performance compared to trained models. The authors propose a perplexity based prompt selector to automatically select the skill for a given dialogue. Finally, they introduce the Few-Shot Bot which combines prompt-based response generation, parsing skills and the selector, to make an end-to-end conversational agent using only few example dialogues, without any training. The results demonstrate the potential of prompt-based learning for building dialogue systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper explores prompt-based few-shot learning for dialogue systems. Prompt-based few-shot learning uses a language model (LM) and requires only a few textual examples as prompts to perform a task, without any fine-tuning or gradient updates to the LM. The authors benchmark prompt-based few-shot learning on a variety of dialogue tasks across two categories - response generation and conversational parsing. For response generation, they test on 9 datasets covering chit-chat, knowledge grounded conversations, and controlled stylistic response generation. For conversational parsing, they test on 5 datasets covering tasks like dialogue state tracking, document retrieval, graph path generation etc. They find that prompt-based few-shot learning achieves competitive results compared to fully trained models across many of these tasks when using the largest publicly available LMs like GPT-J (6B parameters). The results show a correlation between LM size and performance, suggesting further improvements with even larger LMs. The authors also propose a prompt-based few-shot classifier for skill selection to pick the most appropriate prompt/skill for a given dialogue history. Bringing these components together, they build an end-to-end chatbot - the Few Shot Bot (FSB) - that can automatically select skills, retrieve knowledge, and generate human-like responses using only a few examples per skill and no model training. The results demonstrate the promise of prompt-based few-shot learning for building dialogue systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper presents Few-Shot Bot (FSB), a prompt-based few-shot learning approach for dialogue systems. The key method is to use language model (LM) prompting with just a few examples to teach the model new conversational skills, without any gradient-based fine-tuning. For each dialogue task, prompts are designed using a template and a few example input-output pairs from the training set. At inference time, the prompt is concatenated with the dialogue context and fed to the LM to generate the response. This approach is evaluated on a variety of dialogue tasks including chit-chat, knowledge-grounded response generation, conversational parsing, and controlled response styles. The results show that large LMs like GPT-J using prompt-based few-shot learning can achieve competitive performance to fully-trained state-of-the-art models across these tasks using just a few examples, without any training. The paper also proposes a prompt-based few-shot classifier for skill selection and combines these methods into an end-to-end chatbot called the Few-Shot Bot. Overall, the key contribution is showing the effectiveness of prompt-based few-shot learning for diverse dialogue tasks using large pre-trained LMs.
