# Few-Shot Bot: Prompt-Based Learning for Dialogue Systems

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How effective is prompt-based few-shot learning for dialogue systems compared to traditional full-shot training of neural models?The authors investigate using prompt-based few-shot learning, where only a few examples are provided in the context to the language model, to perform various dialogue tasks. This is compared to standard approaches that require full-shot training with gradient updates on large datasets. The key hypotheses appear to be:- Prompt-based few-shot learning can achieve competitive performance to fully trained models in dialogue tasks, without any gradient-based fine-tuning.- Larger language models will perform better at prompt-based few-shot learning for dialogue.- A small number of examples (e.g. 1-10 shots) provided in the prompt context is sufficient, and more shots may not always improve performance.So in summary, the central research question is assessing if prompt-based few-shot learning can match or exceed the performance of traditional full-shot trained models for conversational AI tasks. The authors systematically test this across a wide range of dialogue datasets and models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. The authors benchmark prompt-based few-shot learning on a variety of dialogue-related datasets, including both chit-chat and task-oriented dialogues. They test on a total of 11 datasets spanning 15 different tasks.2. They propose a novel prompt-based few-shot classifier for skill selection that can map dialogue histories to the most appropriate prompt/skill without requiring any fine-tuning. 3. They introduce the Few-Shot Bot (FSB) which combines prompt-based few-shot learning and the skill selector to create an end-to-end chatbot. The FSB can dynamically select skills, query knowledge bases, and generate human-like responses using only a few examples per skill, without any model training.4. They show that prompt-based few-shot learning using large language models like GPT-3 can achieve competitive results to state-of-the-art fully trained dialogue models across many tasks. The performance generally improves with more shots and larger model size.5. They demonstrate the feasibility of creating multi-skill chatbots with minimal training by leveraging capabilities of large pre-trained LMs via prompt engineering. The FSB can easily incorporate new skills just by adding prompt examples.In summary, the key innovation is showing the potential of prompt-based few-shot learning for building dialogue systems without expensive model training, through comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple datasets and introduction of the FSB chatbot framework.
