## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
Autonomous vehicle operation in all weather conditions poses significant challenges across the entire autonomy software stack, from perception to decision-making and control. Conventional approaches often tackle individual modules in isolation rather than taking a holistic, integrated approach. This makes handling adverse weather conditions difficult.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a modular software architecture for an autonomous shuttle bus that considers adverse weather resilience across multiple modules. Key elements include:

1) Perception Module: Uses multi-modal sensor fusion (cameras, LiDARs, radars) for accurate object and snow covered curb detection even in poor visibility.

2) Localization Module: Provides precise self-localization through RTK GNSS-inertial system and a GNSS-denied capability using landmarks from maps during outages. 

3) Decision Making Module: Determines safe driving actions and commands pullover/merging at bus stops based on perception/localization data. Supported by a safety module.

4) Path Planning Module: Plans global paths using maps and local paths avoiding obstacles using potential fields and Bezier curves.

The system is implemented on the WATonoBus, an autonomous shuttle serving a route at the University of Waterloo campus.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes a modular system architecture for an autonomous shuttle bus with weather resilience considerations across perception, decision-making and other modules.

2) Perception leverages multiple complementary sensors for reliable detection even in snow/rain. Curb detection uses LiDAR point clouds.

3) Localization module provides precise self-localization through RTK GNSS-inertial system and landmark-based GNSS-denied capability.

4) Intelligent bus stop pullover/merging maneuver planning specific for shuttle bus service.

5) Safety module performs extensive testing, run-time monitoring and records data for offline improvement. 

6) Real-world validation through daily deployment of the WATonoBus shuttle at University of Waterloo campus for almost a year in all weather conditions. Provides valuable learning and improvements.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in designing an integrated autonomous shuttle bus system architecture that achieves all-weather functionality. This is validated through extensive real-world testing. The architecture and learnings presented serve to advance the state-of-the-art in autonomous shuttle bus development.
