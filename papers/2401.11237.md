# [Closing the Gap between TD Learning and Supervised Learning -- A   Generalisation Point of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11237)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies whether recent supervised learning (SL) based approaches to reinforcement learning (RL), known as outcome conditional behavioral cloning (OCBC) algorithms, have the capability to "stitch" together pieces of experience to solve new tasks not seen during training. This "stitching" property is commonly associated with temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms in RL that perform dynamic programming. However, it remains unclear whether OCBC methods actually lack this important capability.

The paper formally defines "stitching" as a form of combinatorial generalization where the goal is to evaluate performance on (state, goal) pairs that were never seen together in the same trajectory during training, even though they may have been seen separately in different trajectories. For example, if states A and B were seen in separate trajectories leading to goals C and D, "stitching" refers to the ability to reach goal C from state B and goal D from state A at test time.

The paper hypothesizes, both theoretically and empirically, that current OCBC methods do not have this combinatorial generalization property and hence cannot perform "stitching".

Proposed Solution:
- The paper first formally shows that "stitching" requires combinatorial generalization because the training distribution of goals conditioned on states is different from the test distribution, even under certain assumptions. This result suggests OCBC methods have no guarantees for stitching.

- Inspired by data augmentation techniques from SL, the paper proposes a simple "temporal" data augmentation scheme for OCBC methods. The key idea is to replace the original goal with a new goal sampled from a different overlapping trajectory in the training data. This allows the model to see new state-goal combinations during training.

- The paper also proves that under certain smoothness assumptions, this temporal augmentation samples goals according to a 1-step stitching distribution, allowing OCBC methods to approximate the stitching property.

Main Contributions:
- Provides formal definition of "stitching" as combinatorial generalization in RL and shows OCBC methods have no guarantees for this property

- Proposes temporal data augmentation technique to improve stitching capability of OCBC methods

- Shows combinatorial generalization is key for data efficiency in sequential problems beyond RL like audio, video, text

- Constructs new RL benchmarks to precisely test for stitching generalization

- Demonstrates empirically that augmentation enables OCBC methods to solve new tasks requiring stitching on 10 envs, including image-based tasks


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies whether supervised learning approaches to reinforcement learning can stitch together pieces of experience to solve new tasks, showing theoretically and empirically that they lack this combinatorial generalization property but that a proposed temporal data augmentation method can provide it.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) Formally defining "stitching" in reinforcement learning as a form of combinatorial generalization, where the agent must complete tasks composed of state-goal pairs never seen together during training. 

2) Theoretically and empirically showing that common supervised learning approaches to RL (outcome conditional behavioral cloning methods) do not exhibit this stitching property, even with abundant data or model capacity.

3) Proposing a simple temporal data augmentation technique that allows supervised learning methods to acquire the stitching property. This data augmentation samples goals from different overlapping trajectories, facilitating generalization.

4) Demonstrating both theoretically and empirically that this temporal data augmentation enables supervised learning RL methods to successfully complete tasks composed of unseen state-goal pairs, effectively endowing them with the stitching capability.

In summary, the main contribution is connecting stitching to combinatorial generalization, using this viewpoint to analyze limitations of common RL methods, and devising a data augmentation technique to mitigate those limitations. This sheds light on the importance of combinatorial generalization for sequential decision making problems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Reinforcement learning (RL)
- Supervised learning (SL)
- Outcome conditional behavioral cloning (OCBC)
- Stitching
- Combinatorial generalization
- Dynamic programming 
- Temporal difference learning
- Offline RL
- Data augmentation

The paper discusses the difference between RL methods based on dynamic programming (which exhibit "stitching") and simpler RL methods based on supervised learning. It formalizes "stitching" as a form of combinatorial generalization that is required for solving tasks combining state-goal pairs never seen together during training. It hypothesizes and shows empirically that common OCBC algorithms lack this stitching property. To address this, the paper proposes a temporal data augmentation technique that can provide OCBC algorithms with stronger combinatorial generalization abilities.

So in summary, the key themes and terms revolve around contrasting dynamic programming and supervised learning approaches in RL, formalizing and testing for the "stitching" property, relating stitching to combinatorial generalization, and using data augmentation to improve generalization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes temporal data augmentation to improve the combinatorial generalization of OCBC methods. However, the augmentation relies on having a good distance metric between states. What are some ways the distance metric could be learned more effectively, especially for high-dimensional or image-based tasks?

2. How sensitive is the performance of temporal data augmentation to the choice of number of clusters K used in k-means clustering? Does performance plateau after a certain K or keep improving with more clusters? 

3. The paper shows theoretical connections between temporal data augmentation and approximate one-step stitching. Could more rounds of augmentation lead to better approximations of multi-step stitching? Is there a theoretical relation that could be derived?

4. For complex tasks with long horizons, is temporal data augmentation alone enough or would architectural improvements to OCBC methods also be needed to capture longer-term dependencies? 

5. The augmentation relies on finding overlapping trajectories to sample new goals from. For sparse reward tasks, trajectories may not overlap much. How could the augmentation be adapted for such settings?

6. Could temporal data augmentation also be applied in an online setting by augmenting with goals from the current trajectory rather than logged offline data? What challenges would this present?

7. What other forms of data augmentation could approximate properties of dynamic programming based methods besides temporal augmentation proposed here?

8. The paper studies combinatorial generalization in goal-reaching and return-conditioned tasks. What other sequential decision making problems could benefit from studying combinatorial generalization?

9. For real-world applications of offline RL, what kinds of domain knowledge could be incorporated into the temporal data augmentation to make it more practical?

10. The augmentation samples new goals randomly from a neighboring trajectory. Could importance sampling be used to focus augmentation on more viable goals? How could the viability of goals be estimated?
