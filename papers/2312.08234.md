# [Beyond the Label Itself: Latent Labels Enhance Semi-supervised Point   Cloud Panoptic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08234)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a semi-supervised multi-modal point cloud panoptic segmentation method that utilizes latent labels from limited labeled data to enhance performance. It introduces a novel data augmentation technique called Cylinder-Mix that reliably generates additional labeled point clouds by interleaved mixing of existing samples based on cylindrical voxels. This provides more training data without needing new annotations. The paper also proposes an Instance Position-Scale Learning (IPSL) module that projects 3D instance labels to 2D as bounding boxes to train an image detector. The predicted boxes are encoded as heatmaps indicating position and scale information and fused into the image encoder backbone. Experiments show the method outperforms previous state-of-the-art in semi-supervised panoptic segmentation on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets. Ablations demonstrate the adaptability of the IPSL module to use detectors from different datasets or masks from large language models. Both proposed techniques provide useful latent labels from self-supervision to improve segmentation, especially on instance boundaries, without requiring additional human annotations.
