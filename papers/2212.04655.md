# [MIMO Is All You Need : A Strong Multi-In-Multi-Out Baseline for Video   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04655)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How far can a simple Multi-In-Multi-Out (MIMO) architecture go in improving video prediction compared to existing Single-In-Single-Out (SISO) models?The key hypothesis is that MIMO architectures have been underestimated for video prediction and their strengths in addressing issues like long-term dependencies and error accumulation have not been thoroughly explored or exploited. The authors investigate tailoring a MIMO architecture using Transformers to establish a new state-of-the-art approach for video prediction. Their proposed model MIMO-VP is evaluated on multiple benchmarks and aims to demonstrate the capabilities of MIMO architectures compared to SISO models.In summary, the paper explores the potential of MIMO architectures for video prediction, with a focus on overcoming limitations of existing SISO models related to long-term dependencies and error accumulation over longer prediction horizons. The hypothesis is that a properly designed MIMO model can achieve much better performance than current approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a Multiple-In-Multiple-Out (MIMO) predictive strategy for video prediction, which generates the whole sequence of future frames in parallel rather than recursively like existing methods. This avoids error accumulation over time. 2. It presents a MIMO video prediction model called Predormer, which is built on convolutional Transformers. The model captures both long-term and short-term spatiotemporal dependencies of video sequences using convolutional multi-head attention and 3D convolutional feedforward networks.3. It conducts extensive experiments to analyze the effectiveness of the MIMO strategy and the model design. Results show Predormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets compared to previous recurrent and convolutional models.4. It provides insights into the benefits of the MIMO strategy for overcoming issues like error accumulation in long-term video prediction. The results demonstrate the potential of MIMO models in this domain.In summary, the key contribution is advocating for and developing an effective MIMO model for video prediction using convolutional Transformers. The model and experiments provide evidence that MIMO is a promising strategy for advancing video prediction performance.
