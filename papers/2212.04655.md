# [MIMO Is All You Need : A Strong Multi-In-Multi-Out Baseline for Video   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04655)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How far can a simple Multi-In-Multi-Out (MIMO) architecture go in improving video prediction compared to existing Single-In-Single-Out (SISO) models?The key hypothesis is that MIMO architectures have been underestimated for video prediction and their strengths in addressing issues like long-term dependencies and error accumulation have not been thoroughly explored or exploited. The authors investigate tailoring a MIMO architecture using Transformers to establish a new state-of-the-art approach for video prediction. Their proposed model MIMO-VP is evaluated on multiple benchmarks and aims to demonstrate the capabilities of MIMO architectures compared to SISO models.In summary, the paper explores the potential of MIMO architectures for video prediction, with a focus on overcoming limitations of existing SISO models related to long-term dependencies and error accumulation over longer prediction horizons. The hypothesis is that a properly designed MIMO model can achieve much better performance than current approaches.
