# [Explainable Adaptive Tree-based Model Selection for Time Series   Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01124)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
- Time series forecasting is challenging due to the dynamic and complex nature of time series data. Models tend to have time-evolving performance across different regions of the input time series.
- Most existing tree-based models like decision trees and random forests operate statically without adapting to changes in time series. Retraining them periodically is computationally expensive. 
- Prior online model selection methods lack interpretability and transparency.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel method called TreeSHAP Model Selection (TSMS) for online selection of tree-based models using TreeSHAP explainability method. 
- Determine regions of competence (RoCs) for each model using a performance-based ranking on a validation set. RoCs indicate regions where a model performs best.
- At test time, select model whose RoC has member most similar to current input pattern. Similarity measured by dynamic time warping distance.
- Adapt RoCs by detecting concept drifts in time series using statistical test. Enrich old RoCs with newly computed ones after drift.

Main Contributions:
- Novel online tree-based model selection using TreeSHAP for time series forecasting
- Adaptive update of RoCs following concept drift detection leading to performance gains
- Explainability support at three levels:
   1) Input time series feature importance 
   2) Reasons for model selection
   3) Explanation of model output prediction
- Extensive evaluation on 1032 real-world time series datasets showing excellent performance compared to baselines
- Open source code and reproducibility of experiments

In summary, the paper proposes an interpretable and adaptive approach for online selection of tree-based models for time series forecasting. The use of TreeSHAP explanations enables gaining insights into the model selection process across different regions of the input time series.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called TreeSHAP Model Selection (TSMS) for online adaptive selection of tree-based models from a pool of candidates for time series forecasting, using TreeSHAP to determine regions of competence that are updated following concept drift detection to support model explainability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper presents a novel method called TreeSHAP Model Selection (TSMS) for online adaptive selection of tree-based models from a pool of candidates for time series forecasting. The key aspects of TSMS are:

1) It determines regions of competence (RoCs) for each candidate model using the TreeSHAP method to explain which parts of the input time series are most relevant for the model's performance. 

2) The RoCs are updated in an informed manner when concept drift is detected in the time series, rather than blindly or periodically. This allows the method to adapt to changes in the data.

3) TSMS supports explainability at multiple levels - explaining which input features are most relevant, explaining why a particular model is selected, and explaining the selected model's predictions.

4) Extensive experiments on 1032 real-world time series datasets demonstrate that TSMS achieves excellent predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques and baselines.

In summary, the main contribution is an explainable and adaptive approach to online selection of tree-based models for time series forecasting that can handle concept drift. The method provides transparency into the model selection process while maintaining strong predictive performance.

The paper introduces a new method called "TreeSHAP Model Selection (TSMS)" for online adaptive selection of tree-based models for time series forecasting. It determines regions of competence (RoCs) for candidate models using the TreeSHAP method to explain predictions and uses these RoCs to select the best model. The RoCs are updated based on detected concept drift. The method provides explainability at multiple levels. Extensive experiments compare TSMS to state-of-the-art techniques and baselines on over 1000 real-world time series datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using TreeSHAP to compute the Regions of Competence (RoCs) for the candidate models. Could you explain in more detail how TreeSHAP is adapted to determine the RoCs in this context? What is the coherent design that is outlined?

2. When creating the RoCs, the paper describes refining the input time series subsequences before adding them to a model's RoC. Could you walk through the thresholding process using the example provided in more detail? What is the motivation behind discarding subseries below a certain length?

3. The paper compares three variants of the proposed method: TSMS, TSMS-St, and TSMS-Per. What are the key differences between these variants and what do the results suggest about the tradeoffs between them? 

4. For the drift adaptation process, the paper utilizes the concept drift detection method from a previous paper. Could you explain this method in more detail and discuss how the parameters were set? What happens after a concept drift is detected?

5. The paper highlights the ability of the method to support explainability on four levels (A1-A4). Could you pick one of those and discuss the visualization provided in more depth? What insights does it provide?

6. The model pool consists solely of tree-based models in this paper. What considerations would there be in extending the approach to hybrid model pools? What would be the challenges?

7. One baseline method compared is KNN-RoC. What is the key difference in how the Regions of Competence are determined between that method and the proposed TSMS approach? What are the limitations of the KNN-RoC method?

8. For the hyperparameter search, values for ω and τ are provided. Could you discuss the impact of these hyperparameters and why the chosen values perform well? Would the optimal values be expected to vary across datasets?

9. The paper focuses on univariate time series forecasting. What considerations would there be in extending the method to multivariate forecasting scenarios? Would the Regions of Competence concept need to be adapted?

10. One intended future direction is to enhance the explainability by reducing the number of RoCs, especially for long time series. Why can the number of RoCs become problematic? What strategies could be used to condense them while retaining the most important information?
