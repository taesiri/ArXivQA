# [TextGenSHAP: Scalable Post-hoc Explanations in Text Generation with Long   Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01279)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new method called TextGenSHAP for generating explanations for large language models (LLMs). LLMs have become very popular for text generation tasks, but their internal reasoning processes are difficult to understand since they behave like black boxes. 

The paper focuses on generating explanations when LLMs are given long input contexts with thousands of tokens, which is very common in applications like question answering. Existing explanation methods like Shapley values struggle to scale to such long inputs and large models. They can take hours to generate token-level explanations.

The paper proposes several optimizations to make Shapley value explanations much faster:

1) A speculative decoding approach that guesses likely output texts to avoid repeatedly decoding the LLM. This saves significant computation time.

2) Using hardware-efficient transformer architectures like Flash Attention that scale better to long inputs. This also aligns with recent work on long-document modeling.

3) An in-place encoding technique that encodes the input only once when explaining a full example, avoiding repeated encoding. This enables faster batch decoding. 

Together these optimizations improve explanation times from hours to minutes at the token level, and to just seconds at the document level.

The method has a 3-tiered hierarchy for explanations: document, sentence, and word levels. It first identifies important documents, then important sentences within those documents, etc. This focuses computations on the most relevant parts of long contexts.

Experiments show the approach scales to inputs with 10,000+ tokens and models like T5-XXL with billions of parameters. The method is applied to question answering tasks requiring reasoning over long texts.

The paper also shows how to use the explanations to improve existing question answering and document retrieval systems, by identifying important passages and words to strengthen predictions and retrieved results.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient way to generate interpretable explanations from LLMs on long contexts, demonstrating performance improvements on downstream tasks. The hierarchical focus and optimizations make the method uniquely scalable compared to prior explanation techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces TextGenSHAP, a novel approach to efficiently generate explanations for large language models handling long input contexts and open-ended text generation tasks, demonstrating improved speed and applications to enhancing question answering performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is developing a method called TextGenSHAP to efficiently generate explanations for large language models (LLMs) when handling long input contexts and open-ended text generation tasks. Specifically:

- TextGenSHAP adapts the Shapley value explanation method to work with hierarchically structured text inputs and autoregressively decoded text outputs from LLMs. This allows generating explanations at different granularity levels (document, sentence, token) and for free-form generated text.

- The method incorporates several optimizations like speculative decoding, block sparsity, and in-place resampling to significantly accelerate the computation of Shapley values for large LLMs, reducing time from hours to minutes or seconds.

- Experiments demonstrate the scalability of TextGenSHAP for long documents (thousands of tokens), large models (billions of parameters), and text generation tasks. The explanations are shown to effectively highlight important words/sentences in long-document QA.

- Use cases are presented for improving document retrieval for QA by reranking based on passage-level explanations, and "distilling" the retrieved documents to improve the reader model's accuracy. This demonstrates the value of real-time explanations for enhancing LLM performance.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a practical method to generate hierarchical, token-level explanations for large language models on long text generation tasks, along with optimizations to make this feasible, and demonstrations of using the explanations to improve system performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts in this paper include:

- Post-hoc explanations - The paper focuses on developing scalable post-hoc explanation methods for interpreting large language models (LLMs), especially for long input contexts.

- Shapley values - The paper adapts Shapley values, a popular explanation method with strong theoretical foundations, to handle long documents and text generation from LLMs. It introduces extensions like Shapley-Shubik values and hierarchical Shapley values.

- Text generation - The paper aims to facilitate explaining open-ended text generation from LLMs, not just discriminative tasks like classification. This is more challenging.

- Long documents - A major focus is scaling up explanations to handle long input contexts with thousands of tokens, as well as long automatically generated texts.

- Hierarchical explanations - The method generates explanations hierarchically, first identifying important passages, then sentences, then words. This allows selective computation.

- Model-specific optimizations - Optimizations like speculative decoding, block sparsity, and in-place resampling are introduced to accelerate Shapley value computations for large transformer models.

- Applications - The scaled-up explanations are shown to be useful for improving document retrieval and question answering through localizing pivotal words/sentences and redistilling context passages.

In summary, the key themes are around adapting explainability methods to scale to modern LLMs, leveraging model structure and hardware optimizations, and demonstrating usefulness on downstream NLP tasks with long contexts.
