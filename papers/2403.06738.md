# [V3D: Video Diffusion Models are Effective 3D Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06738)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Automatic 3D generation has made great progress recently, but existing methods still face challenges in terms of generation speed, quality, and consistency. Optimization-based methods like DreamFusion suffer from slow speed and mode collapse. Multi-view generation methods using image diffusion models can only produce a limited number of views due to memory constraints. Direct mapping methods require 3D supervision data which is scarce. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes V3D, a framework that leverages video diffusion models to generate consistent multi-view images which are then reconstructed into 3D assets. For object-centric generation, V3D fine-tunes a video diffusion model on 360 degree orbit videos to predict dense views from a single image. A tailored 3D Gaussian reconstruction pipeline with space carving initialization and mesh extraction is designed. For scene-level generation, a PixelNeRF encoder is integrated to precisely control camera poses and adapt to variable input views.

Main Contributions:
- Conceptualize multi-view image generation as video generation to exploit video diffusion models' capacity for 3D understanding and temporal consistency.
- Propose modifications like removing elevation conditioning and larger noise schedule to specialize the model for image-to-3D task.
- Design tailored 3D Gaussian reconstruction with space carving initialization and mesh extraction to obtain high quality 3D assets from generated views.
- Integrate PixelNeRF encoder into video diffusion to precisely control camera path and accommodate multiple input views for scene-level novel view synthesis.
- Extensive experiments validate state-of-the-art performance of V3D in terms of quality, consistency and efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes V3D, a framework that leverages video diffusion models fine-tuned on 3D datasets to generate consistent multi-view images which are then reconstructed into high-quality 3D assets, achieving state-of-the-art performance for both object-centric and scene-level 3D generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing V3D, a framework that first employs a video diffusion model to generate consistent multi-view frames, then reconstructs the underlying 3D content. By fine-tuning on 3D datasets, the approach boosts the geometrical consistency of video diffusion models. The framework is generally applicable to both object and scene generation.

2. Designing a reconstruction pipeline tailored for video diffusion outputs to generate high-quality 3D Gaussians or textured meshes. With efficient initialization and refinement, V3D can reconstruct delicate 3D assets within 3 minutes. 

3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in both object-centric and scene-level 3D generation experiments. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction quality and multi-view consistency.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel and effective approach for high-quality 3D generation by extending video diffusion models to multi-view consistent generators and designing tailored pipelines for robust 3D reconstruction and mesh extraction. The approach demonstrates superior performance in generating consistent multi-views and reconstructing intricate 3D models.

The paper proposes an approach called "V3D" which leverages video diffusion models for 3D generation. The key ideas include using video diffusion models to generate consistent multi-view images from a single image, and then reconstructing the 3D asset from those views. This is applied to both object-centric 3D generation as well as scene-level novel view synthesis. Other key aspects are the model conditioning, tailored reconstruction with perceptual losses, and incorporation of geometric priors like PixelNeRF to enhance consistency.
