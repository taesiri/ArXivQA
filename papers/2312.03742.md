# [Clinical Risk Prediction Using Language Models: Benefits And   Considerations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Electronic health records (EHRs) contain valuable patient data that can be used for clinical risk prediction tasks, such as predicting future diagnoses or hospitalizations. However, strict privacy regulations limit access to comprehensive records.
- Previous methods have tried to overcome data limitations by incorporating medical ontologies or using transfer learning, but have limitations in terms of adaptability across datasets/tasks or ability to handle new medical concepts.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate using language models (LMs) to represent structured EHR data (like diagnostic histories) as text, in order to leverage knowledge encoded in LMs.
- Propose two new methods: 
   - Sent-e-Med: Modifies MedBERT architecture by initializing medical code tokens with sentence embeddings of code descriptions from S-BERT, and freezes these embeddings during training.
   - LLaMA2-EHR: Fine-tunes LLaMA2 model on structured EHR data to create an LM tailored for clinical tasks.

Experiments:
- Compare proposed methods to baselines like MedBERT, GRAM, logistic regression and random forests across 3 prediction tasks, 4 datasets and metrics like ROC AUC and PR AUC.

Main Contributions:
- Show LM-based methods outperform others, especially when handling new medical concepts. Text-based LMs are more adaptable across datasets than methods relying on specific medical ontologies.
- LLaMA2-EHR achieves best overall performance by effectively transferring knowledge from language modeling to risk prediction tasks.
- Caution that reliability concerns with LMs persist, highlight need for careful evaluation practices.

In summary, leveraging LMs to represent structured EHR data as text shows promise for improving clinical risk prediction while offering increased adaptability, but evaluation and caution is still necessary when applying these models.
