# [Are More LLM Calls All You Need? Towards Scaling Laws of Compound   Inference Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02419)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies inference networks called \LLMNet{}, which are networks of large language models (LLMs) connected in a directed acyclic graph structure. 
- The goal is to analyze the performance of different \LLMNet{} instances and understand when adding more components (LLMs) improves or worsens the overall performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper formally defines \LLMNet{} and introduces two main types of LLM nodes - generators that produce candidate answers, and selectors that choose between candidate answers.
- Several \LLMNet{} instances are analyzed: a simple 2-layer network, a selector scaling network with chained selectors, and a generator scaling network with chained generators.
- Asymptotic performance bounds are derived based on assumptions about the quality of generators and selectors. Key result is a dichotomy theorem on when adding more components improves or worsens performance.
- An analytical model is presented to explain the non-monotonic U-shaped performance curve as the number of components increases. The insight is that problem difficulty heterogeneity leads to a balancing act between easy and hard problems. Formal scaling laws capturing this are derived.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a formal definition and analysis framework for inference networks built from LLMs. 
- Gives asymptotic performance characterization and concrete examples of when an \LLMNet{} outperforms individual LLMs.
- Offers analytical scaling laws and an optimization view to shed light on the non-intuitive U-shaped performance curve from adding more components.
- Discusses methods to fit the analytical scaling laws on real-world data by estimating problem difficulty or directly fitting the formula.

The summary covers the key problem definition, proposed \LLMNet{} framework, theoretical analysis results, explanation for empirical phenomena, and potential ways to apply the analysis.
