# [Boosting Segment Anything Model Towards Open-Vocabulary Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03628)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Sambor, an end-to-end open-vocabulary object detection framework built upon the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Sambor seamlessly integrates SAM with an object detector in a mutually beneficial way. On one hand, Sambor leverages SAM's powerful generalization capabilities and flexible interactive prompts to boost the detector's performance, including introducing an Open-set Region Proposal Network using SAM proposals. On the other hand, the integration with the detector addresses SAM's lack of semantic understanding, enabling it to recognize arbitrary object categories based on textual concepts. Specifically, the paper proposes a SideFormer module to effectively extract and inject features into SAM. Experiments on COCO and LVIS datasets demonstrate Sambor's superior zero-shot detection abilities over previous state-of-the-art methods. The authors aim for this integration of SAM with open-vocabulary detection to serve as a meaningful step towards endowing SAM with recognition capabilities and advancing the development of open-vocabulary object detection frameworks.
