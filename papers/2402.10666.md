# [Multi-Hop Table Retrieval for Open-Domain Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10666)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for open-domain text-to-SQL retrieval have limitations in handling "schema linking", which refers to aligning entities between the question and table contents. 
- Two main limitations are:
  1) Similar irrelevant entities: Irrelevant tables with entities similar to the question get high ranks, pushing down relevant tables.  
  2) Domain mismatch: Entities in the question can mismatch the domain of relevant tables, increasing the gap.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a multi-hop table retrieval method called MURRE that focuses on alleviating the above two limitations.

- It employs multi-hop retrieval to focus on low-ranked tables in each hop and considers unretrieved entities. This helps handle similar irrelevant entities.

- It rewrites the question to fit unretrieved tables based on retrieved tables using LLMs in each hop. This helps reduce the domain gap with relevant tables.

- It also uses beam search to maintain multiple candidate retrieval lists in each hop.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel multi-hop retrieval approach for open-domain text-to-SQL focused on enhancing schema linking.

- Employs iterative retrieval with question rewriting to handle similar irrelevant entities and domain mismatch limitations.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on SpiderUnion and BirdUnion+ datasets with average 6.38% gain, demonstrating the effectiveness.

- Provides detailed analysis on reasons for improvements, impact of beam size and hops, and performs case studies.
