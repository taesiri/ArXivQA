# [Opti-Acoustic Semantic SLAM with Unknown Objects in Underwater   Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12837)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Underwater semantic SLAM remains challenging due to lack of GPS, attenuation of electromagnetic waves, poor visibility, and unique sensing modalities compared to aerial/ground robots.  
- No existing works perform fusion at object-level for underwater semantic SLAM. Most rely on a priori known objects or simulation environments. 
- No public underwater dataset exists with semantic labels, camera images, sonar, odometry and ground truth trajectories.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel underwater semantic SLAM system that can identify and locate objects without any prior training data or knowledge of objects.
- Performs unsupervised segmentation and feature extraction from camera images. Fuses camera data with sonar to estimate 3D positions. 
- Odometry is obtained by fusing IMU, DVL and pressure sensor data.
- A probabilistic data association method associates observations to landmarks while considering geometric and semantic similarity.
- Factor graph optimization provides jointly optimized trajectory and map estimates.

Main Contributions:
- Semantic SLAM system for underwater environments capable of detecting and locating previously unseen objects while optimizing vehicle trajectory.
- Opti-acoustic fusion method that projects image features and centroids into 3D using sonar ranges.
- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation on real underwater datasets exhibiting various lighting challenges.
- Publicly released dataset with camera images, sonar pings, odometry and ground truth trajectories across 17 semantic classes.

In summary, the paper proposes a complete pipeline for underwater semantic SLAM using opti-acoustic fusion and probabilistic data association that can detect and locate objects without any prior training data. Both trajectory and mapping accuracy are improved compared to baseline methods. The release of the multi-modal underwater dataset will facilitate future research.
