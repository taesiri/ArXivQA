# [StegaNeRF: Embedding Invisible Information within Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01602)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to reliably embed customizable and recoverable information within neural radiance fields (NeRF) for the purposes of ownership identification and copyright protection, while minimizing the impact on the visual quality of rendered images. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) It is possible to embed hidden information such as images, text, or audio within a trained NeRF model by making subtle changes to the network weights, such that the hidden information can later be recovered from novel view renderings.

2) The embedded information can be recovered reliably from novel views rendered by the modified NeRF model using a detector network, while a detector network will not falsely identify hidden information in renderings from an unmodified NeRF model.

3) The visual quality of rendered images can be largely preserved during the process of embedding information, by steering changes to the less important NeRF weights using an adaptive gradient masking strategy.

4) The framework can support multi-scene and multi-modal hidden information, as well as embedding distinct information for different contributing identities in large-scale collaborative NeRF models.

To summarize, the central research question is how to achieve imperceptible and customizable steganography within NeRF renderings, and the key hypotheses focus on reliably recovering the embedded information without impacting the visual rendering quality or inducing false positives. The experiments aim to validate the overall feasibility of the proposed StegaNeRF framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing the novel problem of steganography in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), i.e. hiding customizable and recoverable information in NeRF renderings without impacting the visual quality. This allows embedding ownership or copyright information in NeRF models.

2. Proposing a framework called StegaNeRF to address this problem. It has two key components:

- A detector network that can extract hidden information from StegaNeRF renderings but not from standard NeRF renderings. This prevents false positives.

- An adaptive gradient masking strategy to steer the hidden information towards less important NeRF weights. This balances steganography objectives and rendering quality.

3. Empirically validating StegaNeRF on diverse 3D scenes to show it can reliably embed and recover information with minimal impact on rendering quality.

4. Exploring various usage scenarios like hiding scene-specific or common images in multiple scenes, embedding multiple identities in large-scale scenes, and injecting multi-modal signals.

5. Providing insights on why naive application of 2D steganography fails on NeRF and discussing limitations and future work.

In summary, the paper presents the first exploration of hiding customizable information in NeRF models, with analysis on the new problem and a proposed framework to tackle it. This could have implications for ownership protection as NeRF-based 3D content sharing increases.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes StegaNeRF, a method to embed imperceptible customized information into neural radiance fields to enable ownership identification and copyright protection when sharing and distributing 3D scene representations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on StegaNeRF compares to other research in neural rendering and steganography:

- It introduces a novel problem of hiding information in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), which has not been previously explored. Most prior work focuses on improving the quality or efficiency of NeRF, while steganography brings a new perspective.

- It shows that standard 2D image steganography methods fail when applied to inject information into NeRF models. This reveals key differences between hiding information in 2D images versus 3D scene representations.

- The proposed method directly optimizes NeRF weights to embed customizable and recoverable information through gradient updates. This differs from typical 2D methods that train encoders on images.

- An adaptive masking strategy is introduced to balance rendering quality and steganography. This considers the inherent sparsity and importance of different weights in implicit networks like NeRF.

- Experiments validate the approach on both synthetic and real scenes, with various camera layouts. It also explores useful scenarios like hiding multiple identities and multi-modal signals.

- The work provides both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations to analyze the rendering quality and hidden information recovery. This gives valuable insights into the proposed techniques.

In summary, this paper pioneers the concept of 3D steganography for emerging neural scene representations. It proposes an optimization framework tailored to NeRF's continuous volumetric modeling, complementing prior arts focused on 2D image steganography. The empirical analysis also offers interesting discoveries regarding the problem's uniqueness and challenges compared to hiding information in discrete 2D frames.
