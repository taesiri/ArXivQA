# [StegaNeRF: Embedding Invisible Information within Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01602)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to reliably embed customizable and recoverable information within neural radiance fields (NeRF) for the purposes of ownership identification and copyright protection, while minimizing the impact on the visual quality of rendered images. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) It is possible to embed hidden information such as images, text, or audio within a trained NeRF model by making subtle changes to the network weights, such that the hidden information can later be recovered from novel view renderings.

2) The embedded information can be recovered reliably from novel views rendered by the modified NeRF model using a detector network, while a detector network will not falsely identify hidden information in renderings from an unmodified NeRF model.

3) The visual quality of rendered images can be largely preserved during the process of embedding information, by steering changes to the less important NeRF weights using an adaptive gradient masking strategy.

4) The framework can support multi-scene and multi-modal hidden information, as well as embedding distinct information for different contributing identities in large-scale collaborative NeRF models.

To summarize, the central research question is how to achieve imperceptible and customizable steganography within NeRF renderings, and the key hypotheses focus on reliably recovering the embedded information without impacting the visual rendering quality or inducing false positives. The experiments aim to validate the overall feasibility of the proposed StegaNeRF framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing the novel problem of steganography in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), i.e. hiding customizable and recoverable information in NeRF renderings without impacting the visual quality. This allows embedding ownership or copyright information in NeRF models.

2. Proposing a framework called StegaNeRF to address this problem. It has two key components:

- A detector network that can extract hidden information from StegaNeRF renderings but not from standard NeRF renderings. This prevents false positives.

- An adaptive gradient masking strategy to steer the hidden information towards less important NeRF weights. This balances steganography objectives and rendering quality.

3. Empirically validating StegaNeRF on diverse 3D scenes to show it can reliably embed and recover information with minimal impact on rendering quality.

4. Exploring various usage scenarios like hiding scene-specific or common images in multiple scenes, embedding multiple identities in large-scale scenes, and injecting multi-modal signals.

5. Providing insights on why naive application of 2D steganography fails on NeRF and discussing limitations and future work.

In summary, the paper presents the first exploration of hiding customizable information in NeRF models, with analysis on the new problem and a proposed framework to tackle it. This could have implications for ownership protection as NeRF-based 3D content sharing increases.
