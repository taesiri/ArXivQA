# [StegaNeRF: Embedding Invisible Information within Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01602)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to reliably embed customizable and recoverable information within neural radiance fields (NeRF) for the purposes of ownership identification and copyright protection, while minimizing the impact on the visual quality of rendered images. The key hypotheses are:1) It is possible to embed hidden information such as images, text, or audio within a trained NeRF model by making subtle changes to the network weights, such that the hidden information can later be recovered from novel view renderings.2) The embedded information can be recovered reliably from novel views rendered by the modified NeRF model using a detector network, while a detector network will not falsely identify hidden information in renderings from an unmodified NeRF model.3) The visual quality of rendered images can be largely preserved during the process of embedding information, by steering changes to the less important NeRF weights using an adaptive gradient masking strategy.4) The framework can support multi-scene and multi-modal hidden information, as well as embedding distinct information for different contributing identities in large-scale collaborative NeRF models.To summarize, the central research question is how to achieve imperceptible and customizable steganography within NeRF renderings, and the key hypotheses focus on reliably recovering the embedded information without impacting the visual rendering quality or inducing false positives. The experiments aim to validate the overall feasibility of the proposed StegaNeRF framework.
