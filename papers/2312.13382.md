# [DSPy Assertions: Computational Constraints for Self-Refining Language   Model Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13382)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Chaining language model (LM) calls as composable modules is becoming a popular way to build complex NLP pipelines. However, ensuring LMs adhere to important constraints remains challenging, often requiring extensive "prompt engineering".

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces "LM Assertions", a new programming construct for expressing computational constraints that LMs in a pipeline should satisfy. 
- There are two types of LM Assertions:
  1) Hard "Assertions" that halt the pipeline if violated after retries
  2) Soft "Suggestions" that trigger self-refinement but allow the pipeline to continue if unresolved
- LM Assertions are integrated into the DSPy programming framework. When failed, they enable automatic backtracking to retry and self-refine the LM, injecting information about past failures into the prompt.

Key Contributions:
- Formalizes semantics and implementation details of the proposed LM Assertions.
- Demonstrates LM Assertions can significantly improve compliance to imposed constraints, with gains up to 35.7% on an information retrieval task.  
- Shows constrained self-refinement also improves downstream performance, with gains up to 13.3% in answer accuracy by refining search queries.
- Evaluates on a long-form QA task requiring citations, finding over 16.7% more faithful citations using LM Assertions.

In summary, the paper introduces the LM Assertions programming construct to express computational constraints and rules for language models. When integrated into the DSPy framework, LM Assertions enable new capabilities for automated self-refinement and backtracking to improve reliability, accuracy and task performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces LM Assertions, a new programming construct for expressing computational constraints on language model pipelines to improve reliability, accuracy, and self-refinement capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing LM Assertions, a new programming construct for expressing computational constraints that language models should satisfy within pipelines. The paper integrates LM Assertions into the DSPy programming framework, allowing developers to specify assertions and suggestions that enable automatic self-refinement and backtracking in LM pipelines when constraints are violated. The paper shows through two case studies on complex question answering tasks that adding LM Assertions to DSPy programs can substantially improve compliance with imposed rules/guidelines as well as downstream task performance. Overall, LM Assertions provide a way to make LM pipelines more reliable, predictable, and correct.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

The paper introduces the concept of "LM Assertions", which are constructs for expressing computational constraints on language models within larger program pipelines. It shows how these assertions can enable capabilities like automatic backtracking and self-refinement when constraints are violated. The paper demonstrates and evaluates these ideas by incorporating LM Assertions into the DSPy programming model and testing on complex question answering tasks. Relevant keywords cover the programming techniques like assertions and self-refinement as well as the application areas in AI and NLP like multi-hop QA and fact checking.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed LM Assertions construct differ from conventional assertions in programming languages? What additional capabilities does it offer beyond basic runtime checks?

2. What are the key differences in semantics between the Assert and Suggest primitives for LM Assertions? How do they handle failures differently?

3. What modifications were made to the control flow logic and prompt construction in the DSPy framework to enable backtracking and self-refinement guided by LM Assertions?

4. Can you describe an example scenario where using Suggest would be more suitable than Assert, given their semantics differ in how failures are handled?

5. How can LM Assertions aid few-shot prompt optimization in the DSPy compiler? What techniques could leverage failed assertions during compilation? 

6. What customizations are possible in the error handling logic and retry semantics when using LM Assertions? How can this flexibility be exploited?

7. What hypotheses remain untested regarding the capabilities of LM Assertions presented in this paper? What evaluations would you prioritize for future work?

8. How do the concepts in LM Assertions relate to classical program synthesis techniques? Where do you see parallels to sketching and assertions for synthesizers?

9. For the long-form QA evaluation, why do you think introducing assertions decreased citation recall and precision despite improving faithfulness? What might explain this interaction?

10. What complex integrity constraints for LM programs are not easy to assert today but could become tractable if integrated with LM Assertions? What applications would most benefit from this?
