# [3D Face Reconstruction with the Geometric Guidance of Facial Part   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00311)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Part Re-projection Distance Loss (PRDL) to leverage the precise geometric information in facial part segmentation to guide 3D face reconstruction, thereby improving the alignment of reconstructed facial features with the original image and excelling in reconstructing extreme facial expressions. Specifically, PRDL transforms the target segmentation and predicted 3D face into semantic point sets. It then establishes statistical distance descriptors between these point sets and a set of fixed image grid anchors, optimizing the distribution of points to ensure the reconstructed regions share geometry with the target. Compared to commonly used landmarks and texture losses, PRDL provides denser supervision directly on shape. Compared to renderer-based segmentation losses, PRDL has a simpler and more stable gradient. The method also introduces a new emotional expression dataset with over 200k images to facilitate related research. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in capturing facial details and part alignment. The project will be publicly available to benefit the research community.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a novel Part Re-projection Distance Loss (PRDL) to comprehensively utilize segmentation information to guide 3D face reconstruction. PRDL transforms the target and prediction into semantic point sets and optimizes the distribution of point sets to ensure the reconstructed regions match the target geometry.

2. It introduces a new synthetic face dataset with over 200K images, including closed-eye, open-mouth, and frown expressions to facilitate research on reconstructing extreme expressions. 

3. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method in achieving high-fidelity and better part alignment in 3D face reconstruction, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks like Part IoU and REALY.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of the Part Re-projection Distance Loss (PRDL) that effectively leverages facial part segmentation geometry to guide precise 3D face reconstruction even for extreme expressions. This is supported by a new synthetic dataset and extensive experiments demonstrating improved performance over other methods.
