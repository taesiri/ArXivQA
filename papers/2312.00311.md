# [3D Face Reconstruction with the Geometric Guidance of Facial Part   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00311)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Part Re-projection Distance Loss (PRDL) to leverage the precise geometric information in facial part segmentation to guide 3D face reconstruction, thereby improving the alignment of reconstructed facial features with the original image and excelling in reconstructing extreme facial expressions. Specifically, PRDL transforms the target segmentation and predicted 3D face into semantic point sets. It then establishes statistical distance descriptors between these point sets and a set of fixed image grid anchors, optimizing the distribution of points to ensure the reconstructed regions share geometry with the target. Compared to commonly used landmarks and texture losses, PRDL provides denser supervision directly on shape. Compared to renderer-based segmentation losses, PRDL has a simpler and more stable gradient. The method also introduces a new emotional expression dataset with over 200k images to facilitate related research. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in capturing facial details and part alignment. The project will be publicly available to benefit the research community.
