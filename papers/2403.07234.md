# [It's All About Your Sketch: Democratising Sketch Control in Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07234)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing sketch-to-image diffusion models struggle to generate high-quality images from real freehand amateur sketches, often producing distorted and non-photorealistic outputs. This stems from directly translating sketch contours into the output image domain (spatial conditioning), as well as a dependence on precise text prompts during inference. There is a trade-off between photorealism and sketch fidelity that requires meticulous tuning. The paper reaffirms these limitations through a pilot study on an existing model.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces an abstraction-aware framework to democratize sketch control, allowing amateur sketches to yield precise, photo-realistic images without text prompts during inference. This is achieved via three key components:

1) A sketch adapter that converts the input sketch into an equivalent fine-grained textual embedding to guide the diffusion model's denoising process through cross-attention. This avoids direct spatial conditioning.

2) Adaptive time-step sampling during diffusion based on a measure of the sketch's abstraction, emphasizing semantics for more abstract inputs. 

3) Discriminative guidance incorporated through a pre-trained fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval model to reinforce sketch-photo associations.

Although no text prompts are used during inference, synthetic captions are utilized during training to help learn the sketch adapter given limited sketch-photo data.

Main Contributions:
- Democratizing sketch control in diffusion models, allowing amateur sketches to yield accurate images through an abstraction-aware approach
- Introducing key components like a sketch adapter, adaptive sampling strategy and discriminative guidance to form an effective alternative to spatial conditioning and text prompts
- Extensive experiments validating the method's ability to generate high-fidelity, photo-realistic images guided only by freehand sketches during inference


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework to enable amateur freehand sketches to precisely control diffusion models for generating high-fidelity images, without relying on textual prompts during inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is democratizing sketch control in diffusion models. Specifically, the paper:

1) Introduces an abstraction-aware framework that enables real amateur sketches of varying quality to generate precise images, overcoming limitations of existing spatial conditioning approaches that struggle with abstract sketches. 

2) Leverages discriminative guidance from a pre-trained fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval model to reinforce fine-grained sketch-photo association in the generation process.

3) Uses a sketch adapter to transform the input sketch into an equivalent textual embedding that guides the diffusion model's denoising process via cross-attention, avoiding direct spatial conditioning.

4) Employs an adaptive time-step sampling strategy that takes into account the abstraction level of the input sketch.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a method to truly democratize sketch control, making diffusion models work well even for amateur sketches, and fulfilling the promise of "what you sketch is what you get". The proposed abstraction-aware framework with its various components is crucial to achieving this goal.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Diffusion models - The paper focuses on enhancing sketch control in diffusion models for image generation. This includes models like Stable Diffusion.

- Sketch conditioning - The paper examines methods for conditioning diffusion models on input sketches rather than just text prompts. This includes spatial conditioning approaches and the proposed sketch adapter approach.

- Abstraction-aware - The paper proposes making the image generation process aware of the level of abstraction in the input sketch through adaptive time-step sampling. 

- Fine-grained fidelity - Maintaining fidelity between the input sketch and output image at a detailed, fine-grained level. This is addressed through losses like the discriminative SBIR loss.

- Spatial conditioning - Prior works directly input the sketch spatially into the diffusion model encoders. The paper identifies issues with this approach.

- Textual embedding - The proposed sketch adapter converts the input sketch into a textual embedding that conditions the diffusion model.

- Discriminative guidance - Leveraging an off-the-shelf fine-grained sketch retrieval model to provide discriminative guidance during training.

In summary, key ideas include sketch conditioning techniques for diffusion models, abstraction awareness, fine-grained fidelity, limitations of spatial conditioning approaches, and the proposed adapter model with discriminative guidance.
