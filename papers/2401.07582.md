# [Geo-locating Road Objects using Inverse Haversine Formula with NVIDIA   Driveworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07582)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Geolocation of road objects like traffic signs and road markers is critical for autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. Using multiple sensors for this task increases system complexity. Monocular camera-based solutions often have sub-optimal accuracy due to GPS errors. This paper aims to address these issues by proposing an accurate monocular camera-based geolocation method for road objects.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors leverage the NVIDIA DriveWorks platform for object recognition and distance estimation. The cameras are calibrated rigorously following NVIDIA guidelines. The inverse Haversine formula is then used to geolocate targets given distance from camera, heading angle and vehicle GPS coordinates as inputs. Experiments are conducted with an autonomous car fitted with cameras and accurate GPS (CPOS) in various static and dynamic scenarios.

Key Contributions:

- Propose an inverse Haversine formula based algorithm to achieve accurate geolocation using monocular cameras

- Provide guidelines for successful calibration of cameras using NVIDIA DriveWorks

- Test geolocation accuracy in different scenarios - stationary vehicle, moving vehicle at different speeds, urban driving, highway driving

- Achieve <1m error for stationary vehicle, <4m error for highway driving at 60km/h speed and 15m radius

- Demonstrate applicability of proposed method for various road objects like control markers and traffic signs

The paper thus demonstrates an accurate and robust real-time monocular camera-based geolocation technique suitable for autonomous driving applications by experimentation in realistic driving scenarios. The guidelines shared for NVIDIA DriveWorks calibration are also a valuable contribution.
