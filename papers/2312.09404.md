# [Unbiasing Enhanced Sampling on a High-dimensional Free Energy Surface   with Deep Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09404)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Enhanced sampling methods like temperature-accelerated MD (TAMD) can explore complex biomolecular energy landscapes more efficiently by biasing collective variables (CVs). Using many CVs is needed to fully describe high-dimensional systems.  
- However, unbiasing TAMD simulations with many CVs is challenging due to the difficulty of modeling the intricate, high-dimensional CV probability distribution with traditional density estimation methods.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using score-based diffusion models (SBDM), a deep generative learning technique, to accurately model the high-dimensional CV distribution for unbiasing TAMD.
- SBDM is trained to denoise data diffused to Gaussian noise, enabling precise density estimation even on complex, high-dimensional landscapes.
- Modifications allow SBDM to handle non-Euclidean CVs like torsion angles.

Key Results:
- SBDM unbiasing (SBDM-TAMD) accurately constructs the 2D and 5D free energy surfaces of alanine dipeptide and glutamine dipeptide from TAMD, closely matching metadynamics benchmarks. 
- For met-enkephalin with 10D TAMD on backbone torsions, SBDM-TAMD accurately predicts stable states when projecting onto intuitive features like end-to-end distance, outperforming KDE, GMM and normalizing flows.

Main Contributions:
- First application of SBDM for unbiasing enhanced sampling simulations, enabling accurate recovery of equilibrium properties from biased TAMD exploring high-dimensional collective variable space.
- Demonstration of SBDM's exceptional accuracy and adaptability for modeling complex, high-dimensional molecular CV distributions compared to traditional density estimation techniques.
- Establishes feasibility of using many CVs with SBDM-unbiased TAMD to efficiently sample complex biomolecular landscapes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an unbiasing method for enhanced sampling simulations based on the score-based diffusion model, a deep generative learning technique, which demonstrates superior performance in modeling high-dimensional collective variable distributions compared to traditional density estimation methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new unbiasing method for enhanced sampling simulations based on the score-based diffusion model (SBDM). Specifically:

1) The paper points out the challenges in unbiasing methods like temperature accelerated molecular dynamics (TAMD) when using many collective variables (CVs), due to the difficulty in accurately modeling the high-dimensional CV probability distribution. 

2) It then proposes using SBDM, a deep generative learning method, for highly accurate density estimation of the CV distribution needed for unbiasing TAMD with many CVs.

3) The SBDM unbiasing method is adapted to work with CVs defined on non-Euclidean spaces like torsion angles.

4) Through experiments on three systems with 2, 5, and 10 CVs, the SBDM unbiasing method demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional unbiasing techniques, especially for higher dimensional CVs.

In summary, the key contribution is developing an SBDM-based unbiasing procedure that enables accurate unbiasing of enhanced sampling simulations using a large number of collective variables, which was previously very challenging.
