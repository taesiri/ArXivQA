# [Unbiasing Enhanced Sampling on a High-dimensional Free Energy Surface   with Deep Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09404)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Enhanced sampling methods like temperature-accelerated MD (TAMD) can explore complex biomolecular energy landscapes more efficiently by biasing collective variables (CVs). Using many CVs is needed to fully describe high-dimensional systems.  
- However, unbiasing TAMD simulations with many CVs is challenging due to the difficulty of modeling the intricate, high-dimensional CV probability distribution with traditional density estimation methods.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using score-based diffusion models (SBDM), a deep generative learning technique, to accurately model the high-dimensional CV distribution for unbiasing TAMD.
- SBDM is trained to denoise data diffused to Gaussian noise, enabling precise density estimation even on complex, high-dimensional landscapes.
- Modifications allow SBDM to handle non-Euclidean CVs like torsion angles.

Key Results:
- SBDM unbiasing (SBDM-TAMD) accurately constructs the 2D and 5D free energy surfaces of alanine dipeptide and glutamine dipeptide from TAMD, closely matching metadynamics benchmarks. 
- For met-enkephalin with 10D TAMD on backbone torsions, SBDM-TAMD accurately predicts stable states when projecting onto intuitive features like end-to-end distance, outperforming KDE, GMM and normalizing flows.

Main Contributions:
- First application of SBDM for unbiasing enhanced sampling simulations, enabling accurate recovery of equilibrium properties from biased TAMD exploring high-dimensional collective variable space.
- Demonstration of SBDM's exceptional accuracy and adaptability for modeling complex, high-dimensional molecular CV distributions compared to traditional density estimation techniques.
- Establishes feasibility of using many CVs with SBDM-unbiased TAMD to efficiently sample complex biomolecular landscapes.
