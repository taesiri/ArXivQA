# [TPA3D: Triplane Attention for Fast Text-to-3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02647)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes TPA3D, a GAN-based framework for fast text-guided 3D object generation. Without relying on text-3D pairs for supervision, TPA3D leverages a pre-trained image captioning model to produce detailed pseudo captions from only 3D shapes and rendered images. To generate fine-grained 3D textured meshes matching input texts, TPA3D extracts sentence and word-level features and performs word-level triplane refinement via the introduced TriPlane Attention (TPA) module. Specifically, TPA conducts plane-wise self-attention and cross-plane attention to enforce intra-plane consistency and inter-plane connectivity. Furthermore, cross-word attention is applied in TPA to incorporate detailed word-level information into triplane features. Experiments demonstrate TPA3D's ability to produce high-quality 3D textured meshes precisely aligned with fine-grained text prompts with fast inference time. The proposed TPA module is shown to be vital to TPA3D's performance. Overall, TPA3D advances the state-of-the-art in unsupervised text-to-3D generation regarding quality, detail alignment, and efficiency.
