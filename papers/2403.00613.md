# [Complete and Near-Optimal Robotic Crack Coverage and Filling in Civil   Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00613)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenging problem of simultaneous sensor-based inspection and footprint coverage (SIFC) for applications like crack detection and repair in infrastructure. The key challenge lies in simultaneously achieving two complete coverage tasks using a single robotic platform - completely scanning the workspace to detect unknown targets like cracks using onboard sensors, and physically covering all detected targets using the robot's footprint to conduct repairs. The onboard sensor range and robot's physical footprint area differ in size and shape, further complicating matters. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper develops a systematic motion planning and control framework to address the SIFC problem. It first presents an algorithm called Graph-based Coverage (GCC) to cover a known target map using the robot's footprint. Building on this, the paper introduces the Sensor-based Complete Coverage (SCC) algorithm that assumes known targets and achieves complete workspace scanning and footprint coverage of targets. Finally, the key contribution is an online extension called the Online Sensor-based Complete Coverage (oSCC) algorithm that handles unknown targets.  

The oSCC algorithm allows the robot to scan and incrementally construct the target map online while achieving near-optimal coverage. It is built on cellular decomposition methods that decompose the free space into cells. As the robot navigates, it continuously scans for targets, updating a target graph and cell graph representing detected targets and free space respectively. The planning happens in iterations - in each iteration, an Euler tour is constructed on the graphs and used to guide coverage, avoiding redundancy. Covered areas are removed and graphs updated for the next iteration. This enables complete scanning and near-optimal route coverage. The robot motion is coordinated with a nozzle actuation mechanism to repair detected cracks.

Main Contributions:
1) A systematic algorithmic approach for robotic SIFC problems involving simultaneous coverage goals 
2) Guaranteed complete scanning coverage and near-optimal route coverage for unknown target environments
3) An online, incremental planning approach that minimizes robot travel distance
4) Coordinated planning and control between robot motion and onboard actuator to efficiently execute repairs 

The solution is demonstrated for crack detection and autonomous filling in infrastructure. Extensive experiments validate the efficiency and near-optimality. The framework is valuable for other robotic applications needing simultaneous coverage goals.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a motion planning and control algorithm for a robot to simultaneously achieve complete sensing coverage to detect unknown cracks and complete footprint coverage to fill the detected cracks in infrastructure surfaces, while minimizing the total traveling distance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a motion planning and control design for simultaneous robotic sensor-based inspection and footprint coverage, with applications to crack detection and repair in civil infrastructure. The main contribution is the development of a new, complete, and empirically near-optimal motion planning and control approach for the simultaneous sensor-based inspection and footprint coverage (SIFC) problem in robotic crack mapping and filling applications. Specifically, the paper proposes:

1) A novel online sensor-based complete coverage (${\tt oSCC}$) algorithm that guarantees complete sensing coverage of the free space in the entire workspace while simultaneously achieving complete robotic footprint coverage of the detected targets. This algorithm aims to minimize the total distance traveled by the robot and achieves a near-optimal path in polynomial time. 

2) A coordinated nozzle motion control design with the planned robot trajectory to efficiently fill all cracks within the robot's footprint. This addresses the coupling between the sensor-based inspection and the onboard footprint coverage actuation in the SIFC problem formulation.

3) Extensive experiments using a robotic crack-filling platform to demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed planning and control algorithms. Comparisons with other benchmark algorithms are also discussed.

In summary, the key contribution lies in the development of a computationally efficient, complete, and near-optimal solution to the challenging SIFC problem for robotic crack mapping and filling. The planning and control framework offers valuable insights and tools for various robotic applications requiring simultaneous sensing and actuation coverage.
