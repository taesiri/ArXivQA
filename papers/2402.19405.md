# [Navigating Hallucinations for Reasoning of Unintentional Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19405)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Focuses on a novel task of understanding unintentional human activities in videos and formalizes it as a reasoning problem in zero-shot scenarios. 
- Given a video of an unintentional activity, the goal is to determine why the activity transitioned from being intentional to unintentional.
- Studies capabilities of current state-of-the-art large multimodal models on this reasoning task and finds they suffer from hallucinations.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduces a new prompting technique called "Dream of Thoughts" (DoT) which allows models to navigate through their own hallucinated thoughts to achieve better reasoning. 
- DoT uses a multi-step approach:
   1) Generate multiple possible video descriptions
   2) Derive multiple possible goals for the intentional activity
   3) Generate multiple hypotheses for why the activity failed
- At each step, frame as a multiple choice question for the model to select the best option based on context

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes a new task of reasoning about unintentional activities in videos
- Proposes a new DoT prompting approach to navigate hallucinations 
- Introduces 3 new evaluation metrics to quantify reasoning capability: rm_MCQ, rm_LLM, rm_FIB
- Experiments on OOPs and UCF-Crimes datasets show DoT outperforms standard prompting and chain of thoughts prompting
- Provides analysis into the role of goal descriptions, number of options, and sampling strategies

In summary, the paper identifies limitations of current models in reasoning about unintentional activities and introduces a novel prompting approach called DoT that shows improved performance through navigating model hallucinations.
