# [iComMa: Inverting 3D Gaussians Splatting for Camera Pose Estimation via   Comparing and Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09031)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes iComMa, a novel 6D pose estimation method that inverts 3D Gaussian splatting and jointly optimizes a comparing loss and a matching loss for camera pose estimation. iComMa addresses the limitations of prior work like iNeRF that struggle with challenging initialization conditions by incorporating a differentiable end-to-end matching loss based on feature correspondence. This makes the method robust to large initial pose deviations. At the same time, a render-and-compare loss ensures accuracy in the final optimization stages. Experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that iComMa outperforms iNeRF and matching-based methods by achieving higher precision and robustness to initialization, especially in complex scenarios with large rotations. The method strikes an effective balance between accuracy and robustness by unifying the strengths of rendering-based comparison and traditional matching techniques in a joint optimization framework. The results validate iComMa's superiority for sophisticated 6D pose estimation tasks.
