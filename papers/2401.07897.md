# [The Pitfalls of Defining Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07897)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper examines issues with evaluating the veracity (truthfulness) of automatically generated text. It focuses on a common NLG task called data-to-text generation, where structured data is converted into a textual description. 

The paper reviews three existing analyses that aim to categorize different types of veracity issues like hallucination (generating false information) and omission (leaving out true information). It finds these analyses are inconsistent, conflate issues, and fail to make some important logical distinctions.

The paper then synthesizes these analyses using concepts from formal logic to systematically characterize different logical relationships between the input data and output text. This allows precisely distinguishing cases where the text contradicts or is independent from the input.

The paper argues current analyses still have limitations - they do not consider pragmatic factors like implicature and metaphor when judging truthfulness. Also, the amount of information added/omitted is not considered. The paper suggests integrating ideas from belief-desire-intention logics to handle pragmatic issues.

The paper then discusses how analyzing veracity gets more complex for large language models that generate free-form text. Faithfulness to an "input" is hard to define here. Truthfulness may need to be judged against world knowledge instead. Even that can be subjective for texts like political essays. Still, logic may help categorize issues like lying by omission.

In conclusion, the paper argues natural language processing should engage more with logicians on problems of truth and evidence in text generation. Issues of ambiguity and pragmatics also need more attention when evaluating veracity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper examines current definitions of hallucination and omission in natural language generation, proposes a logic-based synthesis, notes remaining limitations, and discusses implications for evaluating the veracity of texts from large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a logic-based synthesis of existing classifications of hallucination and omission in data-to-text natural language generation. Specifically, the paper:

- Reviews three existing analyses of veracity issues like hallucination and omission in data-to-text NLG systems. It points out limitations of each analysis, including conflating distinct error types and disagreeing with each other on classifications. 

- Proposes a synthesis based on logical consequence relations that can exist between the structured input and textual output of an NLG system. This allows systematically distinguishing cases where the output is too weak vs too strong compared to the input.

- Discusses limitations of semantic inference-based analyses when dealing with pragmatic phenomena like implicature. It also points out topic-independence as an intrinsic limitation.

- Examines issues in defining veracity for large language models, arguing the analysis depends hugely on the end task. For open-ended applications like essay writing, veracity may need to consider objective truth and informativeness instead of just faithfulness to an input.

So in summary, the key contribution is using logic to systematically analyze different types of hallucination/omission in NLG, while also examining limitations and implications for LLMs. This provides a clearer perspective on evaluating and improving the veracity of generated text.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Hallucination - The paper examines different classifications and definitions of hallucination (intrinsic, extrinsic, etc.) in natural language generation systems.

- Omission - Along with hallucination, the paper looks at the concept of omission, where information from the input is left out of the generated text.

- Veracity - Assessing the truthfulness, accuracy and faithfulness of automatically generated text is a central theme. 

- Data-to-text generation - Much of the analysis focuses specifically on data-to-text NLG systems.

- Logical analysis - The paper proposes using logic and notions like entailment to formally characterize different types of hallucination.

- Large language models (LLMs) - The paper also discusses challenges in evaluating veracity for large pre-trained language models.

- Pragmatic reasoning - The need to go beyond just logical entailment and consider pragmatic inferences in assessing faithfulness.

So in summary, key terms revolve around analyzing hallucination and veracity in NLG, using logical tools, with a focus on data-to-text generation and implications for large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a logic-based synthesis of existing classifications of hallucination and omission. What are the key limitations of the existing classifications that this synthesis aims to address? 

2. The synthesis relies on using logical consequence relations between input and output. What pragmatic reasoning does the author argue should also be applied when assessing the veracity of a generated text?

3. The synthesis results in categories like "output is too weak" and "output is too strong." What further distinctions does the author make within these categories to capture subtleties like tautologous or contradictory outputs? 

4. The author acknowledges some intrinsic limitations of the proposed logical analysis. What example does he give of information the analysis cannot capture about the relationship between input and output?

5. How does the author argue the applicability of the analysis changes for different NLG tasks like summarization or caption generation? What specific requirements need adjustment?

6. When discussing the veracity of large language models, the author argues the nature of the task matters more than the architecture. What distinction does he draw between classical NLG tasks and more open-ended applications of LLMs?

7. For open-ended LLM applications, the author suggests logical analyses may still be useful in limited ways. What specific types of erroneous or misleading information does he discuss that could be formally captured? 

8. The author proposes borrowing from logics of belief, desire and intention to further analyze notions like misleading and withholding information. How might this perspective complement the more semantic analysis presented earlier?

9. What challenges does the author foresee if trying to apply a BDI-style analysis to annotator judgments about whether an LLM-generated text misleads or gives half-truths? 

10. In the conclusion, what two "unfashionable" things does the author argue the NLP community should do more of to better understand NLG evaluation?
