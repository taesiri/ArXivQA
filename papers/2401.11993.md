# [Expert-Driven Monitoring of Operational ML Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11993)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models in production can experience concept drift - changes in the underlying data distribution that negatively impact model performance. However, concept drift is difficult to detect without labeled data. 
- Even when concept drift is detected, understanding its characteristics (severity, duration etc.) is challenging but crucial for selecting an appropriate response.  
- Currently, human domain experts play a vital role in monitoring models and responding to issues through on-call rotations. However, knowledge is dispersed across teams and inaccessible, making this unreliable.

Proposed Solution - Expert Monitoring:
- Consolidate domain expertise into scenarios describing events that can induce concept drift, using knowledge elicitation and retrospective analysis. Scenarios include quantitative estimates of impacted features.  
- At runtime, identify potential scenarios using Bayesian model comparison between expert models and current observations.
- Present scenario likelihoods to engineers to guide response selection. Optionally automate responses.

Main Contributions:
- A method to consolidate dispersed domain expertise related to concept drift into reusable, accessible scenarios.
- An approach to leverage this expertise by identifying likely concept drift-inducing scenarios at runtime using Bayesian techniques. 
- Enabling human oversight and automated adaptability during monitoring.
- Addressing limitations of reliance on domain expertise and lack of knowledge accessibility.

In summary, the paper proposes an Expert Monitoring approach to integrate domain expertise into concept drift detection and response processes. It facilitates human monitoring while making knowledge accessible for oversight and automation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach called Expert Monitoring that consolidates domain expertise into standardized scenarios to help machine learning engineers detect and mitigate concept drift in machine learning models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing an approach called "Expert Monitoring" to address the challenges of detecting and mitigating concept drift in machine learning models deployed in practice. Specifically:

- The paper highlights the inherent limitations of fully automated concept drift detection and mitigation, and argues for the necessity of integrating human domain expertise into the monitoring process.

- The Expert Monitoring approach consolidates relevant domain expertise into standardized "scenarios" that describe events that can induce concept drift. This knowledge is elicited from experts across the organization. 

- At runtime, upon detecting feature drift, the approach identifies the most likely scenario using Bayesian model comparison against the specified scenario models.

- Identifying the scenario provides insights to ML engineers on the potential causes of drift and guides response selection. The approach also supports automated triggering of pre-defined responses.

In summary, the main contribution is outlining an approach to make domain expertise on concept drift-inducing events accessible and actionable for monitoring personnel, enabling detectability and informed responses to address concept drift in operational ML models.

The paper proposes an approach called "Expert Monitoring" to leverage domain expertise to enhance the detection and mitigation of concept drift in machine learning models. It discusses the challenges of detecting concept drift in practice, especially in the absence of labeled data. The paper then explains how incorporating domain expertise from experts through a standardized "scenario specification" format and using Bayesian model comparison can help identify potential causes of feature drift and concept drift. Overall, it focuses on integrating human domain expertise into model monitoring to address concept drift in operational machine learning systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes eliciting domain expertise from various experts in the organization and compiling it into standardized scenario specifications. What are some challenges or limitations you foresee with getting comprehensive and accurate expertise from different experts? How would you address eliciting tacit or implicit knowledge?

2. The Bayesian models allow experts to quantify uncertainties in their estimates of feature distributions under different scenarios. However, how can the level of expertise of each expert be accounted for in interpreting and using these subjective probability distributions? 

3. The proposed approach relies on detecting feature drift as a proxy for potential concept drift. However, the example in Figure 1 illustrates that feature drift does not always imply concept drift. How can the reliability of using feature drift to trigger scenario identification be improved?

4. Retrospective analysis of historical model performance data is used to identify problematic recurring events. However, what if concept drift is caused by unprecedented events? How can the approach identify novel drift-inducing scenarios?  

5. The accuracy of scenario identification depends directly on the accuracy and uncertainty specified in expert estimates (Figure 4). If estimates have high error rates, how can the approach be adapted to still reliably detect the correct scenarios?

6. The proposed method facilitates automated concept drift mitigation actions if scenarios meet a specified threshold. However, what safeguards can be incorporated to ensure automation does not have unintended negative consequences? 

7. The approach aims to consolidate domain expertise and make it accessible to on-call ML engineers. However, how easily can personnel outside the development process correctly interpret this information to select appropriate responses?

8. Recurrent concept drift due to seasonal effects is mentioned as a use case for the approach. How specifically would the method represent and identify cyclical or temporal dynamics of recurring drift-inducing events?

9. The scenario specifications include characteristics like concept drift severity, speed, duration etc. However, how accurately can experts estimate these properties and how precisely can they guide response selection?

10. The method has flexibility to use different distribution types and relative estimates. What other extensions or enhancements of the Bayesian model representation would further improve detection accuracy or better capture domain knowledge?
