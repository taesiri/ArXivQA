# [Learning Intra-view and Cross-view Geometric Knowledge for Stereo   Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19270)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Learning Intra-view and Cross-view Geometric Knowledge for Stereo Matching":

Problem:
- Stereo matching is the task of estimating a disparity map from a pair of rectified images. It is important for many computer vision tasks. 
- Prior works have shown that incorporating geometric knowledge improves stereo matching performance. However, they mainly focus on intra-view geometric knowledge from single images, lacking crucial cross-view factors like occlusion and matching uniqueness.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Intra-view and Cross-view Geometric knowledge learning Network (ICGNet) to assimilate both intra-view and cross-view geometric knowledge for stereo matching.
- It leverages interest points to provide intra-view geometric understanding of images. It also uses correspondences between interest points to capture cross-view geometric relationships like occlusion.
- Two losses are introduced: 
   1) Intra-view loss to align interest points from backbone features with a pre-trained interest point detector
   2) Cross-view loss to align predicted matches between backbone features with matches from a pre-trained matcher and ground truth disparities
- This allows ICGNet to incorporate both intra-view and cross-view geometric knowledge to improve stereo matching.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel framework ICGNet to incorporate both intra-view and cross-view geometric knowledge for stereo matching using interest points and their correspondences
- Introduces intra-view and cross-view losses to align stereo backbone features with pre-trained interest point models 
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on SceneFlow dataset and top-ranked on KITTI 2015 leaderboard
- Improves cross-domain generalization performance on KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015 and Middlebury datasets

In summary, the key idea is to leverage interest points and matches from pre-trained local feature models to provide intra-view and cross-view geometric knowledge to guide stereo matching network training via proposed losses. This gives better accuracy and generalization.
