# [TEDDY: Trimming Edges with Degree-based Discrimination strategY](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01261)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become popular for modeling graph data, but suffer from high computational cost and overfitting on large graphs. 
- The lottery ticket hypothesis has been extended to GNNs - suggesting sparse subgraphs ("graph lottery tickets") can match performance of dense graphs.
- But most prior work on finding graph lottery tickets is iterative and inefficient, not fully utilizing graph structure. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes TEDDY, a framework to efficiently find graph lottery tickets in one shot by pruning both edges and weights.
- TEDDY carefully prunes edges based on degree information to preserve important pathways, motivated by empirical and theoretical evidence on the importance of low-degree edges. 
- It uses a novel edge-centric message passing to assign scores for edge pruning.
- For weight pruning, TEDDY uses efficient projected gradient descent onto the $\ell_0$ ball.
- Overall, TEDDY facilitates joint discovery of sparse graph and model efficiently in one training run.

Main Contributions:
- Careful graph pruning methodology utilizing degree information and edge-centric message passing.
- Efficient one-shot framework to induce sparsity in both graph structure and model parameters.
- State-of-the-art graph lottery ticket discovery on multiple datasets and architectures.
- Significantly lower computational cost than iterative pruning baselines.
- Empirical and theoretical motivation on the importance of low-degree edges in graph neural networks.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in efficiently finding sparse graph lottery tickets by a carefully designed graph pruning approach and weight pruning via projected gradient descent. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces TEDDY, a novel one-shot graph and parameter sparsification framework for graph neural networks that selectively prunes edges by considering multi-level degree information to preserve vital pathways, enabling efficient identification of sparse graph lottery tickets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces TEDDY, a new framework for efficient one-shot graph and parameter sparsification to find sparse graph lottery tickets (GLTs) with comparable performance to dense networks. The key contributions are:

1) TEDDY selectively prunes graph edges using a novel scoring method that considers multi-level degree information to preserve important pathways for information flow. It observes that low-degree edges are crucial for performance and spectral stability.

2) TEDDY encourages parameter sparsity via projected gradient descent on the l0 ball within a single training process, eliminating the need for costly iterative pruning. 

3) Extensive experiments show TEDDY finds much sparser GLTs than prior arts with superior performance, even with one-shot edge pruning without using node features. It also demonstrates significant efficiency gains over iterative methods.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient one-shot framework for joint graph and parameter sparsification that leverages graph structural properties to find high-quality sparse GLTs. The key innovation is the edge scoring technique and integration of degree-based graph sparsification with l0 projected gradient descent for parameters.

The paper introduces a new method called TEDDY for efficiently finding sparse graph lottery tickets in GNNs. The key ideas involve selectively pruning edges based on degree information to preserve important pathways, using projected gradient descent for parameter sparsity, and doing this in a one-shot manner instead of iteratively. The method outperforms prior techniques for graph compression and demonstrates the importance of low-degree edges and incorporating structural information. Key terms like graph sparsification, lottery tickets, projected gradient descent, degree information, and one-shot pruning relate to the main technical contributions and focus.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel edge pruning method called TEDDY that incorporates structural information from the graph. How exactly does TEDDY leverage properties like edge degree when deciding which edges to prune? What is the intuition behind using these structural properties?

2. The paper claims TEDDY is able to identify graph lottery tickets (GLTs) in one shot. What specifically allows TEDDY to find GLTs without the need for iterative pruning over multiple rounds? 

3. The paper highlights the importance of low-degree edges through empirical analysis and spectral graph theory concepts. Can you expand more on why preserving low-degree edges leads to better performance when pruning graphs?

4. TEDDY employs a distillation loss by matching logits from the pruned model to the original dense model. What is the motivation behind using knowledge distillation here? How does it help in finding better GLTs?

5. The parameter sparsification in TEDDY uses projected gradient descent on the $\ell_0$ ball. Can you explain this technique and why it is more efficient than conventional iterative pruning approaches? 

6. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets and GNN architectures. What aspects of TEDDY's design allow it to generalize so effectively across different graph learning tasks?

7. Could the ideas in TEDDY, like leveraging edge degree or one-shot pruning, be applicable in model compression techniques beyond lottery ticket hypothesis? Why or why not?

8. The experiments show impressive results, but are there any potential limitations or weaknesses of TEDDY that future work could aim to address? 

9. The paper claims TEDDY is efficient since everything is done in one training round. But how does the actual runtime of TEDDY compare to other GLT methods? Are there any efficiency tradeoffs?

10. The paper focuses on edge pruning while keeping all nodes. How suitable do you think TEDDY would be for methods that reduce nodes like graph clustering or coarsening? Why?
