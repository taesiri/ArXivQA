# [Augmenting Autotelic Agents with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12487)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we augment artificial agents with the ability to represent, generate, and learn diverse, abstract, and human-relevant goals in an open-ended way, without relying on hand-coded goal representations or reward functions?

In particular, the paper proposes a method to address this question by using a pretrained language model as a model of human cultural transmission. The language model is used to implement three key components of an autotelic agent architecture:

1) A relabeler that describes goals achieved in the agent's trajectories.

2) A goal generator that suggests new high-level goals and decomposes them into subgoals. 

3) Reward functions for the generated goals.

By leveraging the language model as a proxy for human cultural transmission and common sense knowledge, the goal is to enable the agent to autonomously discover and pursue more complex, creative, and human-relevant goals, in a way that moves beyond pre-defined goal spaces. The central hypothesis seems to be that augmenting autotelic agents in this way will allow for more open-ended skill discovery and goal-directed learning.

So in summary, the key research question is how to use language models to provide autotelic agents with the ability to generate and learn diverse, meaningful goals in an open-ended fashion, without hand-coded goal representations. The paper proposes and evaluates an approach using LMs as a model of cultural transmission to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a Language Model Augmented Autotelic Agent (LMA3) that leverages a pretrained language model to support the representation, generation and learning of diverse, abstract, human-relevant goals in a task-agnostic way. 

Specifically, the key ideas presented are:

- Using a language model as a model of human cultural transmission to provide common sense knowledge and capture aspects of human interests and biases. 

- The language model supports three main components of the autotelic architecture:

   1) A relabeler that describes goals achieved in agent trajectories

   2) A goal generator that suggests new high-level goals and decomposes them into known subgoals

   3) Reward functions for the generated goals

- Without relying on any hand-coded goal representations or reward functions, this approach allows the agent to autonomously discover and learn a large diversity of skills in a text-based environment.

- The diversity and abstraction of learned goals is enhanced through careful prompting of the language model, addition of human advice examples, and using the model for recursive goal composition.

- Experiments demonstrate the agent can learn many human-relevant skills without any predefined goal representations, as well as exhibit more diverse and creative discovered goals compared to ablations.

In summary, the key contribution is using language models to bring in outside knowledge and augment an autotelic agent, enabling it to generate and learn more abstract, diverse and human-relevant goals in an open-ended way. This provides a path towards more capable open-ended learning agents.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a Language Model Augmented Autotelic Agent (LMA3) that leverages a pretrained language model to support the representation, generation and learning of diverse, abstract, human-relevant goals in a task-agnostic text-based environment without relying on hand-coded goal representations or reward functions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a brief analysis of how this paper on Language Model Augmented Autotelic Agents (LMA3) compares to other related work:

- Focus on goal generation: The key focus of this work is on autonomous goal generation and representation learning using language models. Most prior work on multi-goal RL or intrinsic motivation focuses more on the skill learning aspect rather than goal imagination. LMA3 uniquely relies on LMs to generate diverse, human-relevant goals.

- Language-based environments: By using text-based environments, LMA3 avoids the challenges of learning from raw sensors and low-level actions. This allows testing goal imagination in partially observable, interactive worlds requiring human-like common sense. Most prior work focuses on physical RL environments.

- No predefined goals/rewards: A key distinction is that LMA3 does not assume any predefined goal space or reward functions. The goals and rewards are generated fully autonomously using the LM. This is unlike most goal-conditioned RL methods that hand-design the goals/rewards.

- Hindsight learning via relabeling: LMA3 leverages trajectory relabeling by the LM to perform hindsight learning on any goals serendipitously achieved. This provides more learning signal compared to regular RL. Prior work has used engineered relabeling functions.

- Cultural transmission via LM: The use of LMs as a proxy for cultural transmission of human goals/knowledge is novel. LMs provide common sense and capture some human biases/interests. Most prior autotelic agents learn in isolation without any "cultural" influence.

- Minimal human input: Beyond the pretrained LM, LMA3 requires very minimal human input (just 11 examples for prompting). It does not need any hand-designed goals, reward shaping, or curricula. This makes it more autonomous compared to many intrinsically motivated RL methods.

In summary, LMA3 innovates over prior work by focusing on autonomous goal generation, using LMs to provide cultural knowledge and goals, and not relying on any hand-engineered goal/reward representations. The results demonstrate that this approach enables agents to learn diverse and human-relevant skills in an open-ended fashion.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Apply the LMA3 approach in more complex, open-ended environments beyond simple text-based games. The authors suggest using more open worlds like Minecraft, coupled with image/video captioning systems to allow grounding in richer sensory environments.

- Improve the skill learning algorithm to better generalize and scale to larger goal spaces. The authors mention using deep RL with transformer architectures, finetuning large language models with online experience, or advanced model-based RL algorithms.

- Co-adapt the goal generator and policy to drive continual open-ended learning. The authors suggest giving the agent metrics to track its own performance and focus the relabeller on harder goals over time.

- Reduce the computational cost of using large LMs, through distillation into smaller environment-specific models or waiting for cheaper access to models like GPT-4.

- Develop better evaluation metrics for open-ended learning, like measuring goal diversity linguistically, human studies of skill complexity/creativity, or standardized human-agent interaction protocols.

- Combine LMA3 with unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to also learn low-level sensorimotor skills hard to describe linguistically. 

- Implement more aspects of human cultural transmission beyond the LM, like learning from human advice/preferences or contributing goals back to humans.

So in summary, the main suggestions are developing more open-ended environments, improving the learning algorithms, reducing computational costs, better evaluation, combining learned skills across modalities, and expanding the cultural transmission aspects. The authors see LMA3 as a proof-of-concept to be expanded in these directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Language Model Augmented Autotelic Agents (LMA3), which are AI agents that leverage large language models to support open-ended skill learning. LMA3 agents operate in text-based environments and use a language model in three ways: 1) a relabeler that describes goals achieved in agent trajectories, 2) a goal generator that decomposes high-level goals into known subgoals, and 3) a reward function to measure goal achievement. Without any predefined goal representations or rewards, LMA3 agents learn to master a diverse range of skills in a cooking environment. The diversity and complexity of learned skills is increased through careful prompting of the language model and a small amount of human-provided advice. The authors argue that language models can provide a form of cultural transmission to augment the capabilities of autotelic agents. While the current prototype is limited to simple environments and skills, the approach demonstrates the promise of leveraging language models to bootstrap open-ended learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a language model augmented autotelic agent (LMA3) that leverages a pretrained language model to support the representation, generation and learning of diverse, abstract, human-relevant goals. Autotelic agents are driven to learn to represent, generate, pursue and master their own goals, supporting open-ended skill learning. However, learning in isolation limits the types of goals agents can represent. LMA3 uses the language model as a model of human cultural transmission to augment the agent's goal representations. Specifically, the language model implements three components: 1) a relabeler that describes goals achieved in agent trajectories, 2) a goal generator that suggests new high-level goals and subgoal decompositions, and 3) reward functions to measure goal completion. Without any hand-coded goal representations or rewards, LMA3 agents learn to master a diversity of skills in a text-based CookingWorld environment. Experiments show LMA3 discovers around 9000 distinct goals, including human-relevant ones. Ablations and analysis illustrate the benefits of careful prompting, human advice, and chaining subgoals. The diversity and abstraction of discovered goals is impacted by these factors.

In summary, this paper proposes an autotelic reinforcement learning agent augmented with a language model to support the generation of diverse, human-relevant goals without any predefined goal representations. Experiments in a text-based environment show the approach can discover thousands of goals and learn corresponding skills. The language model provides a form of cultural transmission to allow agents to break out of the bounds of goals they can represent themselves.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces the Language Model Augmented Autotelic Agent (LMA3), which leverages a pretrained language model (LM) to support the representation, generation and learning of diverse, abstract, human-relevant goals in a task-agnostic way. The LM is used to implement three key components of the autotelic architecture: 1) a relabeler that describes the goals achieved in the agent's trajectories, 2) a goal generator that suggests new high-level goals along with their decomposition into subgoals the agent already masters, and 3) reward functions for each of these goals. Without relying on any hand-coded goal representations, reward functions or curriculum, the LMA3 agent is shown to learn to master a large diversity of skills in a text-based cooking environment called CookingWorld. The agent receives textual observations and acts via textual commands in this environment. The goal generator prompts the LM with a previous trajectory and known goals to generate a new high-level goal and subgoal sequence. The agent attempts to follow this goal sequence, then prompts the LM relabeler to describe the resulting trajectory. Finally, it prompts the LM reward function to assign rewards. This allows the agent to bootstrap a skill learning process completely autonomously, resulting in the discovery of thousands of unique and human-relevant goals.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is addressing is how to enable artificial agents to autonomously generate diverse, abstract and human-relevant goals for open-ended skill learning, without relying on hand-coded goal representations or curricula. 

The paper argues that current artificial agents mostly rely on predefined goal representations that are either bounded or unbounded but not shaped by the agent itself. This limits their ability to continually update and expand their goal representations to support truly open-ended learning. 

To address this, the paper proposes augmenting autotelic agents (agents driven to generate and pursue their own goals) with large language models to provide a primitive form of cultural transmission of human goals and interests. The language models are used to implement key components like a relabeler, goal generator, and reward functions, allowing the agent to generate new goals, describe its own trajectories, and compute rewards without human intervention.

The overall aim is to enable the agent to leverage aspects of human common sense and interests from the language model to represent, generate and learn to complete more diverse, abstract and human-relevant goals in a task-agnostic environment, supporting more open-ended skill learning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The method relies on using a large language model to provide goal representations, goal generation, and reward functions for the agent. How robust is this approach to limitations or biases in the language model? Could imperfections in the language model negatively impact the diversity and quality of skills learned by the agent?

2. The goal generator decomposes high-level goals from the language model into sequences of subgoals that the agent has already mastered. How does the agent ensure that these subgoal sequences are coherent and lead to successful completion of the high-level goal? Are there mechanisms to detect and recover from failed subgoal sequences?

3. The language model provides reward functions for generated goals based on trajectory descriptions. However, language can be ambiguous. How does the method ensure the reward functions are accurate reflections of true goal achievement? Could false positives or false negatives arise and negatively impact learning?

4. The agent uses a simple evolutionary algorithm for skill learning given the generated goals. How might using more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithms impact the diversity and complexity of skills learned? Could the simplicity of the skill learning algorithm limit the benefits of the goal generation process?

5. The method was evaluated in a relatively simple text-based environment. How will the approach scale to more complex, high-dimensional environments like robotics simulators? Will grounding the language model perceptions and goals be a significant challenge?

6. The paper focuses on goal generation as the key capability, but open-ended learning also requires co-adaptation of the goal generator and skill learner. How could the framework be extended to make the goal generator sensitive to and adaptive to the agent's current capabilities?

7. The language model provides a form of cultural transmission and human relevance for the agent. However, language models have biases and limitations in capturing true human values and interests. How could the method incorporate more diverse forms of human interaction?

8. The agent relies heavily on the language model, requiring many prompt-based calls to the model which can be expensive. How could prompt engineering be improved to reduce the number of calls required? Are there ways to distill the language model into more efficient learned components?

9. The text-based environment used is deterministic, allowing the use of simpler learning approaches. How will the agent architecture need to be adapted to handle stochastic environments where skills must be more robust?

10. Open-ended learning aims to continually discover new skills without bound. Does the proposed approach have limitations in how open-ended it can be in practice? Will the language model's knowledge and environment complexity necessarily bound the extent of open-ended learning possible?
