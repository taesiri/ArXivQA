# [Worst-Case Morphs using Wasserstein ALI and Improved MIPGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08371)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can morphs be generated that are even more challenging for face recognition systems than existing landmark- or GAN-based morphs, by approximating the theoretical "worst case" morph?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Considering the goal of generating challenging morphs during training, rather than only after training, will lead to more effective morphs. 

2) Optimizing morph generation directly towards the theoretical "worst case" embedding will produce more challenging morphs than existing landmark or GAN approaches.

3) It is possible to generate morphs that approximate this worst case even for unknown ("black box") face recognition systems that were not used during training or optimization.

The authors propose a new method called Wasserstein ALI (WALI) that incorporates goals 1 and 2 into the training process. They also introduce an improved optimization procedure for morph generation using existing generative models like StyleGAN/MIPGAN. Experiments demonstrate that WALI and improved MIPGAN morphs achieve higher "morphing attack potential" against several face recognition systems compared to other morphing techniques, supporting hypotheses 1 and 2. Evaluations under black box settings provide evidence for hypothesis 3 as well.

In summary, the central question is whether highly challenging "worst case" morphs can be produced by incorporating that goal into training and optimization, beyond what existing morphing techniques can achieve. The results support affirmative answers for all three main hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Improving the Adversarially Learned Inference (ALI) method to enable better manipulation of real images and generation of morphs. This results in an improved method called Wasserstein ALI (WALI).

- Showing that considering the goal of generating challenging morphs during training leads to more effective morphs compared to only optimizing pre-trained models to create morphs. 

- Demonstrating that optimizing the trained WALI model can generate morphs that are more challenging for face recognition systems than landmark-based or prior GAN-based morphs.

- Applying a similar optimization approach to an existing StyleGAN model paired with an encoder network results in an improved MIPGAN method that also generates challenging morphs.

- Evaluating the morphs on multiple face recognition systems and showing they achieve higher vulnerability on most systems compared to other morphing techniques.

In summary, the key contribution is developing and demonstrating methods to automatically generate challenging morphs that expose vulnerabilities in face recognition systems, even when the target system is unknown. This could help improve the robustness of face recognition and morphing attack detection systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes a new method called Wasserstein Adversarially Learned Inference (WALI) to generate challenging facial image morphs that can fool multiple face recognition systems, and shows it can produce morphs closer to the theoretical worst-case vulnerability than existing landmark- or GAN-based approaches.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on generating challenging facial image morphs:

- The paper builds on prior work like MorGAN and MIPGAN which use GANs to generate morphs, but proposes a new method called WALI (Wasserstein ALI) which improves training stability and image quality compared to prior GAN approaches. 

- A key contribution is optimizing the latent embeddings not just to generate realistic looking images (like typical GAN training) but specifically to manipulate identity information and create challenging morphs that can fool face recognition systems. 

- They introduce loss functions tailored for morphing during WALI training, and additional optimization steps after training to further refine the morphs. This leads to morphs that are more challenging than prior landmark- or GAN-based approaches.

- The morphs generated are evaluated against multiple face recognition systems, including both white-box (systems used during optimization) and black-box (unseen systems). The morphs achieve higher attack success rates, demonstrating they are closer approximations to a theoretical worst-case morph.

- They also show the improved optimization process can be applied to other GAN models like StyleGAN, leading to an "improved MIPGAN" approach. This also creates challenging morphs, showing the optimization strategy is useful beyond just their proposed WALI model.

Overall, a key distinction is the explicit focus on optimizing latent embeddings for identity manipulation and fooling face recognition systems, both during training and as a post-processing step. This leads to morphs that are more challenging than prior landmark- or GAN-based approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Generating challenging morph datasets with high visual quality in addition to quantity, for example by investigating manual post-processing effects. The authors suggest it could be interesting to explore whether GANs like StyleGAN that generate high quality images could also be adapted to explicitly include the goal of generating difficult morphs during training.

- Applying similar adaptations to diffusion models to generate challenging morphs by optimizing towards a worst case.

- Further investigating the effects of different post-processing techniques like printing and scanning on the robustness of face recognition systems to morphing attacks. 

- Exploring the effects of training face recognition and morphing attack detection systems on large datasets generated with the proposed WALI method or the improved MIPGAN approach.

- Generating morphs that cover a wide range of possible variations, going beyond landmark-based and GAN-based morphs.

- Analyzing if high visual quality morphs generated using the proposed approaches can survive printing and scanning or other post-processing steps that could degrade image quality and artifacts that might aid detection.

In summary, the authors suggest further work on generating diverse high quality morph datasets, adapting additional generative models like GANs and diffusion models, studying post-processing effects, and using the generated data to train improved face recognition and morphing attack detection systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a new method called Wasserstein ALI (WALI) for generating challenging facial image morphs that can fool multiple face recognition systems simultaneously. It builds on prior work on Adversarially Learned Inference (ALI) and Wasserstein GANs to create a more stable model for manipulating facial identity information. The key ideas are:

- Defining a theoretical "worst-case" morph embedding that fools multiple face recognizers. This guides the training and optimization process.

- Training WALI end-to-end to explicitly generate difficult morphs, unlike prior GAN morphing methods that were trained just to generate realistic faces. 

- Improving the optimization process to find better latent vectors for morphing.

- Evaluating the morphs on multiple recognition systems. WALI morphs achieved higher attack success rates than prior landmark and GAN morphing techniques.

- Showing these ideas can also improve other morphing methods like MIPGAN.

Overall, the work demonstrates the existence of highly challenging morphs and that considering attack goals during training is important. WALI provides a way to generate difficult morph datasets to improve face recognition and detection systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new method called Wasserstein Adversarially Learned Inference (WALI) for generating challenging facial image morphs that can fool multiple face recognition systems. The authors improve on a previous method called Adversarially Learned Inference (ALI) by making it more stable during training and able to generate higher resolution images. During training, WALI tries to match the distributions of real and generated images while also using losses from a face recognition system to encourage generating images that preserve identity information. After training, WALI can manipulate images to create morphs that contain identity information from two people. 

The authors show that their WALI morphs are more challenging for several face recognition systems compared to previous landmark-based and GAN-based morphing techniques. They are closer to approximating the theoretical worst case morphs that would maximize vulnerability of the recognition systems. The authors also adapt their optimization approach to improve an existing GAN-based morphing method called MIPGAN. Overall, the results illustrate the need to consider the goal of creating challenging morphs during training of generative models rather than only when optimizing a pre-trained model. The methods introduced could help improve face recognition and morph detection systems by providing enhanced training data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Wasserstein Adversarially Learned Inference (WALI) to generate challenging facial image morphs that can fool multiple face recognition systems. WALI builds on and improves Adversarially Learned Inference (ALI) by incorporating concepts from Wasserstein GANs to stabilize training. It consists of jointly training an Encoder, Decoder (Generator), and Critic network. After training convergence, the model is finetuned using custom loss functions that leverage a face recognition system to explicitly optimize the model's ability to manipulate facial identity and approximate "worst-case" morphs. The trained WALI model can then be used to generate morphs by optimizing the selection of latent embeddings corresponding to a pair of source images, in order to find a morphed embedding that minimizes the dissimilarity scores between the morph and both source images according to the face recognition system. Experiments show WALI can generate more challenging morphs than landmark-based or other GAN-based approaches for multiple face recognition systems, even in black-box settings where the systems are unknown during training.
