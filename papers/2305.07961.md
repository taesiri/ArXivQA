# [Leveraging Large Language Models in Conversational Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07961)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: How can large language models (LLMs) be leveraged to build an effective, controllable, and explainable conversational recommender system (CRS) at scale, given challenges around properly understanding complex conversations, interfacing with external recommendation engines/databases, lack of conversational training data, etc?In particular, some key aspects the paper focuses on include:- Using a single LLM for flexible dialogue management in a CRS by framing it as a unified language modeling task.- Conceptualizing different approaches for tractable retrieval over a large corpus within an LLM-based CRS.- Developing an LLM-based ranking module that jointly scores and explains recommendations. - Incorporating persistent natural language user profiles as additional inputs to LLMs for better personalization.- Techniques to build controllable LLM-based user simulators to generate synthetic conversations for tuning system modules.So in summary, the core research question is around how to effectively architect and train the components of a scalable, controllable and explainable conversational recommender system powered by large language models, given the unique challenges that arise in this setting compared to using LLMs in other contexts.
