# [Trained Without My Consent: Detecting Code Inclusion In Language Models   Trained on Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09299)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent large language models (LLMs) trained on code can assist with software development. However, their training datasets, which are collected from public code repositories, likely contain copyrighted code. This raises concerns about intellectual property infringement when these models generate new code. Traditional code clone detection techniques cannot reliably detect if an LLM was trained on specific copyrighted code since the training datasets are not public. Therefore, new techniques are needed to audit code generated by LLMs and detect possible copyright infringements.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose TraWiC, an interpretable and model-agnostic approach to detect if an LLM's training dataset contained code from a specific project. It exploits the memorization capability of LLMs by masking unique syntactic (variable/function names) and semantic (strings, comments) elements in a project's code. The model tries to fill in the masked element. Hits are counted when it guesses correctly, indicating the code was likely in the training set. A classifier then predicts if the project was included based on these hit counts.   

Main Contributions:
- TraWiC outperforms the NiCad code clone detector by 36% in detecting code inclusion, showing 83.87% accuracy on file-level and 99.19% sensitivity on project-level.
- Robust to moderate data obfuscation, still achieving 82.15% F1-score when 50% of identifiers are changed.
- Shows semantic elements are more important features than syntactic for detecting inclusion.
- Low computational overhead compared to pairwise code clone detection across entire training datasets.
- Provides model-agnostic and interpretable approach for auditing LLMs without needing access to model or training data.

In summary, TraWiC provides an effective solution to the emerging challenge of auditing code generation from modern LLMs. Its high accuracy and interpretability make it well-suited for identifying potential copyright infringements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes TraWiC, a model-agnostic approach that exploits language models' memorization ability to detect whether code from a project was included in the model's training dataset with 83.87% accuracy, outperforming code clone detection tools.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose TraWiC, a model-agnostic, interpretable, and efficient approach for detecting whether code was included in a language model's training dataset. TraWiC works by exploiting the memorization capability of language models through membership inference attacks.

2) The authors show that TraWiC significantly outperforms traditional code clone detection approaches like NiCad for the task of detecting code inclusion. TraWiC achieves 83.87% accuracy compared to 47.64% for NiCad.

3) The authors demonstrate TraWiC's robustness against data obfuscation techniques. Even with moderate levels of noise injected into the training data, TraWiC can still detect code inclusion with over 80% F-score. 

4) The authors provide a thorough analysis of TraWiC including error analysis, feature importance analysis, and sensitivity analysis. This provides insights into the approach and how it can be further improved.

5) The authors release TraWiC's code and dataset to enable other researchers to replicate and build upon their work.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a new approach called TraWiC for detecting whether code was included in a language model's training data. TraWiC outperforms existing techniques and is shown to be robust and interpretable.

The paper focuses on detecting whether code from a project was included in the training dataset of an LLM, which has implications for code licensing and intellectual property infringement. It proposes an approach called TraWiC which leverages membership inference attacks that exploit the memorization abilities of LLMs. The approach analyzes both syntactic identifiers (variable, function, class names) and semantic identifiers (strings, comments, documentation) in the code. It also examines TraWiC's robustness against code obfuscation techniques and compares it against traditional code clone detection methods. So those are some of the central topics and terminology covered in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using membership inference attacks (MIAs) to detect code inclusion in language models. How does exploiting the memorization capability of models specifically help in detecting code inclusion compared to other approaches? What are the limitations?

2. TraWiC breaks down code elements into syntactic (e.g. variable names) and semantic (e.g. comments) identifiers. Explain the rationale behind this categorization. How does looking for exact vs partial matches for these categories aid in detecting inclusion?

3. The paper compares TraWiC against code clone detection using NiCad. Explain why code clone detection performs poorly for detecting code inclusion compared to TraWiC. What modifications could make code clone detection approaches more viable for this task?  

4. TraWiC uses the Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM) technique to query the model. Explain how FIM allows exploiting memorization capabilities compared to other querying approaches. What are some limitations of FIM in detecting inclusion?

5. The results show TraWiC is robust to moderate levels of data obfuscation. Explain why and discuss what types of obfuscation could still fool TraWiC. How can the approach be made more robust?

6. Explain the difference in performance of TraWiC when detecting inclusion at the file vs repository level. What factors contribute to the variance in specificity and sensitivity across these levels?

7. The choice of edit distance threshold affects which features become more important for inclusion detection. Analyze and discuss the relationship between edit distance, feature importance of semantic vs syntactic identifiers and model performance.

8. Even when the model makes mistakes in predictions, the paper shows it still generates elements from training data 60% of the time. Explain why and discuss how this observation can be useful for improving inclusion detection.

9. The paper acknowledges threats from reliance on MIAs and choice of comparison criteria. Discuss additional threats such as those related to the choice of model, datasets, sampling methods etc. and how they impact validity of results.

10. The approach relies solely on querying the target model. Discuss the limitations this poses compared to white-box approaches, and propose possible extensions leveraging white-box access that could improve performance.
