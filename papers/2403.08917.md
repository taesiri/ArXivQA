# [Efficiently Computing Similarities to Private Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08917)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the fundamental problem of privately computing similarities between a query point and a private dataset. Specifically, given a private dataset $X$, a similarity function $f$, and a query point $y$, the goal is to compute $\sum_{x \in X} f(x,y)$ or $\frac{1}{|X|} \sum_{x \in X} f(x,y)$ privately. This problem arises commonly when computing similarities between private and public data, which is a core subroutine in differential privacy applications like generating synthetic data. The paper considers $f$ to be a distance function like $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ or a kernel function like Gaussian or exponential kernels. 

Proposed Solution:
The key insight is that many such functions $f$ have hidden "low dimensional structure" that can be algorithmically exploited. The paper proposes new algorithms that leverage such structure to achieve better privacy-utility tradeoffs and lower query times. For distance functions, they decompose the sum into independent one-dimensional sums that can be handled using data structures. For kernels, they show the summation can be preserved under dimensionality reduction which reduces query costs. They also use tools from function approximation theory to reduce smooth kernels to simpler exponential kernels. 

Main Contributions:
1) Improved privacy-utility tradeoffs for a variety of distance functions including $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, and $\ell_p^p$. Specifically, the paper shows that if a small multiplicative error is allowed, much lower additive error can be obtained, greatly improving over prior work.

2) Faster algorithms for privately answering kernel density estimation queries on Gaussian, exponential, and smooth kernels (like Cauchy). In high dimensions, the query times improve over the previous best results by poly-logarithmic factors.

3) New private kernel density estimation results for the kernels $1/(1+\|x-y\|_2)$ and $1/(1+\|x-y\|_1)$. These kernels did not have any known private data structures previously. The algorithms are obtained via a reduction using function approximation tools.

4) The paper provides lower bounds on the error for answering $\ell_1$ distance queries privately, highlighting an inherent algorithmic barrier.

5) The practical viability of the new algorithms are demonstrated through experiments on real datasets. An application to differentially private image classification is also shown.
