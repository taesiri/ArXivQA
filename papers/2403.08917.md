# [Efficiently Computing Similarities to Private Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08917)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the fundamental problem of privately computing similarities between a query point and a private dataset. Specifically, given a private dataset $X$, a similarity function $f$, and a query point $y$, the goal is to compute $\sum_{x \in X} f(x,y)$ or $\frac{1}{|X|} \sum_{x \in X} f(x,y)$ privately. This problem arises commonly when computing similarities between private and public data, which is a core subroutine in differential privacy applications like generating synthetic data. The paper considers $f$ to be a distance function like $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ or a kernel function like Gaussian or exponential kernels. 

Proposed Solution:
The key insight is that many such functions $f$ have hidden "low dimensional structure" that can be algorithmically exploited. The paper proposes new algorithms that leverage such structure to achieve better privacy-utility tradeoffs and lower query times. For distance functions, they decompose the sum into independent one-dimensional sums that can be handled using data structures. For kernels, they show the summation can be preserved under dimensionality reduction which reduces query costs. They also use tools from function approximation theory to reduce smooth kernels to simpler exponential kernels. 

Main Contributions:
1) Improved privacy-utility tradeoffs for a variety of distance functions including $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, and $\ell_p^p$. Specifically, the paper shows that if a small multiplicative error is allowed, much lower additive error can be obtained, greatly improving over prior work.

2) Faster algorithms for privately answering kernel density estimation queries on Gaussian, exponential, and smooth kernels (like Cauchy). In high dimensions, the query times improve over the previous best results by poly-logarithmic factors.

3) New private kernel density estimation results for the kernels $1/(1+\|x-y\|_2)$ and $1/(1+\|x-y\|_1)$. These kernels did not have any known private data structures previously. The algorithms are obtained via a reduction using function approximation tools.

4) The paper provides lower bounds on the error for answering $\ell_1$ distance queries privately, highlighting an inherent algorithmic barrier.

5) The practical viability of the new algorithms are demonstrated through experiments on real datasets. An application to differentially private image classification is also shown.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from this paper:

The paper gives improved algorithms and trade-offs for computing similarities privately between a query point and a private dataset for a range of functions, exploiting low dimensionality structures, with empirical validation demonstrating faster runtimes and accuracy over prior methods on tasks such as private classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. New and improved algorithms for privately computing similarities to private datasets for a variety of functions, including distance functions like l1 and l2 norms as well as kernel functions like Gaussians and exponentials. The algorithms have better utility-privacy tradeoffs and faster query times compared to prior work.

2. Novel dimensionality reduction results that allow reducing the dimension of the private dataset and queries while approximately preserving similarity computations. This leads to faster algorithms and is also applicable in the non-private setting. 

3. New upper and lower bounds characterizing the privacy-utility tradeoffs for problems related to private similarity search and private density estimation. 

4. An empirical demonstration of the algorithms on tasks like private L1 distance queries, benefiting from dimensionality reduction for Gaussian KDE, and differentially private image classification based on similarity search. The experiments validate the practical utility of the algorithms.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be an extensive theoretical and empirical study of differentially private similarity search and density estimation, providing new algorithms and lower bounds that advance the state of the art in this area.
