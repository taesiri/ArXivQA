# [Improving Natural Language Understanding with Computation-Efficient   Retrieval Representation Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02993)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing retrieval-based augmentation methods for non-knowledge-intensive (NKI) tasks like text classification have limitations. They concatenate retrievals as context to inputs, demanding LMs handle long texts and consuming substantial computational resources.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose ReFusion, a computation-efficient retrieval representation fusion framework with neural architecture search (NAS).

- It includes:
   - An online retrieval module to retrieve representation vectors of similar sentences
   - A retrieval fusion module with two ranking schemes (reranker-based and ordered-mask-based) to refine and fuse the retrieved representations into LMs
   - An architecture search module using NAS to determine the optimal fusion structure

Key Contributions:

- First to directly fuse retrieval representations into LMs to address performance and efficiency limitations of concatenation-based approaches

- Achieves superior and robust performance over strong baselines on 15 diverse NKI tasks covering text classification, NLI, etc.

- Computation-efficient, with negligible increase in FLOPs compared to 400-500x for concatenation baselines

- NAS determines optimal fusion architecture, outperforming individual ranking schemes  

In summary, ReFusion effectively addresses bottlenecks of existing retrieval augmentation methods for NKI tasks by fusing representations directly into LMs, guided by NAS to determine the best fusion structure. It provides strong performance with high computational efficiency.

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this work include:

- Retrieval representation fusion - The main idea proposed in the paper to fuse retrieval representations directly into language models rather than concatenating retrievals as contexts.

- Online retrieval module - Proposed module to retrieve representations of similar sentences on-the-fly. Uses a query encoder and in-memory cache.

- Ranking schemes - Two schemes proposed to refine and rank the retrieved representations before fusing them into models - reranker-based and ordered-mask-based.

- Neural Architecture Search (NAS) - Used to find the optimal fusion structure across layers of the language model. Searches over choice of ranking scheme per layer.

- Non-knowledge intensive (NKI) tasks - Focus of experiments is evaluating retrieval fusion on NKI tasks like text classification rather than knowledge intensive QA/generation tasks.

- Robustness - Show retrieval fusion leads to superior and more robust performance across variety of NKI benchmarks compared to concatenation-based augmentation.

- Computational efficiency - Aim is to provide computationally cheaper alternative to concatenation-based retrievals. Avoid needing to process long input sequences.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes directly fusing retrieval representations into language models rather than concatenating retrievals as context. What are the key advantages of this approach over concatenation-based methods? How does it solve the limitations around sequence length and computational efficiency?

2. The retrieval fusion module contains two ranking schemes - reranker-based and ordered-mask-based. How do these schemes work? What are the differences between them and what are the motivations for having two separate schemes? 

3. The reranker assigns new weights to the retrieved representations. What is the intuition behind learning a specialized reranker per module rather than using the original ranking from the retriever? How does the reranker architecture work?

4. The ordered mask scheme is based on nested dropout. Explain what nested dropout is, how the ordered mask builds on it, and why an ordered masking approach is useful for fusing retrievals. 

5. The paper utilizes neural architecture search to find the optimal fusion structure. What is the search space here and what modules are being searched over? Discuss the tradeoffs between search space size and tractability.  

6. Analyze the differences in performance between the reranking and ordered mask schemes in the ablation studies. When does one scheme outperform the other? Is there a consistent pattern?

7. The paper experiments with both encoding input texts and using hidden states directly to query the retriever. Compare and contrast the tradeoffs between these two approaches. When is each one preferable?

8. How does the number of retrievals fused impact overall performance and compute? Is there an optimal value or does it depend on the specific dataset? What are the efficiency vs performance tradeoffs?

9. The fusion module can be inserted in different locations (query, key, value). How does the choice of where to insert fusion impact overall performance? Does certain insertion locations work better for some tasks?

10. The method relies on an offline retriever. What are some good strategies for constructing the retrieval database? How could the database design impact which sentences are retrieved?
