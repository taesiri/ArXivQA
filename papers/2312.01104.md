# [QPoser: Quantized Explicit Pose Prior Modeling for Controllable Pose   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01104)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explicit pose prior models are used to represent human poses for downstream generative tasks. Existing models lack one or more of the following desired abilities: expressiveness to represent accurate poses, correctness to avoid impossible poses, and controllability for conditional generation.  

Solution - QPoser Model:
- A multi-head vector quantized variational autoencoder (MS-VQVAE) is proposed to obtain an expressive distributed latent representation of poses. This allows extracting rich features from poses.

- A global-local feature integration mechanism (GLIF-AE) is used to disentangle the latent codes and integrate full-body information into local joint features. This enables controllability while ensuring correctness.

Key Contributions:  
- Proposes a highly expressive and controllable explicit pose prior model QPoser with two key architectures:
  - MS-VQVAE for distributed latent pose representation
  - GLIF-AE for disentangled and embodied latent codes

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in representing expressive and physically correct poses.

- Enables detailed conditional pose generation with reference images or text prompts by leveraging the disentangled and controllable latent space.

- Demonstrates potential for seamless integration with transformer architectures for unconditional and conditioned pose generation.

In summary, this paper tackles limitations in controllability of existing explicit pose priors. The proposed QPoser model with its MS-VQVAE and GLIF-AE architectures achieves improved expressiveness, correctness and controllability compared to previous methods. This facilitates detailed control over pose generation using references or prompts.
