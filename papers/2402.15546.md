# [HiMAP: Learning Heuristics-Informed Policies for Large-Scale Multi-Agent   Pathfinding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15546)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) involves finding collision-free paths for multiple agents from their start locations to goals. It has many real-world applications like controlling robots in warehouses or vehicles in cities. However, as the number of agents grows, computing optimal paths becomes intractable. Prior methods using search algorithms or reinforcement learning (RL) have scalability issues or require complex implementation/training.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Heuristics-Informed Multi-Agent Pathfinding (HiMAP), a decentralized imitation learning method. It trains a neural network to map agent observations to actions by imitating collision-free paths from an expert heuristic solver (EECBS) on small maps. During evaluation, it uses several techniques to boost performance:

1) Preventing revisiting recent locations 
2) Adapting softmax temperature for more exploration
3) Treating completed agents as obstacles
4) Resolving conflicts between agents 

Main Contributions:
1) Formulates MAPF as an imitation learning problem to learn from heuristic expert demonstrations
2) Proposes a simple yet effective training scheme requiring only small-scale expert paths 
3) Introduces techniques like preventing revisits and adapting softmax temperature to improve inference
4) Shows the potential of pure imitation learning for MAPF when combined with inference enhancements

The method demonstrates high success rates in finding collision-free paths even as the number of agents increases. It offers a promising direction for imitation learning-based MAPF without needing complex RL training.
