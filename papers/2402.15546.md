# [HiMAP: Learning Heuristics-Informed Policies for Large-Scale Multi-Agent   Pathfinding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15546)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) involves finding collision-free paths for multiple agents from their start locations to goals. It has many real-world applications like controlling robots in warehouses or vehicles in cities. However, as the number of agents grows, computing optimal paths becomes intractable. Prior methods using search algorithms or reinforcement learning (RL) have scalability issues or require complex implementation/training.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Heuristics-Informed Multi-Agent Pathfinding (HiMAP), a decentralized imitation learning method. It trains a neural network to map agent observations to actions by imitating collision-free paths from an expert heuristic solver (EECBS) on small maps. During evaluation, it uses several techniques to boost performance:

1) Preventing revisiting recent locations 
2) Adapting softmax temperature for more exploration
3) Treating completed agents as obstacles
4) Resolving conflicts between agents 

Main Contributions:
1) Formulates MAPF as an imitation learning problem to learn from heuristic expert demonstrations
2) Proposes a simple yet effective training scheme requiring only small-scale expert paths 
3) Introduces techniques like preventing revisits and adapting softmax temperature to improve inference
4) Shows the potential of pure imitation learning for MAPF when combined with inference enhancements

The method demonstrates high success rates in finding collision-free paths even as the number of agents increases. It offers a promising direction for imitation learning-based MAPF without needing complex RL training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Heuristics-Informed Multi-Agent Pathfinding (HiMAP), a novel scalable approach for multi-agent pathfinding that employs imitation learning to train a neural network model on small-scale instances using heuristic policies as teachers to map agent observations to action probabilities, and introduces techniques like preventing re-visits, treating completed agents as obstacles, and adapting the softmax temperature to improve performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The proposal of Heuristics-Informed Multi-Agent Pathfinding (HiMAP), a novel scalable approach that employs imitation learning with heuristic guidance in a decentralized manner to solve the multi-agent pathfinding problem. Specifically, the key contributions include:

1) Formulating the MAPF problem as an imitation learning problem where the model learns to choose actions by imitating expert decisions from heuristics solvers. 

2) Proposing a simple yet effective training scheme based on imitation learning of small-scale solutions generated by the EECBS heuristic solver.

3) Introducing several inference techniques during evaluation to improve the model's performance, including preventing re-visits, treating completed agents as obstacles, softmax temperature adaptation, and conflict-free planning.  

4) Demonstrating the potential of imitation-learning-only MAPF equipped with these inference techniques in terms of competitive success rate and scalability compared to other learning-based MAPF methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing HiMAP as a novel scalable imitation learning-based approach for MAPF that shows promise through good performance and simple implementation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using EECBS to generate expert paths for imitation learning. What are some key advantages of using EECBS over other MAPF algorithms like CBS or ECBS for this purpose? How does the suboptimality factor impact the quality and diversity of demonstrations?

2. The neural network architecture is based on PRIMAL. What modifications were made compared to the original PRIMAL architecture? Why was the value and blocking head removed? What impact would keeping those outputs have?  

3. The paper utilizes a partially observable grid world as the environment model. What are the tradeoffs of using a partially observable vs fully observable state? How does the field of view size impact learning and generalization?

4. What is the motivation behind using a history mechanism to prevent revisiting previous locations? What are the hyperparameters involved in controlling this mechanism? How sensitive is performance based on the history size?

5. Explain the softmax temperature adaptation technique. Why is greedy action selection not sufficient? How does adjusting temperature lead to more exploration? What range of temperatures work best?

6. What is the intuition behind treating completed agents as obstacles? Does this actually change the underlying map representation or is it just from the model's perspective? How much does this technique improve performance?

7. Walk through the conflict avoidance schemes step-by-step. What types of conflicts are being addressed and what techniques are used to resolve them? How effective are these schemes?

8. The training data only consists of small map demonstrations. What strategies enable the method to generalize to larger maps during evaluation? What are the limitations of this approach?

9. The paper compares against a baseline without two key techniques. What other ablation studies would provide further insight into the method? What are the most critical components?

10. How does the performance compare with other learning-based and search-based MAPF techniques? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages compared to those methods?
