# [Generating Hard-Negative Out-of-Scope Data with ChatGPT for Intent   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05640)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Intent classifiers for dialog systems need to reliably detect when a user's input is out-of-scope (OOS) to avoid generating irrelevant responses. However, current methods for collecting OOS data do not generate "hard-negative" examples that closely resemble in-scope (INS) data but are actually OOS. Evaluating on such data can give misleading results about a model's robustness.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a method to automatically generate hard-negative OOS data using ChatGPT. Their method analyzes the INS data to find important keywords for each intent, then prompts ChatGPT to generate OOS questions containing those keywords. This creates data that models are more likely to incorrectly classify as INS.

- They generate hard-negative OOS datasets for 5 benchmark intent classification datasets. Experiments show models struggle more with the hard-negative OOS data than general OOS data, often predicting high confidence (but incorrect) INS labels.

Main Contributions:
- A novel method to automatically generate hard-negative OOS data for intent classifiers using ChatGPT.

- Analysis showing models are brittle when tested on hard-negative OOS data, frequently predicting incorrect INS labels with high confidence.

- Experiments indicating training on hard-negative OOS data improves model robustness for both hard-negative and general OOS data.

- The generation method and analysis address an important need for more challenging OOS data to properly evaluate and improve intent classifier robustness.

In summary, the paper introduces an inexpensive automated approach using ChatGPT to generate hard-negative OOS data that better exposes deficiencies in intent classifier robustness. Experiments demonstrate the greater difficulty of the approach's hard-negative OOS data. The authors show training on this data can enhance model performance on OOS detection.
