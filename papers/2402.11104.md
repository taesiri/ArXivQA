# [Computing Voting Rules with Elicited Incomplete Votes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11104)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional voting rules assume voters submit complete ordinal rankings over all candidates. However, when the number of candidates is large, eliciting full rankings can be cognitively demanding and lead to voter frustration or incomplete ballots. The paper studies voting rules that only require queries about subsets of candidates, addressing the tension between limited voter cognition and implementing common voting rules.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces a formal model where algorithms can query voters' ordinal rankings over any subset of up to $t$ candidates, for some $t < m$ where $m$ is the total number of candidates. It aims to characterize which common voting rules like positional scoring rules and STV can or cannot be computed correctly using such limited-sized queries.

Key Contributions:

- Shows plurality winners cannot be determined by any algorithm, even randomized, using queries smaller than the full set of candidates. Constructs indistinguishable profile pairs that enable impossibility.

- Fully characterizes the positional scoring rules computable for any query size $t$, proving they coincide with a specific $t$-dimensional subspace. Visualizes the nested subspaces.

- Extends impossibility result to STV, demonstrating limitations of commonly used rules.

- Analyzes the query complexity of computable scoring rules, giving matching upper and lower bounds for deterministic algorithms. Identifies gaps for randomized algorithms, providing instances that show complexity.

The results provide both negative and positive insights into the compatibility of standard voting rules with the realistic constraint of limited voter cognition/effort during preference elicitation. They introduce a novel framework for studying the axiomatic implications of such cognitive barriers in social choice.
