# [Infusing Knowledge into Large Language Models with Contextual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01481)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Infusing Knowledge into Large Language Models with Contextual Prompts":

Problem:
- Existing approaches for infusing knowledge into large language models (LLMs) have limitations - they assume the existence of a well-populated knowledge graph (KG), which may not exist for many real-world applications. For example, new entities like customers or products may not exist in the KG.

Solution:
- The paper proposes an approach to infuse knowledge into LLMs using contextual prompts generated from relevant documents, instead of relying on a structured KG. 
- The key idea is to retrieve contextual sentences about entities from a domain corpus and use that as additional context when fine-tuning the LLM on downstream tasks. This infuses knowledge about those entities into the model.

Main Contributions:
- Alleviates the need for a structured knowledge source by relying solely on domain text corpora to generate contextual prompts. More practical for real applications.
- Contextual prompts are used alongside input examples during fine-tuning. Error propagation based on task drives model to infuse useful knowledge. 
- Experiments on relation extraction and QA demonstrate improved performance with contextual prompts over base LLMs and even standard fine-tuning.
- Approach is simple, scalable, and extensible to utilize other data modalities like tables to generate prompts.
- Establishes feasibility of using documents as knowledge source instead of KGs for knowledge infusion into LLMs.

In summary, the paper presents a practical knowledge infusion technique using contextual prompts from documents that does not assume existence of knowledge graphs, making it more viable for real-world applications. Experiments validate the efficacy of this simple yet effective approach.
