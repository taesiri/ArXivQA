# [Infusing Knowledge into Large Language Models with Contextual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01481)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Infusing Knowledge into Large Language Models with Contextual Prompts":

Problem:
- Existing approaches for infusing knowledge into large language models (LLMs) have limitations - they assume the existence of a well-populated knowledge graph (KG), which may not exist for many real-world applications. For example, new entities like customers or products may not exist in the KG.

Solution:
- The paper proposes an approach to infuse knowledge into LLMs using contextual prompts generated from relevant documents, instead of relying on a structured KG. 
- The key idea is to retrieve contextual sentences about entities from a domain corpus and use that as additional context when fine-tuning the LLM on downstream tasks. This infuses knowledge about those entities into the model.

Main Contributions:
- Alleviates the need for a structured knowledge source by relying solely on domain text corpora to generate contextual prompts. More practical for real applications.
- Contextual prompts are used alongside input examples during fine-tuning. Error propagation based on task drives model to infuse useful knowledge. 
- Experiments on relation extraction and QA demonstrate improved performance with contextual prompts over base LLMs and even standard fine-tuning.
- Approach is simple, scalable, and extensible to utilize other data modalities like tables to generate prompts.
- Establishes feasibility of using documents as knowledge source instead of KGs for knowledge infusion into LLMs.

In summary, the paper presents a practical knowledge infusion technique using contextual prompts from documents that does not assume existence of knowledge graphs, making it more viable for real-world applications. Experiments validate the efficacy of this simple yet effective approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to infuse knowledge into language models by retrieving relevant contextual sentences from text documents mentioning entities, and using these contextual sentences alongside input prompts during fine-tuning, instead of relying on structured knowledge graphs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple yet generalizable approach for knowledge infusion into large language models by generating prompts from the context in the input text. Specifically:

- They propose to exploit contextual text from a relevant domain-specific corpus to infuse knowledge into large language models, without needing to create structured knowledge graphs. This alleviates privacy and maintenance overhead of knowledge graphs.

- Their approach identifies named entities in the input prompt, retrieves relevant context for those entities from an indexed domain corpus, and augments the prompt with that contextual information during fine-tuning. This infuses knowledge about the entities from the contextual text.

- They demonstrate the effectiveness of their contextual prompting approach on tasks like tail prediction in triples and question answering. Their experiments show significant improvements over baseline models by leveraging contextual prompts during fine-tuning.

In summary, the key contribution is a practical and generalizable method for knowledge infusion that relies solely on domain text corpora, rather than requiring structured knowledge bases. The contextual prompts help infuse relevant knowledge into the language models to improve performance on downstream tasks.

The paper proposes an approach for knowledge infusion into large language models using contextual prompts generated from relevant sentences in a domain-specific corpus. Instead of relying on an external knowledge graph, it retrieves contextual information about entities directly from text. The approach is evaluated on tasks like relation extraction, tail prediction, and question answering. Key aspects explored include using discrete vs soft prompts, comparing context lengths, evaluating on a legal corpus, and limitations around knowledge propagation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that maintaining knowledge graphs about customers, organizations and events mentioned in documents is cumbersome. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges involved in creating and maintaining such knowledge graphs? 

2. The method proposes using contextual text from documents as a source of knowledge instead of structured knowledge graphs. What are some of the advantages and limitations of using unstructured text versus structured knowledge?

3. The paper argues that their method is more generalizable than relying on pre-existing knowledge graphs. However, does the method face any issues with scaling or generalizing to entirely new domains that have no relevant documents? 

4. What kinds of downstream tasks would be most suitable for applying this method of knowledge infusion using contextual prompts? Are there any tasks where you think this approach may not be effective?

5. The method relies on first retrieving relevant context from a domain corpus before formulating contextual prompts. What factors influence the quality of retrieved context and how does context relevance impact overall performance? 

6. How does the choice of domain corpus impact the knowledge that gets infused into the language model? Does using a more specialized vs. general corpus lead to different infusion outcomes?

7. The paper compares full fine-tuning against adapter-based fine-tuning. What are the relative tradeoffs between these two approaches for knowledge infusion using contextual prompts?

8. What kinds of strategies could be used to create better contextual prompts that provide more useful knowledge to the language model? How can prompt engineering further optimize this method?

9. The paper focuses on discrete textual prompts. How could the method be extended to utilize soft prompts within a continuous latent space rather than discrete tokens?

10. The method is evaluated on relation extraction and question answering. How could the experimental evaluation be expanded to better analyze the quality and extent of knowledge infusion using contextual prompts?
