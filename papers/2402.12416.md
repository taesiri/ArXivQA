# [Aligning Individual and Collective Objectives in Multi-Agent Cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12416)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-agent cooperation problems often involve both common interests as well as conflicts between individual and collective goals. Such "mixed-motive" scenarios are common but have not been well-studied.
- Existing methods promote cooperation by manually designing additional mechanisms like reputation, norms, contracts etc. However, these require significant human expertise and lack theoretical convergence analysis. 
- Simultaneous optimization methods that focus only on collective rewards can neglect individual interests. Gradient adjustment methods prioritize stability over individual rewards.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulates the mixed-motive game as a "differentiable mixed-motive game (DMG)" to study learning dynamics.
- Proposes a novel optimization method called "Altruistic Gradient Adjustment (AgA)" that adjusts gradients to align individual and collective interests.
- Includes an "alignment parameter" to balance focus between individual and collective objectives.
- Shows theoretically that proper sign selection for alignment parameter can accelerate convergence towards desirable stable fixed points.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces the DMG formulation to facilitate analysis of mixed-motive game dynamics.
- Proposes the AgA method that provably aligns individual and collective interests by gradient adjustments.
- Provides theoretical proof that AgA with correct sign selection reaches stable solutions faster.
- Evaluation on public goods game, Cleanup, Harvest and modified SMAC validates superiority of AgA over baselines in social welfare, equality and win rate.

In summary, the key novelty is the AgA technique to reconcile individual and team interests in mixed-motive multi-agent scenarios, with strong theoretical grounding. Experiments underscore the promise over state-of-the-art methods.
