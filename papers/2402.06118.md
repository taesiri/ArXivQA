# [ViGoR: Improving Visual Grounding of Large Vision Language Models with   Fine-Grained Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06118)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Recent large vision language models (LVLMs) exhibit poor visual grounding, resulting in text generated from images that contains hallucinations, misses details, and has inaccurate attributes or relationships between objects. This is due to limitations in training data and alignment techniques. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework called ViGoR that enhances the visual grounding of LVLMs through fine-grained reward modeling. It has two main components:

1) A reward model trained on human evaluations and fine-grained feedback on sample LVLM outputs. This provides positive/negative reinforcement signals during LVLM training.

2) An automated scoring system using an open-set object detector to verify objects mentioned in the LVLM's text output against the actual image. 

These two signals are combined into a single reward score to select the best text sample for each image from multiple LVLM outputs. This sample is further refined and used to fine-tune the LVLM with supervised learning.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces the ViGoR framework that substantially improves visual grounding of LVLMs through fine-grained reward modeling
- Develops reward models with little human effort by leveraging advances in perception models  
- Constructs a new comprehensive benchmark, MMViG, to evaluate visual grounding capabilities of LVLMs
- Will release a dataset of ~16K image-text pairs with fine-grained human evaluations

The method is shown quantitatively and qualitatively to enhance visual grounding while retaining creativity and reasoning abilities. It also demonstrates efficiency, requiring only 16K samples to significantly improve state-of-the-art LVLMs.
