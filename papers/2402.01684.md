# [A Framework to Implement 1+N Multi-task Fine-tuning Pattern in LLMs   Using the CGC-LORA Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01684)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) faces two key challenges: 1) Various task impact - a domain covers many heterogeneous tasks and a single fine-tuned LLM cannot handle all tasks well. This causes isolated information and high computing costs. 2) Seesawing effect - fine-tuning a single model on multiple datasets causes performance trade-offs between tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a framework to implement a "1+N" multi-task fine-tuning pattern in LLMs. 
- Tasks are first grouped into N clusters based on similarity.
- A novel "CGC-LoRA" module is proposed that unifies multi-task learning (CGC) with parameter efficient fine-tuning (LoRA).
- The module contains task-common experts to capture shared knowledge and task-specific experts to capture specialized knowledge. 
- A task-motivated gate function controls the contributions of the experts to each task based only on the task ID.
- This allows efficient fine-tuning with a small number of additional parameters.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a general framework to equip LLMs with multi-task adaptation capability using CGC-LoRA modules
- Unifies multi-task learning and parameter efficient fine-tuning in an innovative CGC-LoRA structure
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on two public multi-task datasets - PromptCBLUE (medical) and Firefly (general domain)
- Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of key components like CGC structure and task-motivated gates

In summary, the paper presents a novel method to efficiently fine-tune LLMs for multiple heterogeneous tasks while avoiding negative transfer between tasks. The unified CGC-LoRA approach is shown to outperform prior strategies on diverse tasks.
