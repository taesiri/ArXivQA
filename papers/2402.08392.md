# [Large Language Models as Minecraft Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08392)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing conversational agents that can operate in virtual worlds like games is an important AI challenge. Minecraft is a popular sandbox game environment used for this research.
- The Collaborative Builder Task involves an 'architect' agent giving natural language instructions to build structures in Minecraft to a 'builder' agent that places the blocks. Architect has a target structure and builder does not.
- Prior work used neural models for these agents but did not explore modern large language models (LLMs). LLMs have shown promise for task-oriented dialogue but not been applied to Minecraft agents.  

Proposed Solution:
- Implement LLM-based builder and architect agents for the task using GPT-3, GPT-4, Llama and Vicuna models. 
- Builder is prompted to output actions and colors for block placement. Evaluated on interpretation accuracy.
- Architect is prompted with target structure and must instruct builder through dialogue.
- Introduce capability for both agents to ask clarification questions.

Contributions:  
1) LLM-based builder and architect agents for Minecraft tested, builder favorably matches past specialized models
2) Enabled clarification question asking ability lacking in prior work  
3) Presented interactive web platform for agents to support future research  

The paper examined challenges for architect on more complex structures and suggested areas like prompt engineering or fine-tuning for future improvement of the models.
