# [Class Symbolic Regression: Gotta Fit 'Em All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01816)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel framework called "Class Symbolic Regression" for automatically discovering a single analytical function that can accurately fit multiple datasets simultaneously. Each dataset represents observations of instances from the same overall class of phenomena, but may have unique parameter values. The method builds on the authors' prior work on "Physical Symbolic Optimization" which integrates physics-based constraints into symbolic regression using deep reinforcement learning. They demonstrate the approach on several physics-inspired synthetic datasets, showing improved performance over standard symbolic regression. Notably, the method correctly identifies parameters shared across all datasets versus those unique to each case. They showcase an astrophysics application by successfully recovering an NFW analytic potential form from simulated stellar streams. Overall, this hierarchical approach advances symbolic regression capabilities to find "universal laws" describing an entire class of observations rather than overfitting single datasets. It shows promise for revealing the underlying physics common across varied manifestations of phenomena.
