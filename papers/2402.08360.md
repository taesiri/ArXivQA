# [Visual Question Answering Instruction: Unlocking Multimodal Large   Language Model To Domain-Specific Visual Multitasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08360)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in natural language processing but have not been fully utilized for visual tasks, especially domain-specific ones requiring more explicit visual understanding. 
- Existing multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) focus mainly on vision-language tasks like image captioning rather than recognition or detection. 
- MLLMs also have not been adapted for domain-specific visual tasks and multitasking across both vision-language and visual domains.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Visual Question Answering Instruction (VQA-IN) method to transform diverse vision and vision-language datasets into a unified QA format.
- This allows MLLMs to be applied to domain-specific visual tasks, assessed on them, and perform multitasking across domains.
- VQA-IN converts existing datasets through techniques like generating questions with ChatGPT and representing positional info for detection tasks.
- Experiments show VQA-IN can unlock smaller LLMs for strong performance on both vision-language and specialized visual tasks.

Main Contributions:
- VQA-IN enables domain-specific visual datasets to be formatted for MLLM use through QA transformation.
- The method unlocks MLLMs for specialized visual tasks like recognition and detection through instruction. 
- VQA-IN allows efficient multitasking on diverse visual domains with smaller LLMs.
- Experiments validate gains on vision-language and specialized tasks using VQA-IN across multiple MLLM architectures.

In summary, the paper proposes VQA-IN to adapt MLLMs through instruction to expand their capabilities and multitasking abilities across visual domains, as demonstrated through experimental performance gains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a visual question answering instruction (VQA-IN) method to transform diverse visual datasets into a unified question answering format, enabling multimodal large language models to efficiently perform both vision-language and domain-specific visual tasks in a multitask manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of a method called "Visual Question Answering Instruction (VQA-IN)" that transforms diverse vision datasets, including both vision-language and domain-specific visual datasets, into a unified question answering format. This allows multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to be extended to handle domain-specific visual tasks, while still maintaining performance on vision-language tasks. Specifically, the key contributions summarized in the paper are:

1) The VQA-IN method not only transforms vision-language datasets, but also domain-specific visual datasets into a consistent question answering format suitable for MLLMs. 

2) The paper introduces a visual instruction approach to integrate domain-specific vision tasks into the capabilities of MLLMs. This provides insights into how MLLMs can effectively utilize instructions to tackle diverse visual tasks.

3) Using the VQA-IN transformation, smaller versions of large language models (sLLMs) could achieve efficient performance on both vision-language and domain-specific visual tasks in a multitask manner.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed VQA-IN method that unlocks MLLMs for domain-specific visual tasks while enabling multitasking across both vision-language and domain-specific vision datasets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes converting diverse visual datasets into a unified Visual Question Answering Instruction (VQA-IN) format. Can you elaborate on why this unified format is useful for extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to domain-specific tasks? 

2. The VQA-IN method is used to transform both vision-language datasets and domain-specific visual datasets. What are some key differences in how these two types of datasets are transformed into the VQA-IN format?

3. The paper discusses controlling the length of textual responses using prompts within the VQA-IN questions. What is the purpose of having this flexibility to generate both long and short answers? How is this implemented?

4. Various MLLM architectures like BLIP-2, InstructBLIP and OpenFlamingo are trained on the VQA-IN datasets. What modifications, if any, are made to these architectures to work with the VQA-IN format? 

5. The experiments evaluate performance on both vision-language tasks and domain-specific visual tasks. Why is this two-phase evaluation necessary given differences in benchmarking between the two types of tasks?

6. For domain-specific evaluation, the paper uses AffectNet, HaGRID and RefCOCOg datasets. What specific capabilities do these datasets assess? Why are prompts used consistently across them?

7. The results show VQA-IN trained MLLMs achieving near equivalent performance to specialized single task models. What implications does this have for development of multi-capability visual assistants?

8. The paper utilizes smaller versions of large language models. How does VQA-IN and instruction tuning overcome performance limitations of smaller model size? 

9. What additional steps would be needed to deploy the VQA-IN trained models in real-world applications as referenced in the conclusion?

10. Could the VQA-IN approach be extended to other sensory modalities like audio, video, etc. for developing multimodal assistants? What would be required?
