# [Visual Question Answering Instruction: Unlocking Multimodal Large   Language Model To Domain-Specific Visual Multitasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08360)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in natural language processing but have not been fully utilized for visual tasks, especially domain-specific ones requiring more explicit visual understanding. 
- Existing multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) focus mainly on vision-language tasks like image captioning rather than recognition or detection. 
- MLLMs also have not been adapted for domain-specific visual tasks and multitasking across both vision-language and visual domains.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Visual Question Answering Instruction (VQA-IN) method to transform diverse vision and vision-language datasets into a unified QA format.
- This allows MLLMs to be applied to domain-specific visual tasks, assessed on them, and perform multitasking across domains.
- VQA-IN converts existing datasets through techniques like generating questions with ChatGPT and representing positional info for detection tasks.
- Experiments show VQA-IN can unlock smaller LLMs for strong performance on both vision-language and specialized visual tasks.

Main Contributions:
- VQA-IN enables domain-specific visual datasets to be formatted for MLLM use through QA transformation.
- The method unlocks MLLMs for specialized visual tasks like recognition and detection through instruction. 
- VQA-IN allows efficient multitasking on diverse visual domains with smaller LLMs.
- Experiments validate gains on vision-language and specialized tasks using VQA-IN across multiple MLLM architectures.

In summary, the paper proposes VQA-IN to adapt MLLMs through instruction to expand their capabilities and multitasking abilities across visual domains, as demonstrated through experimental performance gains.
