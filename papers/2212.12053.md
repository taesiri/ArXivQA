# [On Calibrating Semantic Segmentation Models: Analyses and An Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12053)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research focus of this paper is on calibrating semantic segmentation models and proposing an effective calibration algorithm. Specifically, the key research questions/goals appear to be:

- To conduct a systematic study on the calibration of semantic segmentation models and provide insights into what affects their calibration.

- To compare different existing calibration methods on state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models. 

- To propose a simple but effective calibration approach called "selective scaling" which focuses on scaling the logits of mispredicted pixels.

- To extensively evaluate the proposed selective scaling method and compare it to other calibration techniques on a variety of segmentation benchmarks and models.

- To examine calibration not just for in-domain data but also under domain shift scenarios.

Overall, the central hypothesis seems to be that selective scaling, by separately processing correct vs incorrect predictions, can effectively improve calibration of segmentation models in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. The experiments aim to demonstrate the efficacy of selective scaling compared to other calibration methods across diverse settings.
