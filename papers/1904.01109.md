# Creativity Inspired Zero-Shot Learning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is: How to improve zero-shot learning by explicitly modeling the capability to deviate generations of unseen classes from seen classes, inspired by concepts of creativity?The main hypothesis is that encouraging the model to carefully deviate from seen classes will improve its ability to recognize unseen classes in zero-shot learning scenarios. The authors propose a novel approach called Creativity Inspired Zero-Shot Learning (CIZSL) that incorporates this idea.Specifically, some key aspects the paper investigates:- Modeling a "creativity inspired" loss that encourages the generator to produce features for unseen classes that are distinct from seen classes, while still remaining realistic. This is inspired by concepts like the Wundt curve from psychology of human creativity.- Defining and experimenting with different parameterized entropy losses to help learn appropriate levels of deviation from seen classes.- Showing their proposed CIZSL approach improves performance across multiple zero-shot learning tasks like recognition, retrieval, and generalized zero-shot learning on benchmarks using both Wikipedia articles and attributes for class descriptions. - Demonstrating their creativity-inspired loss gives consistent gains when added to existing generative zero-shot learning models.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly modeling deviation from seen classes will help generalization to unseen classes in zero-shot learning, and they design and evaluate a method to incorporate this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel zero-shot learning approach called Creativity Inspired Zero-shot Learning (CIZSL) that explicitly models the capability to generate discriminative visual features for unseen classes by learning to deviate from seen classes. This is inspired by the psychology of human creativity and the notion of the Wundt curve. 2. The proposed CIZSL loss is unsupervised and orthogonal to existing generative ZSL methods. It can be easily integrated with any generative ZSL model like GAZSL, FeatGen, and cycle-WGAN to improve their performance without adding extra parameters or requiring more labels.3. Extensive experiments on 7 benchmarks using both Wikipedia articles and attributes as semantic representations demonstrate consistent improvements in zero-shot recognition, generalized zero-shot learning, and zero-shot retrieval over state-of-the-art methods.In summary, the key novelty is modeling the deviation from seen classes for generating discriminative unseen class features, inspired by human creativity. The simplicity of integrating the proposed CIZSL loss with existing models and the consistent gains across different tasks and datasets are also notable contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a creativity-inspired approach for zero-shot learning that carefully deviates visual feature generations of unseen classes from seen classes to improve discrimination, while using an entropy measure to maintain realism and enable knowledge transfer from seen classes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a creative approach to zero-shot learning, which aims to recognize objects from classes not seen during training. It makes the following key contributions:- Proposes a novel creativity-inspired loss function for generative adversarial networks (GANs) to encourage the model to deviate from seen classes when generating examples of unseen classes. This is inspired by theories of creativity from psychology and helps improve discrimination between seen and unseen classes. - Integrates the proposed creativity loss in a simple and modular way into existing GAN-based zero-shot learning methods like GAZSL and FeatGen. Shows consistent improvements over state-of-the-art on multiple benchmark datasets.- Comprehensive evaluation on multiple tasks - zero-shot recognition, generalized zero-shot learning, and zero-shot retrieval using both Wikipedia articles and attribute representations.The key difference from prior work is the explicit modeling of a creativity-inspired loss to encourage discrimination between seen and unseen classes. Most prior GAN-based zero-shot learning works like GAZSL and FeatGen do not have an explicit incentive to deviate from seen classes. Some prior works on computational creativity for art/fashion generation use losses to encourage deviation but are not designed for cross-modal synthesis and zero-shot learning.The simplicity of the proposed approach and its consistency in improving existing models is a strength. The connections drawn to psychology/creativity literature and the comprehensive evaluation are also distinguishing aspects. Overall, it presents a novel perspective to generative zero-shot learning through the lens of computational creativity.
