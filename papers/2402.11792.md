# [SInViG: A Self-Evolving Interactive Visual Agent for Human-Robot   Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11792)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Language ambiguity is ubiquitous in human-robot interaction. Previous works use human-robot interaction to resolve such ambiguity, but face challenges when deployed in the real world, such as handling complex visual inputs, open-ended dialogues, and diverse users.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes SInViG, a self-evolving interactive visual agent for human-robot interaction that aims to resolve language ambiguity through multi-turn visual dialogues.

- SInViG continuously learns from unlabeled images and large language models without human supervision to become more robust. It asks questions to disambiguate language and guesses target objects through dialogues.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a self-evolving framework that automatically labels visual dialog data using the model from the previous iteration to train the next iteration's model. The labeled dialog data is further polished by large language models to improve quality.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on the InViG benchmark and outperforms previous iterations, showing efficacy of self-evolving learning.

- Experiments involving real humans show models from later iterations are preferred and rated higher, indicating improved user experience via self-evolution.

- Deploys model on a real robot for interactive manipulation tasks. It can achieve over 80% grasp success rate and handle diverse natural instructions despite visual complexity.

To summarize, the key innovation is a self-evolving loop that continuously improves an interactive visual grounding agent's robustness to challenges in real-world human-robot interaction via unlabeled data. Both visual dialog experiments and real robot deployments demonstrate clear benefits.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing SInViG, a self-evolving interactive visual grounding system that can continuously and automatically learn from unlabeled images and large language models without human intervention. SInViG aims to resolve language ambiguity in human-robot interaction through multi-turn visual-language dialogues. It is designed to be robust against complex and unpredictable visual inputs, open-ended interaction, and diverse user demands. The self-evolving approach allows SInViG to keep improving its performance and robustness over multiple iterations of self-labeled data generation and model training. Experiments show SInViG sets new state-of-the-art on interactive visual grounding benchmarks and is preferred by users in human-robot interaction experiments compared to previous methods.
