# [SpikingResformer: Bridging ResNet and Vision Transformer in Spiking   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14302)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have advantages like low power consumption and biological plausibility, but their performance lags behind artificial neural networks (ANNs). 
- Recent work has tried to introduce transformer architectures into SNNs to improve performance, but faces challenges:
  - Incompatibility of vanilla self-attention with the spike-based nature of SNNs
  - Lack of reasonable scaling methods for existing spiking self-attention mechanisms
  - Bottleneck in effectively extracting multi-scale features due to reliance on a shallow network before the Transformer encoder

Proposed Solution:
- A new spiking self-attention mechanism called Dual Spike Self-Attention (DSSA) that uses Dual Spike Transformation to achieve compatibility with SNN restrictions
  - Eliminates need for direct spike multiplications
  - Comes with detailed scaling factors derived from statistical properties, enabling handling of multi-scale inputs
- A SpikingResformer architecture that combines:
  - ResNet-based multi-stage backbone to extract multi-scale features
  - Proposed DSSA mechanism to incorporate self-attention  

Main Contributions:
- DSSA spiking self-attention mechanism with spike-driven computation and scaling for multi-scale inputs
- SpikingResformer architecture combining strengths of CNN and self-attention via ResNet backbone and DSSA
- State-of-the-art accuracy of 79.40% on ImageNet with fewer parameters and lower energy than previous SNN Transformers
- Significantly outperforms previous SNN Transformers on other datasets like CIFAR10/100 via transfer learning
- Provides strong baseline for further research into spiking Vision Transformers

In summary, the paper proposes a novel spiking Vision Transformer architecture using a new self-attention mechanism tailored for SNN compatibility and multi-scale feature extraction. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results with efficiency advantages.
