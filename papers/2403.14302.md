# [SpikingResformer: Bridging ResNet and Vision Transformer in Spiking   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14302)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have advantages like low power consumption and biological plausibility, but their performance lags behind artificial neural networks (ANNs). 
- Recent work has tried to introduce transformer architectures into SNNs to improve performance, but faces challenges:
  - Incompatibility of vanilla self-attention with the spike-based nature of SNNs
  - Lack of reasonable scaling methods for existing spiking self-attention mechanisms
  - Bottleneck in effectively extracting multi-scale features due to reliance on a shallow network before the Transformer encoder

Proposed Solution:
- A new spiking self-attention mechanism called Dual Spike Self-Attention (DSSA) that uses Dual Spike Transformation to achieve compatibility with SNN restrictions
  - Eliminates need for direct spike multiplications
  - Comes with detailed scaling factors derived from statistical properties, enabling handling of multi-scale inputs
- A SpikingResformer architecture that combines:
  - ResNet-based multi-stage backbone to extract multi-scale features
  - Proposed DSSA mechanism to incorporate self-attention  

Main Contributions:
- DSSA spiking self-attention mechanism with spike-driven computation and scaling for multi-scale inputs
- SpikingResformer architecture combining strengths of CNN and self-attention via ResNet backbone and DSSA
- State-of-the-art accuracy of 79.40% on ImageNet with fewer parameters and lower energy than previous SNN Transformers
- Significantly outperforms previous SNN Transformers on other datasets like CIFAR10/100 via transfer learning
- Provides strong baseline for further research into spiking Vision Transformers

In summary, the paper proposes a novel spiking Vision Transformer architecture using a new self-attention mechanism tailored for SNN compatibility and multi-scale feature extraction. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results with efficiency advantages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel spiking self-attention mechanism called Dual Spike Self-Attention (DSSA). It produces spiking self-attention via Dual Spike Transformation, which is fully spike-driven and compatible with SNNs. 

2. Detailing the scaling factors employed in DSSA, enabling DSSA to handle feature maps of arbitrary scales.

3. Proposing the SpikingResformer architecture, which combines the ResNet-based multi-stage architecture with the proposed DSSA to improve both performance and energy efficiency while reducing parameters.

4. Experimental results showing that the proposed SpikingResformer significantly outperforms other spiking Vision Transformer counterparts with fewer parameters and lower energy consumption. Notably, SpikingResformer-L achieves up to 79.40% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.
