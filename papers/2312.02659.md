# [Supervised learning of spatial features with STDP and homeostasis using   Spiking Neural Networks on SpiNNaker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02659)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel method for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to recognize spatial patterns of spikes using spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostasis. The authors developed a structured training protocol where an SNN is first trained on a single 10-bit binary pattern, encoded as spikes across input neurons. Through an iterative process utilizing STDP and homeostasis, the SNN learns to selectively spike for only the trained pattern. Experiments showed 100% accuracy in recognizing the single trained pattern. The authors then expanded the experiments to train the SNN on multiple patterns, analyzing how pattern similarity impacted recognition accuracy. They introduce classification metrics to evaluate performance and show accuracy declines as inter-pattern Hamming distance grows. With maximum distance, homeostasis fails and recognition degrades for some patterns. Overall, it is demonstrated that SNNs can learn spatial spike patterns using STDP and homeostasis, with recognition quality linked to pattern similarity defined by Hamming distances. The work could have application in areas like static image recognition or network traffic analysis by training SNNs to categorize spatial spike-encoded data.
