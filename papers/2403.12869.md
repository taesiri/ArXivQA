# [Regularization in Spider-Style Strategy Discovery and Schedule   Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12869)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Automatic theorem provers rely on schedules of diverse proving strategies to achieve good performance. However, constructing effective schedules is challenging. There has been little work exploring how well schedules generalize to unseen problems and what factors influence this.

Proposed Solution:
The authors adopt a pragmatic Spider-style approach to discover complementary proving strategies for the Vampire prover and construct schedules. They discover over 1000 targeted strategies optimized for individual problems and evaluate them on the FOF fragment of the TPTP library. 

To estimate future performance, the problems are randomly split into train/test sets. Schedules are constructed on the train set using a proposed greedy algorithm and evaluated on the test set. Several regularization techniques are introduced that modify the greedy algorithm to improve test performance, possibly at the cost of train performance.

Main Contributions:

- Outline a pragmatic greedy schedule construction algorithm that competes with optimal approaches but runs in polynomial time 

- Systematically explore regularization techniques like temporal reward adjustment, diminishing rewards, slack allocation to improve generalization

- Demonstrate the surprising strength and adaptability of greedy schedules reinforced by regularization, allowing them to outperform optimal schedules

- Establish insights like the tendency of schedules to overfit with increased budgets, the ease of constructing CASC-competitive schedules

- Perform large-scale experiments over 20 days on 120 cores analyzing 1000+ Vampire strategies on the FOF TPTP fragment

The simple and quick greedy algorithm combined with the regularization techniques provides an effective solution for schedule construction that generalizes well. The computational efficiency also enables extensive experimentation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The authors conduct a large-scale experiment with discovering and scheduling strategies for the Vampire theorem prover, proposing several techniques to improve generalization of schedules to unseen problems and finding that a simple greedy algorithm can compete with optimal approaches in schedule quality while being much faster.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Outlining a pragmatic approach to schedule construction that uses a greedy algorithm, contrasting it with optimal schedules in terms of quality and computational resources required. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of the greedy approach for datasets similar to the one used in the paper. 

2. Introducing a range of regularization techniques aimed at improving the robustness of schedules on unseen data. To the authors' knowledge, this represents the first systematic exploration into regularization of strategy schedules.

3. Making the strategy discovery and evaluation data set available online to facilitate further research on the paper's topic.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing a greedy scheduling algorithm, exploring regularization techniques for schedules, and releasing a dataset to enable further research. The greedy algorithm is shown to be effective and allow regularization, while optimal scheduling is computationally demanding. This represents the first work on systematically regularizing schedules to improve generalization.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a greedy algorithm for schedule construction. How does this algorithm differ from existing approaches for optimal schedule construction using mixed integer programming? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The paper introduces several regularization techniques like slack, temporal reward adjustment and diminishing problem rewards. How do these techniques improve generalization performance on unseen problems? What is the intuition behind why they work? 

3. The paper evaluates the greedy algorithm and regularization techniques extensively. What other scenarios could be used to evaluate them? For example, using different theorem provers, benchmark libraries or even completely different domains like SAT solving.  

4. Temporal reward adjustment seems to be the most effective regularization technique. Why does raising the problem reward exponent help improve generalization? Is there an optimal value for the exponent? How does it interact with the time budget?

5. The paper splits problems randomly into train and test sets. What other data splits could reveal interesting aspects of the method? For example, splitting by problem features or splitting temporally as more strategies are discovered over time.

6. Parsing time is ignored during evaluation by assuming it is zero. In reality it can be significant. What are good ways to incorporate parsing time while still allowing fair evaluation across strategies?  

7. The random probing phase biases sampling towards lower time limits using the Luby sequence. How critical is this? Could a uniform distribution over all limits work just as well? What problems may arise?

8. Strategies aim to solve a single training problem well during discovery. Does the preference for default values in optimization help significantly with generalization? Are certain key options more important to keep default?

9. The paper construction one monolithic schedule. What are the tradeoffs of constructing specialized schedules for problem subgroups instead? How should the subgroups be formed? What problems may arise?

10. The schedule construction algorithms seem quite dependent on the pool of strategies discovered initially. What properties should this pool of strategies satisfy? How can the discovery process be improved to construct better pools systematically?
