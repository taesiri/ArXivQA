# [AutoAD: Movie Description in Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16899)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an automatic audio description (AD) model that generates high quality descriptions of movies in a contextualized way?Specifically, the paper aims to address the following key challenges in movie AD generation:1. Movie AD is heavily dependent on context - visual context from the movie frames, previous AD context, and subtitle context. How can an AD model effectively leverage these different types of context?2. There is a lack of large-scale training data for movie AD generation. How can the model be trained when some types of data (e.g. visual frames) are missing or limited? 3. Existing movie AD datasets contain noise and errors. How can higher quality training data be obtained?To address these challenges, the main hypothesis is that an effective movie AD model can be developed by:1. Incorporating visual, previous AD and subtitle context using foundation models like GPT and CLIP.2. Pretraining components of the model on partial data where certain types of data may be missing.3. Creating higher quality AD datasets by cleaning existing ones and collecting new narrations.The paper presents an AutoAD model pipeline and experiments that aim to validate this hypothesis and show improved movie AD generation capabilities over previous approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing an automatic Audio Description (AD) model called AutoAD that can generate high-quality text descriptions for movies to aid the visually impaired. The key aspects are:- Incorporating various types of context into the model, including visual context from movie frames, textual context from previous AD sentences, and context from subtitles. This allows the model to generate more coherent and story-following descriptions.- Addressing the lack of training data by pretraining components of the model (e.g. visual encoder, language model) on large datasets where only partial data is available. For example, pretraining the language model on text-only AD data.- Creating a cleaned version of the existing Movie Audio Description (MAD) dataset called MAD-v2 by removing label noise and adding character names. This improves results when training on MAD.- Achieving strong audio description generation results compared to prior works, even zero-shot on some datasets, highlighting the benefits of leveraging context and pretraining.In summary, the main contribution is developing an end-to-end pipeline (AutoAD) to automatically generate high-quality and context-aware audio descriptions for movies to help the visually impaired, enabled by effectively incorporating various contextual signals and pretraining strategies.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes an automatic audio description (AD) model called AutoAD that generates movie descriptions by incorporating visual, subtitle, and previous AD context through adapters bridging frozen CLIP and GPT models; it also provides new training data by cleaning the MAD dataset annotations and collecting a large text-only AD dataset from AudioVault.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on movie audio description:- It focuses specifically on generating audio descriptions for movies in a fully automatic way, whereas much prior work has focused on generating descriptions for shorter video clips or images. The movie domain brings additional challenges like needing longer-term context.- The method incorporates multiple forms of context that are important for coherent movie audio description - visual context from multiple frames, previous audio description text, and movie subtitles/dialogue. Prior work on video/image description typically only uses visual context. - It deals with the lack of large-scale movie AD training data in an innovative way - by pretraining components of the model (e.g. the text generation module) on related large datasets where some modalities are missing, like text-only AD data.- The model achieves strong results on movie AD generation, outperforming prior methods that adapted image/video captioning models. The zero-shot performance on the LSMDC benchmark is also competitive with the state-of-the-art.- The paper also makes contributions on the dataset side, by proposing an improved AD collection pipeline and releasing a cleaned version of the MAD dataset, as well as a large new text-only AD dataset.Overall, this paper pushes forward movie audio description research significantly. The model architecture and pretraining strategies seem promising for this low-data domain. The contextual modeling and integration of subtitles/dialogue also captures more of the richness of movies versus standard video captioning. The datasets collected will likely benefit future research too.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:- Character naming - Referring to "who" is doing "what" is necessary for story-coherent movie audio description (AD), but the current model struggles with accurately identifying characters. Future work could focus on improving character recognition and naming. - Determining when to generate AD - Currently the model relies on annotated AD timestamps. Future work could look into automatically determining when to generate AD narration based on the movie frames and audio, rather than relying on timestamps.- Incorporating speaker identities in subtitles - The subtitles used currently don't contain speaker identities, which makes it difficult for the model to determine which character spoke each line. Incorporating speaker information could help the model better utilize the contextual information from subtitles.- Long-range dependencies - The current model is limited in its capability to process long context sequences. Exploring different model architectures or pretraining procedures to better capture long-range dependencies in movies could be beneficial.- Additional modalities - The current model uses visual frames and audio transcripts. Incorporating other modalities like audio or face features could provide additional contextual signals. - Controllable generation - Allowing more explicit control over the generated AD narration through attributes like length, verbosity, style etc could make the model more adaptable.In summary, the main suggested future directions are around improving character grounding, incorporating more context modalities, capturing long-range dependencies, and controllable generation to make the model more robust and useful for real-world movie AD generation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes an automatic audio description (AD) model called AutoAD for generating descriptions of movies to aid the visually impaired. Generating high-quality movie AD is challenging due to the dependency on context and limited training data. The AutoAD model incorporates context from the movie clip, previous AD, and subtitles, and addresses the lack of training data by pretraining on large-scale datasets without visual/contextual information. The authors also improve the MAD dataset by removing label noise and adding character names. They leverage the strength of pretrained models like GPT and CLIP by using a lightweight mapping network to integrate them. Experiments demonstrate strong AD generation, with ablations showing the benefit of using context. Comparisons to prior works highlight the improvements, and the model achieves competitive results on the LSMDC benchmark without any paired training data. The key ideas are incorporating context, pretraining with partial data, cleaning the MAD dataset, and effectively integrating pretrained models like CLIP and GPT.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a model called AutoAD for automatically generating audio descriptions for movies. Audio descriptions provide narration of visual elements in a movie to aid visually impaired audiences in following the story. Generating high-quality audio descriptions is challenging because the descriptions depend heavily on context from the movie's visuals, previous scenes, and dialogue. The paper makes several contributions to address these challenges:First, the proposed AutoAD model incorporates contextual information from multiple sources to generate better descriptions. This includes visual context from multiple frames in the current clip, previous audio description text, and movie subtitles. Second, the authors address the lack of training data by pretraining components of AutoAD on other large datasets - using text-only movie audio descriptions or visual captioning datasets. Third, the authors collect and clean two new datasets to support training their model: a denoised version of the existing MAD dataset, and a new large text-only audio description dataset called AudioVault. Finally, experiments demonstrate AutoAD can generate coherent and accurate audio descriptions on movies, outperforming previous methods. The model is also competitive on the LSMDC movie description benchmark, even without using the LSMDC training data.In summary, this paper makes contributions in architectural design, pretraining strategies, and dataset collection to advance the challenging task of automatic movie audio description generation conditioned on contextual information. The AutoAD model shows promising results on generating descriptions that aid story understanding for the visually impaired.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes an automatic audio description (AD) generation model named AutoAD for generating descriptions of movies to aid the visually impaired. AutoAD consists of frozen pretrained vision (CLIP) and language (GPT) models connected by a lightweight mapping network. It incorporates both visual context from movie frames as well as textual context from previous generated AD sentences and movie subtitles. Specifically, visual features from CLIP are passed through a mapping network to obtain prompt vectors that prime the GPT language model. The previous ground-truth or generated AD sentences are formatted with special tokens and also fed directly as prompts into GPT. The model is trained to generate the next AD sentence by conditioning on this multimodal context using a standard language modeling loss. To overcome the lack of abundant paired visual-text AD data, components of AutoAD are pretrained on other large datasets - the vision modules on image caption data and the language module on text-only AD data. The method is evaluated on existing benchmarks and shows promising results for automatic AD generation.
