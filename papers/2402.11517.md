# [Knowledge-to-SQL: Enhancing SQL Generation with Data Expert LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11517)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating accurate SQL queries from natural language questions (text-to-SQL) is challenging as it requires comprehending the question, database schema, and retrieving accurate data. Existing models rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate SQL, but may fail on queries requiring specialized knowledge not explicitly in the database. This reduces robustness of text-to-SQL models.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Knowledge-to-SQL framework that employs a tailored Data Expert LLM (DELLM) to provide helpful expert knowledge to enhance text-to-SQL models. DELLM has a table reading component to select relevant tables and is fine-tuned to generate specialized knowledge. A reinforcement learning strategy called RLDBF provides rewards to DELLM based on the accuracy of retrieved data and generated SQL.

Key Contributions:

- Highlights the significance of incorporating expert knowledge for robust text-to-SQL performance.
- Proposes Knowledge-to-SQL pipeline with specialized DELLM to automatically generate expert knowledge.
- DELLM has customized design and training strategies including table reading, fine-tuning, and RLDBF.  
- RLDBF rewards DELLM based on data retrieval accuracy and SQL generation quality.
- Experiments show DELLM enhances state-of-the-art text-to-SQL models on Bird and Spider datasets.
- Releases DELLM model and code to advance research.

In summary, the key idea is to automatically generate expert knowledge using a tailored DELLM to make text-to-SQL models more robust, especially for queries requiring specialized domain knowledge. Rigorous experiments demonstrate the ability of DELLM to enhance existing text-to-SQL methods.
