# [Goal-Oriented End-User Programming of Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13988)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing end-user programming (EUP) tools for robots require users to specify detailed action sequences, lacking flexibility to allow users to choose the level of task detail they wish to express. This limits the ability for users like caregivers to leverage robot autonomy. Goals are an alternative building block for robot programs that allow flexibility, but goal-oriented programming requires ensuring user expectations match robot performance.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose Polaris, a novel goal-oriented EUP system where users create "goal automata" by connecting goals (representing desired world states) into a flow diagram. An off-the-shelf AI planner then generates a detailed branching plan to achieve the goals. To validate plans match user intent, Polaris includes a Plan Visualizer to display the plan for inspection and iteration before execution. 

Contributions:
1) Systems: The Polaris system contribution representing the authors' vision of flexible yet reliable goal-oriented EUP.

2) Empirical: An evaluation showing the Plan Visualizer improves plan quality, matches user expectations of robot behavior, and enhances usability and perceived robot competence.

3) Design: Implications emerged including the criticality of plan feedback in goal-oriented EUP, not presuming users can leverage flexibility, and carefully selecting study participants based on robot familiarity which strongly predicts tool perceptions/use.

Overall, Polaris challenges existing action-oriented EUP paradigms by demonstrating goals as a flexible yet reliable building block for robot programs. The paper makes both systems and empirical contributions evaluating goal-oriented EUP and extracting design implications for the community.
