# [Goal-Oriented End-User Programming of Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13988)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing end-user programming (EUP) tools for robots require users to specify detailed action sequences, lacking flexibility to allow users to choose the level of task detail they wish to express. This limits the ability for users like caregivers to leverage robot autonomy. Goals are an alternative building block for robot programs that allow flexibility, but goal-oriented programming requires ensuring user expectations match robot performance.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose Polaris, a novel goal-oriented EUP system where users create "goal automata" by connecting goals (representing desired world states) into a flow diagram. An off-the-shelf AI planner then generates a detailed branching plan to achieve the goals. To validate plans match user intent, Polaris includes a Plan Visualizer to display the plan for inspection and iteration before execution. 

Contributions:
1) Systems: The Polaris system contribution representing the authors' vision of flexible yet reliable goal-oriented EUP.

2) Empirical: An evaluation showing the Plan Visualizer improves plan quality, matches user expectations of robot behavior, and enhances usability and perceived robot competence.

3) Design: Implications emerged including the criticality of plan feedback in goal-oriented EUP, not presuming users can leverage flexibility, and carefully selecting study participants based on robot familiarity which strongly predicts tool perceptions/use.

Overall, Polaris challenges existing action-oriented EUP paradigms by demonstrating goals as a flexible yet reliable building block for robot programs. The paper makes both systems and empirical contributions evaluating goal-oriented EUP and extracting design implications for the community.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Polaris, a novel goal-oriented end-user programming system for robots that includes a plan visualizer to improve program quality and match user expectations by exposing the automatically generated plan to the user before execution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contribution of this paper is the Polaris system, a novel goal-oriented end-user programming (EUP) tool that allows users to specify robot programs in terms of goal predicates rather than sequences of actions. The key ideas behind Polaris are:

1) It provides flexibility for users to choose the level of detail they want to specify - they can provide high-level goals and let the robot fill in details through automated planning, or constrain the robot with more lower-level details if desired. 

2) It includes a Plan Visualizer interface that displays the robot's automatically generated plan to the user before execution. This aims to match user expectations to actual robot behavior.

3) It is evaluated in a 32-participant user study comparing the full Polaris system to an ablated baseline without the Plan Visualizer. Results provide evidence that the Plan Visualizer improves plan quality and matches user expectations better.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel Polaris goal-oriented EUP system itself, including the flexibility it provides to users, the Plan Visualizer interface, and the initial evaluation of the system. The paper also provides some design implications for future EUP tools based on the study results.

The paper presents a novel end-user programming system called Polaris that allows users to specify programs for robots using goal predicates and goal automata rather than sequences of actions. Key features include the plan visualizer for providing feedback to users on the robot's automatically generated plans, the flexibility for users to specify programs at varying levels of detail, and the study evaluating the system in a tidying scenario. The keywords cover the main topics and contributions around developing and evaluating this goal-oriented approach to robot end-user programming.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel goal-oriented end-user programming (EUP) system called Polaris. What are some key advantages of a goal-oriented approach over traditional action-oriented EUP systems? How does this increased flexibility benefit end users?

2. Polaris uses goal predicates as the fundamental building blocks for robot programs. What is the formal definition of a goal predicate? How does Polaris represent goal automata and what are the key elements (checkpoints, transitions, etc.)?

3. The paper mentions that Polaris leverages an off-the-shelf planner to create branching plans. What constraints must be satisfied when mapping goal automata to branching plans? Explain the mapping function and constraints in detail. 

4. What is the purpose of the Plan Visualizer component in Polaris? How does it provide feedback to end users on the robot's plan? Explain the intended workflow and how users can iterate on their goal automata.

5. During plan execution, the paper mentions that Polaris enters a feedback-execution loop with the robot. Explain this process in detail - how are actions converted to goals, how does the robot re-plan, and how is the loop closed?

6. The user study compares the full Polaris system (with Plan Visualizer) to an ablated baseline without the visualizer. What were the key hypotheses being tested about the impact of the Plan Visualizer? Explain each one.  

7. Analyze and discuss the user study results in depth as they pertain to the hypotheses and effectiveness of the Plan Visualizer. Were the hypotheses fully supported statistically? What can be concluded?

8. The paper provides several design implications based on the user study findings. Pick one and analyze it in greater detail - provide underlying evidence and discuss the recommendation proposed for EUP tools.  

9. The limitations of the Polaris system are discussed at the end of the paper. Choose two limitations and for each, explain the issue, its implications on real-world usage, and how it can be addressed in future work.

10. The paper focuses on a systems-level evaluation of Polaris, but mentions plans for future component-level testing. Explain the difference between these two types of evaluations and discuss in detail what kinds of component-level testing would be useful to conduct.
