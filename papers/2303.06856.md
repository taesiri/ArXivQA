# [Dynamic Neural Network for Multi-Task Learning Searching across Diverse   Network Topologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06856)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:

How to design an MTL framework that can search for optimized network structures tailored to each individual task across diverse graph topologies in a single network? 

The paper proposes a new MTL framework to address two key challenges:

1) Searching across diverse graph topologies: The paper applies DAG structure to allow searching across diverse topologies. However, DAG-based search space is too large for MTL. 

2) Constructing task-specific sub-networks: Existing MTL methods using DNN or NAS cannot find optimal structures for each task. They use simple/restricted topologies which may degrade performance in heterogeneous MTL scenarios.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes:

- A restricted DAG-based central network with read-in/out layers to enable topology search while limiting search space. 

- A training procedure and algorithms to optimize the central network into compact task-specific sub-networks.

The central hypothesis is that by searching across broader graph topologies and optimizing task-specific structures, the proposed MTL framework can achieve better performance compared to prior MTL methods. Experiments on benchmark datasets verify this hypothesis.

In summary, the core research question is how to design an MTL framework that can search across diverse topologies to find optimized task-specific structures in a scalable way. The paper aims to address the limitations of prior MTL methods in this aspect.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

- It presents the first MTL framework that searches for both task-adaptive structures and sharing patterns among tasks. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on all evaluated public MTL datasets.

- It proposes a new DAG-based central network composed of a flow restriction scheme and read-in/out layers. This allows searching across diverse graph topologies in a reasonably restricted search space. 

- It introduces a new training procedure that optimizes the MTL framework to compactly construct various task-specific sub-networks in a single network.

- Key components proposed include:
  - Flow restriction to reduce search space while maintaining topology diversity
  - Read-in/out layers to enable polytree structures and early exiting
  - Three stage training procedure with squeeze loss and flow-based reduction 
  - Flow-based reduction algorithm to prune unimportant connections

In summary, the main contribution is a novel MTL framework that can search for optimal task-specific structures across diverse topologies in an efficient manner, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods. The proposed components help restrict the search space, construct compact networks, and achieve strong performance across MTL benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new multi-task learning framework that searches for optimized task-specific neural network structures across diverse topologies in a single network, achieving state-of-the-art performance by dynamically controlling feature sharing.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in multi-task learning:

- It proposes a new framework for searching optimal network structures tailored to each task, rather than using a shared network or fixed branching/selection of modules like other works. This allows more flexibility and potential to handle heterogeneous tasks.

- It uses a DAG-based architecture search space, which is common in NAS but novel for MTL. The flow restriction scheme makes this feasible for MTL while still allowing diverse topologies.

- Most prior MTL NAS methods only search over fixed cells or blocks. This searches broader network-level architectures.

- It introduces a new training process with warm-up, search, and fine-tuning stages. The proposed squeeze loss and flow-based reduction algorithm help create compact final task networks.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art results on common MTL benchmarks compared to both static and other NAS-based methods. The analyses provide insights into task relationships and resource needs.

- Overall, it pushes MTL NAS to search more flexible architectures instead of just module selection/connectivity patterns. The innovations in search space design, training process, and network optimization enable this advancement for improved MTL performance.

In summary, the key novelties are in using DAG search for MTL, the broader graph topology search, and associated techniques to make this feasible and effective. The results demonstrate improved performance and ability to handle heterogeneous tasks versus prior works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring more complex and diverse graph topologies for task-adaptive sub-networks, beyond the restricted DAG-based search space proposed in this work. The authors mention that their flow-restriction scheme sacrifices some diversity and capacity of possible network topologies. Removing this restriction or expanding the search space could allow finding further optimized structures.

- Searching for both macro-architecture (overall topology) and micro-architecture (layer design) simultaneously. This paper focused only on optimizing the macro-architecture topology, while using fixed layer design (e.g. conv layers). Jointly optimizing both could lead to further gains.

- Applying the proposed methods to other application domains beyond the vision tasks explored in this paper. The authors demonstrate results on image classification, segmentation, depth estimation etc. Applying similar idea to search for task-specific topologies in other domains like NLP could be an interesting direction.

- Investigating other techniques to control model size and reduce parameters, in addition to the flow-based pruning method proposed here. Continuing to improve compactness of the overall shared model could further increase applicability.

- Exploring different training and search algorithms beyond the three-stage approach used here. The authors note their method inherits limitations of existing NAS approaches. Advances in efficient search and optimization could enhance performance.

- Validating the approach on larger-scale and more complex multi-task learning scenarios. The experiments used fairly small datasets and task combinations. Testing how well the methods scale is important future work.

In summary, the main directions pointed out are expanding the architectural search space, applying to new domains and tasks, improving training efficiency, and enhancing model compactness. Advancing those aspects could build on the solid MTL framework introduced in this paper.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new multi-task learning (MTL) framework that searches for optimized neural network structures tailored to each task across diverse graph topologies. The key idea is to use a restricted DAG-based central network with read-in/read-out layers that allows searching across diverse topologies while limiting the search space. The framework optimizes this central network to have compact task-adaptive sub-networks using a 3-stage training procedure: warm-up, search, and fine-tuning. In the search stage, a squeeze loss limits the model parameters and a flow-based reduction algorithm prunes the network by removing low-importance operations. This results in a single network that serves as multiple task-specific networks, each with a unique structure optimized for its task. Experiments on benchmark MTL datasets show the framework successfully finds task-adaptive topologies and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Analyses also validate the effectiveness of the proposed components like the flow-restriction scheme and training procedure.

In summary, the key contributions are: 1) An MTL framework that jointly searches for task-adaptive structures and sharing patterns, achieving state-of-the-art performance. 2) A restricted DAG-based central network with read-in/out layers that enables topology search across diverse graphs. 3) A training procedure with squeeze loss and flow-based reduction that optimizes for compact task-specific sub-networks. The experiments demonstrate improved performance and efficiency in constructing task-optimized networks compared to prior MTL methods.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points from the introduction are:

- Multi-task learning (MTL) can improve generalization performance and reduce parameters by sharing representations across tasks. However, negative transfer can occur when sharing between less related tasks.

- Recent works use dynamic neural networks to construct task-adaptive networks and control the ratio of shared parameters. But they focus on simple branching patterns and ratios, using restricted search spaces like cells. 

- This limits performance in heterogeneous MTL with unbalanced task complexity. The authors aim to search optimized structures across more diverse topologies to address this.

- Applying MTL to the DAG NAS search space causes scalability issues with quadratic growth of parameters/search time. 

- They propose a restricted DAG-based central network and training procedure to enable searching diverse topologies while limiting search space/time.

So in summary, the key question is how to enable MTL to search for task-specific structures across diverse topologies, while still limiting the search space for efficiency. This aims to improve performance on heterogeneous MTL by finding optimized structures for each task's complexity.
