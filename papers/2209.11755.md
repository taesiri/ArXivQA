# [Promptagator: Few-shot Dense Retrieval From 8 Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11755)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to create effective retrieval systems for diverse tasks with only a few examples, instead of requiring a large amount of supervised training data. 

The key ideas and hypotheses are:

- Different retrieval tasks have distinct search intents and query distributions. It is difficult for models trained on one dataset like MS MARCO to generalize well to other tasks.

- With just a few annotated examples and task descriptions, humans can understand a new retrieval task. The paper proposes a "few-shot retrieval" setting where models are provided with a few examples per task.

- Language models can be prompted to generate high-quality queries from just a few examples, amplifying the information contained in the few shots. This allows creating task-specific training data.

- Consistency filtering using only generated data is sufficient to improve the quality of the synthesized training data in the few-shot setting.

- The synthetic data can be used to train simple but efficient end-to-end neural retriever models that outperform prior work relying on external datasets like MS MARCO.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that task-specific neural retrievers can be synthesized using only a few examples and language model prompting, without requiring external training data. The paper aims to demonstrate this can achieve better accuracy compared to prior transfer learning approaches that use other datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Promptagator, a method for few-shot dense retrieval. The key ideas are:

- Proposing a new few-shot retrieval setting, where each task comes with a short description and a few annotated examples. This sets up retrieval as a more realistic few-shot learning problem.

- Using large language models (LLMs) like FLAN for prompt-based query generation from just a few examples per task. This amplifies the few examples into a large training set of synthetic queries and passages.

- Developing a round-trip consistency filtering technique using only the generated queries and passages, without needing external QA data. This is shown to significantly improve retrieval performance.

- Showing for the first time that prompted LLMs can create high-quality and efficient end-to-end neural retrievers from just a few examples per task. Without using any MS MARCO or Natural Questions training data, Promptagator outperforms prior work by over 1.2 nDCG on BEIR.

So in summary, the main contribution is advancing few-shot learning for information retrieval by generating synthetic training data from prompts and showing this can work much better than prior transfer learning approaches. The power of LLMs is leveraged to create customized retrievers from limited supervision.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes Promptagator, a method for few-shot dense retrieval that uses a large language model to generate synthetic training data from just a few examples. The key ideas are to use prompting and the generalization ability of large LMs like FLAN to amplify a few examples into much more training data, and to filter the synthetic data for consistency. Experiments show Promptagator significantly outperforms prior work despite using only 8 examples, demonstrating the potential of few-shot retrieval with large LMs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents an approach for few-shot dense retrieval by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data from just a few examples. Here are some key comparisons to other related work:

- Most prior work on dense retrieval relies on large amounts of annotated training data from datasets like MS MARCO or Natural Questions. This paper shows that with a good prompt and LLM like FLAN, high quality retrievers can be produced using just 8 or fewer examples. 

- Other work has explored using LLMs like T5 or GPT-3 for query generation, but mainly for re-ranking after an initial retrieval step. This paper shows LLMs can be effectively used to create end-to-end neural retrievers.

- Techniques like hard negative mining and distillation are commonly used to improve neural retrievers. This paper presents a simpler training recipe without those components, showing the synthetic data alone provides a strong training signal.

- Retrieval architectures like ColBERT and SPLADE incorporate cross-attention layers to enable token-level interaction. The dual encoders trained in this work use standard independent encoders without that inductive bias, yet reach higher accuracy thanks to the synthetic data.

- Compared to other few-shot NLP techniques that fine-tune LLMs, this work uses LLMs in a zero-shot prompt-based manner without any fine-tuning. This makes the approach quite efficient.

- The round-trip consistency filtering technique is tailored to the retrieval scenario, unlike prior work that uses a separate pre-trained model. Filtering only with synthetically generated data is shown to be effective.

In summary, this work pushes the boundary on few-shot learning for information retrieval by showing that large pre-trained LLMs can effectively turn a few examples into high quality, task-specific training data for an end-to-end neural retriever. The simplicity of the overall approach is quite notable given the significant accuracy gains demonstrated.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigate exactly how much generated query-document data is needed for each task, or how to use the generated examples more efficiently. The paper mentions they have not yet explored these questions thoroughly.

- Further analyze the sensitivity of the final retriever's performance to the prompt design. The authors suggest prompting is important but more analysis is needed on how variations in prompting impact results. 

- Connect Promptagator to knowledge distillation research. The authors suggest analyzing the headroom and better understanding how knowledge can be transferred from large language models to retrievers.

- Push the limits of few-shot retrieval further, towards systems that can seamlessly adapt to new tasks with minimal examples. The authors advocate this as an important research direction.

- Study if consistency filtering can be improved by using query-specific filtering thresholds instead of a single global threshold. This may help retain more high-quality examples.

- Analyze the generated data and model outputs more thoroughly through qualitative analysis. The authors did some of this but suggest more analysis would be useful.

- Consider modifying the training procedure so fewer examples are needed. The authors used up to 8 examples but suggest further research could aim to reduce this.

So in summary, the main future directions are improving prompt design, generated data efficiency, knowledge distillation connections, qualitative analysis, reducing the number of examples needed, and continuing to push the limits of few-shot learning for retrieval. The authors propose Promptagator as a step in this direction but suggest significant room for future work remains.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Promptagator for few-shot dense retrieval. The key idea is to leverage large language models like FLAN to generate synthetic training data from just a few examples, instead of relying on large manually labeled datasets. Specifically, Promptagator takes a few annotated query-document pairs as prompts to generate many more synthetic examples by applying the prompt to all documents. It uses prompt engineering to create task-specific instructions. The automatically generated queries are filtered using round-trip consistency to improve quality. Promptagator trains an efficient dual encoder retriever on this synthetic data. Surprisingly, with just 8 examples, Promptagator can outperform recent systems trained on 500k examples from MS MARCO, like ColBERT v2 and SPLADE v2, by over 1.2 nDCG on average across 11 BEIR datasets. Further reranking gives another 5 point nDCG gain. The results show that prompting large LMs can produce high-quality synthetic training data to create accurate and efficient task-specific retrievers from minimal supervision.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Promptagator, a method for few-shot dense retrieval. The key idea is to use a large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic training data from just a few examples of query-document pairs for a target retrieval task. The LLM is prompted with a task description and few examples to generate many more queries conditioned on the target documents. This allows creating task-specific training data from limited supervision. The synthetic data is filtered to remove ambiguous and irrelevant queries using a round-trip consistency criteria with an initial retriever trained on the synthetic data. The filtered synthetic data is then used to train a dual encoder retriever and cross-attention reranker. 

Experiments on 11 datasets from the BEIR benchmark show Promptagator significantly outperforms prior retrievers trained on MS MARCO or Natural Questions. With just 8 examples, the Promptagator dual encoder outperforms ColBERT v2 and SPLADEv2 trained on 500k+ examples on MS MARCO, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-generated training data. Adding the Promptagator++ reranker brings further gains. Promptagator shows the potential of few-shot learning for creating specialized retrievers adapted to new tasks without needing large training sets. The key insight is that LLMs can amplify a few examples into useful training signal when properly prompted.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Promptgator, a method for few-shot dense retrieval that leverages large language models (LLMs) as few-shot query generators. Given a short task description and a few annotated examples, Promptgator constructs an instruction prompt to provide context to the LLM about the task. The LLM then generates synthetic queries for documents in the target corpus, creating many query-document training pairs from just a few examples. To filter low-quality generated data, Promptgator trains an initial retriever on the synthetic data and keeps only query-document pairs where the document is ranked highly for the query. The filtered synthetic data is then used to train task-specific dual encoder retrievers and cross-attention rerankers. By prompting the LLM to generate high-quality retrieval training data from a few examples, Promptgator is able to create performant task-specific retrievers without relying on existing supervised data. The key insight is to amplify the signal from a small labeled set through large language model based data generation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of developing effective information retrieval systems that can generalize well across diverse tasks with minimal supervision. Specifically, it focuses on the setting of "Few-Shot Retrieval", where the goal is to quickly create a task-specific retriever using only a short description and a few annotated examples for the task. 

The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:

- It analyzes the differences across retrieval tasks in terms of search intent and query distribution, and argues that it is difficult to expect a single retriever trained on existing QA datasets like MS MARCO to perform well across different retrieval tasks.

- It proposes a new Few-Shot Retrieval setting/evaluation for the BEIR benchmark, where each task comes with a short description and 2-8 annotated query-document examples.

- It presents "Promptagator", a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as few-shot query generators to create task-specific training data from just a few examples. The synthetic queries better match the task's intent and distribution.

- It shows for the first time that with few-shot prompting, end-to-end neural retrievers can be trained to significantly outperform existing retrievers trained on large QA datasets. Promptagator outperforms ColBERT v2 and SPLADEv2 on 11 BEIR datasets.

- It demonstrates the importance of task-specific prompting and round-trip consistency filtering of the synthetic queries. The filtering uses a retriever trained only on the synthetic data.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that large language models can turn a few annotated examples into high-quality training data for an efficient neural retriever for that task, removing the need for large supervised datasets. This makes it feasible to quickly build accurate and efficient retrievers for diverse tasks.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Promptagator, a new approach for few-shot dense retrieval that can create effective task-specific retrievers using just a few annotated examples. The key idea is to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data from the few examples via prompting, rather than trying to train retrievers on the small data directly. Specifically, Promptagator constructs task-specific prompts with a short description and a few query-document examples sampled from the target task's data. It provides these prompts to a LLM (FLAN) to generate many on-task synthetic queries based on documents from the target corpus. To filter noisy examples, it trains an initial retriever on the synthetic data and keeps only examples where the document ranks highly for its query. The filtered synthetic data is then used to train an end-to-end neural retriever and reranker. Experiments on 11 BEIR datasets show Promptagator significantly outperforms retrievers trained on MARCO data. For example, with just 8 examples, Promptagator's models outperform ColBERT v2 and SPLADEv2 by over 1.2 average nDCG@10, demonstrating prompting LLMs is a promising approach for few-shot retrieval.
