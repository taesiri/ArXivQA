# [Visual Gyroscope: Combination of Deep Learning Features and Direct   Alignment for Panoramic Stabilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01461)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Estimating the 3D orientation (roll, pitch, yaw angles) of a camera from panoramic images is useful for autonomous navigation of drones and other robotic systems. 
- Existing methods either have limited accuracy (3-5 degrees error) or narrow convergence range. A method with both wide convergence range and high accuracy is needed.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a pipeline combining three complementary visual gyroscope (VG) methods:
  1) HoLiNet: A convolutional neural network that estimates roll and pitch from the detected horizon line. 
  2) Mixture of Photometric Potentials (MPP): Estimates yaw rotation to align images, has wide convergence range but lower accuracy.
  3) Photometric VG (PVG): Refines roll, pitch and yaw angles by directly aligning images, has high accuracy but narrow convergence range.

- HoLiNet provides initial estimates for roll and pitch.
- MPP aligns images to estimate yaw over a wide range of rotations.
- PVG then refines the roll, pitch and yaw angles by directly aligning the images photometrically.

- Together this combines the benefits of learning-based horizon detection, wide convergence through feature matching, and highly accurate direct alignment.

Contributions:
- Propose a novel pipeline combining neural network, feature-based and direct alignment methods for VG from 360 panoramas.
- Introduce HoLiNet, a convolutional neural network to detect horizon line and estimate roll/pitch.
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively (95.3% alignment success) and quantitatively (4.6 degree mean error) on two airborne panorama datasets.

The key novelty is in the combination of complementary VG approaches to get both wide convergence range and high accuracy orientation estimation from 360 panoramas for the first time.
