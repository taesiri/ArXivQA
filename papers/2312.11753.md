# [Poker Hand History File Format Specification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11753)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Poker is a popular game used in AI research to develop agents that can handle imperfect information. However, there is no standard format to record poker hands across different variants in a way that is human-readable, machine-friendly, and captures all necessary details about the hand. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the Poker Hand History (PHH) file format to standardize recording of poker hands. 
- PHH is based on the TOML format to leverage existing tooling and be easy for machines to parse. 
- It defines required and optional fields to describe all aspects of a poker hand, from game parameters to player actions to metadata. Required fields capture the core info to recreate the hand.
- An action notation is introduced to concisely log player actions and board changes. Cards use a 2-char shorthand indicating rank and suit.
- Support is included for 11 popular poker variants. The format is extensible to more variants.
- Over 10,000 sample hands in PHH format are provided across 11 variants to demonstrate flexibility.

Main Contributions:
- The PHH file format fills a gap by standardizing poker hand histories across variants in a human-readable and machine-friendly way.
- It is more concise than existing formats like PokerStars while capturing richer metadata.
- The specification provides detailed guidance for format usage and extensions.
- Open-source tooling can parse and utilize PHH file histories using the PokerKit library.
- PHH facilitates building poker AI agents, archiving hands, analyzing play, and creating teaching materials.
- Having a standard will accelerate poker AI research and enable more transparency.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel versatile PHH file format to represent poker hands that is human and machine friendly, accompanied by open-source tooling, real sample data spanning variants, and applications across poker research and tooling.
