# [Path-based Explanation for Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Path-based Explanation for Knowledge Graph Completion":

Problem:
- Knowledge graphs (KGs) store structured information about real-world entities and relations. However, they often suffer from incompleteness. 
- Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing links in KGs. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown effectiveness for KGC but their predictions lack transparency.  
- Existing KGC explanation methods produce subgraphs/triplets as explanations which are not interpretable by humans. The paper argues that paths can provide better user-friendly and interpretable explanations for KGC.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Power-Link", the first path-based explanation method for GNN-based KGC models. 
- It extracts a k-hop subgraph around the predicted entity pair and prunes noisy nodes.
- A "Triplet Edge Scorer" scores each edge based on entity, relation type and target triplet information.
- A novel simplified graph powering technique amplifies probabilities of explanatory edges. This parallelizable method avoids early training noise.
- Explanatory paths are generated based on the edge scores.

Contributions:
- First work on path-based explanations specifically for KGC to improve interpretability, sufficiency and scalability.
- Proposes simplified graph powering method to enforce paths which is highly parallelizable and memory-efficient.
- Introduces new metrics to quantitatively evaluate path-based explanations.
- Experiments show Power-Link outperforms subgraph-based methods in efficiency, scalability and human evaluation.

In summary, the paper presents a novel path-based explanation framework "Power-Link" for providing interpretable explanations for GNN-based KGC models. The simplified graph powering technique makes the method efficient and scalable. Quantitive analysis and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of Power-Link over state-of-the-art methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Power-Link, a novel path-based approach to generating explanations for knowledge graph completion models, which uses a simplified graph powering technique to efficiently identify influential paths supporting predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes Power-Link, the first path-based method to generate explanations for graph neural network (GNN) based knowledge graph completion (KGC) models. This fills an important research gap as existing KGC explanation methods rely on instances/subgraphs rather than paths. 

2. It designs a novel simplified graph-powering technique to amplify explanatory paths in the knowledge graph. This approach is highly parallelizable and has low memory cost, allowing easy scalability to large knowledge graphs.

3. It introduces three new evaluation metrics - Fidelity+, Fidelity-, and HΔR specifically for measuring the performance of path-based KGC explanation methods.

4. Extensive experiments show that Power-Link outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of interpretability, efficiency, and scalability of the generated explanations for GNN-based KGC models. Both quantitative metrics and human evaluation demonstrate the superiority.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the first scalable and interpretable path-based explanation method Power-Link for explaining GNN-based knowledge graph completion models. The novel graph-powering technique and specialized evaluation metrics are also key contributions.
