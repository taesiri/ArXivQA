# [Chain of Thought Explanation for Dialogue State Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04656)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Dialogue state tracking (DST) aims to track user goals and queries during conversations by maintaining slot-value pairs. 
- Around 40% of DST samples require multi-step reasoning across non-adjacent turns to determine slot values, posing a challenge for current methods.
- Experiments show existing models have limited performance on complex samples needing multi-step reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Chain-of-Thought Explanations (CoTE) in DST to improve reasoning ability. 
- CoTE-Coarse: Construct explanations by concatenating relevant non-consecutive turns that contribute to slot value changes.
- CoTE-Refined: Further refine the coarse explanations into more fluent narratives using GPT-3.
- CoTE variants produce slot values followed by corresponding reasoning explanations.

Main Contributions:
- Identify an important problem in DST - poor generalization on samples needing multi-step reasoning.
- Propose CoTE-Coarse and CoTE-Refined to address this limitation by incorporating reasoning explanations.  
- Design an interpretable evaluation framework for comprehensive DST analysis.
- Experiments show CoTE variants outperform baselines on complex samples and low-resource settings, validating their reasoning ability.
- CoTE-Refined achieves additional gains, indicating value of high-quality explanations.

In summary, the paper focuses on the challenge of multi-step reasoning in DST, and introduces explanation-based methods CoTE-Coarse and CoTE-Refined to enhance reasoning and generalization capabilities. Experiments demonstrate clear improvements on complex test cases.
