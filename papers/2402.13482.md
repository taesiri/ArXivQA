# [Retrieval-Augmented Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Domain Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13482)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing data augmentation methods for low-resource domain tasks rely solely on the limited seed data samples available. This results in generated samples that lack diversity.
- There are abundant external data sources that could be leveraged to increase diversity, but naively using them risks losing relevance to the target domain task.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Data Augmentation (RADA) framework that performs retrieval over external data pools to find relevant instances for augmentation.
- Leverage capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate new diverse samples based on contextual information from both original seed data and relevant retrieved external samples. 
- Flexibly construct LLM prompts for data generation using samples from seed data, retrieved data, or both for in-context learning examples and target task context.

Key Contributions:
- Identify limitation of existing augmentation methods in low-resource domains due to reliance on small seed dataset alone.
- Propose novel RADA framework to increase diversity by retrieving relevant external samples for LLM-powered augmentation. 
- Validate RADA effectiveness on multiple datasets, outperforming existing augmentation methods.
- Demonstrate dual benefit of RADA in leveraging external data for increased diversity while maintaining relevance through retrieval.
- Show promise for enhancing model performance on low-resource domain tasks where limited quality data is available.
