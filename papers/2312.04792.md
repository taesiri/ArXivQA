# [AI safety by debate via regret minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04792)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper considers the setting of AI safety via debate, where two AIs or human-AI teams debate questions before a human judge. They formulate this as a repeated general-sum game with a large strategy space representing all possible debate arguments. The key challenge is to efficiently minimize regret, which requires best-responding using an AI assistant modeled as an optimization oracle. They give an efficient algorithm based on follow-the-perturbed-leader that leverages a smooth optimization oracle to minimize internal regret. Under Gumbel noise and an approximate fixed point computation, the algorithm achieves sublinear internal regret. This also leads to convergence to an approximate correlated equilibrium when multiple players use this approach. The results characterize when regret can be efficiently minimized in debate games given different assumptions on the players' computational power. Overall, this provides a starting point for understanding the dynamics and equilibria that can arise when AI systems participate in debate games.
