# [FrozenRecon: Pose-free 3D Scene Reconstruction with Frozen Depth Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05733)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:How can we leverage the robustness of affine-invariant monocular depth estimation models to achieve high-quality 3D reconstruction on diverse real-world scenes, without requiring large amounts of training data or a complex optimization process? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Pre-trained affine-invariant monocular depth models (like LeReS) have captured useful geometric priors about scene geometry, even though their depth predictions are not metrically accurate.2) By "freezing" the weights of such a pre-trained depth model and optimizing only a small set of scale/shift parameters, we can align the depth predictions to be metrically consistent across frames and achieve robust 3D reconstruction.3) This approach will generalize better to diverse scenes compared to methods that require end-to-end training or optimizing a huge number of parameters, since it relies only on optimizing a sparse set of depth alignment parameters at test time.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging a frozen robust depth model plus light test-time optimization can enable high-quality monocular 3D reconstruction on diverse real-world scenes. The experiments aim to validate whether this approach actually works better than other end-to-end trained or heavily optimized alternatives.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a novel method for monocular 3D scene reconstruction that can robustly reconstruct diverse real-world scenes, even without access to ground truth poses or camera parameters during training. The main contributions are:- They propose a lightweight optimization pipeline that leverages the robustness of a pre-trained, affine-invariant monocular depth model like LeReS. Rather than fine-tuning the entire depth model, they freeze it and only optimize a small set of parameters (around 30 per frame) to adapt the depth to each new video, ensuring multi-view consistency.- They introduce a geometric consistency alignment module that can effectively rectify the affine-invariant depth maps predicted by LeReS to become metric and scale-consistent across frames. This involves global and local scale/shift alignment.- Their full method jointly optimizes for depth map rectification, camera intrinsics, and poses on each new video in a geometric consistency manner. Despite having only sparse optimization variables, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D reconstruction across multiple unseen datasets compared to prior works.- Experiments demonstrate their method's strong generalization across diverse scenes. It can robustly reconstruct challenging indoor and outdoor environments where previous learning-based and geometry-based approaches fail.In summary, the main contribution is a lightweight yet effective monocular reconstruction approach that transfers the robustness of a frozen pre-trained depth model to new scenarios by optimizing only a sparse set of parameters for each video. This yields state-of-the-art cross-dataset generalization.
