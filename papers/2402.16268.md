# [Foundation Model Transparency Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16268)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Foundation models like GPT-3 are emerging digital technologies with great capabilities but also risks. There is currently a lack of transparency around how they are developed and deployed, which can enable harms. This parallels the history of social media platforms, which initially had little transparency and enabled issues like privacy violations and misinformation. 

Solution - Foundation Model Transparency Reports:
The authors propose instituting "Foundation Model Transparency Reports" where companies provide recurring public disclosures around key aspects of their foundation models. This takes inspiration from "transparency reports" adopted by social media firms over the past 15 years to disclose data on government requests, content takedowns, etc.

The transparency reports would standardize reporting across foundation model developers to assist stakeholders in finding, analyzing and comparing information. They identify 6 principles: centralized, structured, contextualized, independently specified, standardized, and include methodologies. The reports would be organized using 100 indicators on model transparency previously identified by the authors.

The reports would span the full supply chain: upstream resources like data and compute used to build the model, properties of the model itself like size and training objectives, and downstream aspects like documentation to support responsible use.

Examples: 
The authors demonstrate constructing sample transparency report entries for different foundation models by stitching together current practices, showing both feasibility but also gaps to improve contextualization and measurement clarity.

Policy Alignment and Theory of Change:
The transparency report indicators substantially exceed current government requirements, showing the value reports could provide. Specific types of transparency like data and evaluation details can clarify model biases, enable scrutinizing labor practices, quantify compute usage to inform policy, etc. While transparency alone may not directly prevent harms, it enables the oversight needed to manage risks.

In summary, the paper puts forward Foundation Model Transparency Reports as a concrete methodology foundations model developers should adopt for recurring public reporting around their models. This parallels and builds on transparency reports adopted by social media platforms. The reports would standardize information provision to better assist stakeholders in assessing model risks and benefits.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Foundation Model Transparency Reports that standardize and structure the information foundation model developers should periodically publish to provide transparency into model development, evaluation, and deployment, drawing design principles from social media transparency reports while aligning with government transparency requirements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes the concept of Foundation Model Transparency Reports, which are structured, recurring reports that provide essential information about foundation models to improve transparency. This is inspired by and builds upon the transparency reporting practices that have emerged for social media platforms.

2) It shows how the proposed transparency reports align with emerging government policies related to AI transparency, demonstrating that transparency reports could help improve compliance across jurisdictions while also providing more precise requirements compared to current government policies.

3) It provides an example of what Foundation Model Transparency Reports might look like in practice, stitching together transparency information disclosed by various foundation model developers to date. This example surfaces best practices so far and also illustrates opportunities for more contextualization and methodological detail in future reports.

In summary, the paper introduces Foundation Model Transparency Reports as a mechanism to improve transparency in the foundation model ecosystem, demonstrates alignment with government policies, and gives a concrete example to guide developers in what constructing these reports might entail. The overall goal is to promote stronger norms and standards around transparency while the foundation model industry is still nascent.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Foundation models - The paper focuses on transparency reporting specifically for foundation models, which are a class of large language models that serve as a foundation for downstream tasks.

- Transparency reports - The main proposal of the paper is foundation model transparency reports, which are recurring public reports that consolidate essential information about foundation models. The paper draws inspiration from transparency reporting practices in social media.

- Design principles - The paper outlines 6 principles to guide the design of foundation model transparency reports: centralization, structure, contextualization, independent specification, standardization, and methodologies. 

- Indicators - The transparency reports are structured around 100 transparency indicators from the Foundation Model Transparency Index, spanning upstream resources, model properties, and downstream impacts.

- Policy alignment - The paper examines alignment between the 100 indicators and transparency requirements in 6 major government policies related to AI systems.

- Examples - The paper provides some examples of what transparency report entries might look like for different indicators, drawing on limited existing public disclosure practices.

In summary, the key focus is on institutionalizing transparency reporting for foundation models to provide essential information to stakeholders about these rapidly developing systems. The paper aims to guide developers and policymakers on implementing such reporting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes Foundation Model Transparency Reports as a way to improve transparency in the foundation model industry. How might the structure and standardization of these reports facilitate better analysis and comparison across foundation model developers? What specific benefits could this drive?

2. The authors identify 6 principles for effective transparency reporting. Which of these principles do you think is most important and why? Are there any additional principles you would suggest? 

3. The paper examines existing government policies related to AI transparency. What are the main gaps you see between these policies' requirements and the transparency indicators proposed for Foundation Model Transparency Reports? How might alignment between policies and transparency reports be improved?

4. Transparency reporting for social media platforms has received criticism regarding the potential costs, lack of validation, and use as marketing material. How might the authors' approach for foundation models address or avoid some of these pitfalls? Where do you still see risks?

5. The example transparency report entries provide a useful demonstration but lack contextualization and methodological detail in some cases. Can you suggest ways the authors could have enriched these examples to better meet their stated principles?

6. The authors connect transparency to objectives like public accountability and risk management. Of the specific transparency indicators included in the reports, which do you think are most vital for accountability? For risk management? Why?

7. Financial and adverse event reporting systems are discussed as references for designing transparency in AI. What particular aspects of these reporting systems could be useful to incorporate into transparency practices for foundation models?

8. How might the release of transparency reports impact the competitive dynamics between foundations model developers? Could transparency requirements raise barriers to entry for smaller organizations?

9. The paper focuses on transparency from developers to stakeholders, but how might transparency reports also assist communication between different stakeholder groups? What Role could governments play here?  

10. Transparency alone cannot fully address societal impacts of AI systems. What other mechanisms alongside transparency do you think are necessary to ensure foundation models benefit society? How might transparency reports connect with these other mechanisms?
