# [Foundation Model Transparency Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16268)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Foundation models like GPT-3 are emerging digital technologies with great capabilities but also risks. There is currently a lack of transparency around how they are developed and deployed, which can enable harms. This parallels the history of social media platforms, which initially had little transparency and enabled issues like privacy violations and misinformation. 

Solution - Foundation Model Transparency Reports:
The authors propose instituting "Foundation Model Transparency Reports" where companies provide recurring public disclosures around key aspects of their foundation models. This takes inspiration from "transparency reports" adopted by social media firms over the past 15 years to disclose data on government requests, content takedowns, etc.

The transparency reports would standardize reporting across foundation model developers to assist stakeholders in finding, analyzing and comparing information. They identify 6 principles: centralized, structured, contextualized, independently specified, standardized, and include methodologies. The reports would be organized using 100 indicators on model transparency previously identified by the authors.

The reports would span the full supply chain: upstream resources like data and compute used to build the model, properties of the model itself like size and training objectives, and downstream aspects like documentation to support responsible use.

Examples: 
The authors demonstrate constructing sample transparency report entries for different foundation models by stitching together current practices, showing both feasibility but also gaps to improve contextualization and measurement clarity.

Policy Alignment and Theory of Change:
The transparency report indicators substantially exceed current government requirements, showing the value reports could provide. Specific types of transparency like data and evaluation details can clarify model biases, enable scrutinizing labor practices, quantify compute usage to inform policy, etc. While transparency alone may not directly prevent harms, it enables the oversight needed to manage risks.

In summary, the paper puts forward Foundation Model Transparency Reports as a concrete methodology foundations model developers should adopt for recurring public reporting around their models. This parallels and builds on transparency reports adopted by social media platforms. The reports would standardize information provision to better assist stakeholders in assessing model risks and benefits.
