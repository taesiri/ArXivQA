# [Video Anomaly Detection and Explanation via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05702)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Video Anomaly Detection and Explanation via Large Language Models":

Problem:
- Conventional video anomaly detection (VAD) methods rely on predicting anomaly scores and manually selecting thresholds, making them not fully automatic. They also lack explainability on why events are detected as anomalies.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce video-based large language models (VLLMs) into VAD to make the model automatic without thresholds and able to provide textual explanations.
- Propose a Long-Term Context (LTC) module to enhance VLLMs' capability in modeling long-range video context that is critical for anomaly detection.  
- Design a 3-phase training method that improves efficiency by minimizing the need for VAD data and reducing costs of annotating instruction-tuning data.

Main Contributions:
1) A new VAD-LLaMA approach incorporating VLLMs for automatic and explainable VAD. 
2) A novel LTC module to improve long video representation for existing VLLMs.
3) An efficient 3-phase training method that adapts VLLMs to VAD using limited in-domain supervision.

The proposed VAD-LLaMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on VAD benchmarks UCF-Crime and TAD. It can localize anomalies in videos and provide textual explanations. The effectiveness of the model components and training method are validated empirically.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes VAD-LLaMA, a video anomaly detection approach that integrates video-based large language models to enable automatic anomaly detection and textual explanation of the reasons for detected anomalies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1) It proposes a new approach called VAD-LLaMA that introduces video-based large language models (VLLMs) into the framework of video anomaly detection (VAD). This makes the VAD model free from manually selecting thresholds and able to provide textual explanations for detected anomalies.

2) It develops a novel Long-Term Context (LTC) module to enhance the capability of existing VLLMs in modeling long-range video contexts, which is important for anomaly detection in long surveillance videos.  

3) It designs a three-phase training method that significantly improves the efficiency of training VLLMs on the VAD task by substantially minimizing the requirements for VAD data and lowering the costs of creating instruction-tuning data.

In summary, the key innovation is on equipping VLLMs for VAD to make the model automatic and explainable, and tailoring the training of VLLMs to adapt them to the VAD domain with limited domain-specific supervision.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Video anomaly detection (VAD): The main research problem being addressed, which involves identifying unexpected events in long surveillance videos. 

- Video-based large language models (VLLMs): The class of models that the authors incorporate into the VAD framework, such as Video-LLaMA, to make the detections explainable via generated text.

- Weakly supervised VAD (WSVAD): The learning paradigm used for training due to the lack of fine-grained anomaly labels, using only video-level labels indicating normal or abnormal.  

- Multiple instance learning (MIL): The common approach in WSVAD that distinguishes normal and abnormal clips based on video labels during training.

- Long-term context (LTC) module: A proposed module to enhance video representations by capturing normal and abnormal events over long time durations.

- Three-phase training: The proposed efficient training method that requires little VAD data and annotation effort, involving training the VADor, co-training it with LTC, and instruction-tuning.

In summary, the key ideas focus on adapting VLLMs for explainable VAD, overcoming their limitations in modeling long-range video context, and efficient training given scarce labeled anomaly data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 detailed questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a Long-Term Context (LTC) module to enhance the video representation ability of existing video-language models. How does this module specifically integrate long-term normal/abnormal video contexts into the feature representations?

2. The paper proposes a 3-phase training method. Can you walk through what happens in each training phase and what are the objectives? How do the techniques in different phases complement each other?  

3. The LTC module utilizes cross-attention to retrieve relevant contextual features from the normal/abnormal feature lists. What are the key and query vectors in this cross-attention, and how does attention help select useful contexts adaptive to the current clip?

4. Pseudo instructions are generated to create instruction-tuning data for the language model. What information is converted to generate these instructions and what simple text templates are used in combining the information?

5. Why does the method opt to only train the projection layer (adaptor) in the final phase rather than fine-tuning the entire model? What benefit does this bring?

6. The method incorporates samples from both VAD and general videos when training the adaptor. Why is this beneficial compared to using only VAD videos?

7. What are the two key challenges in adapting pre-trained video-language models to video anomaly detection? How does the proposed method aim to resolve them?

8. How does the proposed model detect anomalies in a video and provide explanations during inference? Walk through the pipeline starting from input to output.  

9. What assumptions does the weakly-supervised setting make about annotations available in the training data? How does the MIL learning objective handle such weak supervision?

10. The ablation studies analyze contributions of different components of LTC. What do the results suggest about importance of modeling normal, abnormal and short-term historical contexts?
