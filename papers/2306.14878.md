# [Restart Sampling for Improving Generative Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14878)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we design an improved sampling algorithm for generative models based on differential equations (such as diffusion models) that balances both sample quality and sampling speed?The paper specifically investigates the trade-offs between using ODE-based samplers, which are fast but plateau in performance, versus SDE-based samplers, which yield better quality but require more sampling time. The goal is to develop a sampler that harnesses the strengths of both approaches.
