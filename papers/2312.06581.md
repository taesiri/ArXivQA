# [Grokking Group Multiplication with Cosets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06581)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

In this paper, the authors use the group Fourier transform over the symmetric group S_n to reverse engineer the mechanism that a simple 1-layer neural network uses to perfectly learn the multiplication operation in the permutation groups S_5 and S_6. Through analysis in the Fourier domain, they discover that the network encodes information about subgroup coset memberships, which allow it to break down and simplify the multiplication task. Specifically, the network learns to store coset information about pairs of conjugate subgroups in the embedding layers. The linear layer then queries these embeddings and combines the coset membership information to determine the likely coset membership of the product permutation. Finally, in the unembedding layer, the identity of the product permutation is decoded based on satisfying the predicted coset memberships. The authors refer to this as the "coset circuit" used by the network. They rigorously validate that this circuit accounts for the model's performance through ablations and causal interventions. The paper discusses connections to spectral learning theory and challenges in communicating details of discovered neural mechanisms, using this as an exemplar case study where even simple networks can exhibit intricate emergent computations.
