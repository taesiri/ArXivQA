# [Assessing LLMs' Mathematical Reasoning in Financial Document Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11194)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but their ability for complex mathematical reasoning over semi-structured data like tables is uncertain. 
- Handling such tabular data is challenging as it requires multi-hop reasoning across multiple steps to connect information.
- Prior research hasn't explicitly explored LLMs' mathematical reasoning abilities on such hybrid text-table data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper conducts an extensive evaluation of LLMs on 4 financial tabular QA datasets which require numerical reasoning over tables.
- It provides both qualitative analysis to categorize error types and quantitative assessment of performance variations concerning factors like table complexity, reasoning steps etc.
- Based on the analysis, the paper introduces a novel prompting strategy called EEDP (Elicit->Extract->Decompose->Predict) tailored to semi-structured documents.

Key Contributions:
- Thorough multifaceted analysis giving nuanced insights into LLMs' strengths and weaknesses for tabular QA, especially mathematical reasoning.
- Identification of 3 main error categories - incorrect extraction, reasoning and calculation.
- Introduction of fine-grained dataset annotations concerning number of reasoning steps, question types, table size etc. 
- Proposal of EEDP prompting technique that matches or exceeds performance of other baselines while also providing transparency into model.

In summary, the paper advances the understanding of abilities and limitations of LLMs for mathematical reasoning over semi-structured data through rigorous experimentation. The analysis provides specific directions for future research to enhance LLMs for such hybrid text-table scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper evaluates large language models' capabilities for mathematical reasoning on financial tabular question answering datasets, finding strengths in natural language understanding but limitations with increasing numerical complexity, table intricacy, and reasoning steps, and proposes an improved prompting approach that matches or exceeds performance of other methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is a novel prompting technique called EEDP (Elicit -> Extract -> Decompose -> Predict) for assessing and improving large language models' (LLMs') ability to perform mathematical reasoning over semi-structured financial data. 

Specifically, the key aspects of the contribution are:

1) A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on tabular question answering for mathematical reasoning tasks using public financial datasets. This establishes performance benchmarks.

2) A detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis providing nuanced insights into LLMs' strengths and limitations on this task involving reasoning over tables. 

3) The EEDP prompting technique which matches or exceeds the performance of other prompting methods. EEDP explicitly prompts the model to elicit domain knowledge, extract evidence, decompose reasoning steps, and predict the final answer. This provides greater explainability into model weaknesses.

4) Analysis of model performance concerning factors like increasing table complexity, number of reasoning steps, etc. This further illuminates model capabilities and limitations.

In summary, the paper introduces and evaluates an innovative prompting approach to enhance and assess LLMs' mathematical reasoning over complex semi-structured data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new prompting strategy called EEDP. Can you explain in more detail what each component of EEDP stands for and what it aims to achieve in guiding the model? 

2. How does EEDP compare to other prompting strategies like PoT and decomposers in terms of performance and Computational cost? What are some key advantages and limitations?

3. The paper categorizes different types of errors made by models on numerical reasoning tasks. Can you elaborate on the error categories "Incorrect Extraction" and "Incorrect Reasoning" with examples of specific sub-types? 

4. What techniques does EEDP use to mitigate errors related to missing or wrong evidence extraction? How could these be further improved?  

5. The results show EEDP performs significantly better on complex datasets like Multihiertt. What particular characteristics of this dataset make reasoning difficult? How does EEDP help address these challenges?

6. Could the EEDP strategy be adapted to other domains beyond finance, such as scientific documents or medical records? What components would need customization?  

7. The paper analyzes performance trends concerning the number of reasoning steps. Why does accuracy decrease with more steps? How can prompt engineering help models handle multi-step inference?

8. What role does eliciting domain knowledge play in EEDP? Why is this an important capability for numerical reasoning over semi-structured data?
