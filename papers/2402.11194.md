# [Assessing LLMs' Mathematical Reasoning in Financial Document Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11194)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but their ability for complex mathematical reasoning over semi-structured data like tables is uncertain. 
- Handling such tabular data is challenging as it requires multi-hop reasoning across multiple steps to connect information.
- Prior research hasn't explicitly explored LLMs' mathematical reasoning abilities on such hybrid text-table data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper conducts an extensive evaluation of LLMs on 4 financial tabular QA datasets which require numerical reasoning over tables.
- It provides both qualitative analysis to categorize error types and quantitative assessment of performance variations concerning factors like table complexity, reasoning steps etc.
- Based on the analysis, the paper introduces a novel prompting strategy called EEDP (Elicit->Extract->Decompose->Predict) tailored to semi-structured documents.

Key Contributions:
- Thorough multifaceted analysis giving nuanced insights into LLMs' strengths and weaknesses for tabular QA, especially mathematical reasoning.
- Identification of 3 main error categories - incorrect extraction, reasoning and calculation.
- Introduction of fine-grained dataset annotations concerning number of reasoning steps, question types, table size etc. 
- Proposal of EEDP prompting technique that matches or exceeds performance of other baselines while also providing transparency into model.

In summary, the paper advances the understanding of abilities and limitations of LLMs for mathematical reasoning over semi-structured data through rigorous experimentation. The analysis provides specific directions for future research to enhance LLMs for such hybrid text-table scenarios.
