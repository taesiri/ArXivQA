# [Human Mesh Recovery from Arbitrary Multi-view Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12434)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recovering 3D human mesh from multi-view images is an important task with many applications. However, existing methods either make restricting assumptions about fixed camera poses/number of views or have complex designs for fusing arbitrary views. The paper aims to design a simple yet effective framework that can recover human mesh from images with arbitrary camera poses and number of views.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Unified Human Mesh Recovery (U-HMR) framework based on a divide-and-conquer strategy. The key ideas are:

1) Decouple estimation of camera poses and human mesh parameters into two separate modules since they are independent. This simplifies the overall design. 

2) For camera pose estimation, use a shared MLP across views to predict poses in parallel. This makes it agnostic to number of views.

3) For human mesh recovery, introduce a Transformer decoder with a learnable SMPL query token. The token attends to features from arbitrary views and aggregates information for predicting mesh. Transformer makes fusion view-invariant.

Main Contributions:

- Systematically analyze designs for human mesh recovery from multi-view images and propose a simple yet effective U-HMR framework 

- Novel decoupled structure to separately estimate camera poses and human mesh in a flexible way

- Introduce Transformer with learnable query token for fusing arbitrary number of views agnostically

- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and TotalCapture datasets, demonstrating effectiveness over existing single-view and multi-view methods

The framework is simple, flexible and can naturally handle single-view case as well. Ablations validate the effect of proposed components like decoupling and Transformer-based fusion.
