# [Directional Smoothness and Gradient Methods: Convergence and Adaptivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04081)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:

- Classical analysis of gradient descent (GD) for smooth functions relies on the global Lipschitz constant L. However, this can be pessimistic as GD depends only on local gradient properties along the optimization trajectory. 

- Existing approaches to capture locality either modify GD, rely on local smoothness oracles, or use complex arguments based on local boundedness.

Key Ideas and Contributions:

1. The paper introduces the notion of "directional smoothness" to capture gradient variation along the GD path without global assumptions. Two variants are proposed - pointwise and pathwise directional smoothness.

2. Leveraging directional smoothness, new suboptimality bounds for GD are derived that depend only on local conditioning. The bounds hold for arbitrary step-size sequences and are tighter than standard analysis.

3. For quadratics, the step-size that adapts to directional smoothness recovers the Cauchy step-size rule. For general functions, existence results are given for step-sizes adapted to directional smoothness.

4. Exponential search is adapted to find step-sizes that adapt to a weighted average of directional smoothness. 

5. Remarkably, it is shown GD with Polyak's step-size adapts to any directional smoothness, including the tightest possible bound, without needing the smoothness values. 

6. Experiments on logistic regression verify the improved convergence guarantees compared to standard analysis. On some problems, adaptive methods achieve a fast linear rate.

In summary, the paper provides a localized analysis of GD using novel smoothness notions that depend only on local trajectory properties. The improved analysis guides computation of adaptive step-sizes and reveals inherent adaptivity in the Polyak step-size.
