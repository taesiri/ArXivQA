# [MP5: A Multi-modal Open-ended Embodied System in Minecraft via Active   Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07472)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces MP5, a novel multi-modal embodied system for solving long-horizon, open-world tasks in the Minecraft environment. MP5 consists of five interacting modules - Parser, Percipient, Planner, Performer, and Patroller. A key component is the active perception scheme enabled through Percipient, an object-conditioned multimodal model, along with Patroller. This allows situation-aware planning and embodied action execution adapted to the environment. Experiments demonstrate MP5's ability to complete complex context-dependent tasks needing multi-step reasoning, achieving over 90% success on tasks requiring understanding 4-6 key environment elements. It also succeeds on 22% of very long horizon, diamond-level process-dependent tasks in Minecraft. The results showcase MP5's effectiveness in integrating perception, planning and execution for open-ended tasks requiring both visual context understanding and logical reasoning. The proposed system represents progress towards more human-like embodied agents that can act in the real world.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces MP5, a novel embodied system with five interacting modules - Parser, Percipient, Planner, Performer, and Patroller - that can decompose, perceive, plan, act, and monitor to solve long-horizon open-world tasks in Minecraft which depend on both the inherent logic between sub-tasks and the surrounding visual context.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing MP5, a novel embodied system that can solve long-horizon, open-world tasks in Minecraft. MP5 comprises five interacting modules - Parser, Percipient, Planner, Performer, and Patroller - that work together to decompose tasks, actively perceive the environment, plan and execute actions, and monitor progress. 

A key innovation is the active perception scheme enabled through multi-round interaction between the Percipient and Patroller modules. This allows MP5 to actively gather visual information relevant to the current objective, enabling robust situation-aware planning and embodied action execution.

Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate MP5's ability to complete tasks needing long-horizon reasoning and complex context understanding. For example, it achieves 22% success on difficult, multi-step crafting tasks and 91% success on tasks requiring perceiving multiple key items in the environment.

In summary, the main contributions are:
1) Proposing the MP5 system architecture for solving complex, open-world tasks 
2) The active perception scheme for situation-aware planning and execution
3) Demonstrating strong performance on tasks needing reasoning, planning, and visual understanding

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an active perception scheme for contextual understanding and situation-aware planning/execution. Can you elaborate on how the interaction between the Percipient and Patroller enables this? What are the key challenges?

2. The Parser breaks down tasks into sub-objectives. How does it determine the feasibility and logical order of these sub-objectives? Does it leverage any external knowledge or memories?

3. The Planner schedules action sequences grounded by perceived environmental information. What mechanisms allow it to update/re-plan these action sequences during execution? 

4. The Performer explains action sequences into executable commands. What level of abstraction do these commands have compared to primitive controls? How does it determine action completion?

5. What are the key differences between the active perception scheme used for planning versus execution? What role does the Patroller play in each case?

6. The paper claims the system can handle open-ended tasks involving both process and context dependencies. Can you analyze the architecture to explain how it achieves this?

7. How does the incorporation of external memories such as Knowledge Memory and Performer Memory aid the task completion process? What are their limitations?

8. The Percipient leverages a specialized MLLM called MineLLM. Can you discuss the motivations behind developing a custom MLLM? What advantages does it offer over general MLLMs?

9. The paper utilizes GPT models for several modules. How sensitive is performance to the choice of the underlying LLM? What factors determine this?

10. The system is evaluated on complex metrics including context and process dependencies. What other metrics would provide further insight into the capabilities and limitations of the proposed approach?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing embodied agents struggle with long-horizon open-world tasks in Minecraft due to the inherent process dependency (ordering of sub-tasks) and context dependency (reliance on environmental context). Agents need skills like task decomposition, situation-aware planning, embodied action execution, and perception of open-ended concepts grounded in the current context.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces MP5, an open-ended multimodal embodied system in Minecraft. MP5 has 5 key modules - Parser, Percipient, Planner, Performer, and Patroller. The Parser decomposes tasks into feasible sub-objectives. The Percipient is an MLLM that answers visual queries relevant to planning/execution. The Planner uses perception information to generate situation-aware action plans. The Performer executes those actions in an embodied way. The Patroller checks the responses from other modules and gives feedback.  

MP5 uses an active perception scheme where the Percipient and Patroller modules interact - Percipient grounds visual concepts based on queries from Patroller, while Patroller relays feedback. This enables perception-aware planning and execution. The Parser, Planner and Patroller modules leverage retrieval from external memories to improve reasoning. The different modules collaborate through a unified interface.

Key Contributions:
1) A system with integrated skills for hierarchical reasoning, active perception, situation-aware planning and embodied execution
2) A novel active perception scheme that grounds visual concepts based on diverse objectives  
3) Quantitative experiments showing MP5 can solve complex context-dependent and process-dependent tasks
4) Qualitative demonstrations of MP5 succeeding in very open-ended tasks requiring both context and process understanding

The system represents an advance towards building generalist embodied agents that can solve tasks in ways that approach human behavior.
