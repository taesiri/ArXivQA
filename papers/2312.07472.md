# [MP5: A Multi-modal Open-ended Embodied System in Minecraft via Active   Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07472)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces MP5, a novel multi-modal embodied system for solving long-horizon, open-world tasks in the Minecraft environment. MP5 consists of five interacting modules - Parser, Percipient, Planner, Performer, and Patroller. A key component is the active perception scheme enabled through Percipient, an object-conditioned multimodal model, along with Patroller. This allows situation-aware planning and embodied action execution adapted to the environment. Experiments demonstrate MP5's ability to complete complex context-dependent tasks needing multi-step reasoning, achieving over 90% success on tasks requiring understanding 4-6 key environment elements. It also succeeds on 22% of very long horizon, diamond-level process-dependent tasks in Minecraft. The results showcase MP5's effectiveness in integrating perception, planning and execution for open-ended tasks requiring both visual context understanding and logical reasoning. The proposed system represents progress towards more human-like embodied agents that can act in the real world.
