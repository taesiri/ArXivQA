# [3DGStream: On-the-Fly Training of 3D Gaussians for Efficient Streaming   of Photo-Realistic Free-Viewpoint Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Constructing free-viewpoint videos (FVVs) from multi-view videos of dynamic scenes remains challenging. Existing neural rendering methods require complete video sequences for offline training and are not capable of real-time rendering. This prevents streaming applications and practical use cases.

Method:
The paper proposes a novel method called 3DGStream to enable efficient streaming of photo-realistic FVVs. 3DGStream represents the dynamic scene using 3D Gaussians (3DGs). Instead of directly optimizing the 3DGs per frame, the method employs two key components:

1) Neural Transformation Cache (NTC): Compactly models the translation and rotation of 3DGs over time using a multi-resolution voxel grid encoding and MLP. This avoids having to store all 3DGs per frame.

2) Adaptive 3DG Addition: Dynamically spawns additional 3DGs to capture emerging objects not present initially. Quantities are controlled to limit growth over time.

Together this allows transforming most 3DGs from the prior frame and adding new ones as needed to represent the current frame.

Contributions:
- On-the-fly FVV streaming without needing full video for training
- Real-time rendering at 200 FPS
- Fast per-frame optimization (12 seconds)
- Competitive image quality and storage costs

Experiments on two multi-view datasets demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods in efficiency while maintaining competitive quality. The method advances the capability for streaming applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes 3DGStream, a method that achieves efficient streaming of photo-realistic free-viewpoint videos by modeling scene dynamics through a two-stage pipeline involving transforming 3D Gaussians using a neural cache and adaptively adding additional 3D Gaussians for emerging objects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper include:

1. Proposing 3DGStream, a method for on-the-fly construction of photo-realistic, real-time renderable free viewpoint videos (FVVs) from video streams, eliminating the need for lengthy offline training on entire video sequences.

2. Utilizing a Neural Transformation Cache (NTC) to model the translations and rotations of 3D Gaussians (3DGs), combined with an adaptive 3D Gaussian addition strategy to handle emerging objects in dynamic scenes. This allows efficient manipulation of 3DGs to accommodate scene changes.

3. Conducting extensive experiments showing that 3DGStream achieves competitive performance in terms of rendering quality, training time, and model storage compared to state-of-the-art dynamic scene reconstruction methods, while also demonstrating superior rendering speed.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an efficient online method for streaming high-quality free viewpoint videos of dynamic scenes in real time. The method innovates in using 3D Gaussians with a transformation cache and adaptive addition strategy. Experiments validate its efficiency and effectiveness versus prior state-of-the-art techniques.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage pipeline for efficient free viewpoint video streaming. Can you explain in more detail how the neural transformation cache works in stage 1 to model motion of objects? What design choices were made to balance efficiency and accuracy?

2. The adaptive 3D Gaussian addition strategy in stage 2 aims to handle emerging objects not present in the initial frame. What indicators did the authors use to detect the locations of emerging objects? How does the adaptive spawn and quantity control of additional 3D Gaussians work? 

3. What modifications were made to the 3D Gaussian splatting framework from the Kerbl et al. paper to adapt it for streaming free viewpoint videos? How do considerations like model storage and online training time impact the design?

4. The neural transformation cache uses multi-resolution hash encoding combined with a shallow MLP. What advantages does this design offer over other alternatives the authors experimented with? How is information from different voxel grid resolutions merged?

5. How are the view-dependent colors and opacity of the transformed and additional 3D Gaussians initialized and optimized during training? What strategies are used to improve training stability?  

6. What rendering considerations were made to achieve real-time performance of over 200 FPS at megapixel resolutions? Which components contribute the most to rendering time and how were they optimized?

7. The method has improved efficiency but at the cost of some image quality compared to offline trained models. What factors contribute to the gap in PSNR/image quality? How might this be addressed in future work?

8. How does the performance compare when trained on video streams from systems with different numbers of cameras? What adaptations would be needed for monocular video inputs?

9. The current model optimization strategy limits drastic motion or complex emerging objects. How might the training process be modified to accommodate more complex scene dynamics?

10. The paper focuses on reconstructing indoor scenes. What additional challenges arise when applying the method to large-scale outdoor scenes? How might the neural scene representation and training strategy need to evolve?
