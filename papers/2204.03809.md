# [Federated Learning with Partial Model Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03809)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions addressed in this paper are:1. How can we train machine learning models that are partially personalized to each client in federated learning, where only some components of the model are personalized while others are shared?2. What algorithms can efficiently train such partially personalized models in the challenging setting of federated learning with non-convex loss functions and partial client participation? 3. How do different partial personalization schemes compare with each other and with full model personalization in terms of accuracy, communication efficiency, and memory requirements?4. Can partial personalization achieve most of the benefits of full personalization using only a small fraction of personalized parameters?5. How do the two proposed algorithms for partial personalization, FedSim and FedAlt, compare in theory and practice?The paper proposes and analyzes two algorithms - Federated Simulation (FedSim) and Federated Alternating (FedAlt) - for training partially personalized models in federated learning. It provides convergence guarantees for these algorithms in the non-convex setting. Through extensive experiments on image, text and speech tasks, the paper demonstrates that partial personalization can match or exceed the accuracy of full personalization using only 10-15% personalized parameters. The experiments also reveal that FedAlt consistently outperforms FedSim, albeit by a small margin.Overall, the central hypothesis is that partial personalization provides an efficient and practical way to balance personalization and statistical strength across clients in federated learning. The paper provides compelling evidence for this claim both theoretically and empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Convergence guarantees for two federated learning algorithms called FedAlt and FedSim for training partially personalized models in the general nonconvex setting. The analysis focuses on the challenging case of partial device participation.2. An extensive empirical study on realistic image, text, and speech tasks comparing different model personalization strategies and the two algorithms. The key findings are:- Partial personalization can obtain most of the benefits of full model personalization with only a small fraction of personalized parameters. - The alternating algorithm FedAlt consistently outperforms the simultaneous update algorithm FedSim, although the margin is small.- Personalization can sometimes hurt performance on some devices, despite improving average accuracy. Regularization does not seem to fix this issue, calling for new research.3. Identification of two regimes where FedAlt dominates FedSim in theory based on the problem parameters. Experiments corroborate the practical relevance of this regime.4. Demonstration that the optimization model covers many personalized federated learning formulations as special cases. Therefore, the analysis provides theoretical guarantees for these methods as well.In summary, this paper provides theoretical analysis to support using partial model personalization and the FedAlt algorithm in practice, backed by extensive experiments on real-world tasks. It also identifies some limitations and open problems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my understanding, the key point of the paper is proposing and analyzing two federated learning algorithms (FedAlt and FedSim) for training partially personalized models, where some model parameters are shared across devices while others are personalized. The algorithms have complementary benefits, with FedAlt achieving slightly better accuracy in experiments and having favorable convergence guarantees, while FedSim is simpler to implement. Overall, the paper shows that partial model personalization can achieve much of the benefit of full personalization with only a fraction of the parameters being personalized.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper proposes two algorithms for federated learning with partial model personalization - FedAlt and FedSim. Both algorithms have been explored in prior work, but their convergence properties were not fully understood, especially for the alternating algorithm FedAlt. This paper provides theoretical convergence guarantees for both algorithms which helps justify their use.- The paper analyzes both algorithms under general nonconvex settings with partial participation of devices. Previous theoretical analyses were limited to convex settings or assumed full participation. Analyzing the more practical nonconvex, partial participation setting is an important contribution.- The paper demonstrates through experiments that partial personalization can achieve most of the benefits of full model personalization with only a small fraction of personalized parameters across image, text, and speech tasks. This is consistent with some prior works that also found partial personalization to be effective.- The paper finds that FedAlt slightly but consistently outperforms FedSim across tasks. Prior works have proposed both algorithms but not systematically compared them or provided guidance on when to prefer one over the other. This paper delineates the regimes where FedAlt is provably better.- The paper reveals and analyzes the phenomenon of personalization hurting some devices despite helping on average. This issue has been overlooked by prior work but has important implications on fairness. Understanding and mitigating this phenomenon is identified as an important direction for future work.In summary, this paper provides novel theoretical and empirical insights that advance the understanding of partially personalized federated learning. The analysis and experiments are conducted in practical nonconvex settings and help guide the effective use of such algorithms in practice. The results align with and strengthen some findings from prior works while also revealing new phenomenon that warrant further investigation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Developing a statistical learning theory for personalized federated learning to better understand how to set the regularization parameters (such as λ_i and ν_i in Equation 4) based on the statistical characteristics of the local datasets. This could lead to better optimization performance.- Studying privacy implications of partial model personalization, where only part of the model is communicated. The authors speculate that communicating only the shared parameters may require less noise for differential privacy compared to full model personalization.- Improving performance and fairness across devices, since their experiments showed that personalization can sometimes hurt test accuracy on some devices, especially those with limited data. New regularization techniques may help address this issue.- Exploring more structured forms of partial personalization, such as the examples shown in Figures 2 and 3. The right choice of model components to personalize can lead to better accuracy compared to personalizing a fixed part.- Applying the optimization algorithms and analysis techniques developed in this paper to other multi-task learning problems beyond personalized federated learning.- Extending the convergence analysis to handle challenges like systems heterogeneity, communication constraints, and adversarial attacks.In summary, some of the key future directions are developing a statistical learning theory tailored to personalized FL, studying privacy and fairness implications, exploring more structured personalization architectures, and extending the analysis to more complex federated learning settings.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes and analyzes two federated learning algorithms, FedAlt and FedSim, for training partially personalized models where some parameters are personalized on each client device while others are shared globally. Both algorithms follow the typical federated learning protocol but differ in how they update the shared and personalized parameters - FedAlt updates them alternatingly while FedSim updates them simultaneously. The paper provides convergence guarantees for both algorithms in the general nonconvex setting and shows that FedAlt converges faster than FedSim when the variance of the personalized parameters' gradients is small. Through extensive experiments on image, text and speech tasks, the paper demonstrates that partial personalization can achieve most of the benefits of full personalization using only a fraction of the parameters. The experiments also reveal that personalization can sometimes degrade performance on some devices, indicating the need for techniques to improve fairness. Overall, the paper provides theoretical analysis and practical insights into training personalized federated learning models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes two federated learning algorithms for training partially personalized models, where some parameters are shared across devices while others are personalized for each device. The two algorithms, called FedAlt and FedSim, differ in how they update the shared and personalized parameters. FedAlt updates them alternatingly while FedSim updates them simultaneously. Both algorithms follow the standard federated learning protocol of selecting a subset of devices per round for local model updates. The personalized parameters stay locally on each device while only the shared parameters are sent to the server for aggregation after local updates. The authors provide convergence analyses for both algorithms and compare their rates. The key challenge in analyzing FedAlt is handling the dependent random variables that arise from alternating updates. The authors introduce a novel technique called "virtual full participation" to overcome this. Their theory applies to general smooth nonconvex objectives and allows for partial device participation per round. Through extensive experiments on image, text and speech tasks, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of partial model personalization, which can attain most of the benefits of full personalization using only a small fraction of personalized parameters. The experiments also reveal that FedAlt consistently outperforms FedSim, although the margin is small.In summary, the paper provides valuable theoretical and empirical results on two algorithms for an important practical problem of training personalized models efficiently in federated learning. The proposed "virtual full participation" technique helps advance the theory of federated optimization.
