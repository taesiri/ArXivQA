# [Federated Learning with Partial Model Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03809)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions addressed in this paper are:1. How can we train machine learning models that are partially personalized to each client in federated learning, where only some components of the model are personalized while others are shared?2. What algorithms can efficiently train such partially personalized models in the challenging setting of federated learning with non-convex loss functions and partial client participation? 3. How do different partial personalization schemes compare with each other and with full model personalization in terms of accuracy, communication efficiency, and memory requirements?4. Can partial personalization achieve most of the benefits of full personalization using only a small fraction of personalized parameters?5. How do the two proposed algorithms for partial personalization, FedSim and FedAlt, compare in theory and practice?The paper proposes and analyzes two algorithms - Federated Simulation (FedSim) and Federated Alternating (FedAlt) - for training partially personalized models in federated learning. It provides convergence guarantees for these algorithms in the non-convex setting. Through extensive experiments on image, text and speech tasks, the paper demonstrates that partial personalization can match or exceed the accuracy of full personalization using only 10-15% personalized parameters. The experiments also reveal that FedAlt consistently outperforms FedSim, albeit by a small margin.Overall, the central hypothesis is that partial personalization provides an efficient and practical way to balance personalization and statistical strength across clients in federated learning. The paper provides compelling evidence for this claim both theoretically and empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Convergence guarantees for two federated learning algorithms called FedAlt and FedSim for training partially personalized models in the general nonconvex setting. The analysis focuses on the challenging case of partial device participation.2. An extensive empirical study on realistic image, text, and speech tasks comparing different model personalization strategies and the two algorithms. The key findings are:- Partial personalization can obtain most of the benefits of full model personalization with only a small fraction of personalized parameters. - The alternating algorithm FedAlt consistently outperforms the simultaneous update algorithm FedSim, although the margin is small.- Personalization can sometimes hurt performance on some devices, despite improving average accuracy. Regularization does not seem to fix this issue, calling for new research.3. Identification of two regimes where FedAlt dominates FedSim in theory based on the problem parameters. Experiments corroborate the practical relevance of this regime.4. Demonstration that the optimization model covers many personalized federated learning formulations as special cases. Therefore, the analysis provides theoretical guarantees for these methods as well.In summary, this paper provides theoretical analysis to support using partial model personalization and the FedAlt algorithm in practice, backed by extensive experiments on real-world tasks. It also identifies some limitations and open problems.
