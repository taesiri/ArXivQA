# [Temporal-Mapping Photography for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06443)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) capture brightness changes as asynchronous event streams instead of intensity images. Previous works have focused on converting events to video in dynamic scenes with camera/scene motion. However, converting events to images in static scenes using a stationary event camera remains an open challenge. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Event-based Temporal Mapping Photography (EvTemMap) to address this challenge. The key ideas are:

1) Use an Adjustable Transmittance DVS (AT-DVS) where transmittance can be adjusted from 0 to capture events during gradual transmittance increase. This generates a Temporal Matrix recording initial positive event timestamp for each pixel. 

2) Map the Temporal Matrix to intensity via time-intensity mapping. However, hardware constraints degrade the mapping quality. 

3) Design a temporal and spatial degradation model incorporating factors like threshold noise, timestamp errors, hot pixels etc.  

4) Train a Temporal Mapping network with the degradation model to convert Temporal Matrix to high-quality, high dynamic range grayscale images.

Main Contributions:

1) First work to convert events to images in static scenes using a stationary event camera.

2) Proposed EvTemMap for time-based intensity measurement and AT-DVS allowing adjustable transmittance. 

3) Designed a temporal & spatial degradation model for EvTemMap.

4) Collected a new dataset with diverse scenarios and luminance levels. Experiments demonstrate EvTemMap's superior image quality and performance on downstream vision tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel event-to-image conversion method called Event-Based Temporal Mapping Photography that captures a high dynamic range and low-light grayscale image from a static scene using a stationary event camera with adjustable transmittance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose a new method called Event-Based Temporal-Mapping Photography (EvTemMap) to convert events from a stationary event camera in static scenes to images. This is the first work to achieve this. 

2. They design a new hardware called Adjustable Transmittance Dynamic Vision Sensor (AT-DVS) that can gradually increase the transmittance to capture a Temporal Matrix (sequence of timestamps of initial positive events).

3. They analyze the degradation factors in converting the Temporal Matrix to images and design a temporal and spatial degradation model to train a neural network for effective image reconstruction.

4. They collect a new dataset called TemMat containing diverse static scenes under varying illumination conditions to benchmark event-to-image reconstruction methods.

5. Through experiments on this dataset, they demonstrate the ability of EvTemMap to produce high quality, high dynamic range images from events in static scenes, outperforming prior event-to-video methods like E2VID.

In summary, the key innovation is the idea and implementation of EvTemMap to convert events to images in static scenes by capturing and mapping timestamps of initial positive events using their specially designed hardware AT-DVS.
