## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents the development and validation of an innovative computational pipeline for analyzing exploration behaviors in mice using Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and Spontaneous Location Recognition (SLR) tasks. The pipeline seamlessly integrates three advanced computational tools—Any-Maze, DeepLabCut, and Convolutional Neural Networks via the EXPLORE platform—to enable multidimensional analysis of video recordings. By tracking pose estimation, defining investigation zones, and employing complex metrics, this pipeline extracts nuanced insights into differential interactions with novel versus familiar objects. The study analyzes four distinct mouse groups, including Alzheimer's disease models, control groups, and strain-specific genotypes. Despite facing challenges with video quality limitations and variability in results across metrics, the pipeline demonstrates accuracy levels exceeding 90% and effectively computes the discrimination index for quantifying novelty preference. Overall, this research validates a versatile computational framework for evaluating animal cognition that is poised to become an adaptable benchmark for future studies exploring neurodegenerative diseases.
