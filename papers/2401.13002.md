# [Theorem Discovery Amongst Cyclic Polygons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13002)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper examines a class of geometric theorems involving the angles formed between pairs of sides of cyclic polygons (polygons whose vertices all lie on a circle). 
- Specifically, it considers a cyclic 2n-gon and identifies n disjoint pairs of sides that meet certain criteria in terms of their separation distance around the polygon.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proves a general theorem that if you take such a cyclic 2n-gon and n disjoint pairs of sides meeting the specified criteria, there is a linear relationship between the angles formed by those n pairs of sides that equals a constant. 
- It provides the formula for this linear relationship, allowing new geometry theorems to be generated by computing the coefficients for different pairings of sides.

- The paper then proposes an automated process for discovering new cyclic polygon geometry theorems using this result:
  1) Randomly select compatible pairings of sides
  2) Construct polygon with those pairings, compute and name the angles
  3) Apply formula to get theorem conclusion relating the named angles

- It demonstrates this process through an example theorem for the cyclic decagon.

Main Contributions:
- General theorem relating angles formed by certain pairings of sides in cyclic 2n-gons
- Automated process for generating new geometry theorems based on this result
- Can proliferate large number of distinct theorems and associated proof problems
- Process used to automatically generate a collection of cyclic polygon geometry theorems

In summary, the key innovation is an automated theorem discovery technique for generating new geometry theorems about angles in cyclic polygons, enabled by a general mathematical result about permissible pairings of sides.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper examines theorems involving linear combinations of angles in cyclic polygons, provides a general formula for such theorems, describes an automated process to generate geometry proof problems exploiting these theorems, and shows examples of automatically generated problems and proofs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) It presents a general theorem (Theorem 1) that gives a linear relationship between the angles formed by n disjoint pairs of sides of a cyclic 2n-gon, where the sides in each pair are separated by an odd number of sides. 

2) It provides an automated process for discovering and generating new geometry theorems and proof problems involving angles in cyclic polygons, by:
(a) Randomly selecting a set of side pairings that satisfy the criteria of Theorem 1 
(b) Constructing a diagram with the cyclic polygon and chosen side pairings
(c) Naming and marking the angles between the chosen side pairs
(d) Expressing Theorem 1 in terms of the named angles to get the theorem conclusion

3) It describes an automated problem generator that can create geometry proof problems involving cyclic polygons, along with human-readable proofs, using a set of simple angle generation rules. The generator can produce collections of distinct, non-duplicate problems.

In summary, the main contribution is an automated theorem discovery and geometry problem generation process for angles in cyclic polygons, along with a specific theorem on linear relationships between certain angles in cyclic 2n-gons.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an approach to automated theorem discovery in geometry. What are some potential applications of this in education or research? How could the generated theorems and proofs be used?

2. The method relies on selecting a set of side pairings that satisfy certain criteria and then using those to generate a theorem. What constraints are placed on the side pairings? Why are these important? 

3. Explain in detail the process of going from a set of side pairings to a theorem statement. What role does Theorem 1 play here? Walk through an example.

4. Discuss the algorithm for generating a geometry diagram and naming the angles once the side pairings are chosen. What considerations need to be made in positioning the vertices? 

5. The relation between the directed angles δij and the marked angles ψij depends on the relative locations of the points. Explain this dependence and why it can change the final theorem statement. Provide examples.  

6. Explain the modifications made in the automated problem generator to allow for permutations of the vertices and merged points. How do these expand the space of possible theorems? Provide examples.

7. The paper claims the approach can generate thousands of distinct theorem statements. Analyze the combinatorics behind this estimate. Where does this proliferation come from?

8. Discuss the simple angle propagation rules used in the automated proof generator. How do these allow building up expressions for angles step-by-step? Explain with an example. 

9. When the automated proof fails to complete, geometry is added to the diagram. Explain the two phase process for adding additional geometry. Why does this allow the proof to complete?

10. Assess the strengths and weaknesses of using the generated theorems and proofs for pedagogical purposes. What adjustments could be made to tailor them better for educational use?
