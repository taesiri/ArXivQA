# [Is Curiosity All You Need? On the Utility of Emergent Behaviours from   Curious Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08603)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can the emergent behaviors that arise during curiosity-driven learning be harnessed to accelerate learning on downstream tasks? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Optimizing an intrinsic curiosity objective leads to the emergence of diverse and complex behaviors in continuous control environments like robot manipulation and locomotion.2) The intermediate behaviors that emerge and disappear during curiosity learning can serve as useful skills for solving related downstream tasks. 3) Retaining and reusing these emergent behaviors as modular skills could reduce the need for manually engineering task curricula in reinforcement learning.The experiments seem designed to test these hypotheses - first demonstrating the emergence of behaviors when optimizing a curiosity objective, and then showing how snapshots of the curiosity policy can be used as reusable skills to accelerate learning on a downstream task. The overall goal is to shift the focus towards retaining and leveraging emergent behaviors from curiosity-driven exploration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. The introduction of SelMo, an off-policy realization of a self-motivated, curiosity-based method for exploration. This method is applied to two robotic manipulation and locomotion domains in simulation.2. A focus on identifying and retaining the behaviors that emerge during curiosity-based learning, rather than just using curiosity for fast environment exploration or as a bonus reward. The paper argues that the emergent behaviors can serve as valuable skills for solving related tasks. 3. An analysis showing the continuous shift in behavior over the course of training when optimizing only for the curiosity objective. Diverse and human-interpretable behaviors emerge in both the manipulation and locomotion domains.4. A baseline experiment demonstrating the benefits of reusing discovered behaviors for transfer tasks. The paper shows that using policy snapshots as modular skills in a hierarchical RL setup can perform comparably to a hand-designed curriculum.5. A discussion of remaining challenges and future work on the automatic identification and retention of useful emerging behaviors from curious exploration. The paper suggests this is a promising research direction for unsupervised reinforcement learning.In summary, the main contributions are the introduction of the SelMo method, an analysis of emergent behaviors, and initial experiments showing the potential for harnessing these behaviors for downstream tasks. The paper also discusses the open problems and future work in this domain.
