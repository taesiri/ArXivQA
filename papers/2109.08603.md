# [Is Curiosity All You Need? On the Utility of Emergent Behaviours from   Curious Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08603)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can the emergent behaviors that arise during curiosity-driven learning be harnessed to accelerate learning on downstream tasks? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Optimizing an intrinsic curiosity objective leads to the emergence of diverse and complex behaviors in continuous control environments like robot manipulation and locomotion.2) The intermediate behaviors that emerge and disappear during curiosity learning can serve as useful skills for solving related downstream tasks. 3) Retaining and reusing these emergent behaviors as modular skills could reduce the need for manually engineering task curricula in reinforcement learning.The experiments seem designed to test these hypotheses - first demonstrating the emergence of behaviors when optimizing a curiosity objective, and then showing how snapshots of the curiosity policy can be used as reusable skills to accelerate learning on a downstream task. The overall goal is to shift the focus towards retaining and leveraging emergent behaviors from curiosity-driven exploration.
