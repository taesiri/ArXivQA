# [A Technical Report for Polyglot-Ko: Open-Source Large-Scale Korean   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02254)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop advanced Korean language models with improved performance compared to existing multilingual models, in order to bridge the gap in capabilities between English and non-English languages?The key hypothesis appears to be:By creating large-scale Korean language models trained on extensive Korean corpora, it is possible to surpass the performance of current multilingual models on Korean natural language processing tasks.In particular, the paper introduces the Polyglot Korean models and evaluates their capabilities on Korean benchmark datasets, with the goal of demonstrating they can achieve state-of-the-art results for the Korean language. The underlying hypothesis is that language-specific models tuned for Korean will outperform multilingual models that have poorer Korean language abilities. By presenting the Polyglot Korean models, the authors aim to test this hypothesis and showcase techniques to improve non-English language model performance.In summary, the central research question revolves around improving Korean language modeling through the development of customized models superior to existing multilingual models. The key hypothesis is that language-specific models can boost capabilities for that language compared to generalized multilingual models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the development and release of Polyglot Korean (Polyglot-Ko) language models. Specifically:- The authors collaborated with TUNiB to collect a large 1.2TB Korean dataset which was used to train Polyglot-Ko models. - Four Polyglot-Ko models with different sizes were trained: 1.3B, 3.8B, 5.8B, and 12.8B parameters. The 12.8B model is noted as the largest publicly available Korean language model suitable for commercial applications.- The models were evaluated on the KOBEST benchmark across different tasks like COPA, HellaSwag, BoolQ, and SentiNeg. Results show the Polyglot-Ko models achieve competitive performance, with the 12.8B model demonstrating the best results overall. - The training configurations, model architectures, datasets, and experiments are presented in detail.- The authors discuss limitations and future work, such as expanding Polyglot-Ko to 40B parameters and building multilingual models for East Asian and Romance languages.In summary, the main contribution is the development and release of the new Polyglot-Ko models to empower Korean natural language processing and address the gap in large Korean language models available. The models, training methodology, datasets, and comprehensive experiments are presented to demonstrate these high-performance Korean language models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces Polyglot Korean language models ranging from 1.3B to 12.8B parameters, trained on a large-scale Korean dataset, which achieve strong performance on various Korean NLP benchmarks and represent an important contribution towards improving non-English language capabilities of multilingual models.
