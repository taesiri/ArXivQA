# [A Technical Report for Polyglot-Ko: Open-Source Large-Scale Korean   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02254)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop advanced Korean language models with improved performance compared to existing multilingual models, in order to bridge the gap in capabilities between English and non-English languages?The key hypothesis appears to be:By creating large-scale Korean language models trained on extensive Korean corpora, it is possible to surpass the performance of current multilingual models on Korean natural language processing tasks.In particular, the paper introduces the Polyglot Korean models and evaluates their capabilities on Korean benchmark datasets, with the goal of demonstrating they can achieve state-of-the-art results for the Korean language. The underlying hypothesis is that language-specific models tuned for Korean will outperform multilingual models that have poorer Korean language abilities. By presenting the Polyglot Korean models, the authors aim to test this hypothesis and showcase techniques to improve non-English language model performance.In summary, the central research question revolves around improving Korean language modeling through the development of customized models superior to existing multilingual models. The key hypothesis is that language-specific models can boost capabilities for that language compared to generalized multilingual models.
