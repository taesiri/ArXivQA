# [Is ChatGPT Good at Search? Investigating Large Language Models as   Re-Ranking Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09542)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research questions that this paper aims to address are:1) How does ChatGPT perform on passage re-ranking tasks? (RQ1)2) How to imitate the ranking capabilities of ChatGPT to a smaller, specialized model? (RQ2)The authors explore using ChatGPT and GPT-4 for passage re-ranking through different instruction methods like query generation, relevance generation, and permutation generation. They comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on benchmark datasets like TREC, BEIR, and Mr.TyDi. The results show that ChatGPT and GPT-4 can achieve competitive or even better performance compared to previous supervised systems. To address the second question, the authors propose a permutation distillation technique to transfer the passage ranking ability of ChatGPT to a smaller specialized model. They show that the distilled model trained on just 10K samples generated by ChatGPT can outperform supervised models trained on much larger datasets.In summary, the two central research questions are: assessing ChatGPT's passage re-ranking capabilities (RQ1), and distilling its abilities into a specialized model (RQ2). The authors conduct experiments and propose methods to provide insights into these two questions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper seem to be:1. Investigating the ability of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 for relevance ranking in information retrieval. The paper examines different instruction methods for using LLMs for passage re-ranking, including a novel permutation generation approach.2. Comprehensively evaluating the capabilities of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on passage re-ranking using benchmarks like TREC, BEIR, and Mr.TyDi. The results show that properly instructed ChatGPT and GPT-4 can deliver competitive or superior results compared to supervised methods. 3. Proposing a distillation approach to imitate the passage ranking capabilities of ChatGPT into a smaller, specialized ranking model. By training on ChatGPT's permutation outputs, the distilled model outperforms fully fine-tuned supervised models while being more cost-efficient.In summary, the key contributions are exploring LLMs for relevance ranking, evaluating their capabilities extensively on benchmarks, and distilling their abilities into specialized models.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is my analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the field of using large language models (LLMs) for information retrieval (IR):Overall Comparison:- This paper provides a comprehensive empirical study on using generative LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 for passage re-ranking in IR. It demonstrates strong zero-shot performance of these models on several IR benchmarks.- Most prior work has focused on using LLMs for query/data generation rather than directly for ranking. This paper explores directly leveraging the instruction capabilities of LLMs for ranking.- The results show LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to supervised models, highlighting their potential for IR.Specific Comparisons:- Existing methods like UPR and HELM use LLMs for query or relevance generation. This paper introduces a new instructional permutation generation approach that outperforms these methods.- Compared to InPars and PromptAugator which use LLMs to generate training data, this paper shows directly using LLMs for ranking can be more effective.- While prior work has used smaller LLMs like GPT-3, this paper provides a comprehensive evaluation using more capable models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.- The distillation approach distills LLM ranking capabilities into a small model using only 10K samples, much more efficient than training on hundreds of thousands of labeled samples like monoT5.In summary, this paper significantly advances the understanding of leveraging large generative LLMs for IR through comprehensive benchmarking, introducing a new permutation generation approach, and an efficient distillation technique. The results highlight the promising potential of LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 for IR.
