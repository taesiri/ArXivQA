# [Is ChatGPT Good at Search? Investigating Large Language Models as   Re-Ranking Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09542)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research questions that this paper aims to address are:

1) How does ChatGPT perform on passage re-ranking tasks? (RQ1)

2) How to imitate the ranking capabilities of ChatGPT to a smaller, specialized model? (RQ2)

The authors explore using ChatGPT and GPT-4 for passage re-ranking through different instruction methods like query generation, relevance generation, and permutation generation. They comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on benchmark datasets like TREC, BEIR, and Mr.TyDi. The results show that ChatGPT and GPT-4 can achieve competitive or even better performance compared to previous supervised systems. 

To address the second question, the authors propose a permutation distillation technique to transfer the passage ranking ability of ChatGPT to a smaller specialized model. They show that the distilled model trained on just 10K samples generated by ChatGPT can outperform supervised models trained on much larger datasets.

In summary, the two central research questions are: assessing ChatGPT's passage re-ranking capabilities (RQ1), and distilling its abilities into a specialized model (RQ2). The authors conduct experiments and propose methods to provide insights into these two questions.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is my analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the field of using large language models (LLMs) for information retrieval (IR):

Overall Comparison:

- This paper provides a comprehensive empirical study on using generative LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 for passage re-ranking in IR. It demonstrates strong zero-shot performance of these models on several IR benchmarks.

- Most prior work has focused on using LLMs for query/data generation rather than directly for ranking. This paper explores directly leveraging the instruction capabilities of LLMs for ranking.

Specific Comparisons:

- Existing methods like UPR and HELM use LLMs for query or relevance generation. This paper introduces a new instructional permutation generation approach that outperforms these methods.

- Compared to InPars and PromptAugator which use LLMs to generate training data, this paper shows directly using LLMs for ranking can be more effective.

- While prior work has used smaller LLMs like GPT-3, this paper provides a comprehensive evaluation using more capable models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.

- The distillation approach distills LLM ranking capabilities into a small model using only 10K samples, much more efficient than training on hundreds of thousands of labeled samples like monoT5.

In summary, this paper significantly advances the understanding of leveraging large generative LLMs for IR through comprehensive benchmarking, introducing a new permutation generation approach, and an efficient distillation technique. The results highlight the promising potential of LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 for IR.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

1. Exploring LLMs as relevance annotators. The authors suggest leveraging the strong capability of LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 to provide relevance judgments, as their experiments show the effectiveness of using LLMs' outputs as training labels. This can help address the high cost of human annotation in IR.

2. Instruction-tuning LLMs for a universal information access system. The authors propose further exploring instruction-tuning of LLMs to make them capable of diverse ranking tasks like passage, entity, response and evidence ranking. This could enable a more powerful, universal information access system.

3. Developing end-to-end IR models. The authors suggest investigating using a single LLM to cover different components in IR systems like retrieval and ranking, instead of the current multi-stage pipeline. This could enable end-to-end learning.

4. Improving efficiency of LLMs. The authors highlight the need for improving efficiency of large LLMs, such as through distillation into smaller models and lightweight learning. This is important for practical deployment in real systems.

In summary, the main future directions are leveraging LLMs for annotation and ranking, improving their efficiency, and enabling end-to-end learning in IR with LLMs. The key goals are reducing human annotation costs, achieving unified ranking, and deploying LLMs efficiently.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel instructional permutation generation method to leverage large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 for passage re-ranking in information retrieval. The key idea is to input multiple passages to the LLM, each with a unique identifier, and ask the model to output a ranked list of identifiers based on passage relevance. This allows the LLM to directly predict a permutation for ranking without relying on query generation probabilities or intermediate relevance scores. To handle an arbitrary number of passages, a sliding window strategy is used where subsets of passages are re-ranked in overlapping windows. The authors show that properly instructed, the permutation generation method allows ChatGPT and GPT-4 to achieve competitive or superior performance compared to supervised models on passage ranking benchmarks like TREC, BEIR, and Mr.TyDi. The effectiveness of directly using the LLM's permutation output suggests this is a promising way to tap into their reasoning and instruction following capabilities for ranking tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing two main questions:

1. How does ChatGPT perform on passage re-ranking tasks in information retrieval? 

2. How can the ranking capabilities of ChatGPT be imitated or distilled into a smaller, more specialized model?

In particular, the authors seem interested in exploring the potential of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 for relevance ranking without requiring large amounts of labeled training data. 

The first research question examines different strategies for instructing ChatGPT to rerank passages based on relevance to a query, including query generation, relevance generation, and a new permutation generation method proposed in the paper. Experiments on standard IR benchmarks compare ChatGPT and GPT-4's zero-shot performance to supervised systems.

The second question looks at distilling ChatGPT's passage ranking abilities into a smaller model, using the rankings ChatGPT generates as training targets. This aims to create a cost-efficient specialized ranking model without needing human annotations.

In summary, the main focus appears to be assessing and harnessing the capabilities of ChatGPT-like models for passage re-ranking in information retrieval, in a low resource and unsupervised manner.
