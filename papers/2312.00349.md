# [The Case for Scalable, Data-Driven Theory: A Paradigm for Scientific   Progress in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00349)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a "scalable, data-driven theory" paradigm for making scientific progress in NLP. The idea is to collect data that directly represents the phenomena of interest with minimal theoretical assumptions, use machine learning models as "data simulators" to generate more data, and then induce explanatory theories from this data. This allows for automatic induction of formal theoretical constructs like ontologies directly grounded in relevant linguistic behaviors. The paper illustrates this using Question-Answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) to annotate predicate-argument relations and shows how black-box models can generate distributions over questions that allow clustering arguments into coherent semantic roles. It also demonstrates using QA-SRL to build a controllable question generation system that can ask about any semantic role. While this currently only addresses shallow semantic phenomena, the paper argues it provides a model for data collection, theoretical modeling, and evaluation that could enable progress on more complex linguistic behaviors as well. Overall, it makes the case that the scalability and generalization power of modern NLP models enables a Pragmatist approach to developing useful theories grounded in data.
