# [GenTron: Delving Deep into Diffusion Transformers for Image and Video   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04557)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores transformer-based diffusion models for high-quality text-to-image and text-to-video generation. The authors first adapt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture from class conditioning to free-form text conditioning, investigating various text encoder models and conditioning mechanisms like adaptive layer norm and cross-attention. They then substantially scale up their GenTron model to over 3 billion parameters, observing significant quality improvements. In extending GenTron to video generation, the authors propose a novel "motion-free guidance" technique to enhance video quality by intermittently disabling motion modeling during training. Experiments demonstrate GenTron's superiority over prior arts like SDXL in human evaluations and alignment metrics. Key innovations include the thorough investigation of transformers for diffusion generation, the large-scale GenTron models, and the motion-free guidance strategy for higher-quality video generation. The comprehensive analysis and strong results pave the way for further research into transformer-based diffusion models across modalities.
