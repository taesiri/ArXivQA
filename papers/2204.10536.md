# [Sharper Utility Bounds for Differentially Private Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10536)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: Can we achieve high probability excess risk bounds with rate O(1/n) with respect to n for differentially private models via uniform stability?The paper notes that previous high probability bounds obtained via uniform stability theory for differentially private models contain an inevitable O(1/sqrt(n)) term, which acts as a bottleneck on the utility analysis. Thus, the key research question is whether it is possible to remove this O(1/sqrt(n)) bottleneck and achieve sharper bounds of O(1/n) for the excess risk of differentially private models under the high probability setting.The paper attempts to answer this open question positively by introducing generalized Bernstein conditions and proposing a new differentially private algorithm called max{1,g}-Normalized Gradient Perturbation (m-NGP). Through theoretical analysis, the paper shows that the proposed method can achieve the desired O(1/n) high probability bound under certain assumptions, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches.In summary, the central research question is focused on improving the utility guarantees of differentially private learning algorithms, particularly in terms of removing the bottleneck in generalization error bounds under the high probability setting. The proposal and analysis of the m-NGP algorithm provides a positive answer to this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes the first high probability excess population risk bound of order O(sqrt(p)/(n*epsilon)) for differentially private algorithms under assumptions of Lipschitzness, smoothness, and the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. This removes the O(1/sqrt(n)) bottleneck in previous bounds that used uniform stability.2. It relaxes the smoothness assumption to α-Hölder smoothness, and shows the excess risk bound becomes O(n^(-α/(1+2α))). This cannot achieve O(1/n) rate when α is in (0,1]. 3. To overcome this issue, it proposes a new algorithm called max{1,g}-Normalized Gradient Perturbation (m-NGP) that normalizes the gradient. With this algorithm, it shows the excess risk bound can be improved back to O(sqrt(p)/(n*epsilon)) under α-Hölder smoothness and PL condition, which is the first O(1/n) high probability bound without smoothness assumptions.4. Empirically evaluates m-NGP on real datasets, showing it improves accuracy and convergence over standard gradient perturbation, validating the theoretical improvements.In summary, the key contribution is proposing techniques to achieve O(1/n) high probability excess risk bounds for differentially private learning without smoothness assumptions, which was an open problem. The m-NGP algorithm and analysis enable this theoretical improvement, which is also validated empirically.
