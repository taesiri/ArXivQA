# [MetaAligner: Conditional Weak-to-Strong Correction for Generalizable   Multi-Objective Alignment of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17141)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences have limitations: 
   1) They require repeating costly alignment algorithms for each new LLM.  
   2) They cannot expand to new objectives beyond pre-determined ones used during training.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors propose "Meta-Objective Aligner" (MetaAligner), the first method that is policy-agnostic and generalizable for multi-objective preference alignment. 

- Key ideas:
   1) Decouples alignment from policy model parameters, enabling plug-and-play inference without repeating alignment.  
   2) Facilitates expansion to new objectives via in-context learning, not needing pre-training on them.

- Achieved via: 
   1) Novel dynamic multi-obj dataset construction to teach flexible adjustment of objectives.
   2) Conditional weak-to-strong correction model to approach strong responses.
   3) Prompt-based objectives statement for easy expansion.

Main Contributions:
1) First policy-agnostic method for multi-objective LLM alignment. Enables efficient plug-and-play alignment without policy model tuning.

2) First generalizable method, expanding to new objectives via in-context learning without pre-training on them. 

3) Evaluation on 11 LLMs shows effectiveness. Outperforms prior methods substantially with up to 22.27Ã— less compute resources. Also accurately aligns with 3 unseen objectives.

In summary, MetaAligner pioneers policy-agnostic and generalizable multi-objective LLM alignment via a flexible weak-to-strong correction approach, outperforming prior work significantly.
