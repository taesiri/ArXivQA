# [Orchestrated Robust Controller for the Precision Control of Heavy-duty   Hydraulic Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06304)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an orchestrated robust controller for high-precision control of heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators. The complex robotic system model is decomposed via virtual decomposition control (VDC) into subsystems representing rigid body dynamics and actuator dynamics. Decentralized radial basis function neural networks (DRBFNNs) are incorporated into VDC for estimating disturbances and uncertainties at each subsystem. Compound input constraint (deadzone and backlash) inverse is designed to compensate for the negative effect of such nonlinearity. An adaptive deadzone-backlash method tackles parametric uncertainty while DRBFNNs handle the unknown non-parametric part. Required forces are designed in rigid body parts to track desired trajectories, be robust to uncertainties, and cancel out inertial forces. Corresponding required voltages at actuators ensure generation of these forces. Stability analysis proves semi-globally uniformly ultimate boundedness of all signals under the proposed approach despite high complexity and nonlinearities. Extensive experimental results on a 6 degree-of-freedom hydraulic manipulator show significantly improved precision in joint space and Cartesian space through effective tackling of input constraints and uncertainties. The proposed orchestrating robust controller advances the state-of-the-art in control of hydraulic manipulators.
