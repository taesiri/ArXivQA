# [Extending QGroundControl for Automated Mission Planning of UAVs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18754)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper presents an extension of QGroundControl, an open-source ground control station software for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to facilitate automated mission planning, replanning and decision support. 

The key problem addressed is that current systems for controlling UAVs rely on manual planning or simple pre-configured plans, lacking intelligent automated planning capabilities. However planning optimal missions for multiple UAVs is complex, involving task allocation, vehicle routing, timing considerations and multiple conflicting objectives. The paper argues automated planning and replanning algorithms integrated with ground control software can increase UAV autonomy and reduce operator workload.

The main contributions are:

1) A mission designer interface to allow interactive creation of mission scenarios involving objectives, vehicles, no-fly zones etc. This facilitates evaluation of planning algorithms on diverse mission cases.

2) Integration of a testbed interface for connecting external multi-objective automated planning algorithms. This enables plug-and-play of different solvers to generate mission plans considering constraints and optimizing metrics like time, cost and risk.  

3) A decision support system that ranks and filters solution plans to assist operator choice. This uses multi-criteria methods and solution similarity analysis to focus most relevant options.

4) Visualization, monitoring and replanning capabilities - solution plans can be visualized, simulated, monitored during execution, edited in real-time to trigger re-planning if new objectives or contingencies arise. This demonstrates an end-to-end mission management workflow.

5) Use cases that walk through the mission design, planning, simulation, execution monitoring and replanning functionality developed. Together, these features represent a significant extension to QGroundControl's capabilities.

In summary, the paper presents an integrated mission management framework enhancing a widely used UAV ground control platform with intelligent planning, decision support and real-time management capabilities. This can help increase autonomous drone operations and reduces human operator workload.
