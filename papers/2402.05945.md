# [Eliminating Information Leakage in Hard Concept Bottleneck Models with   Supervised, Hierarchical Concept Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05945)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are a type of deep neural network that aim to improve model interpretability by predicting labels based on human-understandable concepts. However, recent CBMs suffer from information leakage, where unintended information beyond the concepts leaks into the label prediction. This undermines CBMs' interpretability and intervenability. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new CBM framework called SupCBM that addresses the information leakage issue. The key ideas are:

1) Supervised concept prediction: The concept predictor is trained with label supervision to focus only on concepts relevant to the ground truth label. This reduces leakage from irrelevant concepts.  

2) Hierarchical descriptive concepts: A two-level concept hierarchy is built - level 1 has perceptual concepts (nouns) that can be directly perceived by humans; level 2 has descriptive concepts (adjectives) that describe semantics of level 1 concepts. This better utilizes concept semantics.

3) Post-hoc design: Only a lightweight concept bottleneck (CB) layer is trained for any pre-trained feature extractor backbone, enabling efficient conversion to CBM. The final label is predicted by multiplying the CB output and a fixed intervention matrix.

Main Contributions:

- A new CBM paradigm SupCBM that achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing information leakage.

- Introduction of hierarchical descriptive concepts and supervised concept prediction to improve CBM interpretability and intervenability. 

- Efficient post-hoc implementation that only requires training a lightweight CB layer to convert any backbone model into a CBM.

- Extensive experiments demonstrating SupCBM's superiority over existing CBMs in accuracy, information leakage reduction, and generalizability across diverse datasets and backbones.

In summary, this paper makes CBMs more usable in practice by enhancing their faithfulness to the design objectives of interpretability and intervenability while retaining high accuracy.
