# [Axiomatic Preference Modeling for Longform Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02206)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) trained with human preference feedback lack knowledge of the principles behind those preferences. This can lead to misalignment with human expectations.  
- Existing "reward models" simply regress to a preference score without clear axiomatic signals. Training pairs also lack diversity, often just sampled from the LLM itself.  
- It's unclear if separate small preference models can reliably score both human-written and LLM-generated answers. This is challenging due to differences in style.

Proposed Solution:  
- Identify 5 principles for long-form QA based on usefulness, relevance, truthfulness etc.
- Develop axiomatic framework to construct diverse preference training pairs tailored to those principles.
- Train 220M parameter "preference models" on axiomatic signals to score answers, normalizing stylistic differences.

Key Contributions:
- Axiomatic framework to generate nuanced preference training data enforcing principles. Applicable beyond QA.
- Standalone preference models to score human and LLM answers reliably on same scale.  
- With proper axiomatic signals, 220M model exceeds GPT-4 in preference scoring despite size difference.

In summary, the key ideas are using principles to actively construct informative training data for preference models, rather than just passively sampling scores. This helps small models outperform larger ones for the specialized task of preference scoring.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an axiomatic framework to construct tailored training data that teaches preference models to align with human judgments, enabling a 220M parameter model to exceed GPT-4 in scoring longform question answers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It develops an axiomatic framework to generate/augment training pairs that capture nuances in human preferences for longform question answering. These axioms enforce principles like usefulness, relevance, groundedness, truthfulness, and thoroughness.

2. It trains standalone preference models with 220M-7B parameters that can score both human-written and LLM-generated answers on the same scale, normalizing out spurious signals like length and style. The preference models are shown to exceed the capabilities of other open-source reward models.

3. It shows that training on proper axiomatic signals allows a 220M parameter preference model to agree with gold human-annotated preference labels more often than even the much larger GPT-4 model. This suggests that massive models may be overkill for preference scoring tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is using an axiomatic framework to generate tailored training data that teaches small preference models to align well with human preferences when scoring longform question answering responses.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Preference model
- Axiomatic framework
- Longform question answering
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
- Reward model
- Usefulness
- Relevance  
- Groundedness
- Truthfulness
- Thoroughness
- Community QA (CQA) sites
- Upvotes as weak preference signals
- Hard negatives
- Open-book vs closed-book answering
- Irrelevant vs relevant evidence/grounding
- Combining multiple answers for thoroughness
- Scoring both human-written and LLM-generated answers
- Agreement with human preferences
- Parameter efficient preference modeling

The paper develops an axiomatic framework to generate tailored training data that enforces principles like usefulness, truthfulness, etc in preference models. It uses both human feedback signals like upvotes as well as LLM-generated answers in various scenarios to train standalone preference models that can score answers from both humans and LLMs. The models are shown to agree with human judgments, even exceeding the capabilities of large models like GPT-4.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the axiomatic framework for generating training pairs actually enforce the principles like usefulness and truthfulness? What mechanisms ensure the pairs uphold those principles?

2. The paper argues that identifying failures modes is "cognitively simpler" than generating answers. Could you expand more on the theoretical justification behind this claim? 

3. How does the margin loss objective actually operationalize optimizing for agreement with human preferences? Could other loss functions like cross-entropy have been used instead?

4. What are some of the biggest challenges or limitations faced when trying to automatically generate "wrong but believable" answers from Language Models? How can this process be improved?

5. The preference model scores answers "pointwise" while the baselines like GPT-4 score "listwise". What are the tradeoffs between these two scoring approaches, especially when having to deploy at scale?

6. Why axioms and not rules? What specifically makes axioms a better framework over rules for this method? Expand more on the connections and differences.

7. The paper argues even large LLMs can be vulnerable to overfitting. What evidence supports this claim? And what architectural changes could make LLMs more robust?

8. How feasible is it to extend this framework to multi-turn conversations and not just single-turn question-answering? What new axioms would be needed?

9. What potential negative societal impacts could arise from deploying the proposed preference model at scale? How might the axioms be expanded to account for issues like bias and fairness?

10. The paper focuses on long-form question answering, but could the axiomatic framework generalize to other language tasks like summarization or translation as well? What would need to change?
