# [Dynamic Cross Attention for Audio-Visual Person Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04661)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Person verification using audio-visual fusion has shown great potential to outperform unimodal approaches. Cross attention (CA) mechanisms are widely used to effectively capture the complementary relationships across modalities. However, audio and visual modalities may exhibit not just strong but also weak complementary relationships depending on whether one modality is noisy or restrained. Existing CA approaches fail to handle such cases, degrading the fused audio-visual representations when modalities have weak complementary relationships.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Dynamic Cross Attention (DCA) model to adaptively choose between cross-attended or unattended features based on whether the modalities exhibit strong or weak complementary relationships. Specifically:

- A conditional gating layer is introduced for each modality to evaluate the contribution of the CA and select cross-attended features only when there are strong complementary relationships, otherwise select unattended features. 

- The gating layer outputs probabilistic attention scores indicating relevance of cross-attended or unattended features. These scores are used to modulate the features before fusion.

- This adds flexibility to CA frameworks to deal with weak complementary issues while retaining benefits of strong relationships.

Main Contributions:

- First work to investigate and address the issue of weak complementary relationships in audio-visual fusion for person verification.

- Proposal of a DCA model to adaptively select cross-attended or unattended features based on complementary relationships.

- Experiments on Voxceleb1 dataset demonstrate consistent improvements over CA variants and state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the paper makes audio-visual fusion more robust to weak complementary issues by proposing a dynamic cross attention mechanism to choose the most relevant features across modalities.
