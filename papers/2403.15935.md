# [Sample and Communication Efficient Fully Decentralized MARL Policy   Evaluation via a New Approach: Local TD update](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15935)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for cooperative agents under the actor-critic framework. A key component is the MARL policy evaluation (PE) problem where agents cooperate to evaluate the value function of global states for a given policy.  

- A critical challenge in MARL-PE is reducing the sample and communication complexities, defined as the number of samples and communication rounds needed for convergence. 

- One idea to reduce communication is to allow multiple local temporal difference (TD) update steps between communications. But it's unclear if this is valid due to potential "agent drift" from heterogeneous rewards.

Main Question:
- Can the local TD-update approach achieve low sample and communication complexities for solving the MARL-PE problem?

Solution:
- The paper focuses on MARL-PE with average rewards, motivated by problems that care about long-term average performance. 

- It proposes an algorithm with periodic communications and multiple TD updates in between.

- Theoretical analysis shows that up to Θ(1/√ε log(1/ε)) local TD steps can be taken while still ensuring an ε-convergence guarantee. 

- This gives a communication complexity of Θ(1/√ε log(1/ε)) and matches the state-of-the-art sample complexity of Θ(1/ε log2(1/ε)).

Contributions:
- First work to show local TD-updates are effective in reducing communication for MARL-PE with convergence guarantees.

- Establishes upper bounds on sample and communication complexities.

- Shows the approach matches state-of-the-art sample complexity and significantly improves communication complexity.

- Provides theory and experiments on both synthetic and real-world tasks to validate the performance.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in analyzing and demonstrating the effectiveness of local TD-updates to reduce communication requirements for decentralized cooperative MARL policy evaluation.
