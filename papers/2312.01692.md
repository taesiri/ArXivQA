# [Risk-Controlling Model Selection via Guided Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01692)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key ideas from the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach for selecting machine learning model configurations that balance multiple conflicting objectives such as accuracy, fairness, robustness, and efficiency. The key idea is to combine Bayesian Optimization (BO) with statistical testing procedures to identify configurations that adhere to user-specified risk limits while optimizing other metrics. Specifically, the authors introduce the notion of a "region of interest" in the objective space that focuses the search to configurations likely to be both valid under the risk constraints and useful for the free objectives. Their BO method recovers the part of the Pareto front intersecting this region. The resulting configurations are then statistically tested using techniques from multiple hypothesis testing to provide finite-sample guarantees. By focusing the optimization and narrowing down the set of configurations needing rigorous testing, the approach is more efficient and identifies highly performing verified configurations under practical budget constraints. Experiments across various tasks and desiderata demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework for controlling different notions of risk like fairness, robustness to spurious correlations, rate-distortion tradeoffs, and computational costs.
