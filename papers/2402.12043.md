# [A Lightweight Parallel Framework for Blind Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12043)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods rely on complicated deep neural networks like CNNs or transformers, which significantly increases the number of parameters and computational complexity. Two-stage methods also require more training time and resources. There is a need for an accurate yet lightweight BIQA method.

Method: 
The paper proposes a lightweight parallel framework (LPF) for BIQA consisting of three main components:

1) Feature Embedding Network (FEN): A simple yet effective network to transform visual features extracted from a VGG16 encoder to generate latent representations containing salient distortion information.

2) Self-supervised Auxiliary Tasks: Includes a sample-level category prediction task for coarse-grained quality perception and a batch-level quality comparison task to augment training data and enhance robustness. 

3) Distortion-aware Quality Regression Network (DaQRN): Simulates the human visual system with a weight stream to adaptively weight distortion impact and a score stream to predict quality scores. DaQRN applies an element-wise multiplication on the outputs of the two streams to predict final scores.

The three components are trained in parallel with respective loss functions. FEN is constrained by the auxiliary tasks to produce robust latent representations. Only FEN and DaQRN are used at test time.

Main Contributions:

- Lightweight parallel BIQA framework with significantly lower complexity than CNN/transformer-based methods

- Simple yet effective FEN to generate distortion-aware latent representations

- Novel self-supervised tasks for coarse-grained quality perception and data augmentation

- DaQRN's novel design simulates human visual system for accurate quality prediction 

- Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks with lower computation and faster inference

The proposed LPF sets a new state-of-the-art for efficient yet accurate BIQA methods.
