# [Automatic Report Generation for Histopathology images using pre-trained   Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06176)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Histopathology images are very high resolution, making it challenging to apply standard deep learning methods for tasks like disease classification and image captioning. Current methods rely on patching images into smaller parts, which loses overall context.

- Automatic report generation for histopathology images would be useful for assisting physicians, image retrieval, and standardizing clinical vocabularies. However, existing image captioning methods don't work well on high-res histopathology images.

Method:
- The authors propose using a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture called Hierarchical Image Pyramid Transformer (HIPT) to encode full histopathology slide images into a compact representation. 

- HIPT was originally trained in a self-supervised way on histopathology slides to create multiscale representations looking at both cell-level and tissue-level features.

- For caption generation, HIPT is used to encode 4096x4096 patches from a slide. The [CLS] tokens from the ViT layers are concatenated to create a slide-level representation.

- This representation is combined with a lower-magnification thumbnail image encoded by ResNet-18. The combined representation is fed into an LSTM decoder to generate captions.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates that a self-supervised ViT can effectively encode full high-res histopathology images for the downstream task of automatic caption generation, overcoming limitations of patching.

- Achieves strong quantitative results (BLEU score) competitive with prior captioning methods that rely on patching.

- Provides visualizations of model attention to show it is focusing on relevant regions of the image to generate captions.

- Proposes caption generation as a self-supervised task to create richer representations combining images and text for other downstream tasks.

Limitations:
- Uses limited single sentence descriptions rather than full diagnostic reports. More complex decoders would be needed for longer text.

- Testing was limited to a specific histopathology image dataset. More evaluation is needed for real clinical deployment.

In summary, the key innovation is using a ViT encoder to effectively distill full histopathology slide context for image captioning, demonstrated through quantitative results and visualizations. The self-supervised representation learning paradigm is promoted as an alternative to patching images.
