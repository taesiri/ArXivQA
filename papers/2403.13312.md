# [LeanReasoner: Boosting Complex Logical Reasoning with Lean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13312)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with complex logical reasoning tasks due to issues like logical inconsistencies where the model makes statements not grounded in the premises. 
- Existing approaches that combine LLMs and symbolic solvers rely on pre-defined, static solving methods that have limited reasoning capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes LeanReasoner, a framework that uses Lean (a theorem proving language) to address the limitations of LLMs in logical reasoning.
- Natural language logical reasoning problems are formalized into Lean theorems. By proving or disproving the theorems using Lean's logic foundations, the model can logically solve these problems.
- An LLM is used to dynamically generate Lean proof tactics based on the goals, allowing more adaptive and capable reasoning compared to static solvers.

Key Contributions:
- Shows that incorporating mathematical theorem proving data into pretraining improves an LLM's ability to logically reason, achieving near state-of-the-art accuracy on ProofWriter and state-of-the-art on FOLIO.
- Provides an analysis of different proof annotation styles, finding that a more concise style works better.
- Makes available new annotated logical reasoning data in Lean, comprising 100 ProofWriter and 27 FOLIO problems with formalizations and proofs.
- Demonstrates the promise of integrating LLMs with theorem provers like Lean to advance complex logical reasoning. The adaptive proof search empowers more capable reasoning.

In summary, the paper introduces LeanReasoner which achieves excellent performance by dynamically generating Lean tactics to logically solve problems, enabled by mathematical theorem proving data. This highlights the potential of combining LLMs and theorem provers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces LeanReasoner, a framework that uses the Lean theorem prover to formalize natural language logical reasoning problems into theorems and then leverages large language models fine-tuned on theorem proving data to search for proofs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the FOLIO dataset with minimal in-domain training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. This is the first attempt to use Lean, traditionally associated with mathematical theorem proving, for natural language logical reasoning. It highlights a possible intersection between mathematical theorem proving and logical reasoning.

2. The paper reveals that incorporating pretraining data from mathematical theorem proofs enhances the development of a more effective solver for logical reasoning compared to previous techniques. Additionally, this approach enabled achieving SOTA results on the FOLIO dataset. 

3. The paper makes available the training data accumulated in this research, comprising 100 Lean-formalized logic reasoning problems from ProofWriter, along with 27 analogous formalizations from FOLIO. The corresponding proofs in Lean are also included.

So in summary, the key contributions are using Lean for natural language logical reasoning, showing that pretraining on math theorem proving data helps performance, and releasing new training data to enable further research. The state-of-the-art results on the FOLIO dataset are also an important outcome highlighted.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What are the key strengths and weaknesses of the lean-based reasoning approach proposed in this paper? How does it compare to alternative theorem proving frameworks or large language model-based reasoning approaches? 

2. How scalable is the lean-based reasoning approach? What evidence is provided in the paper regarding the ability to handle more complex reasoning tasks compared to existing methods? What are the key challenges for scaling this approach up?

3. How robust is the method to variations in how the natural language context and questions are formalized into Lean code? What analysis was done in the paper regarding errors or inconsistencies in formalization?

4. How sensitive are the results to the choice of annotation style for the training data (intuitive vs concise proofs)? Is there an optimal balance? How might the annotation style interact with model choice?

5. Could this method be improved by incorporating commonsense knowledge and world facts into the Lean formalization process? What challenges would need to be overcome to integrate such factual knowledge effectively?  

6. What was the reasoning behind pretraining on mathematical theorem proving data? Does pretraining on other types of symbolic reasoning data boost performance in different ways?

7. What types of logical reasoning problems does this lean-based approach currently struggle with? Are there certain conceptual limitations? How could the approach be adapted to tackle a broader scope of reasoning problems?

8. Could this method be enhanced by dynamically selecting the most effective tactics during the proof search rather than simply generating via LLMs? What role could more active learning play?

9. How robust are the learned representations of logical and linguistic concepts acquired by this approach? Could analyzing these representations shed light on the strengths or biases of the system?

10. How does the amount and style of fine-tuning data impact the types of tactics generated and strategies adopted during proof search? Does this correlate with human reasoning patterns in interpretable ways?
