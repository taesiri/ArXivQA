# [LeanReasoner: Boosting Complex Logical Reasoning with Lean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13312)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with complex logical reasoning tasks due to issues like logical inconsistencies where the model makes statements not grounded in the premises. 
- Existing approaches that combine LLMs and symbolic solvers rely on pre-defined, static solving methods that have limited reasoning capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes LeanReasoner, a framework that uses Lean (a theorem proving language) to address the limitations of LLMs in logical reasoning.
- Natural language logical reasoning problems are formalized into Lean theorems. By proving or disproving the theorems using Lean's logic foundations, the model can logically solve these problems.
- An LLM is used to dynamically generate Lean proof tactics based on the goals, allowing more adaptive and capable reasoning compared to static solvers.

Key Contributions:
- Shows that incorporating mathematical theorem proving data into pretraining improves an LLM's ability to logically reason, achieving near state-of-the-art accuracy on ProofWriter and state-of-the-art on FOLIO.
- Provides an analysis of different proof annotation styles, finding that a more concise style works better.
- Makes available new annotated logical reasoning data in Lean, comprising 100 ProofWriter and 27 FOLIO problems with formalizations and proofs.
- Demonstrates the promise of integrating LLMs with theorem provers like Lean to advance complex logical reasoning. The adaptive proof search empowers more capable reasoning.

In summary, the paper introduces LeanReasoner which achieves excellent performance by dynamically generating Lean tactics to logically solve problems, enabled by mathematical theorem proving data. This highlights the potential of combining LLMs and theorem provers.
