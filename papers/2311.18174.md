# [Packrat: Automatic Reconfiguration for Latency Minimization in CPU-based   DNN Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18174)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Packrat, a system that optimizes the configuration of CPU-based deep neural network (DNN) serving to minimize inference latency. Packrat is built on the insight that using all available threads for intra-operator parallelism provides diminishing returns, while using all threads for multi-instance parallelism is also suboptimal. Instead, Packrat combines selective profiling and a 2D dynamic programming-based knapsack algorithm to determine the best combination of concurrent model instances, degree of intra-op parallelism per instance, and batch size per instance to minimize end-to-end batch latency. The paper evaluates Packrat on ResNet-50, Inception-v3, BERT and GPT-2 models using PyTorch and TorchServe, showing 1.43-1.83x lower latency averaged across batch sizes versus default configurations that maximize intra-op parallelism. A key contribution is dynamically reconfiguring the serving system online to maintain optimal configurations as workloads change over time. Overall, Packrat pushes the performance limits of DNN serving on multicore CPUs through an automated approach that balances intra-op and multi-instance parallelism.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

Sys automatically determines the optimal configuration of model instances, threads per instance, and batch size per instance for DNN serving on a CPU server in order to minimize inference latency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is presenting Packrat, a system that can automatically determine the optimal configuration (number of instances, threads per instance, batch size per instance) for serving deep neural network (DNN) models on multi-core CPUs in order to minimize inference latency. Specifically:

- Packrat shows that using all available threads for intra-operator parallelism within a single "fat" instance provides diminishing returns on latency reduction. Similarly, using the maximum possible number of instances with 1 thread each is also not optimal.

- Instead, Packrat uses a combination of limited profiling and a 2D dynamic programming knapsack algorithm to determine the partitioning of available threads and batch size across multiple "thin" instances that minimizes overall latency.

- Packrat can reconfigure the system online to adapt the configuration when batch sizes change due to shifts in request arrival rate. This is done using an "active-passive" scaling technique to avoid downtime.

- Evaluation shows that across several models, Packrat improves inference throughput by up to 2x and latency by up to 1.5x compared to default configurations that maximize intra-op parallelism, for batch sizes in a practical range.

In summary, the key innovation is an automated approach to determine and adapt the optimal tradeoff between intra-op and inter-instance parallelism for low-latency DNN serving on multi-core CPUs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key insight behind Packrat's approach to optimize CPU-based inference? Why does running multiple model instances each with smaller batch sizes and fewer threads provide better latency compared to a single instance with all threads?

2. How does Packrat formulate the problem of finding the optimal <instances, threads, batch size> (itbtb) configuration as a multi-dimensional knapsack problem? What is being minimized and what are the constraints? 

3. Explain Packrat's dynamic programming based algorithm to solve the multi-dimensional knapsack problem. In particular, what is the meaning and derivation of the opt[t,b] table? 

4. Packrat's optimizer runs in pseudo-polynomial time. What is the runtime complexity and why is this acceptable? Could you modify the algorithm to run in polynomial time?

5. When running multiple model instances concurrently, Packrat observes a gap between expected and actual speedup. What are the two main reasons for this performance gap? How does Packrat analyze this gap quantitatively?

6. What techniques does Packrat use to handle configuration changes without stalling the serving system? Explain the active-passive scaling mechanism. What are its advantages over naive reconfiguration approaches?

7. How does Packrat estimate the batch size for an online inference workload? Why is conservative reconfiguration important and how does the batch size estimator try to achieve this?

8. How does the degree of speedup using Packrat differ between inference-only microbenchmarks and end-to-end experiments? What additional factors come into play for end-to-end serving workloads?

9. The paper hypothesizes that directly modeling resource contention in Packrat's optimizer may not change the selected configurations. Do you agree? Why or why not? What experiment could you run to test this hypothesis?

10. How do you expect upcoming CPU architectural improvements in areas like memory bandwidth, vector units and model size to interact with Packrat? Would you need to modify Packrat to take advantage of them and if so, how?
