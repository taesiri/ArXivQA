# [EBFT: Effective and Block-Wise Fine-Tuning for Sparse LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12419)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for fine-tuning sparse language models (LLMs) often require large datasets and computing resources, rely on approximations that lead to suboptimal solutions, or use costly full retraining. This poses challenges for efficiently fine-tuning pruned LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose EBFT, an efficient block-wise fine-tuning framework for sparse LLMs that requires only a small calibration dataset. 
- EBFT can be integrated with any pruning technique. It defines a block-wise reconstruction error and optimizes it directly via backpropagation to achieve an optimal and convergent solution.  
- EBFT fine-tunes on a block level rather than layer level, allowing better exploration of the solution space.

Main Contributions:
- EBFT achieves state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks, outperforming prior fine-tuning techniques.
- It requires only 256 samples from C4 for calibration, significantly reducing data and resource requirements.
- Entire fine-tuning of 7B parameter Llama takes only 30 mins on a single 16GB GPU, demonstrating high efficiency.
- Detailed experiments show EBFT's robustness across varying sparsity levels, calibration samples, pruning methods, and in comparison to weight tuning vs mask tuning.
- EBFT also surpasses Low-Rank Adaptation, achieving better performance with 10x speedup and lower overall costs.

In summary, EBFT enables efficient and low-cost fine-tuning for sparse LLMs, achieving optimal solutions with minimal calibration data and outperforming prior state-of-the-art techniques. Its efficiency, low resource requirements and strong performance are its main strengths.
