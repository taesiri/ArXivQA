# [PSC-CPI: Multi-Scale Protein Sequence-Structure Contrasting for   Efficient and Generalizable Compound-Protein Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the challenging problem of compound-protein interaction (CPI) prediction, which aims to predict the interaction pattern (e.g. contact map) and strength (e.g. binding affinity) between chemical compounds and protein targets. This is an important problem in rational drug discovery for high-throughput virtual screening of drug candidates. However, existing methods have two major limitations: (1) They rely only on a single modality of protein sequence or structure, lacking joint modeling of multimodal dependencies. This leads to performance drops in real-world scenarios with missing modalities or domain shifts. (2) They model proteins at a single fixed scale, neglecting fine-grained multi-scale information in key protein fragments.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a multi-scale Protein Sequence-Structure Contrasting (PSC) framework for CPI prediction, called PSC-CPI. It has three key components:
(1) Length-variable protein augmentation to generate subsequences and subgraphs of different lengths, allowing contrasting at multiple scales.
(2) Intra-modality contrasting to capture multi-scale information within each protein modality.  
(3) Cross-modality contrasting to model sequence-structure dependencies across modalities.

This framework pre-trains sequence and structure encoders via contrasting objectives. During inference, it works on either modality alone or both modalities jointly, offering flexibility. To evaluate model generalizability, the test set is split into four settings based on compound/protein novelty.

Main Contributions:
(1) A new sequence-structure contrasting framework to capture multi-scale information and cross-modality dependencies for superior CPI prediction.
(2) State-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, especially on the most challenging unseen protein and compound setting. 
(3) Flexibility to work with single or multiple modalities during inference, unlike prior arts.
(4) Better generalizability across diverse test scenarios with unseen compounds or proteins.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in developing a flexible and generalizable multimodal framework for CPI prediction that captures richer information via contrasting. Experiments demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance.
