## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the abstract, here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper presents an updated version (WeatherBench 2) of an existing benchmark dataset for evaluating global weather forecasting models. The original WeatherBench was released in 2020, so this represents an update to build on that prior work.- The goal is similar to the original WeatherBench - to provide a standardized framework for evaluating and comparing different models/approaches for global weather forecasting. However, it seems WeatherBench 2 puts more emphasis on supporting probabilistic forecasting methods and including more operational forecast verification practices.- The paper compares performance of both physical/dynamical models like ECMWF's IFS and recent data-driven approaches. This allows for direct comparison between traditional and ML-based methods. Other recent papers have focused more specifically on either dynamical or ML models.- The benchmark includes both deterministic and probabilistic skill metrics. Some related works have focused mainly on deterministic metrics for comparing ML approaches. The inclusion of proper scoring rules like CRPS represents an advancement.- The authors use ERA5 reanalysis as ground truth for evaluation. Some other recent works have used different datasets or actual observations. There is a tradeoff between ease of use and accuracy of the "truth" dataset.- Compared to benchmarks focused on a specific region or variable, this is meant to provide a broad overview of model performance across many important weather metrics. Others have pitched more application-specific benchmarks.- Overall it seems to incorporate established forecast verification methodology while also supporting newer ML techniques. The versioned, open-source approach could allow the benchmark to evolve alongside advances in the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Incorporating station observations and other direct measurements into the evaluation framework, in addition to the ERA5 reanalysis dataset currently used. This could provide more accurate ground truth data, especially for precipitation.- Putting more emphasis on evaluating extreme weather events and high-impact variables. The current metrics focus more on average statistics over the full spatial and temporal domain. Targeted metrics for extremes using larger sample sizes would be beneficial.- Expanding the set of probabilistic verification metrics beyond CRPS and spread/skill ratio. The authors mention multivariate metrics, spatial/temporal correlations, and metrics focused on extremes as worthwhile directions. - Comparing "pure" data-driven models against physical models with state-of-the-art statistical post-processing. This could reveal insights about the relative strengths/weaknesses and appropriate roles for data-driven versus physical modeling approaches.- Evaluating different probabilistic forecast representations used in data-driven modeling, from ensemble approaches to directly parameterized distributions. Determining the most suitable representations for different end use cases through collaboration with forecast users.- Continuing to expand the benchmark dataset with additional metrics, models, and case studies. Making the framework flexible and community-driven to accommodate new developments in ML-based weather forecasting.In summary, the main themes are improving evaluation realism, expanding probabilistic assessment, comparing modeling approaches, tailoring benchmarks to applications, and evolving the benchmarks over time. The authors lay out a good roadmap for developing more comprehensive, robust, and practically useful benchmarks as data-driven weather forecasting matures.
