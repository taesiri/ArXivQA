# WeatherBench 2: A benchmark for the next generation of data-driven
  global weather models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the main research goals of this paper appear to be:1) To introduce WeatherBench 2, an updated benchmark for evaluating global medium-range (1-14 day) weather forecast models, especially data-driven AI models. WeatherBench 2 aims to provide a standardized framework for model evaluation and comparison. 2) To describe the design principles, evaluation metrics, datasets, baselines, and current state-of-the-art results for WeatherBench 2.3) To discuss current limitations and challenges for data-driven weather forecasting, such as the need for probabilistic forecasts, improved evaluation of extremes, and operational-quality initial conditions.Overall, the main research contribution seems to be the introduction and description of WeatherBench 2 as a dynamic benchmark for global weather forecasting models. The authors aim to provide an evaluation framework that can evolve along with advances in data-driven modeling. The paper presents initial results but focuses more on laying out the principles and components of WeatherBench 2.
