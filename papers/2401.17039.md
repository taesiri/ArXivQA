# [Taking Action Towards Graceful Interaction: The Effects of Performing   Actions on Modelling Policies for Instruction Clarification Requests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17039)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Clarification requests (CRs) are important for resolving ambiguities and misunderstandings in instruction following, but current neural models struggle to learn good policies for deciding when and what to clarify. 
- Existing CR datasets have limitations in scale or ecological validity. The multimodal CoDraw dataset contains naturally occurring CRs, but baseline models perform poorly on predicting CRs.
- A key limitation of existing models is the "overhearer" paradigm - they passively observe dialogues rather than actively participate, which may limit learning.

Proposed Solution:
- Implement more realistic "action-taker" models that play CoDraw by taking actions, while also predicting CRs via multi-task learning. 
- Test 3 hypotheses: (1) Action-takers learn better CR policies than overhearers; (2) Action-takers show less certainty in predictions at CR turns; (3) Action-taking improves predicting what to clarify.
- Architectures use Transformers to contextually encode gallery, text embeddings and scenes. Output probabilities for turn-level "when to ask" CRs and object-level "what to ask".

Key Contributions:  
- Formalize tasks of "when to ask" and "what to ask" for CRs in CoDraw.
- Show action-taking helps more for "what to ask", less so for "when to ask" policies.  
- Find action-takers show statistically significant differences in certainty at CR turns/objects. But scores alone don't predict CRs well.
- Performance gains over baseline are modest, suggesting limits of supervised imitation for learning meta-communication acts. 
- Recommend more work on intrinsic evaluation via RL and better understanding of internal model states related to CRs.

In summary, the paper provides evidence that current techniques have limitations in capturing human CR strategies from data. More investigation into intrinsically motivated agents is needed rather than directly imitating surface patterns.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper investigates the effects of incorporating action-taking in learning policies for deciding when and what to clarify regarding instructions in a dialogue game, finding limited contribution for deciding when but more positive effects for deciding what to ask.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Implementing a more well-motivated model for learning policies for deciding when to ask instruction clarification requests (iCRs) in the CoDraw multimodal dialogue game. This includes enhancements like incorporating the gallery, using contextual word embeddings, better scene representations, attention mechanisms, and action prediction.

2) Defining and modeling the task of predicting what to ask about in iCR turns. This is framing the problem not just as when to ask iCRs but also what objects/attributes need clarification.

3) Testing three hypotheses regarding the effect of action-taking in learning iCR policies in CoDraw. This includes analyzing if action-taking leads to better performance in predicting when and what to ask iCRs, and if action prediction certainty correlates with the need for iCRs.

4) Providing further evidence that current neural models still struggle to fully capture human iCR strategies from limited dialogue data. The results show that action-taking has a limited contribution for the when to ask task. The paper discusses implications such as the need to move beyond imitation learning approaches for meta-communication acts like clarification requests.

In summary, the main contribution is advancing the understanding around learning clarification request policies from human dialogue data, by implementing an enhanced model tailored to CoDraw and testing assumptions regarding the utility of action-taking for this problem.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Clarification requests (CRs)
- Instruction following 
- Dialogue games
- CoDraw dataset
- When to ask CRs
- What to ask about in CRs 
- Overhearer models
- Action-taker models
- Meta-communication acts
- Graceful interaction
- Imitation learning
- Reinforcement learning

The paper examines the effects of having models perform actions on their ability to learn policies for deciding when and what to ask for clarification in the CoDraw instruction following game dataset. It compares overhearer models that just observe dialogues to action-taker models that also take game actions, testing hypotheses about whether action-taking improves performance on the tasks of predicting when and what to clarify. The key goals are understanding why current models struggle with learning clarification strategies from dialogue data and discussing limitations of simply imitating human clarification behavior.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that Clarification Requests (CRs) are important for graceful human-AI interaction, but even state-of-the-art models struggle to properly produce or interpret them. Why do you think current models have difficulty with this important aspect of dialogue?

2. The paper tests 3 hypotheses concerning the effects of action taking as an auxiliary task on modeling CR policies. Can you explain the intuition behind why action taking was expected to help? Why might actively taking actions provide a better signal than just passively observing actions?  

3. The paper concludes there is limited evidence that action taking contributes substantially to learning CR policies. Do you have any ideas for why the contribution was not as significant as initially hypothesized? Could the sparse action space or other dataset characteristics be a factor?

4. The paper finds that prediction certainty differs for cliparts/turns subject to CRs versus those that are not. Do you think uncertainty is a promising signal for intrinsically probing where models need clarification? How might we leverage such implicit signals?

5. Learning to take actions did help more with determining "what to ask about". Why do you think the impact was more significant for this sub-task than the overall "when to ask" policy? 

6. The paper discusses how most current approaches use an "overhearer" paradigm rather than having models directly participate. Do you think being an authentic dialogue participant rather than observer could substantially change what is learned about CR strategies? Why?

7. The performance gains in the paper are modest despite seemingly better motivated techniques. Do you think supervised imitation learning is sufficient for meta-communication phenomena like CRs? Might reinforcement learning or other approaches be more suitable?

8. The paper argues that ambiguity naturally arises in dialogue due to competing pressures. Rather than viewing CRs as a "problem", how might we instead see them as an expected solution mechanism that emerges through joint effort? 

9. The instruction giver in CoDraw does not observe the follower's actions. How does this asymmetry in common ground compare to other instruction following datasets? Do you think it makes the CR phenomena in CoDraw more or less challenging to model?

10. The paper analyzes the underlying CR policies that emerge in a situated, goal-oriented dialogue game. Do you think the phenomena studied would substantially differ in less goal-directed conversation? How might that impact approaches to modeling CRs?
