# [Evaluation of large language models for assessing code maintainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12714)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can be used to assess the maintainability of source code. Specifically, it examines the assumption that the cross-entropy between code generated by an LLM and the actual code can indicate potential quality issues. The research question is whether cross-entropy is associated with code maintainability aspects like readability, understandability, complexity, and modularization at the class level.

Methods
The authors compute the cross-entropy between 304 Java classes and code generated by 10 different LLMs (based on GPT-2 and Llama-2). They investigate the correlation between cross-entropy and expert ratings of maintainability aspects for these classes provided in an existing dataset. Features examined are cross-entropy, number of logical lines of code (LLOC), and expert ratings on a Likert scale for readability, understandability, complexity, modularity, and overall maintainability.

Results
- Controlling for LLOC, higher cross-entropy is associated with lower maintainability ratings. Without controlling for LLOC, the relationship is reversed.
- LLOC is a stronger predictor of maintainability than cross-entropy alone. Using both features does not significantly improve prediction over using LLOC alone.
- The complexity of LLMs does not significantly impact their usefulness for this task.

Limitations
- Only 10 LLMs based on GPT-2 and Llama-2 were examined.
- Ground truth maintainability assessments have potential quality issues. 
- The assumption that LLM generated code represents optimal maintainability is untested.

Conclusions
Cross-entropy is predictive of maintainability when controlling for LLOC, but LLOC remains the stronger predictor. The results show the potential for using LLMs as maintainability oracles, but more research is needed to apply them effectively in practice.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:

Controlling for lines of code, cross-entropy between code generated by language models and actual code is a predictor of software maintainability, but alone may be insufficient to accurately assess maintainability compared to other metrics like lines of code.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

An empirical evaluation of using the cross-entropy between code generated by large language models (LLMs) and actual code as a predictor of code maintainability at the class level. Specifically:

- They investigate the association between cross-entropy (computed by 10 different LLMs based on GPT-2 and Llama-2) and expert assessments of code maintainability aspects (readability, understandability, complexity, modularization, overall maintainability) on a dataset of 304 Java classes. 

- They find that when controlling for lines of code (LLOC), higher cross-entropy is associated with lower maintainability ratings. However without controlling for LLOC, the association is reversed.

- LLOC remains a stronger predictor than cross-entropy alone. Adding cross-entropy to LLOC does not significantly improve classification performance for the maintainability aspects.

- The complexity/size of the LLMs does not have a major impact on the predictive ability using cross-entropy.

So in summary, the main contribution is an empirical evaluation showing cross-entropy can be a predictor of maintainability when controlling for size, but has limitations compared to using more traditional metrics like LLOC.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Code maintainability
- Cross-entropy 
- Logical lines of code (LLOC)
- Readability
- Understandability 
- Complexity
- Modularization
- Software quality assessment
- Counterfactual code generation
- Pretrained models (e.g. GPT-2, Llama-2)
- Machine learning classifiers (e.g. logistic regression, random forest, SVM)

The paper investigates using the cross-entropy between code generated by LLMs and actual code as a predictor of various code maintainability aspects. It uses a dataset with expert assessments on code maintainability to evaluate this, and compares performance to simply using the number of logical lines of code. The key goal is assessing whether LLMs can act as "oracles" for evaluating subjective code qualities like maintainability.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares the cross-entropy between the probability of the generated token and the actual code as an indicator of code maintainability. What are some potential limitations or drawbacks of using cross-entropy at the class level for this purpose?

2. The paper finds conflicting results regarding the association between cross-entropy and maintainability ratings before and after controlling for lines of code (LLOC). What could explain this discrepancy and how might the authors further investigate the potential confounding effect of LLOC?  

3. The authors use chunking to accommodate model input length restrictions. Could this approach introduce any systematic bias into the cross-entropy calculations? If so, how might the authors mitigate this?

4. What other pretrained language models besides GPT-2 and Llama-2 could the authors experiment with? Would models specifically fine-tuned on code provide better performance?  

5. The paper evaluates the method using expert annotations of maintainability aspects from an existing dataset. What would a human evaluation look like to complement this analysis? How could generated and actual code be evaluated comparatively?  

6. Beyond cross-entropy, what other metrics could be extracted from language models to indicate code quality issues? Could textual explanations also be leveraged?

7. The paper focuses on class-level analysis. Would the proposed method work equally well for shorter (method-level) or longer (system-level) code segments? What adjustments might be required?

8. What threats to external validity exist in evaluating the approach on a single dataset of 304 Java classes? How could the validation be expanded to support broader claims of effectiveness?  

9. The paper finds model complexity does not impact results. Is it possible the models are still not complex enough? At what parameter count might gains be observed from larger models?

10. The paper frames language models as oracles containing knowledge of good coding practices. What evidence exists to support or refute this view? How does generated code quality actually compare to human-written code?
