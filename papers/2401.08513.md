# [X Hacking: The Threat of Misguided AutoML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08513)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper introduces the concept of "explanation hacking" or "X-hacking", which refers to deliberately searching for and selecting machine learning models that produce a desired explanation to support a pre-specified conclusion, while maintaining reasonably good predictive performance. 
- This is a form of p-hacking applied to explainable AI (XAI) metrics such as Shapley values. 
- The increasing demand for model interpretability and "data-driven" decisions creates an incentive for such manipulation of explanations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper shows how an automated machine learning (AutoML) pipeline can be used to perform "Shapley hacking" at scale to find models that support a desired narrative by exploiting the variability and non-uniqueness of Shapley values.
- The trade-off between explanation and accuracy is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, allowing an unscrupulous analyst to select trained models from a Pareto front of feasible solutions.
- Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the feasibility of easily finding models with contrary explanations by running off-the-shelf AutoML tools.  

Main Contributions:
- Introduces the concept of X-hacking as a threat enabled by progress in AutoML and XAI.
- Shows the ease of manipulating model explanations using standard tools. 
- Discusses the implications for credibility and reproducibility of XAI research.
- Suggests possible methods for detection and prevention.
- Argues that researchers should adopt rigorous standards to ensure validity of explanations.

In summary, the paper highlights the potential for manipulation of model explanations through selective reporting, enabled by AutoML, and discusses solutions to promote credibility of XAI.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces the concept of using automated machine learning to deliberately search for and select machine learning models that produce desired explanations supporting pre-specified conclusions, a practice termed "explanation hacking", and demonstrates the feasibility of this approach while discussing ethical implications and potential detection methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing the concept of "explanation hacking" or "X-hacking", which refers to deliberately searching for and selecting machine learning models that produce a desired explanation according to some XAI metric (like SHAP values), while maintaining acceptable predictive performance. This is presented as a form of p-hacking applied to XAI.

2) Demonstrating the feasibility of X-hacking through empirical experiments using off-the-shelf AutoML and XAI software on real-world datasets. The experiments show how SHAP values can be manipulated by searching over different modeling pipelines.

3) Formulating the trade-off between predictive accuracy and desired explanations as a multi-objective optimization problem, allowing an adversary to select models from a Pareto front of "defensible" solutions.

4) Discussing the concept of model/pipeline "defensibility" and how it relates to detectability of X-hacking. More defensible models may be harder to identify as resulting from a manipulated search process.

5) Suggesting possible methods for detection and prevention of X-hacking, such as visualizing the distribution of XAI metrics over likely modeling pipelines.

6) Arguing that researchers should be aware of the potential for XAI manipulation and adopt standards to ensure validity and reliability of explanations. Overall highlighting X-hacking as an important issue for the credibility of XAI research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- X-hacking: A form of p-hacking applied to XAI metrics like Shapley values to find "defensible" models that produce a desired explanation while maintaining performance.

- Explainability hacking/explanation hacking: The practice of deliberately searching for and selecting models to produce a desired explanation for an XAI metric.

- Automated machine learning (AutoML): Tools and frameworks to automate parts of the machine learning pipeline like feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning.

- Shapley values: A model-agnostic explainability method to understand feature importance and model behavior.

- Confirmatory data analysis: The practice of analyzing data to confirm a pre-specified conclusion or explanation. 

- Selective reporting: Only reporting favorable outcomes from a larger set of analyzed outcomes.

- Fairwashing: Manipulating explanations of ML models to make them seem more fair or unbiased than they actually are.

- Multi-objective optimization: Optimizing for multiple objectives like accuracy and desired explanations. Helps explore accuracy-explanation tradeoffs.

- Defensible models: Models whose decisions could be reasonably justified to peers, e.g. based on performance or alignment with common practices.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper introduces the concept of "X-hacking" to describe a form of p-hacking applied to XAI metrics. What are some key differences between traditional p-hacking and X-hacking? How might the properties of XAI metrics like Shapley values make them more vulnerable to manipulation compared to traditional stats?

2) The paper discusses "defensible" models that an adversarial researcher could justify to peers while still achieving a confirmatory explanation. What constitutes a "defensible" model and what strategies could a researcher use to construct a plausible search space? How could the definition of "defensible" models change between domains?

3) The trade-off between accuracy and desired explanation is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. What are some pros and cons of using a weighted sum scalarization approach versus other multi-objective optimization techniques in this context? How sensitive is the choice of weighting factor Î»?

4) The paper argues some datasets are more "vulnerable" to manipulation than others due to redundancy among features. How is the potential for manipulation formally related to concepts like multicollinearity? What dataset characteristics correlate with increased vulnerability? 

5) The results show variability in the ability to manipulate rankings of top feature importances across datasets. What factors might explain why some datasets exhibit more stability in rankings while others permit manipulation - is it complexity, size, noise levels or something else?

6) The paper suggests detection methods like plotting the distribution of XAI metrics over an AutoML search. What are the main challenges and limitations of manual and automated detection? How well could these detect a sophisticated adversary?

7) How far could more complex ensemble, neural network or boosting models increase the search space and "degrees of freedom" for an adversary compared to simpler models examined here? What new detection challenges might arise?

8) The paper argues model-agnostic explainability metrics incentivize new forms of misconduct. Could tailoring the choice of explanation method to model family constrain manipulation? What issues might this approach face? 

9) The experiments here focus on manipulating Shapley values. How difficult is it to extend the X-hacking framework to other model-agnostic (LIME, anchors) or model-specific (feature importance, attention weights) explainability metrics?

10) The paper stops short of providing tools for hackers. What are ethical implications of demonstrating vulnerabilities without prescribing solutions? How could researchers ethically disclose risks to spur progress on countermeasures?
