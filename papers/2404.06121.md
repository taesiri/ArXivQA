# [Detection of fields of applications in biomedical abstracts with the   support of argumentation elements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06121)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Searching for specific information in biomedical literature is challenging. Focusing on particular facts instead of full text can help. 
- Argumentative elements allow focusing on specific parts of a paper, e.g. background or claims by the authors. 
- The paper evaluates argumentative elements for detecting fields of application (e.g. disease diagnosis or drug development) in biomedical publications.

Proposed Solution:
- Experiments using PubMedBERT model fine-tuned on a corpus for detecting fields of application in abstracts. 
- Comparison of using full abstract versus only argumentative elements from tools like ArguminSci, HSLN and MARGOT.
- New corpus of ~2k abstracts with 8 application field labels compiled from reports on non-animal models.

Main Contributions:
- Compilation of a new corpus with abstracts labeled for fields of application. Will be released publicly. 
- Evaluation of several argument mining tools for the task of detecting application fields.
- Best results using 'conclusion' elements from HSLN tool. Top F1 scores ranged from 0.22 to 0.84 depending on application field.  
- Argumentative elements related to conclusion and background sections were most useful overall.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that argumentative elements can help focus on relevant facts for tasks like detecting fields of application in biomedical text. A new labeled corpus is introduced and various argument mining tools are evaluated for this problem.
