# [RePre: Improving Self-Supervised Vision Transformer with Reconstructive   Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06857)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we incorporate fine-grained local feature learning into self-supervised vision transformers that are trained with contrastive learning? 

The key points are:

- Contrastive learning frameworks for self-supervised vision transformers mainly rely on a global image understanding through an instance discrimination pretext task. 

- The authors propose to add a reconstruction branch that predicts raw RGB pixel values, in order to learn local features that can benefit downstream tasks like detection and segmentation.

- They introduce two main components: using multi-hierarchy features from the transformer encoder to provide supervision, and a lightweight convolutional decoder to fuse the features.

- Experiments show performance gains across various contrastive learning methods and architectures on ImageNet classification. The learned representations also transfer better to COCO object detection and Cityscapes segmentation.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that adding a reconstruction objective to contrastive self-supervised learning can improve vision transformers by incorporating more local fine-grained features, while still retaining the global understanding. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a method called Reconstructive Pre-training (RePre) to incorporate fine-grained local feature learning into self-supervised vision transformers. This is done by adding a branch for reconstructing raw image pixels in parallel with the existing contrastive learning objective. 

2. Using multi-hierarchy features from different layers of the transformer encoder to provide rich supervision signals for reconstruction. This helps overcome the limitation of using only the last layer's features.

3. Designing a lightweight convolutional decoder to integrate the multi-hierarchy features and reconstruct the raw pixels. This avoids over-focusing on low-level features.

4. Showing that RePre brings consistent improvements to various contrastive learning methods and vision transformer architectures on ImageNet classification. It also improves transfer learning performance on object detection, segmentation and other dense prediction tasks.

5. Demonstrating that reconstructive pre-training can be effectively incorporated into contrastive learning frameworks for self-supervised visual representation learning. This provides a new direction beyond solely relying on contrastive objectives.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and validating an effective approach to combine reconstructive and contrastive objectives for pre-training vision transformers in a self-supervised manner. The method is shown to improve representation learning on multiple benchmark tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Reconstructive Pre-training (RePre), a method that extends contrastive self-supervised learning frameworks for vision transformers by adding a branch to reconstruct raw image pixels using a lightweight convolutional decoder and multi-level features from the transformer encoder.
