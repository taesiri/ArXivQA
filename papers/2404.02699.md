# [Scalable Model Editing via Customized Expert Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02699)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Scalable Model Editing via Customized Expert Networks":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like Llama suffer from issues like toxic responses, factual inaccuracies, and outdated knowledge. Fine-tuning LLMs to address these issues is computationally expensive. 
- Existing model editing methods have limitations in reliability, generality, and locality when editing LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Scalable Model Editing via Customized Expert Networks (SCEN), a two-stage continuous training approach for efficient and robust model editing.

- Stage 1: Train a separate lightweight "expert network" customized for each sample that needs to be edited. Experts are stored externally.

- Stage 2: Train an "indexing neuron" corresponding to each expert to control when the expert is activated. The neurons are dynamically added and merged into the model during sequential editing.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces the two-stage SCEN approach for scalable model editing that trains customized editors per sample.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in editing two Llama models (7B, 13B) for question answering and hallucination mitigation tasks.

- Shows SCEN meets key criteria - reliability, generality, locality in editing. Neurons ensure precise expert activation without interfering with unrelated samples.

- Analyzes model layers to validate factual knowledge is stored in the higher layers of transformer-based LLM architectures.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative editing approach that is customizable, robust and efficient for updating knowledge issues in large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It introduces SCEN, a novel two-stage continuous training paradigm for model editing, which trains a customized expert network for each sample to be edited, and uses a scalable dynamic neuron indexing mechanism to activate the corresponding experts.

2. It conducts experiments on two different sizes of large language models (Llama2-7B and 13B) on two tasks - question answering and hallucination mitigation. The results demonstrate that SCEN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing mainstream model editing methods. 

3. It provides an in-depth exploration of the mechanisms underlying the storage of factual knowledge within large language models based on the transformer architecture. The research makes a contribution towards enhancing the interpretability of such models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage continuous training paradigm involving training lightweight expert networks. What are the key advantages of training specialized experts tailored to each sample compared to modifying the base model directly?

2. The scalable neuron indexing mechanism activates the relevant expert for each sample. How does this approach help mitigate issues like catastrophic forgetting and interference between edits? 

3. What motivated the design choice of storing the experts externally and using neurons to index them, rather than integrating the experts directly into the model architecture? What are the trade-offs?

4. The paper emphasizes generalizability as an important criteria for model editing. In what ways does the proposed method aim to improve generalization to similar queries during the editing process?

5. Could the proposed approach be extended to other modalities like computer vision? What changes would need to be made to the training procedure and architecture?

6. The activation threshold hyperparameter influences the balance between reliability, generality and locality. What is the sensitivity of model performance to this parameter based on the analysis? 

7. For what types of factual knowledge would you expect this approach to be more or less effective compared to existing methods? When might other techniques be preferred?

8. The paper analyzes which layers are most amenable to editing in the LLMs. What explanations are provided for why higher layers were found to be better targets?

9. What are some ways the storage and computational expenses could be further optimized, such as through weight compression of the experts?

10. How well would the proposed approach likely extend to sequential editing scenarios requiring updating much larger numbers of queries? What scalability challenges need to be addressed?
