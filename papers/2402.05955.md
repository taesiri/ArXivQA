# [A Hyper-Transformer model for Controllable Pareto Front Learning with   Split Feasibility Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05955)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-objective optimization problems aim to optimize multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously. Finding the Pareto-optimal set that represents the tradeoffs between objectives is challenging, especially when constraints further limit the feasible region.
- Prior work on controllable Pareto front learning (CPFL) uses hypernetworks to map preference vectors to Pareto-optimal solutions. However, they don't handle split feasibility constraints that bound the objectives.
- Learning disconnected Pareto fronts found in real-world problems is also difficult for existing methods.

Proposed Solution: 
- Formulate the CPFL problem with split feasibility constraints using scalarization theory and split feasibility problem. Objectives are bounded within box constraints that decision-makers can control.
- Propose a hypernetwork based on Transformer architecture (Hyper-Transformer) for this problem. Compare it to prior MLP-based hypernetwork.
- For learning disconnected Pareto fronts, propose two Hyper-Transformer variants:
   1) With joint input of preference vector and lower bounds 
   2) With mixture of experts, where each expert focuses on one Pareto front component

Main Contributions:
- Formulate and solve the CPFL problem with split feasibility constraints using hypernetworks
- Propose Hyper-Transformer solution and show its superiority over Hyper-MLP
- Provide theoretical analysis of Hyper-Transformer's approximation capability 
- First work to address controllable disconnected Pareto front learning
- Show strong empirical performance on both connected and disconnected MOO problem benchmarks
- Demonstrate Hyper-Transformer's effectiveness on multi-task learning problems

The summary covers the key aspects of the paper - the problem, proposed solution and contributions. It describes the concepts and solutions at a high-level without getting into technical details, allowing a human to fully understand the essence of the work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a hypernetwork based on transformer architecture to achieve controllable Pareto front learning with split feasibility constraints for both connected and disconnected Pareto fronts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

1. Expressing a split multi-objective optimization problem and focusing on solving the controllable Pareto front learning problem with split feasibility constraints based on scalarization theory and the split feasibility problem. This allows decision-makers to control resources and provide more optimal criteria for the Pareto solution set.

2. Proposing a novel hypernetwork architecture based on a transformer encoder block for the controllable Pareto front learning problem with split feasibility constraints. The proposed model shows superiority over MLP-based designs for multi-objective optimization and multi-task learning problems. 

3. Integrating joint input and a mix of expert architectures to enhance the hyper-transformer network for learning disconnected Pareto fronts. This helps bring great significance to promoting other research on the controllable disconnected Pareto front of the hypernetwork.

In summary, the main contributions are around proposing a hyper-transformer model for controllable Pareto front learning with split feasibility constraints, showing its superior performance over MLP-based models, and enhancing it to handle disconnected Pareto fronts.
