# [Adversarial Medical Image with Hierarchical Feature Hiding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01679)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from this paper:

This paper investigates why medical adversarial examples are more easily detected than natural image adversarial examples. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, the authors show that adversarial attacks consistently optimize vulnerable features towards outlier regions in the feature space. A stress test further reveals that medical image features are much more vulnerable to such manipulation compared to natural images. To exploit this vulnerability, the authors propose a novel Hierarchical Feature Constraint (HFC) that can be added to existing attacks to hide adversarial examples by constraining their features to lie close to the distribution of normal sample features. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed HFC helps conventional attacks bypass state-of-the-art adversarial example detectors more effectively than previous adaptive attacks. This exposes deficiencies in current medical adversarial defense methods that rely solely on detecting outliers, while also revealing the greater vulnerability arising from lack of robustness in medical models. The authors hope their analysis helps motivate more robust medical models and defenses in the future.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates why medical adversarial examples are easier to detect than natural ones, reveals the greater vulnerability of medical image features that can be exploited to hide adversarial attacks, and proposes a novel constraint term to help conventional attacks bypass state-of-the-art medical adversarial example detectors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1) It theoretically and empirically investigates why medical adversarial examples are easier to detect in feature space compared to natural image adversarial examples. It proves that adversarial attacks tend to optimize features in a consistent direction, pushing them to be outliers. It also shows through experiments that medical image features are more vulnerable and get pushed further out compared to natural images. 

2) It proposes a novel "hierarchical feature constraint" (HFC) that can be added to existing white-box attacks to help adversarial examples avoid detection. The HFC term encourages the adversarial features to move towards the distribution of normal/clean features.

3) Extensive experiments validate that the proposed HFC helps adversarial attacks bypass multiple state-of-the-art adversarial detectors for medical images, within a small perturbation budget. This reveals deficiencies in current medical image defenses that rely only on detecting outliers.

4) Comparisons show HFC is superior to other adaptive attacks that also aim to manipulate features to avoid detection. Evaluations are performed on multiple datasets, models, and perturbation budgets.

5) Analysis shows medical images are more vulnerable than natural images, allowing more room for manipulation. This highlights the importance of improving robustness of medical models.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and validating HFC to help reveal limitations of medical adversarial defenses, while inspiring more robust defenses to be developed in the future.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Adversarial examples (AEs) - Maliciously crafted inputs that fool deep neural networks into making incorrect predictions. A major security concern for AI systems.

- Medical image analysis - Applying deep learning for tasks like medical image segmentation, disease diagnosis, and landmark detection. Shows vulnerability to adversarial attacks.  

- Reactive defense - Defenses that aim to detect adversarial examples after they have been crafted, by analyzing patterns in the feature space.

- Outlier detection - A type of reactive defense that looks for outliers in the feature space distribution. Used to identify adversarial examples. 

- Hierarchical feature constraint (HFC) - The proposed method in this paper for hiding adversarial examples by constraining them to remain close to the normal feature distribution. Makes attacks harder to detect.

- Robustness of medical image models - This paper argues medical models are more vulnerable to attacks than natural image models. Improving robustness is important for safe clinical deployment.

- Limitations of current adversarial defenses - By successfully hiding attacks, this paper demonstrates deficiencies in current outlier-based detection defenses for medical images.

The core focus is on evaluating and improving methods for crafting adversarial attacks on medical images that can bypass common reactive detection defenses, in order to demonstrate their limitations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a "hierarchical feature constraint (HFC)" to hide adversarial examples in the feature space of deep neural networks. Can you explain in detail how the HFC term is formulated and optimized during the attack process? 

2. The key idea behind HFC is to model the distribution of normal features using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and push adversarial features towards high-density GMM regions. What are the motivations and intuitions behind this idea? How does it help hide adversarial features?

3. The paper shows medical images are more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than natural images. What analysis and experiments support this claim in the paper? Why do you think medical images are more vulnerable?

4. How does the proposed HFC attack differ from other adaptive attacks that aim to manipulate features like the "random guide" attack and attacks using KDE/LID constraints? What are the advantages of HFC over them?

5. The GMM modeling in HFC has a hyperparameter M denoting the number of Gaussian components. How does this hyperparameter impact attack success and how is an appropriate M value selected empirically? 

6. Can you explain the process of generating adversarial examples using HFC in detail? What existing attacks can HFC easily integrate with and how easy is it to adapt attacks to use HFC?

7. The paper shows 3D medical volumes are more vulnerable than 2D slices. What dimensions are compared and what explanations support greater 3D vulnerability? How is this hypothesis further validated?

8. What evaluation metrics are used to measure attack success for classifiers and detection methods? Why are both classifier accuracy and detector AUC metrics needed to fully evaluate attacks?

9. How difficult is it to apply the proposed HFC attack under a semi-whitebox setting where the classifier details are unknown? Does HFC transfer effectively to unseen victim models? 

10. The paper shows potential for HFC to detect real out-of-distribution data. Can you explain this experiment in detail and discuss the possibility of extending HFC for anomaly detection?
