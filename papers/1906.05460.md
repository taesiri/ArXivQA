# [Factorized Mutual Information Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05460)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It studies factorized versions of multi-information (I) and mutual information (MI) as proxies that are easier to estimate and optimize. - It defines the factorized multi-information (FMI) as the average mutual information between all pairs of variables in a system. - It defines the separated factorized mutual information (SFMI) as the average mutual information between pairs of variables from two subsets.- It investigates the sets of distributions that maximize FMI and SFMI.- A main result is that FMI maximizers coincide with multi-information maximizers if the set of variable pairs forms a connected covering. - SFMI maximizers form unions of transportation polytopes containing some MI and multi-information maximizers.- The central hypothesis seems to be that FMI and SFMI can serve as tractable proxies for optimizing multi-information and mutual information in applications like reinforcement learning.In summary, the main research questions are:1) How do the maximizers of FMI and SFMI relate to maximizers of I and MI? 2) Can FMI and SFMI serve as useful proxies for I and MI optimization in applications?The theoretical results characterize the maximizing sets and their relationships. The potential applications provide motivation for studying these proxies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:- Defining and analyzing two new factorized measures of multi-information: the factorized multi-information (FMI) and the separated factorized mutual information (SFMI). These are proxies for the multi-information and mutual information that may be easier to compute and estimate from samples.- Characterizing the sets of maximizers for FMI and SFMI. In particular, showing that maximizers of FMI agree with maximizers of multi-information. While maximizers of SFMI form transportation polytopes that contain some maximizers of mutual information. - Providing interpretations of FMI and SFMI in terms of specifying certain marginal distributions. The maximizers correspond to joint distributions compatible with maximally informative margins.- Discussing the optimization of mutual information in machine learning contexts using factorized proxies like SFMI. The proxies provide computationally cheaper alternatives that may still optimize mutual information well in practice.In summary, the main contribution seems to be introducing these new factorized information measures, analyzing their theoretical properties, and discussing their potential usefulness for optimizing mutual information in machine learning applications.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related research:- It focuses on characterizing the maximizers of factorized versions of multi-information, specifically the factorized multi-information (FMI) and separated factorized mutual information (SFMI). Much of the prior work has focused just on characterizing the maximizers of multi-information itself.- The paper builds on previous results about maximizing multi-information and divergence from exponential families. It cites several key papers that laid the groundwork for understanding maximizers of multi-information.- A novel contribution is the detailed analysis of how the maximizers of FMI and SFMI relate to maximizers of multi-information and mutual information. Prior work did not examine these specific factorized measures.- The characterization of SFMI maximizers as unions of transportation polytopes seems to be new. The paper goes into mathematical details about properties of these polytopes.- The motivating application of using factorized mutual information for reinforcement learning relates this work to a body of research using information theory concepts in RL. The specific idea of using SFMI as an intrinsic reward appears novel.- The paper is theoretical in nature, focused on characterizing sets of probability distributions. It does not provide empirical validation or experiments demonstrating the usefulness of FMI/SFMI.Overall, this paper makes incremental contributions building on a foundation of information theory and divergence maximization research. The focus on factorized versions of multi-information and connections to transportation polytopes provide new insights relative to prior work. More empirical validation of the proposed measures would strengthen the paper.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Generalizing the analysis to other families of margins beyond the FMI and SFMI cases studied in detail. The authors suggest it should be possible to characterize the maximizing sets for more general choices of margins $\Lambda$.- Studying inhomogeneous systems where the variables have different numbers of states. The authors note that their analysis focused on the case of equal state spaces for simplicity, but extending the characterization to inhomogeneous variables would be interesting.- Considering continuous variables. The paper focused on discrete probability distributions, but studying factorized measures for continuous variables is noted as an avenue for future work. - Relating the structure of SFMI maximizers to different pairings between the X and Y variables. The specific SFMI measure studied corresponds to one perfect matching between X and Y variables. The authors suggest studying how SFMI maximizers relate for other pairings. - Investigating how to choose margins $\Lambda$ to capture desired MI maximizers. Since FMI/SFMI maximizers don't contain all MI maximizers, an open question is how to select margins to tightly capture a given subset of MI maximizers.- Applications as intrinsic rewards in reinforcement learning. The authors motivate the factorized measures as easier to compute alternatives to MI for use as intrinsic rewards. Further study of the performance in this application is suggested.So in summary, the main directions mentioned are: considering more general margin specifications, extending to inhomogeneous/continuous variables, relating different SFMI pairings, choosing margins to capture MI maximizers, and applications to reinforcement learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper studies factorized measures of multi-information, defined as averages of the multi-information over subsets of variables. It focuses on two cases - the factorized multi-information (FMI), which is the average mutual information of all pairs of variables, and the separated factorized mutual information (SFMI), which is the average mutual information of pairs of variables with one from each of two random vectors. The paper characterizes the maximizers of FMI and shows they coincide with the maximizers of multi-information. It also characterizes the maximizers of SFMI, showing they form transportation polytopes containing some maximizers of multi-information and mutual information. The SFMI serves as a computationally simpler proxy for optimizing mutual information that provides a more structured objective than directly maximizing mutual information.
