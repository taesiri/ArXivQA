# [DuPL: Dual Student with Trustworthy Progressive Learning for Robust   Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11184)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using only image-level labels is challenging due to the ambiguity in the initial class activation maps (CAMs). 
- Existing one-stage methods suffer from confirmation bias where incorrect pseudo-labels reinforce themselves during concurrent CAM generation and segmentation training. This impairs segmentation performance. 
- Recent methods use high/fixed thresholds to filter unreliable regions in CAMs, failing to utilize sufficient supervision. Discarded pixels often exist in ambiguous areas where supervision is most needed.

Method: 
- Proposes a dual student architecture with two subnets that provide pseudo-labels for each other to alleviate confirmation bias. A discrepancy loss encourages diversity.  
- Progressive learning strategy to introduce more pixels using dynamic threshold adjustment and adaptive noise filtering based on segmentation loss distribution.
- Consistency regularization on filtered regions to comply with smoothness assumption and provide supervision.

Main Contributions:
- Explores the limitation of CAM confirmation bias in one-stage weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods.
- Dual student architecture to provide cross-supervision with each other's CAMs, reducing over-activation.
- Trustworthy progressive learning to utilize more pseudo-labels by dynamic thresholding and adaptive noise filtering.
- Consistency regularization on discarded pixels to exploit their potential, motivated by "every pixel matters".
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance among one-stage methods on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets. Comparable to multi-stage methods.
