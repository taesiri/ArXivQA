# Language Is Not All You Need: Aligning Perception with Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we align visual perception with large language models to create multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can perceive, reason about, and generate responses for multimodal inputs?Some key points about the research question:- The paper aims to connect language, visual perception, action, and world modeling as a step toward artificial general intelligence. - It proposes training a multimodal large language model called Kosmos-1 from scratch on web-scale multimodal corpora.- Kosmos-1 is intended to natively support multimodal tasks like visual question answering and image captioning, in addition to language tasks.- The goal is to enhance language models with visual perception abilities to create models that can both see (perceive visual inputs) and talk (generate textual outputs).- This involves aligning visual perception modules with a Transformer-based language model decoder to create a general multimodal interface.- The research tests how well Kosmos-1 can perform on language, vision, and multimodal tasks in zero-shot and few-shot settings without any gradient updates or fine-tuning.In summary, the central research question is about advancing from large language models (LLMs) to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by aligning visual perception abilities with language models to allow them to handle multimodal inputs and tasks. The paper proposes and tests the Kosmos-1 model as an approach to accomplish this alignment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing and evaluating a multimodal large language model called Kosmos that can perceive and process different modalities like text, images, etc. The key ideas include:- Training the model on large multimodal corpora containing text, image-caption pairs, and interleaved text and images. This allows the model to learn alignments between text, images, and other modalities.- Using a Transformer-based architecture with modifications like Magneto and xPos to enable stable and effective training. The model can take in text, images, and other inputs and generate text outputs.- Evaluating the capabilities of Kosmos across a diverse set of tasks involving language, vision, reasoning, etc. without any gradient updates or fine-tuning. The model shows strong performance on language tasks, vision-language tasks like captioning and VQA, reasoning tasks, and even an IQ test.- Demonstrating new capabilities like multi-turn multimodal interactions, non-verbal reasoning on IQ tests, and handling vision tasks through natural language prompting/instructions.- Analyzing cross-modal transfer e.g. from language to vision tasks through instruction tuning, and from vision to language tasks through improved commonsense reasoning.Overall, the key contribution seems to be proposing Kosmos, a multimodal LLM trained on large-scale web data, that can handle a diverse set of language, vision, and reasoning tasks in a unified manner. The work shows the promise of aligning perception with LLMs to create capable multimodal LLMs.
