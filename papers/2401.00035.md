# [Learning About Structural Errors in Models of Complex Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00035)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Complex dynamical systems like turbulent flows, climate models, etc have a vast range of dynamically important scales. It is infeasible to resolve all scales numerically. 
- Unresolved small scales are represented via semi-empirical closure models that have structural errors due to lack of scale separation, limited data use, etc. 
- Structural errors lead to biased model predictions. Correcting closure models using data is critical but challenging.

Proposed Solution: 
- Incorporate structural error models within the closure models instead of external bias correction. This facilitates physical constraints, stability, interpretability.
- System state now evolves based on physical model + internal structural error models. Mismatch with data arises from these structural error models.
- Calibrate error models using direct data (like model residuals) or indirect data (like statistics of model trajectories) which map indirectly to errors.
- Use derivative-free Ensemble Kalman Inversion for calibration with indirect data. Add constraints like sparsity, conservation laws.  
- Construct error models using dictionaries, Gaussian processes or neural networks. Make them stochastic or non-local.

Main Contributions:
- Principles and algorithms for learning about internal structural error models, highlighting direct/indirect data use, gradient vs derivative-free optimization, constraints, error model construction.
- Numerical demonstrations of various concepts based on Lorenz-96 model.
- Guidelines to construct complex error models - stochastic, non-local. Demonstrate merits on multiscale Lorenz-96 system.
- Demonstrate trajectory fitting by data assimilation for non-ergodic dynamics using glucose-insulin system.

In summary, the paper provides an overarching framework and methodology for learning structural error models with constraints to improve complex dynamical system predictions.
