# [Learning About Structural Errors in Models of Complex Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00035)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Complex dynamical systems like turbulent flows, climate models, etc have a vast range of dynamically important scales. It is infeasible to resolve all scales numerically. 
- Unresolved small scales are represented via semi-empirical closure models that have structural errors due to lack of scale separation, limited data use, etc. 
- Structural errors lead to biased model predictions. Correcting closure models using data is critical but challenging.

Proposed Solution: 
- Incorporate structural error models within the closure models instead of external bias correction. This facilitates physical constraints, stability, interpretability.
- System state now evolves based on physical model + internal structural error models. Mismatch with data arises from these structural error models.
- Calibrate error models using direct data (like model residuals) or indirect data (like statistics of model trajectories) which map indirectly to errors.
- Use derivative-free Ensemble Kalman Inversion for calibration with indirect data. Add constraints like sparsity, conservation laws.  
- Construct error models using dictionaries, Gaussian processes or neural networks. Make them stochastic or non-local.

Main Contributions:
- Principles and algorithms for learning about internal structural error models, highlighting direct/indirect data use, gradient vs derivative-free optimization, constraints, error model construction.
- Numerical demonstrations of various concepts based on Lorenz-96 model.
- Guidelines to construct complex error models - stochastic, non-local. Demonstrate merits on multiscale Lorenz-96 system.
- Demonstrate trajectory fitting by data assimilation for non-ergodic dynamics using glucose-insulin system.

In summary, the paper provides an overarching framework and methodology for learning structural error models with constraints to improve complex dynamical system predictions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a comprehensive framework and algorithms for learning structural error models within complex dynamical systems models, using various approaches including dictionary learning, Gaussian processes, neural networks, stochastic processes, and non-local dependencies to represent errors, and employing both direct and indirect data with ensemble Kalman inversion for model calibration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper summarizes principles and algorithms for learning about structural error models in complex dynamical systems. The main contributions include:

1) Comparing internal (embedded in the model) and external (added at the output) approaches to modeling structural errors, and advocating for the internal approach. 

2) Discussing construction of error models using dictionaries, Gaussian processes, and neural networks, including non-local and stochastic extensions.

3) Demonstrating calibration of error models from direct or indirect data using derivative-free optimization methods like ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI). This includes handling constraints and unknown initial conditions.

4) Using Lorenz 96 models and a glucose-insulin model as examples to showcase the proposed principles and algorithms for learning error models, with a focus on the benefits of stochastic, non-local, and constrained error models.

In summary, the paper provides a systematic framework and guidelines for learning about and correcting structural errors in complex dynamical system models by fusing data with domain knowledge encoded in approximate physical models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the internal model error approach proposed here differ philosophically from the external model error approach of Kennedy and O'Hagan? What are some of the key advantages and disadvantages of each?

2. This paper discusses both direct and indirect data for calibrating internal error models. In what types of applications might direct data be unavailable or difficult to obtain? When might indirect data be preferred even if direct data is available?

3. The paper highlights the importance of stability when using neural networks or other flexible function approximators as internal error models. What are some strategies discussed to promote stability? How might these strategies limit model expressivity? 

4. What is the motivation for using non-local error models? In what types of systems might non-local dependencies be important to capture? How does the convolution-based approach attempt to capture these?

5. Stochastic error models are proposed to account for effects of unresolved scales/information. In what types of systems might deterministic closure models fail? What are some challenges in fitting stochastic models to data?

6. This paper leverages ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) for derivative-free optimization. What are some of the advantages of EKI over gradient-based approaches? What are some strategies for imposing constraints within the EKI framework?

7. For non-ergodic systems, the paper uses data assimilation along with EKI for model inference. Why is this advantageous over simply appending the initial condition as a model parameter? What types of DA methods are amenable to this approach?

8. Sparse regularization is used to identify parsimonious error models. What is the motivation for sparse structural error models? What thresholding approach is used here to promote sparsity? How might the regularization parameters be selected?

9. The paper highlights the importance of conservation principles and other physical constraints in error model design. How are such constraints imposed in the proposed framework? What types of physical principles might be important to enforce for a specific application?

10. The method leverages the multiscale Lorenz 96 system and a glucose-insulin model as test problems. What aspects of the method are illustrated by each of these example problems? How might the approach need to be adapted for more complex spatially extended systems?
