# [Large Human Language Models: A Need and the Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07751)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Language is an expression of human thoughts, emotions and experiences. To truly understand language, we need to model the human context i.e. the personal, social and situational attributes of the person generating the language.  
- Large language models (LLMs) like BERT and GPT-3 have become the foundation of most NLP systems today. But they only model language in the context of neighboring words, and do not capture the human context.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors advocate for developing large "human" language models (LHLMs) that integrate rich human contexts directly into language model training. 

Main Contributions:

Position 1) Include human context in LM training:
- Motivation: Treat texts from a person as inter-dependent based on their shared human context to avoid "ecological fallacy". 
- Challenges: Architectural decisions, model scaling, data processing of long historical texts.
- Possible solutions: Add human context vector to word vectors or compose it similar to position embeddings. Use recurrence over blocks.

Position 2) Recognize people are more than their groups:  
- Motivation: Represent human context as a mixture of factors, not discrete groups. Capture breadth across human diversity.
- Challenges: Limited datasets, privacy issues, model scalability.
- Possible solutions: Text-based human attribute inference, strict policies to prevent misuse, avoid separate model per user.

Position 3) Model dynamic and temporal nature of human context:
- Motivation: Human states change over time influencing language. Capture changing states. 
- Challenges: Temporal gaps in data, modeling complex temporal dynamics.
- Possible solutions: Objectives predicting language after temporal intervals, not just immediate context.

By developing LHLMs using these guidelines, we can create language models that better capture the essence of human communication.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The authors advocate for developing large language models that incorporate rich, dynamic representations of human context, arguing this is key to better understanding human language while also raising challenges around effectively modeling and applying such human-centered information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is advocating for the development of large human language models (LHLMs) that incorporate rich, dynamic human contexts into language model training. Specifically, the paper puts forward three key positions:

1. LM training should include the human context: The authors argue that language models should be conditioned not just on the text itself but also on representations of the human context (e.g. author traits, states, demographics, etc.) that generated the text. This allows models to better capture dependencies between texts from the same individual.

2. LHLMs should recognize that people are more than their groups: The human context should cover the breadth of human diversity, recognizing that people have complex mixed memberships rather than belonging to discrete groups. This includes modeling the intersectionality of factors, graded memberships, as well as unique individual traits. 

3. LHLMs should account for the dynamic, temporal nature of human contexts: Human states and contexts change over time. LHLMs should use recurrent mechanisms and leverage temporally ordered texts to capture this important dynamic aspect.

The paper lays out motivation, challenges, and possible solutions for each of these positions. Overall, it makes the case that incorporating rich, multidimensional, and temporally varying human contexts is key to language models better capturing and understanding human language.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Large human language models (LHLMs)
- Human context
- Static human traits 
- Dynamic human states
- Temporal modeling
- Personalization
- Privacy
- Representational disparities
- Intersectionality of human factors
- Ecological fallacy
- Theory of mind
- Pre-training objectives
- Downstream applications

The paper advocates for integrating rich "human contexts" into large language models to better understand human language. It discusses the motivation, challenges, and potential solutions around three key positions:

1) Including human context directly in language model training 
2) Recognizing that people are more than just the groups they belong to
3) Accounting for the dynamic and temporally-dependent nature of human contexts

Concepts like privacy, scalability, downstream usage of the models, and ethical considerations are also touched upon. Overall, the goal is to work towards large "human" language models that can truly capture the complexity of human language and behavior.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper advocates for including the human context directly in language model training. What are some of the key challenges in representing the human context effectively and incorporating it into the training process of large language models?

2. When modifying transformer-based architectures for integrating the human context, what are some of the key architectural decisions one needs to make in terms of which layers to modify, where to include the human context, and how to potentially alter the self-attention mechanism?

3. For applying pre-trained large human language models to downstream tasks, what are some of the strategies discussed in the paper in terms of fine-tuning approaches and processing of the downstream task data?

4. To handle long historical texts of users when capturing rich human contexts, what are some of the mechanisms and design considerations discussed for overcoming the limitations of transformer self-attention for long sequences?

5. The paper argues that people are more than the groups they belong to. What are some ways discussed to capture the richness and diversity of human contexts beyond discrete groups? What are some data and modeling challenges involved?

6. What are some of the privacy and ethical concerns involved in modeling personal human characteristics and what solutions are discussed in the paper to address them? 

7. To build scalable models that can capture unique individual contexts of users, what architectural design choices are explored in existing literature and what open questions remain?

8. Why does the paper argue for modeling the dynamic and temporal aspects of human contexts? What are some past approaches that try to model this temporality?

9. What kinds of datasets are needed to effectively model the changing human states and behaviors over time? What data challenges does it raise? 

10. Beyond positional encodings in transformers, what additional mechanisms may be needed to allow models to explicitly capture and utilize temporal information associated with user texts over time?
