# [Design2Code: How Far Are We From Automating Front-End Engineering?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03163)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Implementing visual designs of websites into functional code is challenging as it requires understanding visual elements/layouts and translating them into structured code. This prevents many people from building their own web apps even if they have good ideas/designs.

- Effective automatic generation of code from visual designs can democratize front-end web development and allow non-experts to build web apps more easily. However, prior works have been limited to simplistic designs.

Method:
- The authors formalize the problem as \modelname (Design2Code) - taking a screenshot as input and generating code that renders the webpage. 

- They introduce a new realistic benchmark with 484 diverse real-world webpages as test cases, along with a suite of automatic metrics to evaluate generated code quality.

- They develop prompting methods to elicit capabilities of multimodal models like GPT-4V and Gemini, including text-augmented prompting and self-revision prompting.

- They also fine-tune an open-source 18B parametric model called \texttt{\modelname}-18B which matches Gemini Pro Vision's performance.

Results:
- GPT-4V performs the best, with 49% of its generated pages considered interchangeable with reference pages by humans, and 64% preferred over references.

- The text-augmented prompting is shown to be effective in improving performance of both GPT-4V and Gemini. Self-revision helps for GPT-4V.

- Analysis shows main weaknesses are in recalling all elements and getting layout designs correct. Text content and coloring improve well via finetuning.

Main Contributions:
- Realistic benchmark and automatic metrics for \modelname
- Novel prompting methods that improve multimodal LLM performance 
- Competitive open-source model via finetuning that matches Gemini Pro Vision
- Extensive analysis quantifying current capabilities and limitations


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a new benchmark for automatically generating HTML and CSS code to render a webpage from its screenshot, benchmarks current multimodal models on this task, and finds GPT-4V can generate usable code for nearly half of diverse real-world webpage examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper include:

1. Formalizing the Design2Code task of generating code implementations from webpage screenshots, and constructing a new benchmark (the Design2Code benchmark) with 484 diverse, real-world webpage examples for evaluating models on this task.

2. Developing a comprehensive suite of automatic evaluation metrics, including both high-level visual similarity and fine-grained element matching metrics, to assess how well models can reproduce the reference webpages. 

3. Proposing new multimodal prompting methods like text-augmented prompting and self-revision prompting that improve over direct prompting baselines on commercial models like GPT-4V and Gemini.

4. Contributing an open-source 18B finetuned model, Design2Code-18B, that matches the performance of Gemini Pro Vision on this benchmark. 

5. Conducting human evaluations showing that GPT-4V generates webpages considered interchangeable with 49% of reference webpages and better designed than 64% of reference webpages.

In summary, the key contribution is formalizing and benchmarking the Design2Code task with a new dataset, metrics, models, and human evaluation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Design2Code - The name of the task formalized in the paper, which is to generate code implementations from visual webpage designs. This is the core focus of the paper.

- Multimodal language models - The types of models used in the paper, which can process both visual and text inputs to generate text outputs. Examples mentioned include GPT-4V, Gemini, CogAgent.

- Real-world benchmark - The paper introduces a new benchmark of 484 real-world webpages to evaluate Design2Code models, in contrast to prior synthetic datasets.

- Automatic evaluation metrics - A suite of automatic metrics proposed to evaluate the visual similarity between generated and reference webpages, including element matching metrics.

- Human evaluations - Human studies conducted to compare model performance and directly assess the quality of generated webpages.

- Prompting methods - Different prompting strategies explored to improve model performance, like text-augmented prompting and self-revision prompting. 

- Model finetuning - Finetuning an open-source Design2Code-18B model on synthetic data that matches commercial models, enabling future open research.

In summary, the key focus is introducing the Design2Code task and benchmark, evaluating current multimodal LLMs on this task, and pointing to future work on improving autoregressive code generation from visual designs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new \modelname benchmark with 484 real-world webpage examples. What are some key differences between this benchmark and prior datasets like WebSight? What unique challenges does using real-world webpages introduce?

2. The paper develops a suite of automatic evaluation metrics beyond just code similarity, including both high-level visual similarity and low-level element matching scores. What are some pros and cons of these automatic metrics versus human evaluation? When would you trust one over the other?

3. The paper shows lower performance of commercial models like GPT-4V on automatic metrics versus human preference scores. What might explain this discrepancy? Does this suggest any issues with the automatic metrics or human evaluation?

4. The paper introduces text-augmented prompting and shows improved performance over direct prompting. What might be the mechanisms behind this improvement? When would you expect text-augmentation to help versus not help?  

5. The self-revision prompting is shown to only help GPT-4V but not Gemini. What capabilities might self-revision require from the model? Why might GPT-4V have those capabilities more than Gemini?

6. The paper shows the difficulty of training on real-world webpage data. What are some potential reasons and solutions to make such training more stable and effective? What type of data cleaning or preprocessing might help?

7. The human evaluation shows high rates of GPT-4V generations being judged even better than original references. What might explain this counter-intuitive result? Does this suggest any issues with the human annotation protocol?

8. The analysis shows total numbers of HTML tags correlating with webpage difficulty. Are there any other proxy difficulty measures you might consider for analyzing model performance? What other factors might contribute to difficulty?

9. The paper releases an open-source Design2Code-18B model. What directions could future work take to improve this model, such as model architecture, training data, prompting techniques, etc? What performance gaps need to be addressed?

10. The paper focuses on static webpage generation. What are some key challenges in extending this benchmark to interactive, dynamic webpages? How would you modify the data, training, and evaluation protocols?
