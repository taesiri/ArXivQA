# [Avoiding Data Contamination in Language Model Evaluation: Dynamic Test   Construction with Latest Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12343)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Data contamination in evaluations is becoming more common as language models are pretrained on massive corpora. This leads to inflated metrics that do not accurately reflect model capabilities.  
- Existing benchmarks use online data and have high overlap with training corpora. Decontaminating them is extremely difficult and not possible for closed models.

Proposed Solution - LatestEval:
- Automatically create uncontaminated reading comprehension benchmarks using the most recent texts from the web. 
- Collect latest texts from arXiv, BBC and GitHub as passages.
- Extract key info like terminology definitions and summaries as answers. 
- Generate questions targeting the extracted info using templates and GPT-4.
- Remove explicit answers from passages to require reasoning rather than copy-pasting.

Main Contributions:
- First analysis of real Human-AI conversations to determine benchmark scope 
- Novel pipeline to leverage latest materials to avoid contamination
- New perplexity-based method to quantify contamination
- Experiments show models exhibit negligible memorization on LatestEval versus high memorization on existing benchmarks
- Enables fine-grained assessment on different comprehension abilities

In summary, LatestEval provides a dynamic benchmark that mitigates data contamination by only using recent texts, enabling more accurate evaluation of language model capabilities on reading comprehension.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing LatestEval, an automatic pipeline to construct reading comprehension benchmarks that leverage the latest online materials. This allows creating uncontaminated tests to evaluate language models, avoiding issues with data contamination from the training data. Key aspects of the contribution include:

- Conducting an analysis of real-world human-AI conversations to determine the scope and key information types to target in LatestEval. This aims to align the benchmark with practical needs. 

- Developing an automated pipeline to collect the latest texts from various online sources, extract key information from them to construct answers, and generate corresponding questions/queries.

- Demonstrating reduced risk of data contamination in LatestEval compared to existing benchmarks, through perplexity analysis and memorization tests on language models. 

- Evaluation experiments showing LatestEval can effectively differentiate between language models in terms of their reading comprehension and reasoning abilities.

So in summary, the main contribution is introducing LatestEval as a new methodology for creating dynamic reading comprehension benchmarks that avoid contaminated evaluation. The paper describes the motivation, scope, pipeline for automatic construction, and experiments validating reduced contamination risks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a dynamic test construction pipeline called LatestEval. What are the key motivations and advantages of using latest materials over existing static benchmarks? How does it help address the issue of data contamination?

2. The paper conducts an analysis of real-world Human-AI conversations to determine the scope of LatestEval. What are the most frequently asked query types identified from the analysis? How are they incorporated into the benchmark design? 

3. Explain the three main steps involved in the LatestEval pipeline - (i) collecting latest texts (ii) extracting key information as answers (iii) generating questions. What are some of the techniques used in each step?

4. The paper collects texts from 3 different sources - arXiv, BBC and GitHub. Why are these sources chosen? What kind of content do they cover and what are the advantages of using texts from these sources?  

5. For answer construction, 5 types of key information are extracted - terminology explanations, summarization, purpose, examples, future predictions. Explain how each of these are extracted from the passages using the proposed techniques.

6. Both rule-based methods and large language models are used for query construction. Compare and contrast these two approaches. What are some of the templates used for question generation?  

7. The paper proposes a perplexity-based analysis to quantify test set contamination. Explain how perplexity indicates the extent of memorization and data contamination. Discuss the findings from this analysis.

8. In the human evaluation, three key aspects are analyzed - faithfulness, answerability and copyability. What are some of the issues identified in each of these aspects? How can LatestEval be improved to address these?

9. The paper demonstrates that language models exhibit negligible memorization behaviors on LatestEval. What are the implications of this? How does it make LatestEval more robust compared to existing benchmarks?

10. LatestEval produces a dynamic benchmark with new test instances over time. Discuss some of the implementation challenges involved in continually updating the benchmark and how its scope can be expanded in future work.
