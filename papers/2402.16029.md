# [GraphWiz: An Instruction-Following Language Model for Graph Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16029)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graphs are an important data structure but large language models (LLMs) have not been well explored in their ability to understand and solve complex graph problems that require algorithms like shortest path. 
- Current methods rely on prompt design rather than model capabilities and have only been tested on small graphs.  
- There is no available open-source LLM specialized in solving various graph problems through explicit reasoning paths to enhance interpretability.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce GraphInstruct, a new instruction-tuning dataset with over 72K samples across 9 graph tasks of varying complexity.
- Use GraphInstruct to develop GraphWiz, an open-source LLM capable of explicit reasoning for graph problems. 
- Train GraphWiz with mixed-task instruction tuning then further optimize reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Key Contributions:
- First large-scale instruction tuning dataset designed to train language models to solve graph problems with explicit reasoning paths
- Introduce GraphWiz, the first open-source LLM outperforming GPT-4 in accurately solving various graph problems while generating clear reasoning processes 
- Show strong performance across multiple model architectures (LLaMA, Mistral) and analyze impact of training data volume, risk of overfitting, and transferability
- Offer new blueprint and insights for developing specialized LLMs with graph reasoning and problem solving abilities

In summary, the paper makes important contributions around data, methods, and analysis to significantly advance the capabilities of LLMs in the domain of complex graph problems and associated algorithms.
