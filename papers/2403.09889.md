# [Generalization of Scaled Deep ResNets in the Mean-Field Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09889)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- ResNets are powerful deep neural network architectures that have achieved great empirical success, but their generalization properties beyond the lazy training regime are rarely explored theoretically. 

- The paper aims to analyze the generalization of scaled ResNets in the mean-field regime, i.e. in the limit of infinitely wide and deep networks, where the parameters can move substantially during training.

Proposed Solution:
- The training dynamics of scaled ResNets in the mean-field regime are characterized by a partial differential equation (PDE) over the parameter distributions. 

- A key technique is providing a lower bound on the minimum eigenvalue of a time-varying, distribution-dependent Gram matrix that controls training speed. 

- This eigenvalue bound allows proving linear convergence of the training loss and bounding the KL divergence between parameter distributions before and after training.

- Finally, a generalization bound is established via Rademacher complexity, yielding an O(1/√n) convergence rate.

Main Contributions:
- First generalization analysis of scaled ResNets in the mean-field regime beyond lazy training.

- Introduction of time-varying, distribution-dependent Gram matrices to analyze training speed.

- Quantitative control of KL divergence between initial and trained parameter distributions.

- Proof that scaled ResNets achieve O(1/√n) generalization error for binary classification, matching classical results.

- The analysis provides new insights into fundamental properties of deep networks beyond the kernel regime.

In summary, the paper makes important theoretical progress in understanding generalization of scaled ResNets under a practical mean-field training regime. The techniques introduced pave the way for further analyses of deep network feature learning and generalization.
