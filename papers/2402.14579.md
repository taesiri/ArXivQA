# [Text Role Classification in Scientific Charts Using Multimodal   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14579)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Text role classification involves classifying the semantic role of text elements within scientific charts. It is an important task for building systems that can provide feedback to authors on the comprehensibility of charts in scientific papers. 
- While there has been some work on text role classification, performance on real-world charts extracted from publications is quite low compared to synthetic charts. 
- There is a lack of published work on the best methods for this task, especially using multimodal transformers that can capture text, image and layout information.

Proposed Solution:
- Finetune two pretrained multimodal document layout analysis transformers, LayoutLMv3 and UDOP, on chart datasets for text role classification. These models capture text, image and layout information.
- Evaluate whether data augmentation and class balancing techniques can further improve performance.
- Test model robustness on a synthetic noisy dataset and generalizability on 3 additional unlabeled real-world chart datasets that were manually annotated.

Contributions:  
- LayoutLMv3 outperforms UDOP on all experiments, achieving the highest F1-macro score of 82.87% on ICPR22, surpassing all baseline methods.
- Data augmentation and balancing improves UDOP's scores but only marginally for LayoutLMv3.
- LayoutLMv3 generalizes better on 3 additional chart datasets. The best F1-macro scores achieved are 95.60% on CHIME-R and 66.40% on EconBiz.
- LayoutLMv3 is more robust to noise compared to UDOP when tested on a synthetic noisy dataset.
- 3 real-world chart datasets are labeled with text role information to enable further benchmarking.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that pretrained document layout analysis transformers can be effectively finetuned for text role classification in charts, even with limited training data, using data augmentation and balancing. LayoutLMv3 is shown to outperform previous methods and have better robustness and generalizability. The newly labeled datasets also open up opportunities for further research.
