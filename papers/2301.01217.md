# [Unlearnable Clusters: Towards Label-agnostic Unlearnable Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01217)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How to generate effective "unlearnable examples" (UEs) to protect private visual data under a more realistic label-agnostic setting, where hackers/attackers may exploit the protected data differently from the original labeling?

Specifically, the paper argues that existing UE generation methods rely on a strong assumption of label-consistency, where the hacker will use the same labels as the original dataset. This is unrealistic as hackers may relabel or use the data differently. 

To address this, the paper proposes a new method called "Unlearnable Clusters" that generates UEs by disrupting the inherent clustering of data, without relying on the class labels. This makes the UEs more robust to different labeling strategies by hackers. The key ideas include:

- Using cluster-wise perturbations rather than class-wise.

- Leveraging Vision-Language models like CLIP as the surrogate model to improve transferability.

- Showing UCs are effective on diverse datasets against different models and training schemes.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that exploiting inherent data clusters instead of labels can generate more robust UEs under the label-agnostic setting. The proposed Unlearnable Clusters method is evaluated to verify this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new method called "Unlearnable Clusters" (UCs) to generate unlearnable examples that are robust under a "label-agnostic" setting. The key ideas and contributions are:

- It identifies a limitation with existing unlearnable example (UE) generation methods - they rely on a "label-consistency" assumption where the hacker/attacker uses the same labels as the data protector. 

- It proposes a more realistic "label-agnostic" setting where the hacker may use different labels or different number of classes. Existing UE methods fail under this setting.

- It analyzes the working mechanism of existing UE methods and finds they disrupt the uniformity and discrepancy of the deep representation.

- Based on this analysis, it proposes the UC method to craft unlearnable noise in a cluster-wise manner, without relying on labels, to disrupt uniformity and discrepancy.

- It leverages vision-language pretrained models like CLIP as the surrogate model to generate more transferable UCs.

- It evaluates UC extensively on different datasets, target models, training schemes, and even against commercial ML platforms, showing superiority over existing UE baselines.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the label-agnostic setting for UE generation and the UC technique to craft label-agnostic UEs by exploiting clusters in the representation space. The use of CLIP and the comprehensive experiments also showcase its effectiveness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Unlearnable Clusters (UCs) to generate unlearnable examples that can prevent machine learning models from exploiting private images in a label-agnostic setting, where the hacker's use of labels may differ from the protector's.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of unlearnable examples:

- The key novel contribution is proposing the label-agnostic setting, where the hacker/attacker may use different labels or tasks than the protector. This is more realistic than the label-consistency assumption made in prior work like EMinN and AdvPoison. Studying the problem under this more challenging setting is an important advance.

- The analysis of why existing UE methods fail under the label-agnostic setting provides useful insights - the perturbations tend to overly exploit label information and cluster samples based on their class. This leads to the key idea of using label-agnostic clustering to craft the perturbations.

- Leveraging CLIP embeddings and clustering on those is clever, as CLIP was trained in a self-supervised manner so may provide more generalizable features. Using a powerful pre-trained model like this as the surrogate is novel.

- The experimental validation is fairly comprehensive, studying different datasets, target model architectures, and even attacking commercial APIs. The method appears robust across diverse settings.

- Comparisons to prior UE techniques like EMinN, AdvPoison, etc under the same label-agnostic setting helps clearly show the superiority of the proposed approach.

- Some limitations are that the threat model still assumes the entire dataset is perturbed, and it may be interesting to study lower perturbation ratios in future work. Defenses are also limited to simple data augmentation, so testing against more sophisticated defenses could be beneficial.

Overall, I think this is a very solid advance over prior UE work by identifying and addressing a key limitation. The label-agnostic setting and use of CLIP are interesting novel contributions. The comprehensive experiments support the effectiveness of the approach. It moves the field forward in crafting more practical unlearnable examples.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring the impact of different surrogate models on generating effective and transferable unlearnable examples, especially models like CLIP that are pre-trained on large diverse datasets. The authors show promising results using CLIP but suggest more work is needed.

- Evaluating the proposed methods on more complex tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection or segmentation. The authors propose a "task-agnostic" setting as an important direction for future work. 

- Analyzing the effectiveness of the methods when only a subset of the training data is made unlearnable, rather than assuming all data is protected. The authors suggest experiments on mixtures of clean and unlearnable data.

- Developing more advanced defenses against unlearnable examples and evaluating their impact. The authors mainly consider simple data augmentation techniques as defenses in this work. 

- Conducting further analysis to understand the working mechanisms of the unlearnable examples, especially in the label-agnostic setting. More investigation into what exactly models learn from the unlearnable data is suggested.

- Exploring alternative threat models, protections goals, and assumptions around the protectors and hackers. The authors focus on a specific threat scenario in this work but suggest extensions.

- Applying the methods to more complex real-world datasets and demonstrating effectiveness against commercial systems at scale. The authors show some initial results on commercial platforms but more evaluation is needed.

In summary, the main future directions are around improvements to the unlearnable example generation, exploring more complex and realistic threat models, analysis into working mechanisms, and more thorough evaluation on diverse tasks and systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a new method called Unlearnable Clusters (UCs) to generate unlearnable examples (UEs) that are effective under a label-agnostic setting. Existing UE generation methods rely on a label-consistency assumption, where the hacker exploits the protected dataset with the same labels as the protector. This paper argues that hackers may actually use different labels than the protector, termed the label-agnostic setting. The proposed UCs method generates cluster-wise perturbations without relying on label information. It leverages a surrogate model like CLIP to extract representations, clusters them with K-means, and trains a generator model to craft noise that disrupts the uniformity and discrepancy of each cluster. Experiments show UC is effective against different models and datasets under the label-agnostic setting. It also prevents exploitation by commercial platforms like Azure and PaddlePaddle. Overall, UC generates more robust and transferable UEs without knowing the hacker's labeling strategy.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method to generate "unlearnable examples" - training images that have been subtly modified to prevent machine learning models from successfully training on them. Previous methods for generating unlearnable examples rely on the assumption that the "protector" generating the examples and the "hacker" trying to train on them will use the same label set. However, the authors argue that in many real cases, hackers may relabel or repurpose the images, violating this assumption. 

To address this, the authors propose a method called "Unlearnable Clusters" that does not rely on specific labels. Their key idea is to use clustering in the deep feature space of a vision-language model like CLIP to divide the images into semantic groups. Then, for each cluster, they train a generator network to modify the images in a way that disrupts the uniformity and separability of clusters in the deep feature space. This prevents a model from learning meaningful representations regardless of how the images are labeled after modification. Experiments across datasets and target model architectures show this method successfully prevents learning compared to prior label-dependent techniques.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Unlearnable Clusters (UCs) to generate unlearnable examples that are effective even when the hacker may exploit the protected dataset with different labels than the original dataset (label-agnostic setting). The key idea is to leverage the clusters that naturally arise during model training rather than relying on the class labels. Specifically, the method first extracts representations of all images in the dataset using a pretrained model like CLIP. It then applies k-means clustering on the representations to identify clusters. For each cluster, the method uses a conditioned generator model to create a cluster-wise perturbation that moves the cluster away from its center. This cluster-wise noise disrupts both the uniformity and separability of clusters in the representation space, preventing the model from learning meaningful information. The noise is added to each image according to its cluster assignment to create the unlearnable examples. Using a powerful pretrained model like CLIP allows creating noise that transfers better to unknown target models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of generating unlearnable examples (UEs) for protecting visual data under a more realistic threat model called the label-agnostic setting. 

Specifically, existing UEs rely on an ideal assumption called label-consistency, where the hackers exploit the dataset in the same way (same labels) as the data protector. This paper argues that this assumption is unrealistic as hackers may exploit the data differently, e.g. using different number of classes or annotations. This is called the label-agnostic setting. Under this more challenging setting, existing UE generation methods fail to work effectively.

The key contributions and proposals of the paper are:

- It promotes the more practical label-agnostic threat model where hackers may exploit the protected data differently from the protector.

- It reveals that existing UE methods disrupt both the distributional uniformity and discrepancy in the deep representation space.

- It proposes a new UE generation method called Unlearnable Clusters (UCs) to achieve such disruption without relying on the label information.

- It leverages Vision-and-Language Pretrained Models like CLIP as the surrogate model to improve transferability.

- It provides comprehensive experiments showing the effectiveness of the proposed UC method against different datasets, target models, and even commercial platforms.

In summary, the paper aims to develop a more robust unlearnable example generation technique that does not rely on strong assumptions like label-consistency, in order to provide more reliable protection of visual data against unauthorized machine learning model training.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Unlearnable examples (UEs) - Images that have been modified with imperceptible noise to make them unusable for training machine learning models without authorization. Also referred to as data poisoning.

- Label-consistency vs. label-agnostic - The paper promotes a more realistic label-agnostic setting where hackers may exploit the protected data differently from the original labels. This is contrasted with the label-consistency assumption of previous work.
