# [Online Learning of Joint-Muscle Mapping Using Vision in Tendon-driven   Musculoskeletal Humanoids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Tendon-driven musculoskeletal humanoids have complex body structures that are difficult to model accurately. As a result, there are large errors between the geometric models and actual robots. 
- This makes it challenging to accurately control the robots to move as intended to grasp objects. There can be internal tension in the muscles and slack in the tendons.

Proposed Solution:
- Represent the joint-muscle mapping (JMM), which expresses the nonlinear relationship between joint angles and muscle lengths, using a neural network (NN). This allows online updating of the JMM.  
- Develop two methods to update JMM online using real robot data:
   1) Antagonism Updater: Uses current estimated joint angles and measured muscle lengths to update JMM and correct muscle antagonisms and reduce tension/slack.
   2) Vision Updater: Uses joint angles estimated from camera images and commanded muscle lengths to update JMM so robot moves to intended positions accurately.

Main Contributions:  
- Novel way to represent and incrementally update JMM online using NN and real robot data
- Two complementary updaters that allow tendon-driven robots to move accurately by correcting errors in both muscle antagonisms and position/orientation
- System adapts JMM dynamically to match changes and growth in actual robot, enabling complex manipulation tasks not previously possible due to model errors
- Experiments quantify performance gains, with joint angle errors reduced by 40% and muscle forces lowered using proposed method

In summary, the key innovation is the online learning framework to update the joint-muscle mapping model for tendon-driven robots, enabling more dexterous control despite complex physiology. The antagonism and vision updaters work together to match the model to the real robot dynamically over time.
