# [Mixtral of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04088)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Language models still have significant limitations in capabilities like mathematical reasoning, code generation, and multilingual language understanding. There is a need for more efficient models that can match the performance of very large models while using fewer computational resources.

Proposed Solution 
- The paper proposes Mixtral, a 47 billion parameter sparse mixture of experts (SMOE) language model. 
- It has 8 expert networks per layer. For each token, 2 out of the 8 experts are selected to process and combine outputs. This allows broader access to parameters while keeping active usage low.  
- Mixtral was pretrained on multilingual data with long contexts (32k tokens). An instructor version was further fine-tuned.

Key Contributions
- Mixtral matches or exceeds the capabilities of previous top models like LLaMA and GPT-3.5, using far fewer active parameters. It is specifically much better at math, code generation and non-English language understanding.
- The instructor version, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct, sets new state of the art results among open source models on human evaluation benchmarks, surpassing Claude, GPT-3.5 Turbo and others.
- Both base and instructor versions are being publicly released under Apache 2.0 license to enable open research.
- Analysis shows the routing mechanism in Mixtral leads to consecutive tokens often accessing the same experts, indicating optimization possibilities.

In summary, the paper presents SMOE model Mixtral that very efficiently matches the performance of models with far more parameters. The instructor version also sets new benchmarks in human preferences. Both versions are being open sourced to facilitate research in this emerging technique.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Mistral introduces Mixtral, a 47B parameter sparse mixture of experts language model that matches or exceeds the performance of previous models like LLaMA 2 and GPT-3.5 while using 5x fewer active parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction and evaluation of Mixtral, a sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) language model. Specifically:

- Mixtral is an SMoE model with 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters per token during inference due to its routing mechanism that selects 2 out of 8 experts per token.

- Mixtral was trained on multilingual data with a context size of 32k tokens.

- Mixtral matches or exceeds the performance of LLaMA 2 70B and GPT-3.5 on most language understanding benchmarks, with particular strengths in mathematics, code generation, and multilingual tasks where it substantially outperforms LLaMA 2 70B. 

- An instructed version of Mixtral (Mixtral-chat) was fine-tuned with supervision and outperforms other models including GPT-3.5 Turbo and LLaMA 2 70B-chat on human evaluation.

- Both the base Mixtral model and Mixtral-chat model are released publicly under an Apache 2.0 license.

So in summary, the main contribution is introducing Mixtral, an performant open-sourced SMoE model, and demonstrating its capabilities, especially on mathematics, code, and multilingual tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Mixtral - The name of the sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) language model introduced in the paper.

- Sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) - The model architecture used in Mixtral, where each layer has multiple "expert" feedforward blocks and a router network selects a subset of experts to process each token. This allows scaling model capacity while controlling compute costs.  

- Outperforms LLaMA 2 and GPT-3.5 - The paper shows Mixtral matches or exceeds the performance of previous state-of-the-art models LLaMA 2 and GPT-3.5 across various benchmarks.

- Multilingual - Mixtral was pretrained on multilingual data and demonstrates strong performance on non-English tasks compared to LLaMA 2.

- Long context window - Mixtral was trained with a context length of 32,768 tokens and shows ability to retrieve information from anywhere in this long context.

- Mixtral-Instruct - A version of Mixtral finetuned with instruction following datasets that outperforms other instruction-following models. 

- Open weights - Both Mixtral base model and Mixtral-Instruct are released publicly under the Apache 2.0 license.

The key things the paper introduces are the Mixtral SMoE architecture, its state-of-the-art performance compared to previous models, and its open availability under Apache 2.0 license.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces Mixtral, a sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) language model. How does the SMoE architecture allow scaling up the number of parameters while controlling compute costs? What are the tradeoffs compared to a standard transformer architecture?

2. The router network in Mixtral selects 2 out of 8 experts per layer to process each token. What motivated this design choice compared to selecting a single expert? How does it affect model capacity and efficiency? 

3. The paper shows high performance on mathematics, code generation and multilingual benchmarks. Can you analyze the SMoE architecture and training methodology to hypothesize why it works well on these tasks compared to previous models like LLaMA?

4. Mixtral is shown to achieve 100% accuracy on the passkey retrieval task regardless of sequence length. What architectural properties enable the excellent long-range capabilities? How was the model training methodology optimized for this?

5. The analysis shows consecutive tokens often get routed to the same experts. What are the implications of this locality on optimization approaches like expert parallelism? How can the locality be exploited? 

6. How exactly was the router network designed and trained? What recent techniques like learned routing could potentially improve its assignment abilities?

7. Mixtral has 47B parameters but 13B active parameters. How do the memory requirements compare to a 70B standard transformer? What are the bottlenecks for deployment?

8. The paper introduces a fine-tuned chat model, Mixtral-chat. How was it optimized using supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization? What specifically was the training data?

9. Mixtral chat achieves state-of-the-art results on human evaluations like LMSys Arena. What metrics indicate that it has less bias and more positive sentiment than previous models?

10. The paper focuses on English language tasks. How could Mixtral be extended to a true multilingual model covering 100+ languages? Would the routing mechanism need to be adapted?
