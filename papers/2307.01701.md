# [Synthetic is all you need: removing the auxiliary data assumption for   membership inference attacks against synthetic data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01701)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Can membership inference attacks against synthetic tabular data still be successful without assuming access to an auxiliary dataset sampled from a similar distribution as the training data?In other words, the paper investigates whether the common assumption in prior membership inference attacks - that the attacker has access to auxiliary data from the same distribution - can be removed, while still developing successful attacks. The key hypothesis appears to be that membership inference attacks using only the synthetic data itself, without any auxiliary real data, can still infer membership of records with accuracy significantly better than random guessing.Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:1) An attacker with black-box access to the synthetic data generator can run successful membership inference attacks using synthetic data to replace the auxiliary data typically assumed.2) Even an attacker who only has access to the released synthetic dataset, without any access to the generator, can still develop meaningful membership inference attacks.3) The accuracy of these synthetic data only attacks may currently be limited by a "double counting" issue, and resolving this could allow attacks using solely synthetic data to outperform traditional attacks relying on auxiliary data.In summary, the central hypothesis is that membership inference attacks can work using synthetic data alone, without the strong assumption of access to auxiliary data from the same distribution. The paper aims to evaluate this hypothesis empirically across different scenarios.
