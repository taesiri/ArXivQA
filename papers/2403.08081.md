# [Mechanics of Next Token Prediction with Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08081)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies transformer-based language models trained via next-token prediction to understand what relationships in the training data are learned by the self-attention mechanism and how algorithms like gradient descent optimize these models. Specifically, it focuses on a single-layer transformer with self-attention and aims to characterize its implicit bias when trained on next-token prediction through empirical risk minimization. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces the concept of "token priority graphs" (TPGs) constructed from the training data, which capture priority relationships between tokens based on what tokens tend to follow other tokens in sequences. TPGs consist of strongly connected components (SCCs), which group tokens that can all reach each other, indicating no strict priority. 

The paper proves that gradient descent on next-token prediction exhibits a decomposition where part of the learned self-attention converges to the solution of an SVM problem defined on the TPGs. This "hard" SVM component retrieves high-priority tokens for the last input token. The rest of self-attention forms a "soft" component that assigns probabilities over retrieved tokens.

Together, this implements a two-step automaton: precise selection of high-priority tokens, then convex combination of them for next-token sampling. High-priority tokens are captured by SCC structure of TPGs. Gradient descent discovers SCCs of TPGs and learns topological order between them.

The analysis reveals connections between continuous optimization done by SGD and discrete structures in data, establishing rigorous support vector machine equivalences for transformers without statistical assumptions on data.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of token priority graphs (TPGs) to model relationships in text data
- Formalization of hard vs soft token selection/composition mechanics in self-attention
- Proving gradient descent convergence on transformers exhibits bias toward graphical SVM solutions 
- Revealing implicit learning of strongly connected components and topological orders between them
- Establishing optimization-theoretic foundations for transformers without statistical data assumptions
