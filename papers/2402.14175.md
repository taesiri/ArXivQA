# [Towards Contact-Aided Motion Planning for Tendon-Driven Continuum Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14175)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Tendon-driven continuum robots (TDCRs) can navigate complex, cluttered environments due to their flexible backbones, but typically require multiple segments leading to complex actuation and control. 
- The paper aims to develop motion planning for a single-segment TDCR, the simplest topology, to reach target poses in cluttered environments.

Proposed Solution:
- Key idea is to exploit contact-aided navigation (CAN) where interactions with the environment passively deform the robot to achieve multiple curvatures without mechanical changes.
- Propose a search-based motion planner that discretizes the configuration space and uses best-first search guided by a specially designed heuristic.

Heuristic Function:
- Captures kinematic constraints and environmental interactions while avoiding running the complex forward model during search.  
- Models the robot's path as constant curvature (CC) arcs that change curvature only on contact, approximating contact mechanics.
- Precomputes a grid of shortest CC arc paths from each discretized pose to goal.

Contributions:
- Novel motion planning approach for single-segment TDCRs leveraging CAN to reach target poses in cluttered environments.  
- Specifically designed heuristic function that enables efficient search while respecting kinematic constraints and environmental contacts.
- Empirically demonstrated high success rate of ~80% over 525 test cases with different environments, significantly outperforming baselines.
- Showed the heuristic reduces search space explored 10x compared to BFS benchmark.

The key novelty is enabling cluttered environment navigation using CAN for simple single-segment TDCRs via efficient search-based planning with a tailored heuristic.
