# [NoisyQuant: Noisy Bias-Enhanced Post-Training Activation Quantization   for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16056)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key contributions of this paper are:1. It theoretically shows the possibility of reducing quantization error for heavy-tailed distributions by adding fixed noisy bias sampled from a uniform distribution. Specifically, it proves conditions under which adding uniform noise before quantization provably reduces quantization error. 2. It proposes NoisyQuant, a method to enhance post-training quantization of activations in vision transformers by adding optimized noisy bias before quantization and removing the bias after quantization. This allows altering the activation distribution to make it more quantization-friendly.3. It demonstrates that NoisyQuant consistently improves accuracy of post-training quantization for vision transformers like ViT, DeiT and Swin, using both linear and non-linear quantizers. For 6-bit quantization, NoisyQuant provides gains of up to 1.7% on top of prior methods.In summary, the key hypothesis is that quantization error for heavy-tailed activation distributions can be reduced by optimally adding uniform noisy bias before quantization. NoisyQuant realizes this idea and shows consistent gains across different vision transformer models and quantizers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It theoretically shows the possibility and proves conditions for reducing quantization error of heavy-tailed distributions by adding fixed uniform noisy bias before quantization.2. It proposes NoisyQuant, a quantizer-agnostic method to enhance post-training quantization of activations in vision transformers. NoisyQuant reduces quantization error by actively altering the activation distribution with additive noisy bias before quantization, following the theoretical results.3. It demonstrates consistent improvements by applying NoisyQuant on top of existing post-training quantization methods, both linear and nonlinear quantizers. For 6-bit activation quantization, NoisyQuant improves top-1 ImageNet accuracy of vision transformers by up to 1.7% with linear quantizers, and up to 0.7% when combined with state-of-the-art nonlinear quantizers.In summary, the main contribution is proposing NoisyQuant as a novel technique to actively change the activation distribution being quantized, in order to reduce quantization error and improve post-training quantization performance of vision transformers. This is supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:The paper proposes NoisyQuant, a method that adds fixed uniform noise to the activations before quantization to make the distribution more amenable to quantization, leading to improved accuracy for post-training quantized vision transformers.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a new method called NoisyQuant for post-training quantization of vision transformer models. Here are some key comparisons to other related work:- Most prior PTQ methods focus on designing better quantizers to fit the complex activation distributions in vision transformers. In contrast, NoisyQuant takes a new perspective of actively altering the activation distribution before quantization to make it more quantization-friendly.- NoisyQuant achieves the first success in uniform linear quantization of vision transformer activations. Previous linear quantizers like EasyQuant suffer 2-6% accuracy drop, while NoisyQuant matches or exceeds nonlinear quantizers. - NoisyQuant is shown to bring consistent benefits when combined with advanced nonlinear quantizers like PTQ4ViT. This demonstrates its versatility as a quantizer-agnostic technique.- Unlike methods that suppress outliers by rescaling activations, NoisyQuant directly changes the distribution with additive noise. It can be applied orthogonally after rescaling for further gains.- Compared to mixed-precision quantization, NoisyQuant enables full int8 quantization of vision transformers without accuracy loss. This brings higher efficiency.Overall, NoisyQuant introduces a simple yet effective technique to tackle the core difficulty of quantizing heavy-tailed vision transformer activations. It achieves new state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy with negligible overhead. The theoretical analysis and empirical verification of its working mechanism also provide new insights to the PTQ field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Developing better methods for designing or generating the noisy bias distribution based on the characteristics of the quantizer and the activation distribution. The authors propose adding uniform random noise in this work, but suggest exploring if other noise distributions could work even better. The theoretical analysis provides guidance on properties of the noise distribution to reduce quantization error.- Generalizing the approach to other model architectures beyond vision transformers, such as CNNs. The authors show strong results for transformer models, but suggest exploring if the method could also benefit CNN activation quantization.- Hardware-aware optimizations and implementations of the method. The paper focuses on the algorithmic benefits, but notes that optimized implementation on hardware like FPGAs or ASICs is an important direction.- Extending the theoretical analysis to provide more formal guarantees or tighter bounds on the quantization error reduction. The current analysis shows promising results, but more rigorous study of the conditions and error bounds could strengthen the theory.- Combining NoisyQuant with other PTQ methods like reparameterization of normalization layers. The authors show NoisyQuant provides further gains on top of these concurrent methods. More exploration on jointly optimizing multiple PTQ techniques could be beneficial.- Developing adaptive or learned approaches to determine the noisy bias parameters rather than just using a fixed noise level. Adding some model-based optimization could potentially improve results further.In summary, the key opportunities are to develop a deeper theoretical understanding, generalize and optimize the approach, and combine NoisyQuant with complementary PTQ methods to maximize accuracy and efficiency of quantized models. Exploring the interplay between intentionally adding noise and quantization could be a fruitful research direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes NoisyQuant, a method to improve post-training quantization of vision transformer models. Transformers have complex activation distributions that are challenging to quantize with prior methods. NoisyQuant makes a surprising theoretical discovery - adding fixed uniform noisy bias to activations before quantization can significantly reduce quantization error under certain conditions. Building on this, NoisyQuant samples a noisy bias for each layer based on the activation distribution to alter it and make it more quantization-friendly. The noise is removed after quantization to retain the correct output. This reduces quantization error with minimal overhead. Experiments show NoisyQuant boosts accuracy of linear 6-bit post-training quantization by up to 1.7% on ImageNet for ViT, DeiT and Swin models, achieving on par or better performance than prior nonlinear quantizers. It also further improves state-of-the-art nonlinear quantizers. The method provides a new way to actively change the distribution being quantized rather than just tuning the quantizer.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new method called NoisyQuant for post-training quantization of vision transformer models. Vision transformers have complex activation distributions that are challenging to quantize with existing post-training quantization techniques. NoisyQuant takes a novel approach of altering the activation distribution before quantization by adding fixed uniform noisy biases. The paper proves theoretically that adding such noisy biases can reduce quantization error under certain conditions. NoisyQuant samples a noisy bias for each layer based on its activation distribution. At inference, this bias is added before quantization and a corresponding denoising bias is subtracted after to retain the correct output. This process reduces quantization error with minimal overhead. Experiments show NoisyQuant improves accuracy of 6-bit post-training quantized vision transformers by up to 1.7% over state-of-the-art methods. It also further boosts accuracy when combined with advanced nonlinear quantizers. The key contributions are proving the theory of noisy bias for quantization, proposing the efficient NoisyQuant method, and demonstrating consistent gains across vision transformer models.
