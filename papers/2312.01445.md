# [Classification of Home Network Problems with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01445)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Network problems like WiFi connectivity issues, routing misconfigurations, faulty links, and DNS issues are common in home networks and frustrating for users. Identifying the root cause is difficult for non-expert users. Currently, solutions rely on specialized networking tools, manual rules created by experts, or machine learning models that require extensive feature engineering. 

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a deep learning model based on transformer architecture that takes raw text logs from standard networking tools as input and predicts the likelihood of 10 common home network problem classes. The key ideas are:

- Collect logs by wrapping existing tools like ping, dig, ip etc into a monitoring application running on the home gateway. 

- Feed concatenated log texts into a transformer encoder model with a classification head to map logs to problem categories.

- Introduce a custom pre-tokenizer called "Greedy-k-digits" that splits numeric digit sequences in the logs to improve model accuracy.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrate that an end-to-end transformer model can accurately classify home network problems directly from tool logs, eliminating the need for log parsing and feature engineering.

- Propose the "Greedy-k-digits" pre-tokenizer that is more suitable for tool logs compared to standard whitespace tokenization, leading to better model performance.

- Share results from experiments on simulated data for 10 problem classes, showing 94% accuracy for the transformer model with the new pre-tokenizer, significantly outperforming baselines.

- Analyze confusion matrices to highlight strengths of the transformer over bag-of-words models in identifying difficult problem classes involving high delay variance.

Overall, the paper makes a case for using sequential deep learning models like transformers for text-based network problem diagnosis without extensive data wrangling. The presented approach could enable self-healing home networks and reduce manual troubleshooting costs.
