# [Binarized Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10862)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an efficient neural architecture search method for binarized neural networks (BNNs). Specifically, the key questions are:

1) How to adapt neural architecture search (NAS) to binarized neural architecture search (BNAS) by exploring binarized convolutions? 

2) How to address the challenges of BNAS compared to NAS, including learning inefficiency and huge architecture search space?

3) How to reduce the search cost and time and achieve comparable accuracy to NAS?

The main hypothesis is that by introducing channel sampling and operation space reduction strategies into differentiable NAS, the search efficiency can be significantly improved for BNAS. The reduced search space and optimized training process could allow BNAS to find high-performance binarized architectures efficiently.

In summary, this paper focuses on designing a fast and effective BNAS method to automatically generate binarized neural network architectures by addressing the unique challenges posed by binarization. The core ideas are channel sampling, operation space reduction, and a performance-based search strategy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing BNAS, the first binarized neural architecture search algorithm, which can search for highly compressed binarized neural network architectures. 

2. Introducing a performance-based strategy to significantly reduce the search space by abandoning less promising candidate operations during the search. This makes BNAS 40% faster than prior NAS methods.

3. Achieving excellent results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with the discovered binarized architectures. The binarized models searched by BNAS perform comparably to full-precision models found by other NAS methods, but with much higher compression and faster search.

4. Validating BNAS with two binarization methods, XNOR networks and PCNNs, showing its generalization capability. 

5. Outperforming previous binarized networks designed manually in terms of accuracy and number of parameters.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Binarized Neural Architecture Search (BNAS), a novel method for searching optimal binarized neural network architectures. BNAS is based on differentiable architecture search, but introduces channel sampling and operation space reduction strategies to significantly reduce the search cost. It uses a performance-based strategy to prune the less promising operations during training, allowing faster convergence to the optimal architecture. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that BNAS can find binarized architectures that achieve comparable accuracy to neural architecture search methods for full precision networks, while requiring much lower computational cost. The binarized models obtained by BNAS also outperform prior manually designed binarized networks. Overall, BNAS provides an efficient way to automate the design of highly compact and accurate binarized deep neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Binarized Neural Architecture Search (BNAS) for automatically designing optimal neural network architectures using binarized convolutions. BNAS builds on differentiable architecture search methods like DARTS by introducing two new techniques to significantly reduce the search cost: channel sampling and operation space reduction guided by a performance-based strategy. Channel sampling reduces computation by only computing on a subset of channels. Operation space reduction iteratively prunes the least promising operations to focus optimization on more useful ones. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that BNAS can design binarized networks that achieve accuracy comparable to full precision architectures searched by other NAS methods, but with much higher model compression. For example, on CIFAR-10, BNAS achieved 96.53% accuracy using a binarized model with only 2.3M 1-bit parameters, versus 97.22% accuracy and 3.3M 32-bit parameters for the full precision DARTS model. BNAS also reduces search time by 40% compared to the state-of-the-art PC-DARTS method.

In summary, this paper introduces a new neural architecture search method called BNAS that can efficiently search for high accuracy binarized neural network architectures. Key innovations include channel sampling and operation space reduction to greatly reduce search cost. Experiments demonstrate BNAS can find compressed models with accuracy competitive with full precision NAS techniques. The proposed techniques could be useful for deploying neural networks on memory and computation constrained devices.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a binarized neural architecture search (BNAS) method to find optimal architectures for binarized neural networks. BNAS is based on a differentiable architecture search that uses partial channel connections (PC-DARTS) as a baseline. To reduce the huge search space and make BNAS more efficient, the authors introduce two strategies: 1) Channel sampling to only compute on a subset of channels, reducing computation cost. 2) A performance-based search strategy that evaluates candidate operations on a validation set and abandons the worst performing ones, progressively reducing the search space. These allow BNAS to find compressed binarized models much faster than previous NAS methods. The binarized models use XNOR or PCNN for efficient convolution. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show BNAS can find models that match or exceed the accuracy of other NAS and human-designed models, with up to 32x compression.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of neural architecture search (NAS) for binarized neural networks (BNNs). The key points are:

- NAS has shown impressive performance in designing optimal architectures for various tasks. However, directly applying NAS to BNNs (called BNAS) faces challenges due to inefficient optimization and huge search space. 

- The paper proposes a new BNAS method to address these challenges. The main ideas are:

1) Introduce channel sampling and operation space reduction strategies to significantly reduce the search cost.

2) Use a performance-based strategy to abandon less promising operations during the search, further speeding it up. 

3) Validate BNAS with two BNN optimization methods (XNOR and PCNN) on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.

- Comprehensive experiments show BNAS can find high-performance BNN architectures 40% faster than prior NAS methods. The resulting BNNs achieve comparable accuracy to NAS networks but with much greater model compression.

In summary, the key contribution is developing an efficient BNAS algorithm to search for optimal BNN architectures by carefully designing the search space and optimization strategy. This allows BNAS to find accurate yet highly compressed models faster than previous NAS techniques.
