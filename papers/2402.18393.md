# [Evaluating Decision Optimality of Autonomous Driving via Metamorphic   Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18393)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: This paper focuses on testing the decision-making performance of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs). In particular, it aims to assess the ability of ADSs to make optimal driving decisions and generate efficient motion paths. This is an important non-safety-critical requirement for ADSs that impacts factors like comfort, efficiency and energy consumption. However, evaluating decision optimality faces two key challenges: (1) Lack of test oracles to verify if a path is optimal; (2) Difficulty in efficiently generating scenarios where the ADS makes non-optimal decisions.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a novel metamorphic testing approach called Decictor to address these challenges. 

1) To tackle the oracle problem, a metamorphic relation (MR) is introduced. The key idea is that for a given scenario where the ADS generates an optimal path, if non-invasive changes are made that do not affect this optimal path, then the ADS should continue making optimal decisions. Violations of this relation indicate suboptimal decisions.

2) To efficiently find violations, Decictor employs a search-based approach with three components:
   - Non-Invasive Mutation: Modifies scenarios without affecting original optimal paths
   - MR Check: Verifies if mutated scenarios violate the MR 
   - Feedback Mechanism: Guides the search towards scenarios more likely to violate the MR

The feedback mechanism in Decictor considers both spatial aspects (route differences) and temporal aspects (behavior differences) to effectively guide the search process.

Main Contributions:

1) First study investigating the problem of non-optimal decisions in ADS testing

2) Novel MR for exposing suboptimal decisions in ADSs 

3) Search-based algorithm incorporating strategic mutation and feedback to efficiently find violations

4) Extensive evaluation on Baidu Apollo demonstrating Decictor's ability to effectively and efficiently detect 46 non-optimal decision scenarios on average.

In summary, the paper addresses an important yet under-explored problem in testing ADS decision optimality, enabled by a specialized MR and guided search technique. The results showcase violations that can impact efficiency and safety, emphasizing the value of Decictor.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a metamorphic testing approach called Decictor to effectively and efficiently detect non-optimal decision scenarios for autonomous driving systems, where violations of optimal decisions are exposed through a novel metamorphic relation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It is the first work to investigate the problem of detecting non-optimal decisions made by Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs). Specifically, it proposes a metamorphic relation that can effectively expose non-safety-critical issues related to decision-making in ADSs. 

2. It develops a search-based algorithm called Decictor that efficiently generates non-optimal decision scenarios (NoDSs), providing insights into non-safety-critical violations in ADSs.

3. It conducts extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of Decictor on Baidu Apollo. The results show that Decictor can detect 46.0 NoDSs on average from 4 initial optimal decision scenarios, demonstrating its potential in evaluating the non-optimal decisions made by ADSs.

In summary, this paper makes important first steps towards testing and evaluating the non-safety-critical performance of ADSs related to decision optimality. The proposed Decictor framework serves as an effective complement to existing ADS testing methods that primarily focus on safety issues.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a metamorphic relation (MR) to detect non-optimal decisions made by autonomous driving systems (ADS). Can you explain in detail what this MR is, what optimal decisions mean in this context, and how violations of this MR help identify non-optimal decisions?

2. The paper proposes a search-based testing approach called Decictor with three main components: Non-invasive Mutation, MR Check, and Feedback. Can you describe the key ideas behind each of these components and how they work together to generate non-optimal decision scenarios efficiently? 

3. The Non-invasive Mutation component mutates the input optimal decision scenario (ODS) to generate new scenarios. What is the main challenge here and how does Decictor address it to ensure the optimal path in the original ODS remains unaffected?

4. The paper introduces the concepts of non-invasive feasible areas and kinematic constrained areas for calculating valid mutations. Can you explain these concepts, the constraints considered in computing them, and their importance?

5. The MR Check component determines if a mutated scenario still complies with the metamorphic relation using a grid-based measurement method. Can you explain this grid-based approach for checking path equivalence and how the similarity threshold epsilon is set?

6. The Feedback component guides the search to scenarios likely to violate the MR. It incorporates both driving path and behavior feedback. What specific metrics are used to quantify these two types of feedback? 

7. What are the key differences between Decictor and existing works on safety testing of ADS? What unique aspects of non-optimal decision testing does Decictor address through its specialized design?

8. The empirical evaluation uses metrics like percentage of valid mutations, number of detected non-optimal decision scenarios (NoDS), and number of NoDS validated manually by humans. Can you explain the significance of each of these metrics?

9. What were the key findings from the experiments comparing Decictor against baseline methods like AVFuzzer and SAMOTA? What do these results indicate regarding the effectiveness of Decictor?

10. The paper also evaluates variants of Decictor to demonstrate the usefulness of different components like Non-invasive Mutation and the Feedback strategies. Can you summarize some of the key ablation studies done and what they reveal about these components of Decictor?
