# [Cheating Suffix: Targeted Attack to Text-To-Image Diffusion Models with   Multi-Modal Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01369)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models can be exploited to generate harmful images by appending adversarial suffixes to prompts. 
- Existing attacks are either untargeted, query-based, or rely solely on single modal (text/image) features. There lacks practical and stealthy approaches for targeted attack.

Proposed Solution - MMP-Attack:  
- Proposes a targeted attack method to add a specific target object while removing original object from generated images.  
- Leverages multi-modal priors - text embeddings of target category and reference image containing target category.
- Optimization algorithm to search for a short 4-token "cheating suffix" by maximizing similarity of prompt+suffix embeddings to target embeddings.

Main Contributions:
- First attempt at strictly targeted attack on T2I diffusion models by simultaneously adding and removing objects.
- Introduces use of multi-modal priors for first time to enhance attack success rate.
- Discovered cheating suffixes achieve over 81% attack success rate with good stealthiness.
- Exhibits superior universality (generalize to other prefixes) and transferability (attack black-box models).
- First successful transfer-based attack on commercial T2I service DALL-E 3, marking severe security threat.

In summary, the paper explores a practical targeted attack against T2I diffusion models by optimizing a short multi-token suffix using multi-modal features. Experiments demonstrate stealthiness, high attack performance and transferability of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes MMP-Attack, a novel targeted attack method against text-to-image diffusion models that leverages multi-modal priors to manipulate generated image content by adding target objects while removing original objects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a targeted attack method named MMP-Attack against text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by adding a specific target object while removing the original object. This is the first attack method that utilizes multi-modal features (both text and image) to manipulate T2I generation.

2. Experimental results showing that the cheating suffixes discovered by MMP-Attack can achieve high attack success rates exceeding 81.8% on two open-source T2I models, outperforming prior attack methods by a large margin.

3. Demonstrating that the cheating suffixes generated by MMP-Attack have superior universality and transferability. Notably, they are able to successfully attack the commercial T2I model DALL-E 3 in a black-box setting. This is believed to be the first successful transfer-based attack against commercial T2I models.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a highly effective targeted attack method against T2I diffusion models by exploiting their multi-modal nature, with results showcasing strong attack performance and transferability even to commercial models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models
- Targeted attack 
- Cheating suffix
- Multi-modal priors (MMP)
- MMP-Attack
- Attack success rate 
- Universality 
- Transferability
- Black-box attack
- Query-free attack
- Stable Diffusion
- DALL-E

The paper proposes a targeted attack method named MMP-Attack that adds a cheating suffix to the original text prompt to manipulate the output image from T2I diffusion models. It leverages both text and image multi-modal features to optimize the cheating suffix. Experiments demonstrate high attack success rates and good universality and transferability of the cheating suffix. Notably, it enables black-box attacks on commercial T2I services like DALL-E by searching for the suffix on an open-source model like Stable Diffusion. The attack is query-free and does not require access to the victim models. These key ideas and terms summarize the core focus and contributions of this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 suggested in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an MMP-Attack method that utilizes both text and image modal priors for targeted attack. How does incorporating multi-modal priors lead to better attack performance compared to using only a single modality? What are the limitations?

2. The optimization problem defined in Equation 1 aims to find a cheating suffix that can manipulate the generated image content. Explain the key challenges in directly optimizing this objective and how the reformulated objective in Equation 3 provides a more feasible solution. 

3. The paper employs a straight-through estimator (STE) technique to address the discrete and non-differentiable nature of the optimization variables during cheating suffix search. Elaborate on how this technique enables the use of gradient-based optimization. What are its pros and cons?

4. Analyze the impact of different initialization strategies for the token embeddings matrix Z on the attack success rate. Why does the proposed 'Synonym' initialization perform the best?

5. The weighting factor λ balances the multi-modal loss terms. Investigate how λ impacts attack performance and provide insights into choosing an appropriate value. Discuss scenarios when relying purely on image priors could be more effective.

6. Apart from effectiveness, the paper also analyzes universality and transferability of the generated cheating suffixes. Explain these properties and discuss their significance in evaluating real-world attack feasibility. 

7. The attack exhibits high success rates when transferring cheating suffixes from one diffusion model to another. Analyze the possible reasons behind the transferability phenomenon in this context.

8. The paper demonstrates black-box targeted attacks on commercial services like DALL-E 3. Compare and contrast the challenges involved in attacking open-source vs. commercial text-to-image services.

9. Discuss the strengths and limitations of using CLIP score, BLIP score and object detection rates as evaluation metrics for the targeted attack. Suggest other relevant metrics if any.

10. The paper only explores adding and removing objects in the generated images. Propose ways to extend this attack method to achieve more complex image manipulations, for example, modifying attributes like color, pose, viewpoint etc.
