# [Accelerating DNN Training With Photonics: A Residue Number System-Based   Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17323)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes \ACC, a novel photonic accelerator that leverages residue number system (RNS) and block floating point (BFP) to enable precise and efficient training of deep neural networks (DNNs). The key innovation is using RNS to decompose high-precision matrix multiplications into multiple modular arithmetic operations that can be performed with low-precision analog photonic hardware. To achieve this, the authors design a new photonic modulo multiply-accumulate unit that exploits the inherent modulo property of optical phase. Multiple such units are combined into a modular matrix-vector unit tailored for RNS computation. By strategically choosing BFP parameters and RNS moduli, \ACC achieves accuracy comparable to FP32 training on state-of-the-art DNNs. Evaluations show that compared to digital systolic arrays, \ACC provides over 23.8× speedup and 32.1× better energy-delay product given equal energy budget, and 42.8× lower power given equal area budget. The results demonstrate that RNS combined with analog photonics can overcome precision limitations and enable high-throughput and energy-efficient DNN training accelerators. Overall, this work presents groundbreaking ideas in bridging analog computing and RNS for advancing DNN training hardware.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Mirage, an RNS-based photonic accelerator for DNN training that combines block floating point and residue number system to achieve high accuracy in analog photonic hardware while providing over 23x faster training and 32x lower energy-delay product compared to digital systolic arrays.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing an RNS-based computing model and dataflow for DNN training that combines BFP and RNS to achieve high accuracy in analog photonic hardware.

2) Introducing a new design of photonic MAC units that efficiently perform modular operations using the optical phase, enabling RNS-based arithmetic using photonic hardware. 

3) Architecting a novel RNS-based photonic DNN training accelerator called ACC that leverages the proposed computing model and photonic MAC units. ACC is the first photonic training accelerator that can successfully train real-world practical DNN models.

In summary, the key innovation is using RNS with specialized photonic hardware to overcome the precision limitations in analog photonic accelerators, allowing them to be used for accurate DNN training rather than just inference. The proposed accelerator ACC demonstrates this concept and achieves significant speedups and energy efficiency improvements over digital systolic arrays.
