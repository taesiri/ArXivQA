# [Attention-based UNet enabled Lightweight Image Semantic Communication   System over Internet of Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07329)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Semantic communication is important for efficient data transmission in 6G networks to enable intelligent applications. However, training and deploying deep learning (DL) based semantic codecs on resource-constrained IoT devices is computationally expensive.  
- Designing a lightweight image semantic codec with low computational complexity and small model size is critical for deployment on IoT devices.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a lightweight image semantic communication (LSSC) system based on an attention-based UNet architecture. 
- The system consists of an edge server and multiple IoT devices. The edge server trains the semantic codec and transmits the encoder to the devices.
- Devices collect images, extract semantic features using the encoder, and transmit them to the edge server. The decoder at the edge server reconstructs the image segmentation.
- To reduce complexity, the number of downsampling layers in UNet is reduced and the CBAM (convolutional block attention module) is introduced to focus on important features.

Main Contributions:
- A lightweight attention-based UNet architecture for image semantic communication, which achieves 55% smaller model size and 14% lesser FLOPs with only 3% drop in accuracy compared to baseline UNet.
- Semantic codec training at the edge server to avoid computation burden on IoT devices.
- Use of CBAM for efficient feature extraction by identifying important channels and spatial regions.  
- Higher segmentation accuracy than traditional communication schemes, especially in low SNR conditions due to robustness of transmitted semantic features.

In summary, the paper proposes an end-to-end lightweight image semantic communication system for IoT devices that transmits a small-sized semantic codec model and image features with attention focusing, achieving efficiency in computation, memory and wireless transmission.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an attention-based UNet architecture for a lightweight image semantic communication system over Internet of Things devices, which achieves lower computational complexity and model size while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel image semantic segmentation communication system that can be deployed on Internet of Things (IoT) devices with low floating-point operations (FLOPs) and small model size while ensuring high segmentation performance. Specifically, the key contributions include:

1) Developing a lightweight image semantic communication (LSSC) system consisting of a semantic encoder that extracts image data at the transmitter and a decoder that decodes the image information at the receiver.

2) Designing a lightweight attention-based UNet architecture with low computational complexity and small model size by decreasing the number of downsampling layers and introducing the convolutional block attention module (CBAM).

3) Showing through simulations that the proposed LSSC system can reduce the FLOPs by 14% and model size by 55% with only a 3% loss in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) accuracy compared to traditional UNet. It also achieves higher mIoU than traditional methods under different wireless channel conditions, especially in the low channel signal-to-noise ratio region.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient and lightweight image semantic communication system suitable for deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices.
