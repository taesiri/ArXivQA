# [Teach Large Language Models to Forget Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00870)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Teach Large Language Models to Forget Privacy":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but raise privacy concerns due to their ability to memorize and retain sensitive user information. 
- Existing privacy-preserving methods like differential privacy and homomorphic encryption require model transparency and can degrade utility. Lightweight API-based methods for black-box models are limited in complex applications like QA.
- This paper introduces a new "question oblivion" task to address the local privacy challenges of LLMs without compromising model performance. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Prompt2Forget (P2F), a framework to teach LLMs to "forget" sensitive information in queries. 
- It works by decomposing questions into sub-questions, generating fabricated answers, and obfuscating the model's memory of the original input.  
- P2F misleads the LLM into prioritizing fabricated data over genuine data through prompts.

Main Contributions:
- First framework designed specifically for the LLM local privacy challenge through a novel question oblivion task
- Generalizable across diverse use cases without manual tuning
- Achieves ~90% forgetfulness score without utility loss, 63% better than baseline
- Establishes benchmark and metrics to evaluate LLM forgetfulness 
- Demonstrates resilience against various reconstruction attacks
- Significant advancement in privacy preservation for emerging LLM domain

In summary, this paper makes an important contribution by introducing an innovative framework called Prompt2Forget that can teach language models to "forget" sensitive information. It is the first solution tailored specifically to address the local privacy risks of large language models. The proposed approach is generalizable, achieves high effectiveness in causing models to forget while retaining utility, and is resilient against attacks trying to retrieve forgotten information.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel Prompt2Forget framework to teach large language models to "forget" sensitive user information by decomposing questions, fabricating alternate data, and obfuscating the model's memory without compromising utility or performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It presents the first initiative aimed at addressing the local privacy challenges of large language models (LLMs) without compromising model performance. This is achieved by defining a new task focused on teaching LLMs to "forget" sensitive information that they have been exposed to.

2) It introduces a generalized Prompt2Forget (P2F) framework to instruct LLMs to disregard original private information. This framework is designed to be broadly applicable across various query types, without the need for domain-specific customizations.

3) It establishes evaluation metrics to ascertain LLM forgetfulness and conducts rigorous experiments that demonstrate the resilience of the proposed methodology against malicious reconstruction attacks. The results show that P2F can achieve around 90% forgetfulness score without any utility loss.

In summary, this paper makes meaningful advancements in the novel field of privacy preservation for large language models, especially in terms of safeguarding local user privacy in black-box API settings. The P2F framework represents an innovative solution that balances both privacy and utility concerns.
