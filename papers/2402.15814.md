# [A Theoretical Result on the Inductive Bias of RNN Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15814)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent work by Hewitt et al. (2020) shows RNNs can efficiently represent bounded hierarchical structures prevalent in language, suggesting RNNs' success is linked to modeling hierarchy. 
- However, closer inspection shows their construction is not limited to hierarchical LMs. So what other classes of LMs can RNNs efficiently represent?

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the model of "bounded pushdown automata" (BPDA) which have a bounded stack and simple stack update operations like pop, push and shift.
- BPDAs define a diverse class of non-hierarchical LMs, including some n-gram LMs.
- The paper shows RNNs can optimally represent many simple BPDA LMs using the same compression as Hewitt et al. for bounded Dyck languages.

Main Contributions:
- Generalizes Hewitt et al.'s construction to show RNNs can efficiently represent a broader class of LMs, not limited to hierarchical ones.
- Shows the efficiency is not due to modeling hierarchical structure, since non-hierarchical LMs like n-grams can also be efficiently compressed.
- Posits a lack of concrete cognitive or linguistic inductive biases in RNNs since they can represent diverse non-hierarchical LMs.
- Provides a new interpretation of RNN recurrence as keeping a bounded memory of symbols seen so far.

In summary, the paper makes both theoretical and conceptual contributions in analyzing the representational capacity of RNNs, highlighting the breadth of languages they can efficiently model is not linked to hierarchical structure. This suggests inductive biases connected to properties of human language may need to be imposed externally.
