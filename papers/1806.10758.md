# A Benchmark for Interpretability Methods in Deep Neural Networks

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we empirically evaluate and compare the quality/accuracy of different methods for estimating feature importance in deep neural networks? The paper proposes a new benchmark called ROAR (Remove And Retrain) to address this question. The key ideas are:- Replace the inputs estimated to be most important by an interpretability method with a meaningless constant value. Do this for images in both train and test sets.- Retrain the model from scratch on the modified dataset. - Evaluate how much the accuracy drops on the modified test set. - Compare to a random baseline. A good interpretability method should cause a bigger drop in accuracy than randomly removing features.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the ROAR benchmark can effectively evaluate which feature importance estimation methods are more accurate by measuring the degradation in model performance when the "most important" features are removed and the model is retrained. The paper tests this hypothesis by applying ROAR to evaluate several popular interpretability methods on image classification tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing an empirical measure called ROAR (Remove And Retrain) to evaluate the quality of feature importance estimates in deep neural networks. The key ideas are:- They modify the input images by replacing the pixels estimated to be most important by each interpretability method with a fixed value. This is done for varying fractions of the pixels.- They retrain models on these modified datasets and evaluate how much the accuracy drops compared to original unmodified images. - More accurate estimators will identify pixels that are truly important, so replacing them will degrade performance more.- They compare to a random ranking of pixel importance and sobel edge filter as controls.- Their experiments across ImageNet, Food 101 and Birdsnap datasets show that many popular interpretability methods (Gradients, Integrated Gradients, Guided Backprop) are no better than random at identifying important pixels. - However, some ensembling approaches like SmoothGrad-Squared and VarGrad consistently outperform random and base methods in identifying important pixels across datasets.So in summary, the key contribution is proposing ROAR as an evaluation measure for interpretability methods and results showing many popular methods are not very accurate while some ensembling approaches are remarkably effective.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes an empirical measure called ROAR (Remove And Retrain) to evaluate the accuracy of different methods for estimating feature importance in deep neural networks, and finds that ensemble-based approaches like VarGrad and SmoothGrad-Squared produce the most accurate estimates while other popular methods are no better than random.
