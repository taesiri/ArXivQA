# [A Benchmark for Interpretability Methods in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10758)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we empirically evaluate and compare the quality/accuracy of different methods for estimating feature importance in deep neural networks? The paper proposes a new benchmark called ROAR (Remove And Retrain) to address this question. The key ideas are:- Replace the inputs estimated to be most important by an interpretability method with a meaningless constant value. Do this for images in both train and test sets.- Retrain the model from scratch on the modified dataset. - Evaluate how much the accuracy drops on the modified test set. - Compare to a random baseline. A good interpretability method should cause a bigger drop in accuracy than randomly removing features.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the ROAR benchmark can effectively evaluate which feature importance estimation methods are more accurate by measuring the degradation in model performance when the "most important" features are removed and the model is retrained. The paper tests this hypothesis by applying ROAR to evaluate several popular interpretability methods on image classification tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing an empirical measure called ROAR (Remove And Retrain) to evaluate the quality of feature importance estimates in deep neural networks. The key ideas are:- They modify the input images by replacing the pixels estimated to be most important by each interpretability method with a fixed value. This is done for varying fractions of the pixels.- They retrain models on these modified datasets and evaluate how much the accuracy drops compared to original unmodified images. - More accurate estimators will identify pixels that are truly important, so replacing them will degrade performance more.- They compare to a random ranking of pixel importance and sobel edge filter as controls.- Their experiments across ImageNet, Food 101 and Birdsnap datasets show that many popular interpretability methods (Gradients, Integrated Gradients, Guided Backprop) are no better than random at identifying important pixels. - However, some ensembling approaches like SmoothGrad-Squared and VarGrad consistently outperform random and base methods in identifying important pixels across datasets.So in summary, the key contribution is proposing ROAR as an evaluation measure for interpretability methods and results showing many popular methods are not very accurate while some ensembling approaches are remarkably effective.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes an empirical measure called ROAR (Remove And Retrain) to evaluate the accuracy of different methods for estimating feature importance in deep neural networks, and finds that ensemble-based approaches like VarGrad and SmoothGrad-Squared produce the most accurate estimates while other popular methods are no better than random.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on evaluating interpretability methods for deep neural networks:- The paper introduces a new evaluation approach called ROAR (Remove And Retrain) which involves removing the most "important" input features according to an interpretability method, retraining the model on the modified data, and measuring the degradation in performance. This provides a more rigorous way to evaluate the accuracy of feature importance estimates compared to just removing features and evaluating on the original model. - The paper tests a broad range of interpretability methods (gradients, integrated gradients, guided backprop, SmoothGrad, VarGrad, etc.) across multiple large-scale image datasets (ImageNet, Food 101, Birdsnap). Most prior work has evaluated on smaller datasets or fewer methods. The scope allows for more generalizable conclusions.- The finding that many popular methods (gradients, integrated gradients, guided backprop) perform no better than a random assignment of feature importance is surprising and contrasts with prior human studies suggesting these methods produce interpretable saliency maps. This highlights the limitations of relying on qualitative human evaluations.- The paper shows that only certain ensemble methods like VarGrad and SmoothGrad-Squared reliably improve performance over a single estimate, while SmoothGrad does not, despite being more computationally expensive. This provides insight into why ensembling helps and how it should be done.- The comparison to "control" baselines like randomly shuffling feature importance or using a Sobel filter is a simple but effective way to set lower bounds on expected performance. This is missing from most prior work.Overall, the paper makes excellent progress in rigorously evaluating interpretability methods at scale using a modification-based approach. The findings highlight major limitations of popular methods and suggest ensemble techniques as a promising direction. More work is still needed to understand why certain ensembling approaches succeed. But this provides an important benchmark for the field to improve upon.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Further understanding why certain ensemble methods like SmoothGrad-Squared and VarGrad dramatically improve performance compared to the underlying base methods. The authors suggest focusing on why the manner of ensembling is so critical.- Exploring why squaring estimates before ranking inputs provides gains in performance across all estimators. This could provide more insight into how the directionality of importance estimates should be treated.- Examining why the choice of best underlying estimator varies by dataset/task when using ensemble methods. The authors found SmoothGrad-Squared and VarGrad robustly improved all base methods, but the overall best performing estimator differed.- Expanding the evaluation to additional interpretability methods beyond the ones considered in the paper. The authors welcome applying ROAR to more estimators.- Considering other model architectures and tasks beyond image classification. The authors focused on ResNet-50 for image datasets, but ROAR could be applied more broadly. - Further theoretical analysis of the properties and limitations of ROAR for evaluating feature importance, especially for models that use feature selection.- Comparing ROAR to other evaluation approaches like human studies or unit tests to better understand trade-offs.So in summary, the authors suggest further analysis of the ensemble methods, applying ROAR more broadly, and combining it with other evaluation techniques as fruitful future directions. The overall goal is better understanding properties of methods that accurately explain model behaviors.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes an empirical measure called ROAR (Remove And Retrain) to evaluate the approximate accuracy of feature importance estimates in deep neural networks. The authors apply ROAR across several large-scale image classification datasets and find that many popular interpretability methods like gradients, integrated gradients, and guided backpropagation produce importance estimates no better than random. However, certain ensemble methods like VarGrad and SmoothGrad-Squared consistently outperform random assignment and single estimates. The results suggest ensemble approaches are critical for accurate importance estimation, though the manner of ensembling matters as some like Classic SmoothGrad do not improve on single estimates despite higher computation. Overall, ROAR provides a framework to empirically validate and compare feature importance methods for neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes an empirical measure called ROAR (Remove And Retrain) to evaluate the approximate accuracy of feature importance estimates in deep neural networks. The authors apply ROAR across several large-scale image classification datasets - ImageNet, Food 101, and Birdsnap. ROAR replaces the fraction of pixels estimated to be most important by an interpretability method with a fixed uninformative value. This is done for both the training and test sets. New models are then trained on the modified datasets to measure the change in accuracy after removing features deemed important. The results show that many popular interpretability methods like gradients, integrated gradients, and guided backpropagation produce estimates no better than random. Only certain ensemble methods like VarGrad and SmoothGrad-Squared reliably outperform a random assignment of importance. The manner of ensembling is critical - some approaches like classic SmoothGrad do not improve accuracy despite higher computation. Overall, the paper demonstrates that many widely used methods do not accurately identify the most important input features for a deep neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed ensemble techniques highlights the need for further research into what properties make an explanation method reliable.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The main method used in this paper is an empirical measure of the approximate accuracy of feature importance estimates in deep neural networks. The authors propose an approach called ROAR (Remove And Retrain) to evaluate different interpretability methods. The key steps of ROAR are:1. Generate feature importance estimates for each input using the interpretability method. 2. Rank the estimates and replace the top fraction of most important features with a fixed uninformative value. This is done for all images in both the training and test set.3. Retrain models on the modified dataset from random initialization.4. Measure performance degradation on the modified test set. More accurate estimators will identify features whose removal causes the greatest drop in accuracy.5. Compare estimator performance to random and sobel edge filter baselines.The authors apply ROAR to evaluate several gradient and attribution based methods on ImageNet, Food 101 and Birdsnap datasets. Key findings are that ensemble methods like VarGrad and SmoothGrad-Squared substantially outperform both underlying base methods and random/sobel baselines, while base methods like Integrated Gradients perform no better than random.
