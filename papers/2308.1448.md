# [On $κ$-solutions and canonical neighborhoods in 4d Ricci flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.1448)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, it seems the main goal is to introduce and motivate some conjectures about the classification of certain solutions ("kappa-solutions") to the Ricci flow equation in 4 dimensions, and explore some consequences if the conjectures hold. 

Specifically, the main conjectures are:

- Conjecture 1 (kappa-solutions in 4d Ricci flow): This proposes a classification of all possible "kappa-solutions" - a type of ancient solution with certain properties - in 4-dimensional Ricci flow. The conjecture lists specific examples of known kappa-solutions and proposes that this list is complete.

- Conjecture 2 (ancient 4d Ricci flows): A related conjecture proposes a classification of "ancient asymptotically cylindrical" solutions to 4d Ricci flow. This is motivated as a tool to understand singularities and find "canonical neighborhoods" in 4d Ricci flow.

Assuming these conjectures hold, the main consequence derived in the paper is:

- A "canonical neighborhood theorem" describing the behavior of 4d Ricci flow near cylindrical singularities, analogous to results in other settings like Perelman's work in 3d. This depends on Conjecture 2.

The conjectures aim to give a complete picture of the "building blocks" for understanding singularities in 4d Ricci flow. Their motivation seems to be both analogy to related results in 3d, and the broader goal of constructing a Ricci flow through singularities in 4d.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be:

- The construction of a new 1-parameter family of $\kappa$-solutions (bubble-sheet ovals) in 4D Ricci flow, which interpolates between $\mathbb{R} \times$ 3D ovals and 3D ovals $\times \mathbb{R}$. 

- A classification conjecture for $\kappa$-solutions and ancient asymptotically cylindrical 4D Ricci flows. Some special cases of this conjecture are known to be true from recent literature.

- Assuming the conjecture on ancient asymptotically cylindrical 4D Ricci flows, a proof of the existence of canonical neighborhoods around cylindrical singularities in 4D Ricci flow, analogous to results for 3D Ricci flow and mean curvature flow.

- A discussion of how quotient necks can lead to non-uniqueness phenomena and an example conjecture for non-uniqueness in 4D Ricci flow through singularities.

The key novel contributions seem to be the construction of the new 1-parameter family of $\kappa$-solutions, the classification conjectures, and the canonical neighborhood theorem assuming the ancient flows conjecture. The conjectures aim to provide a framework for further understanding singularity formation in 4D Ricci flow.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper introduces a conjectural classification of κ-solutions in 4D Ricci flow, constructs a new 1-parameter family of examples, proves a canonical neighborhood theorem assuming the conjectural classification, and discusses how quotient necks can lead to non-uniqueness phenomena.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on Ricci flow in 4 dimensions:

- It introduces a new conjectural picture for the classification of κ-solutions and ancient asymptotically cylindrical Ricci flows in 4D. This builds on previous work classifying κ-solutions in 3D, and provides a framework for understanding singularities in 4D Ricci flow.

- The construction of the new 1-parameter family of κ-solutions (Theorem 1) enriches the known examples of κ-solutions in 4D. It shows that, in addition to products of lower dimensional solutions, there may be new "intrinsically 4D" ancient solutions arising as ovals.

- The canonical neighborhood theorem (Theorem 2), assuming the ancient flows conjecture, is analogous to previous uniqueness/stability results for Ricci flow through singularities in 3D and for mean curvature flow. If true, it suggests 4D Ricci flow through cylindrical singularities should be unique.

- The discussion on non-uniqueness due to quotient singularities indicates new phenomena arising in 4D that have no analogue in 3D. This proposes a potential mechanism leading to non-uniqueness.

Overall, this paper brings new ideas and conjectures to the study of Ricci flow in 4D. By drawing connections to the better understood 3D case and mean curvature flow, it provides a roadmap for tackling open problems in 4D. The constructions and analysis of new examples also move beyond existing classes of solutions, suggesting the need to further develop tools tailored specifically to 4D.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further investigating Conjecture 1 on the classification of κ-solutions in 4D Ricci flow. The main open case is dealing with κ-solutions whose tangent flow at −∞ is a round shrinking R2×S2. The authors suggest as a first step showing that the Tits cone of any time-slice of such a κ-solution is either a ray or splits off a line.

- Proving Conjecture 2 on the classification of ancient asymptotically cylindrical 4D Ricci flows, which is closely related to Conjecture 1. This conjecture is key for establishing the canonical neighborhood theorem in the paper.

- Exploring whether cylindrical singularities lead to uniqueness of Ricci flow through singularities in 4D. The authors conjecture that quotient necks may lead to non-uniqueness due to the possibility of resolving them by gluing in Appleton solitons. 

- More broadly, further developing the program of constructing Ricci flow through singularities in dimension 4, building on the groundwork laid by Bamler and others. The conjectural picture proposed in this paper could guide part of this investigation.

- Investigating whether similar conjectural pictures and canonical neighborhood theorems can be established in higher dimensions.

So in summary, the main suggestions are to further investigate the conjectures stated here, with an eye towards ultimately constructing Ricci flow through singularities in dimension 4 and higher. The interplay between κ-solutions, ancient asymptotically cylindrical flows, and canonical neighborhoods seems like a fruitful direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a classification conjecture for κ-solutions in 4D Ricci flow, which are ancient solutions that arise as blowup limits near cylindrical singularities. The conjectured list of κ-solutions includes known examples as well as a new 1-parameter family of κ-solutions constructed in the paper. The paper shows the conjecture holds in some special cases, using recent results from the literature. Assuming a stronger version of the conjecture for ancient asymptotically cylindrical 4D Ricci flows, the paper establishes the existence of canonical neighborhoods, analogous to Perelman's theorem in 3D. Finally, the paper argues quotient-necks lead to new non-uniqueness phenomena in 4D Ricci flow through singularities.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper introduces a conjectural classification of κ-solutions in 4D Ricci flow. The author constructs a new 1-parameter family of κ-solutions called bubble-sheet ovals that are Ζ_2^2 x O_3-symmetric and have a round shrinking R^2 x S^2 as their tangent flow at -∞. Based on known examples and this new solution, the author conjectures that any κ-solution in 4D Ricci flow belongs to a specific list of shrinkers, steadies, and ovals, up to scaling and finite quotients. Some special cases of this conjecture are proved using recent results in the literature. 

Assuming a stronger form of the κ-solution conjecture, the author establishes the existence of canonical neighborhoods around cylindrical singularities in 4D metric Ricci flows. This is analogous to Perelman's canonical neighborhood theorem in 3D and the mean-convex neighborhood theorem for mean curvature flow. The author argues new phenomena arise from quotient necks in 4D Ricci flow, which could lead to non-uniqueness examples. An example of non-uniqueness is sketched based on forming quotient necks that connect to Appleton solitons.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a conjectural classification of κ-solutions in 4d Ricci flow. The main method is:

The author first constructs a new 1-parameter family of κ-solutions, called bubble-sheet ovals, that interpolate between the known examples of κ-solutions in 4d Ricci flow. This new family is obtained by taking a limit of rescaled elliptic Ricci flow evolutions on S^4. 

Motivated by this new family and known examples in the literature, the author then proposes a classification conjecture for all κ-solutions in 4d Ricci flow up to scaling and finite quotients. The conjectured list includes the known examples as well as the new family of bubble-sheet ovals.

Assuming this classification conjecture, the author uses techniques from the theory of metric measure spaces satisfying the Riemannian curvature-dimension condition to establish the existence of canonical neighborhoods near cylindrical singularities in 4d Ricci flow. This provides a local description of the flow near such singularities.

The main method is the construction of the new κ-solutions, the formulation of the classification conjecture, and then deriving consequences assuming the validity of the conjecture.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, this paper seems to be addressing the following main problems/questions:

- Classifying and conjecturing a list of all possible κ-solutions in 4D Ricci flow. This is analogous to the classification of κ-solutions in 3D Ricci flow, which was an important ingredient in Perelman's proof of the geometrization conjecture. 

- Constructing a new 1-parameter family of κ-solutions in 4D Ricci flow called "bubble-sheet ovals" (Theorem 1).

- Proposing a conjecture (Conjecture 2) that classifies all ancient asymptotically cylindrical 4D Ricci flows, which is closely related to classifying κ-solutions. 

- Assuming the conjecture, proving a "canonical neighborhood theorem" (Theorem 3) that gives a canonical description of the flow near cylindrical singularities in 4D Ricci flow. This is analogous to Perelman's canonical neighborhood theorem in 3D.

- Discussing non-uniqueness phenomena caused by quotient necks in 4D Ricci flow and proposing a conjecture (Conjecture 4) for a mechanism of non-uniqueness in 4D involving quotient necks.

So in summary, the main problems addressed are classifying κ-solutions and ancient flows in 4D Ricci flow, constructing a new example of a κ-solution, proving a canonical neighborhood theorem assuming a classification conjecture, and discussing non-uniqueness issues related to quotient necks. The classification conjectures and canonical neighborhood theorem aim to lay groundwork for constructing a Ricci flow through singularities in 4D.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?
