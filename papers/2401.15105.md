# [Diffusion Enhancement for Cloud Removal in Ultra-Resolution Remote   Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Presence of cloud layers severely degrades quality and effectiveness of remote sensing (RS) images, obscuring underlying landscape details.  
- Existing deep learning methods for cloud removal (CR) struggle to accurately reconstruct visual authenticity and semantic content. Main issues are:
  - CNN-based models have limited feature representation capability.
  - GAN-based models have training instability issues like mode collapse. 
  - Diffusion models tend to generate unreliable fake textures.

Proposed Solution - Diffusion Enhancement (DE) Framework:

- Establishes new high-resolution CR dataset called CUHK-CR with 0.5m spatial resolution to enable development of ultra-resolution CR algorithms.

- Proposes novel Diffusion Enhancement (DE) framework that integrates:
  - Diffusion model branch for progressive texture detail recovery 
  - Reference branch that generates approximate cloud-free image, providing overall structure
  - Weight Allocation (WA) network to dynamically adjust fusion weights between above two branches

- WA allows adaptive weighting based on image features and noise levels across diffusion timesteps.

- Implements coarse-to-fine training strategy to accelerate convergence while handling ultra-resolution images.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes DE framework that merges global visual information from reference branch with progressive diffusion recovery to improve cloud removal accuracy.

- Introduces WA network for optimized dynamic fusion between reference branch and diffusion model across timesteps.

- Applies coarse-to-fine training strategy to expedite DE model convergence.

- Establishes new high-quality, ultra-resolution CUHK-CR benchmark dataset to facilitate advanced CR algorithm development and evaluation.

- Achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance on RICE and CUHK-CR datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of DE framework.
