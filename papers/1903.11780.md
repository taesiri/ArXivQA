# [Wasserstein Dependency Measure for Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11780)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be that using the Wasserstein distance instead of KL divergence in mutual information estimators for representation learning will result in more complete learned representations. Specifically, the authors argue:- Mutual information maximization for representation learning is fundamentally limited because tight lower bounds on mutual information require sample sizes exponential in the mutual information. This makes them problematic for high mutual information datasets.- KL divergence based mutual information estimators are prone to only capturing a few factors of variation in the data, leading to incomplete representations.- Using the Wasserstein distance instead of KL divergence will mitigate this issue and learn more complete representations. The Wasserstein distance accounts for the underlying metric of the data distribution, unlike KL divergence.To test this hypothesis, the paper:- Demonstrates cases where mutual information estimation fails to learn complete representations, both in theory and experiments.- Introduces the Wasserstein dependency measure as an alternative objective using Wasserstein distance.- Shows experimentally that their proposed Wasserstein predictive coding technique learns more complete representations on designed tasks where incomplete representations are problematic.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that using Wasserstein distances instead of KL divergence for representation learning will learn more complete representations by overcoming limitations of mutual information maximization. The experiments aim to demonstrate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper appear to be:- Demonstrating limitations of mutual information-based representation learning approaches, both theoretically and empirically. The paper shows that these methods can learn incomplete representations that capture only a few factors of variation when the mutual information is large. - Proposing the Wasserstein dependency measure as an alternative to mutual information for representation learning. This uses the Wasserstein distance instead of KL divergence.- Introducing Wasserstein predictive coding (WPC), a practical approximation of the Wasserstein dependency measure using Lipschitz regularization from GAN literature. - Showing experimentally that WPC mitigates the incomplete representation problem of mutual information approaches and learns more complete representations on a number of designed tasks as well as on real datasets like CelebA.- Analyzing the effect of dataset size, minibatch size, and neural network inductive biases, and showing WPC is more robust in various settings.So in summary, the main contribution appears to be identifying limitations of mutual information approaches for representation learning, proposing the Wasserstein dependency measure as a solution, and providing experimental evidence that a practical approximation can learn more complete representations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in representation learning:- It focuses on limitations of mutual information-based representation learning methods like contrastive predictive coding (CPC). Prior work has shown CPC can learn useful representations, but this paper argues it struggles with high mutual information data.- It proposes an alternative called the Wasserstein dependency measure that uses the Wasserstein distance instead of KL divergence. This is motivated by the theoretical benefits of Wasserstein vs KL for dependency measurement. - It introduces a practical method called Wasserstein predictive coding (WPC) to approximate the proposed Wasserstein dependency measure. WPC combines ideas from CPC and Wasserstein GAN regularization.- Experiments across several synthetic and real datasets demonstrate WPC mitigates issues with CPC, leading to better representation learning. WPC seems robust to factors like dataset size and batch size.- The techniques focus on unsupervised representation learning. Much prior work has explored supervised representation learning, but unsupervised settings remain challenging. The proposed ideas could help advance unsupervised methods.- For estimation, the paper uses simple gradient penalty regularization from WGAN. More advanced Lipschitz constraint techniques could further improve WPC performance.Overall, this paper makes both theoretical and practical contributions for unsupervised representation learning. It identifies limitations of existing mutual information methods, proposes the Wasserstein dependency measure as an alternative, and provides promising experimental results with WPC. More work is needed to scale up WPC, but it seems a worthwhile direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Developing better methods for enforcing Lipschitz continuity in neural networks. The authors note that their approximation using gradient penalty may not be sufficient for more complex tasks, and better scalable methods for Lipschitz regularization could lead to further improvements.- Exploring other metrics beyond Euclidean for the Wasserstein dependency measure. The choice of metric provides an inductive bias, so investigating different metrics suited for different modalities could be beneficial. - Extending the Wasserstein dependency measure to other divergence measures like Sinkhorn divergences. The Wasserstein distance has computational challenges, so approximations like Sinkhorn divergences could help scale these techniques.- Applying Wasserstein dependency measure to other self-supervised learning tasks like natural language processing. The authors demonstrate results on image domains, but extending to other modalities like text could be an interesting direction.- Theoretical analysis of generalization with Wasserstein dependency measure versus mutual information lower bounds. The authors provide an intuition for why Wasserstein could generalize better, but formal analysis could further illuminate this.- Combining Wasserstein dependency measure with other self-supervised losses. The Wasserstein objective could complement other losses like predictability to learn even better representations.In summary, the main thrust is developing better methods for optimizing and scaling Wasserstein dependency measure, extending it to other modalities and tasks, and rigorously analyzing its theoretical properties. The results indicate it is a promising approach worthy of further investigation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new unsupervised representation learning approach called Wasserstein dependency measure (WDM) as an alternative to mutual information maximization. It argues that mutual information estimators are fundamentally limited due to needing sample sizes exponential in the mutual information. This causes issues in practice where the mutual information is often large, such as in video or RL. The limitations stem from using KL divergence which is insensitive to distances between underlying samples. WDM addresses this by using the metric-aware Wasserstein distance instead of KL divergence. A practical approximation called Wasserstein predictive coding (WPC) is presented using Lipschitz continuity techniques from GAN literature. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate WPC mitigates the limitations of mutual information maximization, leading to learning more complete representations on tasks where this is an issue. WPC outperforms mutual information techniques, especially when inductive biases like CNN priors do not fit the data well. Overall, the work provides theoretical and empirical evidence that using Wasserstein distances instead of KL divergence can improve representation learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces the Wasserstein dependency measure (WDM) as an alternative to mutual information for unsupervised representation learning. The key motivation is that mutual information maximization techniques are limited in the amount of mutual information they can capture, due to the need for an exponential number of samples to tightly estimate mutual information. This leads to incomplete representations that only capture a few factors of variation when the true mutual information is high, as is common in many problems like video understanding. To address this, the authors propose using the Wasserstein distance rather than the KL divergence in the mutual information objective. This results in a representation learning method that is more robust to high mutual information values. They introduce Wasserstein predictive coding (WPC) as a practical approximation, using ideas from GAN training to enforce Lipschitz constraints. Experiments across a range of designed and real datasets demonstrate that WPC representations capture substantially more factors of variation compared to mutual information techniques when the underlying mutual information is high. The results provide strong evidence that the Wasserstein dependency measure is a promising alternative to mutual information for unsupervised representation learning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper introduces the Wasserstein dependency measure as an alternative to mutual information for unsupervised representation learning. The key ideas are:- Mutual information lower bounds suffer from limitations in estimating high mutual information from finite samples. This can result in incomplete representations that only capture a few factors of variation.- The Wasserstein dependency measure uses the Wasserstein distance instead of the KL divergence used in mutual information. This makes it metric-aware and focus on modeling the generative process between variables. - A practical objective called Wasserstein predictive coding is proposed. It combines contrastive predictive coding with Lipschitz regularization from the GAN literature to approximate the Wasserstein dependency measure.- Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate cases where mutual information methods fail due to high mutual information. The proposed Wasserstein method mitigates these issues and learns more complete representations.In summary, the paper proposes a theoretically motivated alternative to mutual information for unsupervised representation learning based on the Wasserstein distance. It provides an analysis of limitations of mutual information methods and shows improved performance of the proposed method.
