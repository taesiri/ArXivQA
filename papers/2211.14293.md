# [RbA: Segmenting Unknown Regions Rejected by All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14293)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we improve anomaly/unknown object segmentation by using mask classification models instead of per-pixel classification?

The key hypotheses explored in the paper are:

1) Mask classification models have inherent properties that allow them to express uncertainty better and reduce overconfidence on unknown classes compared to per-pixel classification models.

2) The object queries in mask classification behave approximately like independent one vs all classifiers for each known class. This property can be exploited to define a new outlier scoring function.

3) Fine-tuning a very small part of a mask classification model with minimal outlier data and a custom loss function can optimize the proposed outlier scoring function and achieve state-of-the-art anomaly segmentation without hurting closed-set performance.

In summary, the paper proposes using mask classification instead of per-pixel classification for anomaly segmentation, based on an analysis of the properties of mask classifiers. It introduces a new outlier scoring function called RbA that builds on the one vs all behavior of object queries. And it shows that fine-tuning just 0.21% of the Mask2Former model parameters with a small amount of outlier data can optimize RbA to exceed previous methods, while maintaining inlier performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a novel outlier scoring function called RbA (Rejected by All) that represents the probability of a pixel belonging to an unknown class as not being assigned to any of the known classes. 

- Showing that mask classification models like Mask2Former exhibit a "one vs all" behavior where the object queries specialize in predicting specific classes independently. This helps reduce overconfidence in predictions.

- Demonstrating that fine-tuning only a small part of a mask classification model with the proposed RbA objective and minimal outlier data can improve unknown segmentation performance without hurting known class segmentation.

- Conducting extensive experiments on challenging datasets like SMIYC, Road Anomaly and Fishyscapes to show state-of-the-art performance in unknown segmentation while preserving known class performance.

In summary, the key novelty seems to be the proposed RbA scoring function that is optimized with minimal outlier supervision to achieve strong unknown segmentation. The insights into mask classification models and how to effectively fine-tune them are also important contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new semantic segmentation method for detecting unknown object categories by leveraging mask classification models, finding they behave like one-vs-all classifiers, and defining a new outlier scoring function and training objective to optimize it using minimal outlier data.
