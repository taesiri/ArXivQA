# [RbA: Segmenting Unknown Regions Rejected by All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14293)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve anomaly/unknown object segmentation by using mask classification models instead of per-pixel classification?The key hypotheses explored in the paper are:1) Mask classification models have inherent properties that allow them to express uncertainty better and reduce overconfidence on unknown classes compared to per-pixel classification models.2) The object queries in mask classification behave approximately like independent one vs all classifiers for each known class. This property can be exploited to define a new outlier scoring function.3) Fine-tuning a very small part of a mask classification model with minimal outlier data and a custom loss function can optimize the proposed outlier scoring function and achieve state-of-the-art anomaly segmentation without hurting closed-set performance.In summary, the paper proposes using mask classification instead of per-pixel classification for anomaly segmentation, based on an analysis of the properties of mask classifiers. It introduces a new outlier scoring function called RbA that builds on the one vs all behavior of object queries. And it shows that fine-tuning just 0.21% of the Mask2Former model parameters with a small amount of outlier data can optimize RbA to exceed previous methods, while maintaining inlier performance.
