# [How to Backdoor Diffusion Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05400)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How to effectively implant backdoors into diffusion models? 

Specifically, the authors propose a novel attack framework called "BadDiffusion" to engineer compromised diffusion processes during model training for backdoor implantation. The key hypothesis is that by maliciously modifying both the training data and the forward/backward diffusion steps, the proposed BadDiffusion approach can train a backdoored diffusion model that achieves two main attack objectives:

1. High utility: The backdoored model has similar performance to a clean (untampered) diffusion model on regular inputs.

2. High specificity: The backdoored model exhibits a specific targeted behavior when a trigger pattern is present in the input.

The paper aims to demonstrate that BadDiffusion can successfully create backdoored diffusion models with high attack effectiveness, measured by utility and specificity. The findings suggest potential security risks of diffusion models being compromised via backdoor attacks.

In summary, the central research question is how to effectively backdoor diffusion models, and the key hypothesis is that the proposed BadDiffusion attack framework can achieve this by jointly tampering with the training data and diffusion processes. The attack effectiveness is evaluated through quantitative metrics on model utility and specificity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel backdoor attack framework called BadDiffusion that targets diffusion models. The key ideas and contributions are:

- BadDiffusion is the first work that explores the risks of backdoor attacks against diffusion models. It proposes a tailored attack methodology to implant backdoors into diffusion models by modifying the training data and the forward/backward diffusion processes. 

- Through extensive experiments, the authors show BadDiffusion can consistently train backdoored diffusion models with high attack effectiveness (high specificity to the backdoor trigger and target) and model utility (good performance on clean inputs).

- The authors demonstrate BadDiffusion can be executed cost-effectively by fine-tuning a pre-trained clean diffusion model. This is concerning as it shows an attacker can easily create a backdoored version from a publicly available diffusion model.

- The paper discusses and evaluates potential countermeasures like adversarial neuron pruning and inference-time clipping. The results provide insights into the challenges and opportunities for mitigating backdoor risks in diffusion models. 

- Overall, the work systematically studies the backdoor attack surface of diffusion models, reveals practical risks, and calls attention to the potential misuse of diffusion models. It sheds light on improving the robustness and security of diffusion models.

In summary, the key contribution is comprehensively exploring and evaluating the feasibility of backdoor attacks against diffusion models, an increasingly important class of generative models. The paper reveals practical risks and weaknesses that need to be addressed.
