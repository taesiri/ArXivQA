# [Heterogeneous Encoders Scaling In The Transformer For Neural Machine   Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15872)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are various neural network architectures like RNNs, CNNs, self-attention, etc. that can encode sequences in different ways. 
- State-of-the-art NLP models combine a couple of these techniques, but it's unclear why only some methods are chosen and not others.  
- Existing combinations also intertwine the methods closely, limiting flexibility in applying different combinations.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Multi-Encoder Transformer to systematically analyze combining an increasing number of heterogeneous encoding methods - RNN, CNN, self-attention, static expansion, and Fourier transform.
- Use a simple summing strategy to combine the encoder outputs to enable adding arbitrary encoders easily.
- Analyze the synergies between the different encoders to determine good combinations.

Key Contributions:
- Show that a dual encoder Transformer with self-attention + static expansion outperforms single encoder baseline across all translation tasks.
- Low resource languages with less training data benefit more from multiple encoders (max gains of 5.35 and 7.16 BLEU).
- Increasing beyond 2 encoders gives diminishing returns and can even hurt performance in some cases.
- Analysis provides insights into synergies between different encoding methods.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the potential benefits of combining multiple heterogeneous encoders in sequence modelling, with dual encoder Transformers showing consistent improvements across tasks. The analysis also reveals that more than 2 encoders leads to reduced gains, and could guide selection of encoding techniques in future work.
