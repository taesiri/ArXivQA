# [Label Propagation for Zero-shot Classification with Vision-Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04072)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles zero-shot image classification using vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, it considers the case where unlabeled images are available in addition to the labeled training data. The goal is to utilize the unlabeled data to improve zero-shot classification performance.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes ZLaP, a method based on label propagation (LP) to exploit the structure of the unlabeled data. ZLaP constructs a graph with nodes being the VLM features of class names (text nodes) and unlabeled images (image nodes). Edges capture similarity between nodes based on a separate kNN search for images and text. LP is then used to propagate labels from text to image nodes for classification. 

The paper tailors LP to handle bi-modal graphs and balance cross-modal affinities. Further, an efficient inductive variant is proposed based on a dual LP solution and sparsification. This not only speeds up inference but also improves accuracy by suppressing less confident predictions.

Main Contributions:

- Tailors label propagation for zero-shot VLM classification over bi-modal graphs via separate kNN search and cross-modal affinity balancing

- Proposes an efficient inductive variant using a dual LP solution and sparsification that improves both runtime and accuracy

- Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on 14 datasets for both transductive and inductive setups

- Demonstrates compatibility with recent methods leveraging LLMs or unlabeled data like InMaP

The proposed ZLaP is non-parametric, efficient and can work with black-box VLMs. By effectively using unlabeled data, it pushes the envelope of zero-shot learning for image classification.
