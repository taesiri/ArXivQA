# [DR2: Diffusion-based Robust Degradation Remover for Blind Face   Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06885)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop a robust blind face restoration framework that is able to handle complex, real-world degradations without relying on synthetic training data?The key points are:- Current blind face restoration methods rely on training with synthetic degradations, which limits their ability to handle complex real-world degradations. - The authors propose a two-stage framework called DR2E that consists of a Diffusion-based Robust Degradation Remover (DR2) module and an enhancement module. - DR2 leverages a pretrained denoising diffusion model to remove degradations and transform the input into a clean, degradation-invariant intermediate representation. This allows it to handle complex real-world degradations without seeing them during training.- The enhancement module then uses this intermediate output to produce a high quality restoration result. This separation of degradation removal and quality enhancement provides robustness and flexibility.- Experiments demonstrate the approach is more robust on heavily degraded real-world data compared to recent state-of-the-art methods that rely on synthetic training data.So in summary, the key hypothesis is that using diffusion models in a two-stage framework can enable robust blind face restoration without reliance on synthetic degradations for training. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of this approach.
