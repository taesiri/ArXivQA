# [InstructTA: Instruction-Tuned Targeted Attack for Large Vision-Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01886)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an instruction-tuned targeted attack method called InstructTA for fooling large vision-language models (LVLMs). The attack operates under a practical gray-box threat model where the adversary only has access to the victim LVLM's visual encoder, without knowledge of the underlying language model or prompts used. To achieve high attack transferability, InstructTA leverages text-to-image models and language models like GPT-4 to generate reasonable target images and prompt instructions tailored to the attacker's chosen target text response. It then extracts instruction-aware features from the target image and adversarial example using a local surrogate model, and minimizes the distance between these features during optimization. Further transferability improvements come from paraphrasing the inferred prompts using ChatGPT. Experiments against models like BLIP-2, InstructBLIP and MiniGPT-4 demonstrate InstructTA's superior targeted attack success rate over baselines. The work highlights LVLMs' vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and the importance of instruction tuning and fusing visual-linguistic information to enable more transferable attacks.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to images can cause the model to output erroneous or malicious responses. 
- Targeted attacks that aim to make the model output a specific response pose serious safety concerns.
- Existing attacks assume white-box or black-box access to the full model. The paper considers a more practical gray-box setting where the attacker only has access to the visual encoder. This is challenging due to the lack of knowledge about the language model backends and prompts used.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes InstructTA, an instruction-tuned targeted attack for LVLMs.
- It first uses GPT-4 to infer a reasonable instruction for the target response. 
- It creates a surrogate model with the same visual encoder and trains it to extract features tailored to the instruction and target response.
- It generates a target image from the text via stable diffusion and minimizes the distance between embeddings of the adversarial image and target image.
- To improve transferability, it augments the instruction via paraphrasing and uses the augmented versions during optimization.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates a practical gray-box attack scenario against LVLMs.
- Proposes InstructTA, which uses inferred and augmented instructions to enable targeted attacks on LVLMs in this setting.
- Shows improved attack success rate and transferability compared to existing methods.
- Provides detailed experimental analysis and discussions around ethics and mitigations.

In summary, the paper explores the vulnerability of LVLMs to practical gray-box targeted attacks, and proposes an instruction-tuning based approach to enable such attacks with high effectiveness and transferability.
