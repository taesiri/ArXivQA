# [Leveraging AI Predicted and Expert Revised Annotations in Interactive   Segmentation: Continual Tuning or Full Training?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19423)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- In interactive segmentation, human experts revise AI model predictions and the AI model improves using these revisions. However, two key issues arise:
1) Catastrophic forgetting - the model forgets previously learned classes when trained only on revised annotations. 
2) Training inefficiency - retraining using both predicted and revised annotations is slow and revised annotations have little impact due to their small portion.

Proposed Solution - Continual Tuning
- Addresses the two issues through network architecture and data reuse
1) Uses a shared network for all classes plus class-specific networks 
2) Freezes shared network and only fine-tunes class-specific network for revised classes. Prevents forgetting.
3) Reuses a small subset of data based on an importance score to avoid over-computation

Key Contributions:
- Continual Tuning achieves competitive performance to full retraining baseline but is 16x faster 
- Prevents catastrophic forgetting through network architecture
- Selective data reuse further improves efficiency 
- Shows promise for long term learning as model iteratively improves through expert interaction
- Enables precision diagnosis and reduces annotation effort in healthcare

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient way to leverage AI predictions and expert revisions called Continual Tuning. It prevents catastrophic forgetting and improves computational efficiency to facilitate iterative enhancement of models in interactive segmentation for healthcare applications.
