# [View-decoupled Transformer for Person Re-identification under   Aerial-ground Camera Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14513)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing person re-identification (ReID) methods focus on homogeneous camera networks (ground-ground or aerial-aerial matching) and achieve good performance. However, aerial-ground person re-identification (AGPReID) is more practical but faces the key challenge of dramatic view discrepancy between aerial and ground cameras, which hinders discriminative identity representation.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a view-decoupled transformer (VDT) to specifically tackle the view discrepancy challenge in AGPReID. 
- VDT contains two key components: (1) Hierarchical subtractive separation, which separates view-related and view-unrelated features layer-by-layer inside VDT. (2) Orthogonal loss, which constrains the above two features to be independent after VDT.
- Together, these two components achieve the decoupling of view-related and view-unrelated features to facilitate identity learning from view-unrelated features.

Main Contributions:
- Focuses on the novel aerial-ground person re-identification (AGPReID) problem which is more practical but challenging.
- Proposes view-decoupled transformer (VDT) to specifically tackle the dramatic view discrepancy in AGPReID, by hierarchically subtractive separation and orthogonal loss.
- Contributes CARGO, a large-scale synthetic dataset for AGPReID, with 5,000 identities and 108,563 images under 5 aerial and 8 ground cameras.
- Experiments show VDT achieves state-of-the-art performance on CARGO and another dataset AG-ReID, demonstrating its effectiveness.

In summary, the paper identifies the more practical yet challenging AGPReID problem, proposes VDT solution to alleviate view discrepancy, and contributes a large synthetic dataset to advance AGPReID research. Experiments validate the superiority of VDT for tackling view challenges in AGPReID.
