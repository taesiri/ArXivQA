# [SAFDNet: A Simple and Effective Network for Fully Sparse 3D Object   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing high-performing 3D object detectors rely on dense feature maps, causing quadratic growth in computational costs as perception range increases. This makes them difficult to scale up for long-range detection.  
- Fully sparse detectors avoid this issue but suffer from center feature missing problem for large objects, hurting accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose SAFDNet, a simple yet effective fully sparse detector tailored for long-range 3D detection.
- Main idea is to propagate features adaptively towards object centers to address center missing issue while maintaining efficiency.  

Key Points:
- Employs sparse 3D backbone to extract voxel features and transform to 2D BEV features.
- Proposes adaptive feature diffusion (AFD) strategy to selectively expand voxel features to neighborhoods based on voxel locations. Larger diffusion for voxels inside bounding boxes.
- AFD serves as core component to handle center missing issue without dense convolutions.
- Achieves strong performance on Waymo (short-range) and Argoverse2 (long-range), validating efficacy for long-range detection.  

Main Contributions:
- Simple yet effective fully sparse detector achieving SOTA accuracy.
- Adaptive feature diffusion strategy to address center missing problem while retaining efficiency.
- State-of-the-art results on Waymo Open and Argoverse2 datasets, especially for long-range detection.
- Ablation studies validating design choices of AFD strategy.
