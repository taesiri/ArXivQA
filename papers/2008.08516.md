## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a brief comparison to other research in the field of automated machine learning (AutoML):

- The paper provides a good historical overview of the progress in AutoML over the past decade or so. Other papers such as those by Yao et al. (2019), Zoller et al. (2021), and He et al. (2021) also review the history and development of AutoML, but the overview in this chapter is more concise and high-level.

- The paper categorizes AutoML methods into different levels (alpha, beta, gamma) based on the Liu et al. (2019) framework. This provides a nice way to disentangle the different AutoML approaches. Other papers like Feurer et al. (2019) use different taxonomies to categorize AutoML techniques.

- The paper briefly describes some of the key AutoML methods like PSMS, Auto-WEKA, Auto-Sklearn, TPOT, etc. More comprehensive surveys like Hutter et al. (2019) and Elsken et al. (2018) provide more in-depth analysis and comparison of AutoML algorithms.

- The paper highlights the importance of challenges like ChaLearn AutoML for advancing the state-of-the-art. Reviews like Guyon et al. (2019) provide more details on these challenges.

- The open issues and future directions discussed align broadly with those identified in other papers, including interpretability, transfer learning, benchmarking, etc. But they are discussed here more briefly.

Overall, this chapter provides a solid high-level overview of AutoML aimed at newcomers to the field, in contrast to other more detailed survey papers. The historical perspective is helpful but concise compared to other reviews. The discussion of open problems is fairly general compared to some other analyses. So in summary, it serves well as an introductory AutoML overview.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Explainable AutoML models: Developing AutoML methods that are transparent and can explain their model selection and tuning process. This could improve accessibility and trust in AutoML.

- AutoML for feature engineering: Applying AutoML specifically to the feature engineering process. This could allow working directly from raw data.

- AutoML for non-tabular data: Developing AutoML techniques that work on non-tabular data like images, text, graphs, etc. Most AutoML research has focused on tabular data.

- Large scale AutoML: Improving the ability of AutoML methods to work on large datasets and in large scale settings. Many current methods struggle with large data. 

- Transfer learning in AutoML: Leveraging transfer learning to improve AutoML performance by transferring optimization knowledge across tasks.

- Benchmarking and reproducibility: Creating standardized platforms and frameworks for evaluating and fairly comparing AutoML methods. This could improve maturity of the field.

- Interactive AutoML: Developing interactive AutoML methods that can incorporate human domain knowledge and guidance in the model building process.

In summary, the main suggested directions are around improving AutoML performance on complex real-world problems, enhancing transparency and interactivity, and advancing reproducibility and rigor of the field.
