# [DOT: A Distillation-Oriented Trainer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08436)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research questions and hypotheses appear to be:- There seems to be a trade-off between optimizing the task loss and the distillation loss when using standard knowledge distillation techniques. Introducing the distillation loss limits the convergence of the task loss. - The authors hypothesize that this trade-off is due to insufficient optimization of the distillation loss. If the distillation loss was optimized better, it could help decrease both the distillation loss and the task loss since it makes the student more similar to the better-performing teacher.- To address this trade-off, the authors propose a novel training method called Distillation-Oriented Trainer (DOT) which aims to optimize the distillation loss more sufficiently by using separate momentum values for the task and distillation losses. - The central hypothesis is that by making the distillation loss optimization more dominant with higher momentum, DOT can break the trade-off between task and distillation losses, achieving lower values for both losses and better model performance.In summary, the key focus seems to be investigating and addressing the trade-off between task and distillation losses during knowledge distillation training, by making the distillation loss optimization more dominant. The DOT method is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It provides the first attempt to understand knowledge distillation from an optimization perspective. Specifically, it reveals an interesting trade-off phenomenon - introducing distillation loss helps the student network converge to flatter minima with better generalization, but limits the convergence of the task loss. 2. To address this trade-off issue, the paper proposes a novel training method called Distillation-Oriented Trainer (DOT). DOT separates the gradients of task loss and distillation loss, and applies larger momentum to distillation loss to make its optimization more sufficient. 3. Extensive experiments show that DOT can effectively break the trade-off and achieve lower task loss and lower distillation loss simultaneously. DOT also leads to more flat minima and significantly improves various distillation methods on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet datasets.4. More importantly, this work provides valuable insights into knowledge distillation and shows the great potential of better optimization for distillation. It is an important step towards understanding and improving knowledge transfer from the optimization perspective.In summary, the key contribution is revealing the optimization trade-off in distillation and proposing DOT to address it. DOT achieves better optimization and performance for knowledge distillation. This work also opens up new research directions on optimization for distillation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Distillation-Oriented Trainer (DOT), a novel optimization method for knowledge distillation that applies larger momentum to the distillation loss gradients and smaller momentum to the task loss gradients, which breaks the trade-off between task and distillation losses and enables better convergence and generalization.
