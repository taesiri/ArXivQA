# [HDRFlow: Real-Time HDR Video Reconstruction with Large Motions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03447)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reconstructing high dynamic range (HDR) video from sequences captured with alternating exposures is challenging, especially when there are large motions between frames. Existing methods rely on optical flow or attention mechanisms for alignment before fusion, but they often struggle with large complex motions and are computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a robust and efficient flow estimation method called "HDRFlow" tailored for real-time HDR video reconstruction. HDRFlow has three key components:

1) HDR-Domain Alignment Loss (HALoss): A novel loss function to supervise the flow network, enabling accurate alignment in saturated and dark regions by utilizing the corresponding ground-truth HDR frames for photometric consistency.

2) Efficient Flow Network with Multi-Size Large Kernel (MLK): A lightweight flow network to efficiently model large motions, using multi-size large kernel convolutions that operate only on low-resolution features to minimize computation.

3) HDR Flow Training Scheme: A training scheme that incorporates both synthetic (Sintel) and real videos, utilizing ground-truth optical flows from Sintel to improve robustness against large motions.

Main Contributions:

1) First real-time HDR video reconstruction method for alternating-exposure sequences, capable of 720p resolution at 25ms per frame.

2) Novel HDR-domain alignment loss for supervising flow network to learn HDR-oriented flow that precisely aligns saturated/dark regions.

3) Efficient flow network with multi-size large kernels to model large motions at low computational cost.

4) New training scheme integrating Sintel's ground-truth flows to boost robustness against large motions.

Experiments show state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance. The method is robust to large motions, outperforming previous flow-based and attention-based approaches. At 720p resolution, HDRFlow reconstructs HDR video at 25ms per frame, 10Ã— faster than prior arts.
