# [Learning adaptive planning representations with natural language   guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08566)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the challenge of adapting general world knowledge to support flexible long-term planning in AI agents. While techniques exist for solving restricted, short-term planning problems, generalized and long-horizon planning remains an open challenge across AI paradigms. The key bottleneck is identifying useful hierarchical action representations tailored to a particular domain that enable efficient planning. Most state-of-the-art systems rely on human expertise to hand-engineer these representations.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a framework called "Action Domain Acquisition" (Ada) for automatically constructing task-specific planning representations using background knowledge from language models (LLMs). Ada interactively learns a library of planner-compatible high-level action abstractions and low-level controllers adapted to a domain of planning tasks. 

It uses LLM prompts to initially propose candidate operator definitions consisting of preconditions, effects, and low-level controllers. It then uses a bi-level planner that refines high-level plans into low-level action sequences to iteratively ground and verify these operators based on environment interaction. Useful operators are added to the library, while inaccurate ones are rejected. The low-level controllers are also refined over time using policy learning techniques.

Main Contributions:

- A novel framework for using LLMs to propose an initial set of useful planning operator abstractions tailored to a domain using language, then iteratively grounding and verifying these representations through environment interaction

- Demonstrating that language provides an effective prior for proposing planning representations that enable efficient search

- Introducing two language-goal based planning benchmarks based on Mini Minecraft and ALFRED household environments  

- Showing significantly improved performance over baselines on complex, compositional tasks requiring abstraction hierarchies to solve efficiently

The main insight is utilizing linguistic knowledge as a rich general prior for planning that can be adapted to different domains through interaction, reducing manual engineering effort.
