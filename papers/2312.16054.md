# [A Logically Consistent Chain-of-Thought Approach for Stance Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16054)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to detect stances towards unseen targets. Existing methods struggle with two key issues: 1) Knowledge-task disconnect: They extract expansive, fragmented information not directly relevant for stance detection. 2) Lack of logical consistency: The fragmented knowledge lacks logical verification, introducing errors and contradictions that reduce credibility of predictions.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Logically Consistent Chain-of-Thought (LC-CoT) approach to improve relevance and logical soundness of knowledge utilization for ZSSD. It has three steps:

1) Ask an LLM if additional knowledge is needed to determine the stance. 

2) If yes, use the LLM to generate API calls to retrieve relevant knowledge from external sources, processed by a separate LLM.

3) Provide the LLM a manually selected exemplar with if-then logical structure to guide inference and consolidate input text and retrieved knowledge to predict the stance.

Key Contributions:
- Structured elicitation of pertinent background knowledge from LLMs through a chain-of-thought process to enhance ZSSD model capability.

- Ensuring relevance and logical coherence of knowledge utilization by employing if-then reasoning templates. 

- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance over supervised models without needing annotated data, even in cross-target setups.

- Established efficacy of integrating logical reasoning into LLM-based knowledge generation to elevate stance detection accuracy and reliability.

In summary, the paper introduced an effective structured methodology to leverage LLMs' knowledge and inference capabilities through logical prompting for superior zero-shot stance detection.
