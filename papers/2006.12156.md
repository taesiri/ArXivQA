# [Logarithmic Pruning is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12156)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is:

How large must a randomly initialized neural network be in order to contain subnetworks that can approximate any given target network to high accuracy, without any training?

Specifically, the paper aims to provide tighter theoretical bounds on the size of the randomly initialized "large" network compared to the target network. This is formalizing the idea of the "lottery ticket hypothesis", which states that large neural networks contain small subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the full network. 

The key results of the paper are:

- They provide a general lemma that shows how the approximation error propagates through the layers of a network based on the accuracy of approximating the individual weights. This gives insight into how the different variables like depth, width, weight norms, etc. impact the required accuracy.

- They show that by using a hyperbolic distribution to sample weights (instead of a uniform distribution as in prior work), the overparameterized network only needs O(log n) neurons per weight of the target network. This is much tighter than previous polynomial bounds.

- They remove the assumption on bounding weight norms from prior work and show the bound becomes O(L log n) where L is the depth. 

- Overall, the paper gives an improved theoretical understanding of how overparameterization allows neural networks to contain highly accurate subnetworks, formalizing the lottery ticket hypothesis. The key insight is using a hyperbolic weight distribution for tighter logarithmic bounds.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proving strong theoretical guarantees for the lottery ticket hypothesis. Specifically, the paper shows that a large randomly initialized neural network only needs a logarithmic factor more neurons per weight compared to a target subnetwork in order to contain good subnetworks that can approximate the target to high accuracy after pruning. 

Key contributions:

- Provides significantly tighter bounds on the overparameterization needed compared to prior work, improving from polynomial to logarithmic in the number of layers, number of neurons per layer, and error tolerance. 

- Removes limiting assumptions made in prior work, such as bounds on the spectral norms of the weight matrices.

- Shows the logarithmic factor above while keeping all other dependencies only logarithmic, compared to prior polynomial dependencies.

- Achieves this by using novel proof techniques exploiting the composability of neural nets, including binary decomposition of weights, product weight distributions, and batch sampling.

In summary, the paper makes significant theoretical progress on an important open problem regarding neural network overparameterization, proving that randomness and pruning together can extract high-accuracy subnetworks using far fewer parameters than previously thought necessary. This provides valuable insight into the power of overparameterization and the role of pruning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proves that large randomly initialized neural networks contain many more accurately prunable subnetworks than previously shown, requiring only logarithmically more neurons per weight compared to the target network.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper focuses specifically on proving tighter theoretical bounds on the size of neural networks required to contain good subnetworks that can be revealed through pruning, building on the "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis" area of research. Other papers have provided empirical evidence for this hypothesis, but this paper makes theoretical contributions.

- Compared to the prior work of Ramanujan et al. (2019) and Malach et al. (2020), this paper provides stronger theoretical guarantees by improving the bounds from polynomial to logarithmic in key variables related to network size and accuracy. 

- The key innovations that allow tighter bounds are using a hyperbolic weight distribution rather than uniform, decomposing weights in a "binary" fashion, and batch sampling techniques. These proof ideas could potentially be applied to improve bounds for uniform sampling as well.

- The assumptions made are similar to Malach et al. in terms of bounding weight and input norms. However, this paper manages to relax the assumption of bounded spectral norm of the weight matrices, at the cost of a linear dependence on number of layers.

- Compared to concurrent work by Pensia et al. (2020), this paper takes a more general approach not restricted to bounded input/weight norms, while Pensia et al. provide matching upper and lower bounds. The techniques of decomposed weights could be complementary.

- Overall, this paper makes important theoretical progress on fundamental questions about neural network trainability, pruning, and the lottery ticket hypothesis. The logarithmic bounds derived are significantly tighter than prior work. Extending the bounds to more general settings like unbounded weights/inputs is noteworthy.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper proposes some possible directions for future research:

- Study the impact of convolutional layers, skip connections, LSTM/RNNs, and other types of layers on the theoretical bounds for network pruning. The current results focus only on fully-connected feedforward networks. Extending the analysis to other network architectures could provide insights into their benefits.

- Investigate whether similar or better bounds can be proved for uniform or Gaussian weight initialization, perhaps by taking advantage of summing or averaging weights. The current results rely on a hyperbolic weight distribution, but the authors conjecture uniform weights may also work well.

- Explore whether hyperbolic weight initialization improves practical performance, for either pruning untrained networks or for training. The theoretical analysis suggests potential benefits, but empirical validation is needed. 

- Examine how the bounds change for different activation functions like sigmoid or tanh. This may reveal insights about their properties.

- Consider how pruning and training interact, and whether pruning guides networks into the vicinity of a global optimum that can then be refined locally.

- Extend the analysis to other learning settings like classification, reinforcement learning, etc. This could uncover insights about the role of overparameterization more broadly.

- Study the complexity of finding the optimal sparse subnetwork, which may be as hard as learning in very overparameterized regimes.

In summary, the main suggested directions are: extending the theoretical analysis to more network architectures and settings, validating benefits empirically, and elucidating connections between pruning, training dynamics, overparameterization, and learning difficulty.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper improves on recent theoretical results showing that large neural networks contain many smaller subnetworks ("winning tickets") that can achieve comparable accuracy to the full network when trained in isolation. Prior work established polynomial bounds on the size of the overparameterized network required to contain good subnetworks, but made strong assumptions about weight norms. This paper shows that with a hyperbolic weight distribution, only a logarithmic factor more neurons per target weight are needed, removing most assumptions. The key ideas are decomposing weights in a binary-like fashion using a `golden ratio' base, combining weights through their product distribution, and "recycling" sampled neurons across target weights. Compared to prior polynomial bounds, this gives much tighter guarantees on the size of overparameterized networks required to contain accurate subnetworks, lending further support to the notion that neural networks inherently contain many accurate but compact subnetworks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a new theoretical analysis of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which conjectures that large neural networks contain small subnetworks ("winning tickets") that can achieve comparable performance to the full network when trained in isolation. The paper builds on recent theoretical work by Malach et al. (2020) that provided the first polynomial bounds on how overparameterized a network needs to be to contain good winning tickets. Specifically, Malach et al. showed that with uniform weight initialization, a network needs a polynomial factor more weights than the target subnetwork in order to contain it with high probability. 

This paper improves on the polynomial bounds of Malach et al. by using a hyperbolic weight initialization scheme rather than uniform weights. With this change, the authors are able to show logarithmic bounds on the overparameterization factor required. In particular, they prove that with hyperbolic initialization, the overparameterized network only needs Ã•(log(layers x neurons / accuracy)) times more neurons per weight compared to the target network. This is a significant improvement over the polynomial dependency shown in prior work. The proof relies on a "binary" decomposition of weights using the composability of neural networks. Overall, this tightened analysis gives further evidence for the idea that neural networks inherently contain many accurate subnetworks from random initialization.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new method for proving bounds on the size of a randomly initialized overparameterized neural network required to contain good subnetworks that can approximate a target network after pruning. Previous work showed polynomial bounds, but relied on strong assumptions about weight and input norms. This paper removes those assumptions by using a hyperbolic distribution to sample weights instead of a uniform distribution, along with some new techniques like binary decomposition of weights, product weight distributions, and batch sampling. Specifically, they show that by sampling weights from a hyperbolic distribution, decomposing them into a binary representation with precision related to the target accuracy, and constructing virtual weights as products of multiple sampled weights, the overparameterized network only needs O(log n) neurons per target weight. This leads to logarithmic or near-linear bounds without norm constraints, significantly improving upon prior polynomial bounds. The key insight is that the hyperbolic distribution combined with weight products and sums can give high density over a large range.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key question the paper is addressing is: How large must a randomly initialized neural network be in order to contain subnetworks that can approximate any target network to high accuracy? 

In particular, the paper aims to provide stronger theoretical guarantees than previous work on the properties of untrained neural networks and their capability to contain highly accurate "winning lottery tickets" or subnetworks.

The paper builds on the influential work of Frankle & Carbin on the "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis", which conjectured that large neural networks contain much smaller subnetworks that can reach comparable accuracy to the full network when trained in isolation. 

Recent theoretical work has provided results bounding the size of the overparameterized network required to contain good subnetworks, but relied on strong assumptions. This paper aims to relax those assumptions while providing tighter bounds, improving from polynomial to logarithmic dependence on key variables like network size and accuracy.

The main contributions are:

- An analysis of how approximation error propagates through network layers, which provides insight into the effect of different variables on the required accuracy.

- Construction of a large "prunable" network with weights sampled from a hyperbolic rather than uniform distribution. This allows taking advantage of a logarithmic decomposition of weights. 

- Theoretical results showing the overparameterized network only needs a logarithmic (rather than polynomial) factor more neurons per weight compared to the target subnetwork, under similar assumptions as previous work.

- Further relaxation of assumptions leading to linear rather than exponential dependence on depth, at the expense of some other logarithmic factors.

So in summary, the key question addressed is how large an untrained network must be to contain very accurate subnetworks, with the main contribution being significantly improved theoretical bounds compared to prior work.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Neural networks
- Lottery Ticket Hypothesis 
- Pruning
- Overparameterization
- Winning tickets
- Subnetworks
- ReLU activation
- Training dynamics
- Weight initialization
- Hyperbolic distribution

The main focus of the paper is on the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which conjectures that large neural networks contain smaller subnetworks that can match the performance of the full network when trained in isolation. The authors provide theoretical analysis to show that overparameterized networks contain many more of these "winning ticket" subnetworks than previously proven. 

To do this, they construct a large randomly initialized network and show that with only a logarithmic factor more neurons per weight compared to the target subnetwork, the large network is guaranteed to contain a matching subnetwork that can be revealed through pruning. This is a significant improvement over previous polynomial bounds.

Some of the key theoretical contributions and techniques used are:

- An approximation propagation lemma that analyzes how errors accumulate through the layers.

- Decomposing weights in the overparameterized network into a logarithmic number of components using a hyperbolic distribution, allowing higher precision with fewer samples. 

- Batch sampling and recycling samples across target weights to reduce the number of required neurons.

Overall, the theoretical results lend more support to the idea that neural network training relies heavily on pruning out unnecessary connections, and that overparameterization is crucial to containing rich sets of subnetworks that can match target functions.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper provides strong theoretical evidence for the lottery ticket hypothesis, which conjectures that neural networks contain small subnetworks that can achieve comparable performance to the full network when trained in isolation. The authors significantly improve upon previous theoretical work by showing that a randomly initialized overparameterized network needs only a logarithmic, rather than polynomial, factor more neurons per weight compared to the target subnetwork in order to contain an approximate version of the subnetwork with high probability. They achieve this by using a hyperbolic weight distribution, binary decomposition of weights, and batch sampling of neurons.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proves that overparameterized neural networks contain many more well-performing subnetworks than previously shown. Prior work showed that neural networks contain subnetworks that can achieve comparable performance to the full network even without training, but this required strong assumptions and polynomial overparameterization. This paper provides significantly tighter bounds, showing that a network needs only a logarithmic (rather than polynomial) factor more neurons per weight than the target subnetwork in order to contain an untrained subnetwork that approximates the target network. Specifically, they show that a network with neural network architecture A(l,n,Ïƒ) and weights uniformly sampled from a hyperbolic distribution is likely to contain an untrained subnetwork that approximates any target network T with architecture A(l,n,Ïƒ) to accuracy Îµ. Their key insight is decomposing each target weight into a sum of O(log(1/Îµ)) sampled weights, taking advantage of the summation in neurons. This suggests neural network training may primarily serve to identify high-performing subnetworks, lending support to the lottery ticket hypothesis. Overall, this theoretical result significantly strengthens our understanding of how overparameterization enables neural networks to find well-performing subnetworks.
