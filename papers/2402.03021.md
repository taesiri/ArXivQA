# [Data-induced multiscale losses and efficient multirate gradient descent   schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03021)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world data often exhibits multiscale characteristics, meaning the distributions vary drastically across different directions/components. 
- This multiscale structure passes to the loss landscape in machine learning problems.
- Traditional algorithms and analysis do not account for this, and implicitly assume uniform scaling.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper analytically shows how multiscale data characteristics directly pass to multiscale gradients and Hessians of the loss landscape. This is verified numerically.
- Inspired by multiscale scientific computing methods, the paper develops a Multirate Gradient Descent (MrGD) algorithm that uses multiple learning rates tailored to the different scales.

Main Contributions:
- Provides both theoretical and empirical evidence that multiscale data leads to multiscale loss landscapes in neural networks and other models.
- Derives precise analytical connections between properties of the data and resulting multiscale gradients/Hessians of the loss.
- Proposes a novel MrGD algorithm that leverages inherent multiscale information to accelerate training, especially in later stages. 
- Establishes comprehensive theory proving MrGD achieves provably faster convergence for convex problems compared to standard GD. Shows quasi-optimal convergence rate for quadratics.
- Conceptually bridges the gap between empirical tuning of learning rates and systematic data-driven learning rate selection.

In summary, the key insight is that multiscale data characteristics directly influence the optimization landscape itself. By explicitly accounting for this using MrGD, faster training is possible. The work provides both theory and algorithms to exploit multiscale structure in data.
