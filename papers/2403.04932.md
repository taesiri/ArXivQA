# [Divide and Conquer: High-Resolution Industrial Anomaly Detection via   Memory Efficient Tiled Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04932)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Industrial anomaly detection on high-resolution images is an important task but poses challenges due to high memory consumption during model training and inference. Existing methods that process images at original resolutions inflate memory usage, making them impractical for widespread adoption. Downscaling images leads to loss of pixel-level details causing models to miss small anomalies.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a tiled ensemble approach that divides high-resolution input images into a grid of tiles and trains separate models for each tile location. This allows processing images at high resolutions while adhering to memory constraints as each model only sees one tile. Overlapping tiles provide benefits of ensembling for improved performance. The approach works with any anomaly detection model without needing architectural changes.

Key Contributions:
- Practical memory-efficient technique to enable existing and upcoming anomaly detection models to handle high resolution images, facilitating detection of small anomalies.

- Model-agnostic extension requiring no changes to base architecture. Compatible with probabilistic, memory-bank, student-teacher and normalizing flow based methods.

- Specialized models for each tile location capitalizes on patch-based processing while preserving spatial information.

- Overlapping tiles provide stacking ensemble benefits for further performance gains over just increased resolution.

- Comprehensive analysis across diverse base architectures and datasets demonstrates consistent notable improvements in detecting anomalies, especially smaller ones, while adhering to memory constraints.

In summary, the tiled ensemble approach allows overcoming memory bottlenecks for high-resolution industrial anomaly detection, enabling existing techniques to handle such use cases more reliably through an easy-to-apply extension.
