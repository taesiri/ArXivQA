# [Bootstrapping Rare Object Detection in High-Resolution Satellite Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of bootstrapping rare object detection in high-resolution satellite imagery when there is no labeled data available and no spatial priors on where the objects of interest may be located. Specifically, the goal is to efficiently find a small number of positive examples of a rare object class that can then be used to train a machine learning model for detecting more instances of that class. This is challenging because the imagery scenes are very large and contain minimal or no examples of the rare objects.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a framework involving:
1) Dividing the large imagery scene into a grid of patches. 
2) Initializing a sampling probability surface over this grid in an unsupervised way using clustering methods based on visual features of patches. This assigns higher probability to unusual looking patches.
3) Defining sampling strategies, including offline methods and online methods that update probabilities based on incoming labels.
4) Sampling patches according to these probabilities to show users to label until a labelling budget is exhausted.
5) Using the labelled patches to train a semantic segmentation model for detecting more instances.

An unsupervised optimization scheme based on silhouette scores is also introduced to set hyperparameters of clustering algorithms without any labels.

The methods are evaluated on the real-world problem of finding Bomas ( livestock enclosures) in satellite imagery of the Serengeti Mara region in Africa.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of the rare object bootstrapping problem with no labels or spatial priors
- Novel offline and online cluster-based sampling methods to efficiently expose positive samples
- Demonstration of proposed methods on Boma detection, increasing positive sampling rate from 2% to 30%
- Enables effective detection with minimal labelling budget e.g. $F1$ score of 0.51 with just 300 labels
- Framework is scalable to other rare object detection tasks in geospatial ML

In summary, the paper provides an efficient and practical solution to bootstrapping rare object detection in satellite imagery by guiding manual labelling to quickly yield training data for machine learning models. The methods are generalizable to other problems involving very sparse objects of interest over large geographical areas.
