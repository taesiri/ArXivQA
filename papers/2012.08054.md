# [Image Inpainting Guided by Coherence Priors of Semantics and Textures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08054)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can coherence priors between semantic information and image textures be exploited to facilitate joint optimization of semantic segmentation and image inpainting for high-quality completion of complex holes with multiple semantic regions?

The key points are:

- Existing image inpainting methods struggle with completing complex holes involving multiple semantic categories, due to inability to model mixture of semantic textures. 

- The coherence priors characterize the mutual consistency between semantics and textures of objects.

- The paper proposes to utilize these coherence priors to optimize semantic segmentation and image inpainting jointly. This allows borrowing textures from semantically similar regions to fill in missing areas.

- Two main technical contributions are proposed to achieve this:

1) Semantic-Wise Attention Propagation (SWAP) module to propagate textures by semantic relevance.

2) Coherence losses at global structure and local texture levels to enforce consistency between semantics and inpainted images.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging coherence priors through joint optimization framework and technical innovations can significantly improve inpainting quality for complex holes. The experiments aim to validate the benefits of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces the concept of "coherence priors" between semantics and textures in image inpainting. The key idea is that there is a mutual consistency between the semantics (object classes) and textures of an image that can be exploited to improve inpainting results. 

2. It proposes a semantic-wise attention propagation (SWAP) module that uses the predicted semantics to guide texture propagation from known to missing image regions. This avoids mixing inconsistent textures during propagation.

3. It devises two coherence losses - a non-local patch coherence loss and a global structure coherence loss - to enforce consistency between the inpainted image and predicted semantics.

4. It develops a joint optimization framework that alternates between image inpainting and semantic segmentation in a coarse-to-fine manner. The coherence priors and losses allow these tasks to assist each other.

5. Experiments show the method outperforms previous inpainting techniques, including other semantics-based methods, in terms of semantic consistency and visual realism, especially for challenging holes spanning multiple semantic regions.

In summary, the key innovation is the use of coherence priors between semantics and textures to jointly optimize inpainting and segmentation in a way that improves both tasks. The proposed components help enforce this semantic-texture coherence for better inpainting quality.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new image inpainting method that utilizes coherence priors between semantics and textures to jointly optimize semantic segmentation and image inpainting in a coarse-to-fine manner, resulting in sharper semantic boundaries and more realistic textures in the inpainted images compared to prior work.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in image inpainting:

- It focuses on inpainting complex holes involving multiple semantic regions, which remains a challenging problem in image inpainting. Many prior works perform well on simpler holes but struggle with holes spanning multiple objects.

- The key idea is to leverage coherence priors between semantics and textures to guide the joint optimization of inpainting and semantic segmentation. This differs from prior works that use mid-level edge guidance or synthesize textures based only on local semantics. 

- A novel Semantic-Wise Attention Propagation (SWAP) module is proposed to fill in textures by matching to semantically similar patches, avoiding texture mix-ups. This is a new way to perform non-local texture propagation.

- Two new coherence losses are introduced - a patch-level loss and an image-level structural loss - to enforce semantic consistency of the inpainted result. Most prior works do not explicitly optimize for semantic coherence.

- The framework alternates between inpainting and semantic segmentation in a multi-scale architecture. This joint optimization approach is more advanced than two-stage pipelines like EdgeConnect.

- Experiments demonstrate superior performance over recent state-of-the-art methods, especially on complex holes spanning multiple objects. Both quantitative metrics and user studies confirm the improved visual quality.

In summary, this work pushes inpainting capabilities for complex holes by jointly optimizing for semantics and textures based on learned coherence priors. The proposed techniques for semantic guidance and coherence optimization advance the leading research in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other types of coherence priors between semantics and textures beyond the global structure and local patch coherence losses proposed in this work. The authors mention that exploiting additional coherence priors could further improve the consistency between predicted semantics and generated textures.

- Applying the proposed framework to other conditional image generation tasks like super-resolution, style transfer, etc. The coherence priors and joint optimization approach could potentially benefit other tasks that aim to generate images consistent with semantic guidance. 

- Extending the approach to handle video inpainting by enforcing temporal coherence of semantics and textures across frames. The authors suggest video inpainting as an interesting and challenging future direction.

- Investigating the incorporation of other semantic guidance like instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation maps, etc. Different types of semantic information could provide further constraints and cues for generating realistic image content.

- Applying the joint optimization idea to other combinations of low-level and high-level vision tasks beyond inpainting and segmentation. Exploring other task combinations that have inherent coherence priors to exploit.

- Validating the approach on more diverse and complex datasets with irregular mask shapes, more semantics, etc. Testing the robustness and generalizability of the method.

In summary, the main future directions are around exploring more coherence priors, applying the framework to new tasks and datasets, and combining it with other forms of semantic guidance beyond segmentation maps. The key idea is leveraging coherence priors between semantics and image contents for conditional image generation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new image inpainting method to fill in missing regions in an image by exploiting coherence priors between semantics and textures. The method uses a multi-scale joint optimization framework to perform image inpainting and semantic segmentation together. This allows utilizing coherence priors between the semantics and textures to guide the inpainting process. Specifically, two novel components are introduced - a Semantic-Wise Attention Propagation (SWAP) module to refine inpainted textures by referring only to known patches of the same semantic class, and two coherence losses to constrain consistency between the inpainted image and predicted segmentation map at both global structure and local texture levels. Experiments demonstrate the method's ability to realistically complete challenging holes spanning multiple semantic classes, outperforming existing inpainting techniques including other semantics-based approaches. The key ideas are leveraging semantics-texture coherence priors within a joint inpainting-segmentation framework and using them to propagate semantically-relevant textures and optimize global structural and local textural consistency.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for image inpainting that can fill in complex holes involving multiple object classes. Existing methods often fail on such holes because they cannot properly model the mixture of textures and semantics. The key idea is to exploit coherence priors - the mutual consistency between an object's semantics and its visual textures. For example, the "animal" class leads to fur textures while "tree" leads to leaf textures.  

To implement this, the method uses a multi-scale framework that jointly optimizes image inpainting and semantic segmentation. This allows propagating the coherence priors across scales to guide hole filling. Two main novel components are: 1) A semantic-wise attention module that matches textures based on semantics rather than blindly from the context. 2) Coherence losses that ensure consistency between the inpainted image and predicted semantics. Experiments show this method outperforms existing inpainting techniques on complex holes with multiple objects. It generates sharper boundaries and more realistic textures that properly reflect the underlying semantics.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel joint optimization framework of semantic segmentation and image inpainting to exploit coherence priors between semantics and textures for completing complex holes. The method uses a shared feature to represent common information for the two tasks and characterizes their interaction across scales. It includes a Semantic-Wise Attention Propagation (SWAP) module to explicitly capture semantic relevance between the missing and known regions when propagating textures. SWAP matches features based on semantics rather than using general contextual attention. The method also introduces two coherence losses - a non-local patch coherence loss to maximize texture similarity between the inpainted patches and real patches of the same semantics, and a structure coherence loss using conditional discriminators to encourage consistency between the overall inpainted image structure and the predicted segmentation map. With these components, the method is able to generate semantically meaningful structures and visually realistic textures when inpainting complex holes involving multiple objects.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points about the problem addressed in this paper are:

- Existing inpainting methods work well for holes in specific types of scenes, but filling holes with multiple semantic regions remains challenging. This is due to unclear semantic boundaries and mixture of textures from different semantics.

- Using mid-level structural guidance like edges for inpainting is ambiguous, as similar edges can map to very different textures. 

- High-level semantic information provides stronger cues to guide texture filling, through "coherence priors" between semantics and textures.

- The authors propose exploiting these coherence priors for joint optimization of semantic segmentation and image inpainting to address complex holes spanning multiple semantic regions.

In summary, this paper introduces coherence priors between semantics and textures to guide joint optimization of segmentation and inpainting. This allows generating semantically consistent structures and realistic textures when filling challenging holes covering multiple semantic categories. The coherence priors provide tighter coupling between semantics and textures compared to using mid-level edges or structures.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 The paper proposes a semantic-guided image inpainting method to complete missing regions involving multiple semantic categories. The key idea is to model and leverage the coherence priors between semantics and textures for joint optimization of image inpainting and semantic segmentation. 

Specifically, the method adopts an encoder-decoder network to predict the inpainted image and segmentation map in multi-scale. To refine the texture details, it proposes a Semantic-Wise Attention Propagation (SWAP) module to capture semantic relevance between missing and known regions when propagating features. This avoids mixing up irrelevant textures from different semantics. Further, two coherence losses are introduced to ensure consistency between the predicted semantics and inpainted textures in terms of overall structure and local details. 

The coherence modeling enables generating semantically meaningful structures and visually realistic textures when filling complex holes with mixed semantics. Experiments show the method outperforms existing inpainting techniques in both objective metrics and subjective evaluations. The main contributions include the coherence priors, the SWAP module, and the coherence losses for semantic-guided inpainting.
