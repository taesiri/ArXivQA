# Image Inpainting Guided by Coherence Priors of Semantics and Textures

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can coherence priors between semantic information and image textures be exploited to facilitate joint optimization of semantic segmentation and image inpainting for high-quality completion of complex holes with multiple semantic regions?The key points are:- Existing image inpainting methods struggle with completing complex holes involving multiple semantic categories, due to inability to model mixture of semantic textures. - The coherence priors characterize the mutual consistency between semantics and textures of objects.- The paper proposes to utilize these coherence priors to optimize semantic segmentation and image inpainting jointly. This allows borrowing textures from semantically similar regions to fill in missing areas.- Two main technical contributions are proposed to achieve this:1) Semantic-Wise Attention Propagation (SWAP) module to propagate textures by semantic relevance.2) Coherence losses at global structure and local texture levels to enforce consistency between semantics and inpainted images.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging coherence priors through joint optimization framework and technical innovations can significantly improve inpainting quality for complex holes. The experiments aim to validate the benefits of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces the concept of "coherence priors" between semantics and textures in image inpainting. The key idea is that there is a mutual consistency between the semantics (object classes) and textures of an image that can be exploited to improve inpainting results. 2. It proposes a semantic-wise attention propagation (SWAP) module that uses the predicted semantics to guide texture propagation from known to missing image regions. This avoids mixing inconsistent textures during propagation.3. It devises two coherence losses - a non-local patch coherence loss and a global structure coherence loss - to enforce consistency between the inpainted image and predicted semantics.4. It develops a joint optimization framework that alternates between image inpainting and semantic segmentation in a coarse-to-fine manner. The coherence priors and losses allow these tasks to assist each other.5. Experiments show the method outperforms previous inpainting techniques, including other semantics-based methods, in terms of semantic consistency and visual realism, especially for challenging holes spanning multiple semantic regions.In summary, the key innovation is the use of coherence priors between semantics and textures to jointly optimize inpainting and segmentation in a way that improves both tasks. The proposed components help enforce this semantic-texture coherence for better inpainting quality.
