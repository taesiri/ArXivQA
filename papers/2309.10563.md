# [A Hierarchical Neural Framework for Classification and its Explanation   in Large Unstructured Legal Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10563)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Legal case documents can be very long (10,000s of words) and unstructured, making judgment prediction and explanation challenging. 
- Lack of structure annotations and long lengths define the problem of "scarce annotated legal documents".
- Need methods to predict judgments and explain predictions on such long, unstructured legal documents.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a multi-stage neural classification framework called "MESc" (Multi-stage Encoder-based Supervised with-clustering).
- Uses a transformer encoder (e.g. BERT) to encode document chunks. Approximates structure labels by clustering chunk embeddings. 
- Combines embeddings from last layers of encoder with structure labels for final classification.  
- Also propose an extractive explanation method called "ORSE" based on model input sensitivity to extract relevant sentences.

Main Contributions:
- Explore judgment prediction on scarce annotated legal documents using MESc framework. Shows performance gains over benchmarks.
- Study adaptability of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-Neo and GPT-J for legal text classification.
- Propose ORSE algorithm for extractive explanation from hierarchical models. Achieves 50% avg gain over baseline on explanation task.
- New SOTA results on judgment prediction for ILDC and LexGLUE legal datasets. New explanation benchmarks on ILDC expert annotations.
- Analyze limits of MESc w.r.t LLMs and document lengths. Provide insights on handling long texts.

In summary, the paper explores classification and explanation for long, unstructured legal documents using neural approaches. The MESc framework and ORSE algorithm offer ways to predict judgments and explain predictions which outperform previous methods.
