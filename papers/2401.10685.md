# [Towards End-to-End GPS Localization with Neural Pseudorange Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10685)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Pseudorange errors are a major cause of inaccurate GPS localization. Previous methods try to regress and eliminate these errors using handcrafted intermediate labels derived from receiver location ground truth. However, the final localization task target - the receiver locations - are not used directly for training.  

- End-to-end deep learning methods directly map GPS measurements to locations, but require learning well-established localization theories unnecessarily. 

- The goal is to combine neural networks and model-based methods to leverage their respective strengths - learn pseudorange errors while retaining robust localization computation.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose E2E-PrNet - an end-to-end GPS localization framework with a neural network for pseudorange correction (PrNet) connected to a Differentiable Nonlinear Least Squares (DNLS) optimizer.

- PrNet regresses pseudorange errors. Its output is combined with measurements and fed to the DNLS optimizer for location estimation.

- The loss between estimated and ground truth locations is backpropagated through the optimizer to train PrNet. This uses the final task target for training.

- To handle lack of receiver clock offset ground truth, its WLS-based estimate is used as the target.

Main Contributions:
- Novel idea of end-to-end GPS localization with pseudorange correction neural network trained on final localization loss.

- Implementation details of connecting PrNet and DNLS optimizer using Theseus library for differentiable optimization.

- Strategy to tackle lack of receiver clock offset ground truth.

- Experiments on open datasets showing E2E-PrNet outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art end-to-end methods in localization accuracy.

- Analysis showing PrNet learns to output smoothed pseudorange errors, leading to WLS-based state estimates in DNLS module.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes E2E-PrNet, an end-to-end GPS localization framework that trains a neural network to correct pseudoranges using the final localization loss calculated with receiver state ground truth, outperforming classical and end-to-end methods on highway datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing E2E-PrNet, an end-to-end GPS localization framework that trains a neural network (PrNet) to correct pseudoranges using the final task loss calculated with the ground truth of GPS receiver states. Specifically:

- E2E-PrNet connects a neural network for pseudorange correction (PrNet) with a differentiable nonlinear least squares (DNLS) optimizer that estimates receiver states. 

- The loss is computed between the DNLS-estimated states and ground truth states. Gradients are backpropagated through the DNLS optimizer to train the parameters of PrNet.

- This allows training PrNet directly using the final localization loss, instead of intermediate losses based on manually derived pseudorange error labels.

- Experiments on smartphone GPS datasets show E2E-PrNet outperforms both classical weighted least squares localization and prior end-to-end learning methods in terms of positioning accuracy.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and evaluation of this end-to-end framework that can learn to correct pseudoranges for improved GPS localization directly from receiver state ground truth.

The paper proposes an end-to-end GPS localization framework called E2E-PrNet that uses a neural network (PrNet) to correct pseudorange errors. The neural network is connected to a differentiable nonlinear least squares optimizer to estimate the receiver's location. The framework is trained end-to-end using the final task loss calculated based on the ground truth receiver location. The method is evaluated on smartphone GPS datasets from the Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge, and shows improved localization accuracy over baseline methods. The paper also analyzes the explainability of what the neural network learns when trained end-to-end. So the key terms reflect this overall focus and contribution of the paper.
