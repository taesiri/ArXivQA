# [Discrete Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02200)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can discrete latent variables be effectively incorporated into the variational autoencoder framework for probabilistic modeling?

The key points are:

- Discrete latent variables (such as those in a restricted Boltzmann machine) are useful for capturing discrete classes or modes in the data. 

- However, it is difficult to train models with discrete latent variables using the variational autoencoder framework, since backpropagation through discrete variables is generally not possible.

- The authors propose a method to train variational autoencoders with discrete latent variables by:

1) Introducing continuous latent variables that are transformations of the discrete variables. This allows backpropagation through the continuous variables.

2) Using a hierarchical approximating posterior over the discrete variables to capture multimodality. 

3) Adding layers of continuous latent variables below the discrete variables to model continuous deformations.

4) Deriving low-variance gradient estimates for training.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by introducing continuous variables and hierarchical approximations, along with proper gradient estimates, discrete latent variable models can be effectively trained within the variational autoencoder framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a method to train probabilistic models with discrete latent variables using the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, including backpropagation through the discrete latent variables. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- They introduce continuous latent variables that are deterministically coupled with the discrete latent variables. This allows backpropagation through the continuous variables while retaining a discrete latent representation.

- They use a hierarchical approximating posterior over the discrete latent variables to capture strong correlations, avoiding a mean-field approximation.

- They add layers of continuous latent variables below the discrete variables to build powerful nonlinear hierarchical priors and posteriors. 

- They apply this to a model with a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) over the discrete latent variables, allowing the RBM to capture multimodal discrete structure.

The resulting "discrete variational autoencoder" combines the benefits of VAEs and RBMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance on permutation-invariant MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech-101 Silhouettes datasets. Overall, the paper contributes a method to effectively optimize probabilistic models with both discrete and continuous latent variables using backpropagation and the VAE framework.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel class of probabilistic models called discrete variational autoencoders that combine discrete and continuous latent variables and can be trained efficiently using variational inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance on image datasets like MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech-101 Silhouettes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper on discrete variational autoencoders compares to other related research:

- This paper introduces a novel class of probabilistic models that combines discrete and continuous latent variables. The discrete variables aim to capture the abstract, categorical aspects of data (e.g. object class), while the continuous variables model the finer variations (e.g. pose and position). This hybrid approach contrasts with models that use either purely discrete (e.g. RBMs, NADE) or purely continuous (e.g. VAEs, GANs) latent variables.

- A key contribution is developing an efficient variational inference framework that can handle both discrete and continuous variables. Previous approaches like NVIL and REINFORCE faced high-variance gradient estimates. This paper uses a smoothing technique and hierarchical posterior to enable low-variance gradients and end-to-end backpropagation.

- The proposed model architecture resembles a Deep Belief Network, but differs in the training procedure (VAE framework rather than greedy layerwise pretraining) and connections between the discrete and continuous variables. It also relates to some multi-stochastic-layer VAEs.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art density modeling performance on MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech 101 Silhouettes. The results suggest combining discrete and continuous variables can capture abstract classes and fine details better than purely discrete or continuous models.

- Overall, this paper makes promising progress on integrating discrete and continuous latent variables for unsupervised learning. The VAE training framework and model architecture offer a novel way to leverage the complementary strengths of both types of representations. The results on density modeling benchmarks highlight the potential of this hybrid approach.

In summary, this paper introduces innovations in model architecture and training to successfully incorporate both discrete and continuous latent variables within a VAE framework, achieving strong generative modeling performance. It presents an advance over purely discrete or continuous models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more effective sampling algorithms for the RBM prior distribution. The paper notes that training may be constrained by poor sample quality from block Gibbs sampling. They suggest parallel tempering could potentially yield further improvements.

- Applying discrete VAEs to more complex datasets like Imagenet. The paper mentions that a much larger RBM would likely be needed to model the many classes and relationships in Imagenet.

- Exploring different transformations from the discrete to continuous latent space. The paper discusses several possible transformations like spike-and-exponential, spike-and-slab, etc. More options could be investigated.

- Using input-dependent transformations from discrete to continuous space. The paper proposes making the transformation dependent on both the discrete latent variables and the input, which could help capture more structure.

- Optimizing the regularization and architecture choices. The paper notes the model is prone to overfitting with too flexible a prior. Better regularization techniques could help scale up the models.

- Extending discrete VAEs to semi-supervised learning. The unsupervised structure could be combined with labeled data for classification.

- Applying discrete VAEs to other domains like text or audio. The framework may be useful for capturing discrete linguistic or sound units.

In summary, the main directions mentioned are developing better inference procedures, scaling up the models, exploring architectural variants, and applying discrete VAEs to other datasets and tasks. The framework seems promising for capturing both discrete and continuous structure in data.
