# [Discrete Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02200)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can discrete latent variables be effectively incorporated into the variational autoencoder framework for probabilistic modeling?

The key points are:

- Discrete latent variables (such as those in a restricted Boltzmann machine) are useful for capturing discrete classes or modes in the data. 

- However, it is difficult to train models with discrete latent variables using the variational autoencoder framework, since backpropagation through discrete variables is generally not possible.

- The authors propose a method to train variational autoencoders with discrete latent variables by:

1) Introducing continuous latent variables that are transformations of the discrete variables. This allows backpropagation through the continuous variables.

2) Using a hierarchical approximating posterior over the discrete variables to capture multimodality. 

3) Adding layers of continuous latent variables below the discrete variables to model continuous deformations.

4) Deriving low-variance gradient estimates for training.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by introducing continuous variables and hierarchical approximations, along with proper gradient estimates, discrete latent variable models can be effectively trained within the variational autoencoder framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a method to train probabilistic models with discrete latent variables using the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, including backpropagation through the discrete latent variables. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- They introduce continuous latent variables that are deterministically coupled with the discrete latent variables. This allows backpropagation through the continuous variables while retaining a discrete latent representation.

- They use a hierarchical approximating posterior over the discrete latent variables to capture strong correlations, avoiding a mean-field approximation.

- They add layers of continuous latent variables below the discrete variables to build powerful nonlinear hierarchical priors and posteriors. 

- They apply this to a model with a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) over the discrete latent variables, allowing the RBM to capture multimodal discrete structure.

The resulting "discrete variational autoencoder" combines the benefits of VAEs and RBMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance on permutation-invariant MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech-101 Silhouettes datasets. Overall, the paper contributes a method to effectively optimize probabilistic models with both discrete and continuous latent variables using backpropagation and the VAE framework.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel class of probabilistic models called discrete variational autoencoders that combine discrete and continuous latent variables and can be trained efficiently using variational inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance on image datasets like MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech-101 Silhouettes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper on discrete variational autoencoders compares to other related research:

- This paper introduces a novel class of probabilistic models that combines discrete and continuous latent variables. The discrete variables aim to capture the abstract, categorical aspects of data (e.g. object class), while the continuous variables model the finer variations (e.g. pose and position). This hybrid approach contrasts with models that use either purely discrete (e.g. RBMs, NADE) or purely continuous (e.g. VAEs, GANs) latent variables.

- A key contribution is developing an efficient variational inference framework that can handle both discrete and continuous variables. Previous approaches like NVIL and REINFORCE faced high-variance gradient estimates. This paper uses a smoothing technique and hierarchical posterior to enable low-variance gradients and end-to-end backpropagation.

- The proposed model architecture resembles a Deep Belief Network, but differs in the training procedure (VAE framework rather than greedy layerwise pretraining) and connections between the discrete and continuous variables. It also relates to some multi-stochastic-layer VAEs.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art density modeling performance on MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech 101 Silhouettes. The results suggest combining discrete and continuous variables can capture abstract classes and fine details better than purely discrete or continuous models.

- Overall, this paper makes promising progress on integrating discrete and continuous latent variables for unsupervised learning. The VAE training framework and model architecture offer a novel way to leverage the complementary strengths of both types of representations. The results on density modeling benchmarks highlight the potential of this hybrid approach.

In summary, this paper introduces innovations in model architecture and training to successfully incorporate both discrete and continuous latent variables within a VAE framework, achieving strong generative modeling performance. It presents an advance over purely discrete or continuous models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more effective sampling algorithms for the RBM prior distribution. The paper notes that training may be constrained by poor sample quality from block Gibbs sampling. They suggest parallel tempering could potentially yield further improvements.

- Applying discrete VAEs to more complex datasets like Imagenet. The paper mentions that a much larger RBM would likely be needed to model the many classes and relationships in Imagenet.

- Exploring different transformations from the discrete to continuous latent space. The paper discusses several possible transformations like spike-and-exponential, spike-and-slab, etc. More options could be investigated.

- Using input-dependent transformations from discrete to continuous space. The paper proposes making the transformation dependent on both the discrete latent variables and the input, which could help capture more structure.

- Optimizing the regularization and architecture choices. The paper notes the model is prone to overfitting with too flexible a prior. Better regularization techniques could help scale up the models.

- Extending discrete VAEs to semi-supervised learning. The unsupervised structure could be combined with labeled data for classification.

- Applying discrete VAEs to other domains like text or audio. The framework may be useful for capturing discrete linguistic or sound units.

In summary, the main directions mentioned are developing better inference procedures, scaling up the models, exploring architectural variants, and applying discrete VAEs to other datasets and tasks. The framework seems promising for capturing both discrete and continuous structure in data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel deep generative model called a discrete variational autoencoder (discrete VAE) for unsupervised learning on datasets with discrete classes. The model combines a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) over discrete latent variables with a hierarchy of continuous latent variables. To train the model efficiently, continuous "smoothing" variables are introduced that allow gradient-based learning through the discrete variables via the reparameterization trick. The RBM captures the overall class of an input while the continuous variables model intra-class variations. Experiments show the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on permutation-invariant MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech-101 Silhouettes datasets. Overall, the discrete VAE provides an effective way to leverage the advantages of both discrete and continuous latent variables within the variational autoencoder framework.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel class of probabilistic models called discrete variational autoencoders (discrete VAEs) for learning with datasets composed of discrete classes. The model consists of an undirected discrete component that captures the distribution over disconnected manifolds induced by a directed hierarchical continuous component. Specifically, the discrete component is a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) that represents the discrete latent variables. The continuous component comprises multiple layers of continuous latent variables that capture the continuous deformations within each discrete class. 

A key contribution is showing how discrete VAEs can be trained efficiently using the variational autoencoder framework, including backpropagation through the discrete RBM variables. This is achieved by symmetrically projecting the posterior and prior distributions to a smoothed continuous space, and evaluating the expectation in the variational lower bound exclusively in this continuous space. Experiments demonstrate that discrete VAEs outperform state-of-the-art methods on permutation-invariant MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech-101 Silhouettes datasets by efficiently combining the strengths of discrete and continuous latent variables.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method proposed in this paper is a discrete variational autoencoder (discrete VAE) for unsupervised learning of probabilistic models with both continuous and discrete latent variables. The key ideas are:

1. The discrete latent variables are modeled using a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). To enable backpropagation through the discrete variables, the RBM is symmetrically transformed into a continuous space using smoothing variables. 

2. The posterior approximation over the discrete latent variables is made hierarchical, allowing it to capture multimodality and strong correlations. The continuous latent variables are also organized in a hierarchy.

3. The evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective is optimized using the reparameterization trick and stochastic gradient descent. The continuous latent variables allow low-variance gradients of the autoencoding term. The KL divergence terms are approximated using samples from the posterior and RBM prior.

4. The model combines the benefits of discrete latent variables in capturing distinct classes and the flexibility of continuous latent variables in modeling intra-class variations. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on several image datasets.

In summary, the key innovation is the symmetrical smoothing of the discrete latent space to enable efficient variational inference while retaining the modeling power of discrete variables. The overall model combines discrete, continuous, undirected and directed graphical models within a single deep generative framework.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It is challenging to train probabilistic models with discrete latent variables efficiently using approaches like variational autoencoders, because it is generally not possible to backpropagate through discrete variables. 

- The authors propose a novel class of probabilistic models called "discrete variational autoencoders" (discrete VAEs) that marry variational autoencoders with discrete latent variables.

- Discrete VAEs have a hierarchical structure, comprising a smoothed restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) to capture the discrete class of an image, followed by a hierarchy of continuous latent variables to capture the continuous deformation.

- The smoothing allows backpropagation through the discrete units of the RBM. The hierarchy allows modeling of strong correlations in the posterior.

- Discrete VAEs achieve state-of-the-art performance on permutation-invariant MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech-101 Silhouettes datasets.

So in summary, the key problem is enabling efficient training of models with discrete latent variables, and the solution is the proposed discrete VAE architecture that facilitates backpropagation through the discrete variables. The effectiveness is demonstrated through strong empirical performance on standard image datasets.
