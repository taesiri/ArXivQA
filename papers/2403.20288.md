# [Can LLMs Correct Physicians, Yet? Investigating Effective Interaction   Methods in the Medical Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20288)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent works show LLMs can be highly accurate in medical QA tasks, but little analysis exists on their performance when interacting with human experts (e.g. physicians). Understanding human-LLM interaction is critical for ensuring practical utility and reliability of LLMs in high-stakes medical scenarios.

Methodology:
- Evaluate LLM performance in medical QA when interacting with a simulated physician who provides a binary answer and sometimes an explanation to questions from the PubMedQA dataset. 
- Examine different interaction scenarios: physician always right/wrong (Case 1), physician provides plausible correct/incorrect explanations generated by GPT-4 (Case 2), physician accuracy varies (Case 3).
- Analyze impact of prompt design and physician input on LLM ability to correct errors, explain reasoning, and improve performance.

Key Findings:  
- Prompt design significantly impacts performance - with appropriate instructions/examples, LLMs can effectively correct erroneous physician responses.
- LLMs can generate plausible explanations, conditional on good prompt design.  
- LLMs rely heavily on physician-provided arguments, with sensitivity to prompt order.
- While LLMs improve with physician input, they fail to outperform physician accuracy alone.  

Main Contributions:
- First analysis of LLM performance on medical QA when interacting with physicians
- Introduces new binary classification dataset with plausible explanations
- Demonstrates importance of prompt design in LLM-physician interactions and potential for LLMs to enhance decision-making
- Uncovers challenges in ensuring LLM suggestions are useful and actionable

The paper emphasizes the need for further research on optimizing human-LLM collaboration in high-stakes domains like healthcare.
