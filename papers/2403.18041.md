# [Learning Piecewise Residuals of Control Barrier Functions for Safety of   Switching Systems using Multi-Output Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18041)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers control of uncertain switching systems, where the system switches between different dynamics (or modes) depending on the state. The goal is to design a controller that stabilizes the system and satisfies safety constraints, despite uncertainties in the model. Specifically, it focuses on cases where a nominal model is available, but the true underlying system dynamics in each mode are uncertain, leading to residuals that affect control Lyapunov (stability) and barrier (safety) function constraints.

Solution: 
The key idea is to use a batch multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) to learn and approximate the piecewise residuals for each mode. First, data is collected from the true system to estimate the residuals using finite differences between the true and nominal system derivatives. This data is split into batches corresponding to each mode. Then, a MOGP is trained on each batch to capture the mode-specific residuals. By structuring the MOGP kernel in a certain way, the chance-constrained optimization problem with the learned residuals can be cast as a second-order cone program (SOCP). Feasibility conditions of the SOCP are analyzed. The overall approach allows generating safe control inputs despite uncertainty.

Main Contributions:
- Showing that switching systems with uncertainty introduce piecewise residuals in CLF and CBF constraints
- Developing a batch MOGP framework to efficiently learn and approximate residuals for each mode
- Structuring the MOGP kernel such that chance constraints lead to an SOCP formulation
- Analyzing feasibility conditions of the resulting SOCP
- Demonstrating the approach on an uncertain switching adaptive cruise control system example

In summary, the paper develops a principled learning-based method to enable safe control for uncertain switching systems by learning and mitigating the effect of piecewise residuals using batch MOGPs.
