# [Extracting Biomedical Entities from Noisy Audio Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17363)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have shown promise for clinical documentation, but performance drops significantly when natural language processing (NLP) models are applied to noisy ASR transcripts (termed ASR-NLP gap). 
- Prior biomedical ASR research has focused on clean recordings or "cleaned" transcripts. There is a lack of publicly available datasets for studying the ASR-NLP gap with noisy biomedical audio.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce BioASR-NER, a novel biomedical audio dataset with nearly 2000 clean and noisy recordings for studying ASR-NLP gap. Contains named entity recognition tasks like adverse drug reactions and fruits/animals.
- Propose transcript cleaning method using GPT-4 via zero-shot prompting and few-shot in-context learning to improve NLP model performance without need for annotated noisy transcripts.  

Main Contributions:
- First publicly available dataset enabling research on biomedical ASR-NLP gap using real-world noisy audio
- Effective transcript cleaning technique using GPT-4 to recover up to 79% of NLP performance drop, outperforming baseline systems
- Informative error analysis detailing transcription errors, GPT-4 corrections and remaining challenges

Overall, the key innovation is the new dataset and simple yet effective GPT-4 based transcript cleaning method to improve NLP model performance on noisy biomedical speech without needing annotations. This enables progress on real-world clinical documentation using error-prone ASR.
