# [Rainier: Reinforced Knowledge Introspector for Commonsense Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03078)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop an AI system that can generate relevant knowledge to help improve reasoning for commonsense question answering?

The authors propose a new method called RAINIER that learns to generate knowledge statements which provide useful context to enhance the performance of question answering models on commonsense tasks. Their key ideas include:

- Using reinforcement learning to train a knowledge generator, with rewards based on the impact of the generated knowledge on a fixed QA model's predictions. This allows it to produce knowledge that is more useful for QA without direct supervision.

- Training the model on a diverse set of commonsense QA datasets to equip it with generalization ability to unseen datasets. 

- Conducting a two-stage training process, first imitating knowledge from GPT-3, then optimizing based on QA model rewards. This provides a basic functionality, then refines the knowledge to be more beneficial.

- Evaluating the approach on a range of seen and unseen commonsense QA datasets, showing consistent improvements in QA performance when using the generated knowledge to prompt the models.

So in summary, the central research question is around developing an AI technique to automatically generate knowledge that can enhance reasoning for commonsense QA, using a reinforcement learning approach. The authors aim to show this can work across diverse datasets and generalize to unseen data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing RAINIER, a novel model that can introspect relevant commonsense knowledge for answering questions, without requiring human-labeled knowledge. 

2. Training RAINIER via a two-stage approach - first imitating GPT-3's knowledge generation capabilities, then using reinforcement learning to optimize the impact of generated knowledge on QA performance.

3. Demonstrating RAINIER's ability to generate high-quality, useful knowledge that improves QA performance on both seen and unseen commonsense QA datasets. Its knowledge provides greater and more consistent gains compared to GPT-3 despite being much smaller.

4. Analyzing RAINIER's generated knowledge and showing its fluency, meaningfulness, diversity, and agreement with human judgements on helpfulness for QA.

5. Publicly releasing RAINIER's code, model, and knowledge-extended versions of commonsense QA datasets to facilitate further research.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a novel model architecture and training approach to learn to introspect commonsense knowledge without human supervision, for improving commonsense QA. The analyses also provide insights into the model's capabilities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Rainier, a neural model trained with reinforcement learning to introspect relevant commonsense knowledge for answering questions, which improves performance of QA models on both seen and unseen benchmarks more than knowledge from GPT-3 despite being much smaller.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of commonsense reasoning and question answering:

- The key novel contribution is using reinforcement learning to train a model to generate relevant knowledge statements for commonsense QA, without requiring human-labeled training data. Most prior work relies on supervised learning over labeled data or retrieving from knowledge bases. Using RL to optimize based on downstream task performance is an interesting alternative approach.

- The model architecture of having a separate knowledge generator module versus just doing end-to-end training of the QA model is fairly typical. Other works have proposed similar modular or pipeline-based approaches. 

- Leveraging GPT-3's few-shot knowledge generation capabilities as a starting point for the imitation learning phase is clever. This provides a strong initialization for the model before the RL fine-tuning. Other works have not exploited GPT-3 in this way.

- Evaluating on a broad range of 9 commonsense QA datasets (5 seen + 4 unseen) is fairly comprehensive compared to prior work. Many papers focus on 1-2 datasets. Testing generalization to unseen datasets is important.

- The model size is moderate relative to other commonsense reasoning models. At 0.77B parameters it is much smaller than GPT-3, but a bit larger than some other specialized commonsense models. The fact that it outperforms GPT-3 is impressive given the size difference.

- The style of free-text knowledge generation provides more flexibility than generating structured representations like logic or graphs. This is similar to some other recent papers leveraging large LMs for commonsense reasoning.

Overall, I would say this paper makes solid incremental contributions to improving commonsense QA using deep learning and RL, building nicely on top of recent related work. The innovations around RL training and leveraging GPT-3 seem impactful compared to prior approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Extending their method to support multi-step knowledge introspection, i.e. chaining multiple knowledge statements in each reasoning path. This could allow for more complex reasoning. 

- Exploring better knowledge integration methods that adaptively fit the required depth of reasoning. This could improve how the generated knowledge is utilized by the QA model.

- Applying their approach to other types of commonsense reasoning tasks beyond QA, to get a more systematic view of commonsense reasoning via knowledge introspection.

- Testing their model on generating more factoid-type knowledge beyond commonsense knowledge. The paper mentions it is unknown how well their model can generate knowledge like a person's hometown.

- Testing their model's capability for generating longer, more coherent text. The experiments in the paper were limited to short knowledge statements.

- Improving the model's ability to avoid generating problematic knowledge related to social values, cultural assumptions, or ethical issues. The paper provides some examples where the model currently falters in these aspects.

So in summary, the main directions seem to be improving the knowledge generation, integration, and usage, extending the approach to new tasks and contexts, and addressing current limitations around problematic knowledge generation. Overall the authors seem to view knowledge introspection as a promising approach for commonsense reasoning that can be further developed.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called RAINIER for generating relevant knowledge to help question answering models reason about commonsense questions. RAINIER is trained using a two-stage approach. First, it is pretrained by imitating knowledge generated by GPT-3 on a collection of commonsense QA datasets. Then, it is trained via reinforcement learning to generate knowledge that improves the performance of a fixed QA model on answering questions from those datasets. The reward function for RL is based on whether the knowledge changes the QA model's prediction to be correct or not. Experiments show that knowledge generated by RAINIER boosts the performance of various QA models on commonsense QA datasets, including unseen ones, more than knowledge from GPT-3 despite being much smaller. Analyses also find RAINIER's knowledge to be of high quality, diverse, and aligned with human judgments on usefulness. The success demonstrates the promise of smaller models generating useful knowledge to facilitate reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called RAINIER for generating relevant commonsense knowledge to improve question answering models. RAINIER is a generative model that is trained to introspect the knowledge needed to answer a question. It generates free-form natural language knowledge statements. 

RAINIER is trained in two stages. First, it is trained by imitation learning to generate fluent knowledge statements, by learning from statements generated by GPT-3. Second, it is trained by reinforcement learning to generate knowledge that improves the performance of a fixed QA model. The reward function is based on whether the knowledge changes the QA model's prediction to be correct. Experiments show RAINIER substantially boosts QA models on commonsense benchmarks, seen and unseen during training. The knowledge is shown to be high-quality and diverse. RAINIER outperforms baselines including few-shot GPT-3 for knowledge generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Rainier for generating relevant knowledge to help answer commonsense question answering (QA) tasks. Rainier is trained in two stages - first with imitation learning to teach it to generate natural language knowledge statements by imitating those elicited from the large GPT-3 model, and then with reinforcement learning to optimize the knowledge statements to be maximally useful for improving a fixed QA model's predictions. Specifically, the reinforcement learning phase uses proximal policy optimization (PPO) to train Rainier to generate knowledge that maximizes the QA model's probability of predicting the correct answer when provided Rainier's knowledge statement as additional context. The reward function for the RL phase compares the QA model's score for the true answer with vs without Rainier's knowledge. Rainier is trained on a multi-task dataset covering different commonsense domains, and is evaluated on both seen and unseen QA datasets, where it shows strong generalization and provides substantial gains over state-of-the-art QA models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the key problem the paper is trying to address is how to effectively generate relevant commonsense knowledge to improve the performance of question answering (QA) models, without relying on very large pretrained language models like GPT-3 or having access to human-labeled training data. 

Some key aspects of the problem and approach:

- Commonsense QA is challenging for models as it requires reasoning about implicit knowledge. Providing relevant knowledge as context can help, but where to get such knowledge is an open challenge.

- The paper introduces a method called RAINIER that can generate knowledge by "introspecting" on the question. This knowledge takes the form of natural language statements.

- RAINIER does not have access to human-labeled knowledge ground truth for training. Instead, it is trained via a two-stage approach:
  - Imitation learning to initialize the model by imitating GPT-3's knowledge generation capability.
  - Reinforcement learning to directly optimize the knowledge based on its impact on a QA model's performance.

- A key goal is for RAINIER to generate knowledge that generalizes - helping QA models even on unseen datasets, without task-specific engineering. 

- The approach aims to achieve this generalization capability with a model much smaller than GPT-3.

So in summary, the key problem is generating relevant, generalizable commonsense knowledge to improve QA, in a data-efficient and scalable way. RAINIER offers a way to do this via imitation and reinforcement learning, without relying on very large pretrained models like GPT-3.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage training process involving imitation learning followed by reinforcement learning. Why was this two-stage approach taken rather than only using reinforcement learning from the start? What are the benefits of pretraining with imitation learning first?

2. The imitation learning stage uses silver knowledge elicited from GPT-3. What are some limitations or potential issues with relying on GPT-3 demonstrations rather than real human-labeled data? How might this affect the quality or diversity of the knowledge generated?

3. The reinforcement learning stage uses a reward function based on the impact of the generated knowledge on a QA model's predictions. What are some potential pros and cons of using a QA model itself to provide the training signal rather than human feedback? How sensitive is this approach to the choice of QA model?

4. The paper argues that reinforcement learning is necessary because the desired knowledge sequences are non-differentiable. However, recent work has shown success in end-to-end training of text generation models. Could an approach like straight-through Gumbel-softmax have been used instead while still allowing end-to-end differentiability? What are the tradeoffs?

5. What motivated the choice of using PPO as the RL algorithm over other on-policy (e.g. A2C) or off-policy (e.g. DQN) algorithms? What characteristics of the knowledge generation task make PPO suitable?

6. The rewarded is shaped based on the impact on the QA model's predictions. Several reward formulations are experimented with in Table 3. What are the pros and cons of each? Why is the final chosen formulation preferred?

7. During inference, nucleus sampling is used to generate multiple diverse knowledge statements. How sensitive are the results to the nucleus $p$ hyperparameter? Could stochastic beam search have been used instead for decoding?

8. The paper evaluates on a set of 9 question answering benchmarks. How well might the approach generalize to other NLP tasks like summarization, data-to-text generation, etc? What adaptations would be needed?

9. Error analysis: In which cases does the model fail to generate factual, relevant, and helpful knowledge? Are there common patterns in the types of questions or domains where it struggles? 

10. The model is still limited by length compared to humans. How could the approach be extended to generate longer, more complex chains of reasoning? Could hierarchical reinforcement learning help reward intermediate subgoals?

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the proposed method in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage training regime involving imitation learning followed by reinforcement learning. Why is this two-stage approach beneficial compared to just training with reinforcement learning from the start? What are the limitations of training only with imitation learning?

2. The reward function used in the reinforcement learning stage aims to capture whether the QA model's prediction changes from incorrect to correct (or vice versa) when provided the generated knowledge. How does this differ from more straightforward reward functions like the probability or score assigned to the correct answer? What are the tradeoffs?
