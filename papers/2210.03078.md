# Rainier: Reinforced Knowledge Introspector for Commonsense Question   Answering

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an AI system that can generate relevant knowledge to help improve reasoning for commonsense question answering?The authors propose a new method called RAINIER that learns to generate knowledge statements which provide useful context to enhance the performance of question answering models on commonsense tasks. Their key ideas include:- Using reinforcement learning to train a knowledge generator, with rewards based on the impact of the generated knowledge on a fixed QA model's predictions. This allows it to produce knowledge that is more useful for QA without direct supervision.- Training the model on a diverse set of commonsense QA datasets to equip it with generalization ability to unseen datasets. - Conducting a two-stage training process, first imitating knowledge from GPT-3, then optimizing based on QA model rewards. This provides a basic functionality, then refines the knowledge to be more beneficial.- Evaluating the approach on a range of seen and unseen commonsense QA datasets, showing consistent improvements in QA performance when using the generated knowledge to prompt the models.So in summary, the central research question is around developing an AI technique to automatically generate knowledge that can enhance reasoning for commonsense QA, using a reinforcement learning approach. The authors aim to show this can work across diverse datasets and generalize to unseen data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Proposing RAINIER, a novel model that can introspect relevant commonsense knowledge for answering questions, without requiring human-labeled knowledge. 2. Training RAINIER via a two-stage approach - first imitating GPT-3's knowledge generation capabilities, then using reinforcement learning to optimize the impact of generated knowledge on QA performance.3. Demonstrating RAINIER's ability to generate high-quality, useful knowledge that improves QA performance on both seen and unseen commonsense QA datasets. Its knowledge provides greater and more consistent gains compared to GPT-3 despite being much smaller.4. Analyzing RAINIER's generated knowledge and showing its fluency, meaningfulness, diversity, and agreement with human judgements on helpfulness for QA.5. Publicly releasing RAINIER's code, model, and knowledge-extended versions of commonsense QA datasets to facilitate further research.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a novel model architecture and training approach to learn to introspect commonsense knowledge without human supervision, for improving commonsense QA. The analyses also provide insights into the model's capabilities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents Rainier, a neural model trained with reinforcement learning to introspect relevant commonsense knowledge for answering questions, which improves performance of QA models on both seen and unseen benchmarks more than knowledge from GPT-3 despite being much smaller.
