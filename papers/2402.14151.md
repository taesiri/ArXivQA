# [BIRCO: A Benchmark of Information Retrieval Tasks with Complex   Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14151)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Information retrieval (IR) tasks have traditionally focused on semantic similarity matching between queries and passages. However, user search objectives can be more complex, involving multiple facets that are not well captured by similarity.  
- Existing IR benchmarks have limited query complexity and suffer from potential contamination where language models can answer queries without accessing documents. This reduces their validity for evaluating retrieval abilities.
- Large language models (LLMs) are promising for IR but evaluating them is prohibitively expensive on large document sets.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce BIRCO, a benchmark for IR tasks with complex, multi-faceted objectives. It has 5 diverse datasets with long, complex queries and 100 passages per query.
- BIRCO queries cannot be answered by LLMs without the documents, ensuring models are evaluated on retrieval abilities.
- The authors propose a modular LLM framework to investigate ranking vs scoring and reasoning strategies.

Main Contributions:
- BIRCO provides a challenging IR benchmark for models to handle complex search needs, with built-in controls against contamination.
- Analysis shows BIRCO is significantly more difficult than existing benchmarks across metrics.
- Experiments with the LLM framework find scoring outperforms ranking, and chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve performance. Providing task objectives helps for some datasets.
- GPT4 matches or exceeds specialized IR models, but still struggles on certain BIRCO tasks, highlighting room for progress on complex retrieval.

In summary, the paper introduces BIRCO, a novel IR benchmark to evaluate complex search scenarios, and uses it to benchmark LLMs, revealing strengths and limitations in handling multi-faceted user needs. The analysis provides insights into design of more capable IR systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces BIRCO, a benchmark for evaluating information retrieval systems on complex search tasks with long, multi-faceted queries and varied objectives beyond semantic similarity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of BIRCO, a new benchmark for evaluating information retrieval systems on tasks with complex, multi-faceted objectives. Key aspects of BIRCO include:

- It curates 5 open-source datasets spanning diverse domains with paragraph-length queries that have multiple semantic facets and complex retrieval goals beyond just finding similar passages. This represents a more challenging testbed compared to existing IR benchmarks.

- It is designed specifically to evaluate large language model (LLM) based retrieval systems. BIRCO queries cannot be directly answered by the LLMs without examining the corpus documents, reducing issues of data contamination. The compact corpus size also makes BIRCO feasible to use for evaluating LLMs. 

- The paper proposes a modular framework to integrate LLMs into retrieval pipelines and investigate factors like ranking versus scoring and chain-of-thought reasoning that may impact LLM performance.

- Benchmark results using GPT models show that only the largest GPT4 model is able to outperform baseline embedding models and fine-tuned encoder-decoders across BIRCO datasets. No approach achieves adequate performance across all tasks, highlighting the need for advances in models and protocols to address complex search needs.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and analysis of BIRCO, a new benchmark to measure progress on information retrieval tasks with complex, multi-faceted user objectives.

The paper introduces BIRCO, a new benchmark for evaluating information retrieval systems, especially large language models, on tasks with complex objectives beyond semantic similarity. BIRCO consists of 5 diverse datasets with longer, multi-faceted queries. The paper also proposes different methods to integrate LLMs into the retrieval pipeline, including scoring vs ranking passages, chain-of-thought reasoning, and task decomposition. A framework is introduced to evaluate these different factors. Data decontamination procedures are also described. So in summary, the key terms revolve around the new benchmark, its datasets, the LLM retrieval frameworks, and factors that are evaluated.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a modular framework for integrating large language models into information retrieval tasks. Can you explain the key components of this framework and how they aim to improve retrieval performance?

2. The paper evaluates both ranking-based and scoring-based approaches for using LLMs in IR. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of each approach? Under what conditions might one approach be preferred over the other?  

3. The paper introduces a "chain-of-thought reasoning" prompt structure. Why is explicating reasoning hypotheses thought to benefit LLM performance, and in what types of tasks has this been shown previously? Why was the effect inconsistent in this study?

4. What role does task decomposition play in the proposed framework? How does it aim to simplify complex retrieval tasks for LLMs and why was its effect limited based on the results? 

5. The paper puts emphasis on including explicit task objective descriptions in prompts. Why is this considered important for LLMs in IR? For which specific datasets/tasks did including objectives improve performance the most?

6. Two datasets contain deliberately constructed "hard negatives". How are these defined? What was their impact on model ranking performance based on the error analysis? 

7. What procedures were undertaken to "decontaminate" the datasets and avoid inflated estimates of LLM abilities? How much data had to be filtered for the WhatsThatBook task and why?

8. The paper identifies query complexity features that correlate with task difficulty. What are some of these features and what do the results suggest about predicting difficulty?

9. How was the candidate passage pool constructed for each query? What analyses were done to ensure consistent difficulty compared to using the full dataset passage collections?

10. What overall conclusions does the paper reach about the abilities of different LLMs on these complex retrieval tasks? What types of improvements are still needed to achieve adequate performance?
