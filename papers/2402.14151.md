# [BIRCO: A Benchmark of Information Retrieval Tasks with Complex   Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14151)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Information retrieval (IR) tasks have traditionally focused on semantic similarity matching between queries and passages. However, user search objectives can be more complex, involving multiple facets that are not well captured by similarity.  
- Existing IR benchmarks have limited query complexity and suffer from potential contamination where language models can answer queries without accessing documents. This reduces their validity for evaluating retrieval abilities.
- Large language models (LLMs) are promising for IR but evaluating them is prohibitively expensive on large document sets.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce BIRCO, a benchmark for IR tasks with complex, multi-faceted objectives. It has 5 diverse datasets with long, complex queries and 100 passages per query.
- BIRCO queries cannot be answered by LLMs without the documents, ensuring models are evaluated on retrieval abilities.
- The authors propose a modular LLM framework to investigate ranking vs scoring and reasoning strategies.

Main Contributions:
- BIRCO provides a challenging IR benchmark for models to handle complex search needs, with built-in controls against contamination.
- Analysis shows BIRCO is significantly more difficult than existing benchmarks across metrics.
- Experiments with the LLM framework find scoring outperforms ranking, and chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve performance. Providing task objectives helps for some datasets.
- GPT4 matches or exceeds specialized IR models, but still struggles on certain BIRCO tasks, highlighting room for progress on complex retrieval.

In summary, the paper introduces BIRCO, a novel IR benchmark to evaluate complex search scenarios, and uses it to benchmark LLMs, revealing strengths and limitations in handling multi-faceted user needs. The analysis provides insights into design of more capable IR systems.
