## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a new framework for learning rotation equivariant keypoint descriptors using "steerers" - linear maps that encode image rotations in descriptor space. The key idea is that a steerer transforms descriptor vectors to match how they would change if the image was rotated, enabling rotation invariant matching without test-time augmentation. The paper grounds steerers in representation theory, proving steerers emerge for descriptors approximately satisfying an equivariance condition. Experiments are conducted in three settings: optimizing steerers for fixed descriptors, jointly optimizing descriptors and steerers, and optimizing descriptors for fixed steerers. State-of-the-art results are demonstrated on rotated matching benchmarks like AIMS and Roto-360, while maintaining performance on upright images, highlighting the benefits over prior learned descriptors. The framework is flexible, applicable beyond rotations, and advances understanding of equivariance in descriptors. Analysis also reveals training dynamics and eigenvalue structure relates to descriptor performance. Overall, the paper presents a novel, well-grounded framework for learning descriptors equivariant to transformations like rotations.
