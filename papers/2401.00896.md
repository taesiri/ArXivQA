# [TrailBlazer: Trajectory Control for Diffusion-Based Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00896)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent text-to-video (T2V) models like Imagen Video and ZeroScope can generate high-quality videos from text prompts. However, they lack controllability over the motion and trajectories of objects in the synthesized video. Providing low-level signals like edge maps or depth maps to guide the motion requires extra effort and limits the motion to existing videos. There is a need for high-level control over object trajectories for casual users.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes TrailBlazer, a method to control object trajectories in videos generated by diffusion models like ZeroScope. It allows controlling the subject's location, size and movement using bounding boxes (bboxes) specified at keyframes. 

The core ideas are:
1) Edit the spatial cross-attention maps to focus activation on user-specified bboxes. This guides subject position.
2) Edit the temporal cross-frame attention maps to encode high correlation between frames for static bg and low correlation for moving fg.
3) Animate bboxes and prompts using keyframes. Bbox size controls perspective effects.
4) Composite multiple object latents to ensure consistent rendering.

The method requires no retraining or optimization. Attention edit is done only for initial diffusion steps.

Main Contributions:
1) Introduces high-level bbox-based control over subject trajectory and appearance in videos from diffusion models.
2) Enables control over subject location, size, prompt and speed using keyframed bboxes and prompts.
3) Generates smooth, natural motion with perspective and subject-background interactions.
4) Simple 200 LoC algorithm with negligible overhead over base model.

The method shows good quantitative results and can generate videos with non-rigid motion of subjects that interact properly with backgrounds. Limitations include artifacts inherited from the base model. Controlling multiple objects can also be challenging. Overall, it provides an easy way for casual users to direct object motion in text-to-video generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a high-level bounding box interface to control object trajectories in diffusion-based text-to-video synthesis by editing spatial and temporal attention maps during early denoising steps, enabling keyframe-based directing of subject position, size, prompt, and speed without model retraining.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a novel approach to enhance controllability in diffusion-based video synthesis using simple bounding boxes to guide the subject's trajectory. Specifically:

1) It enables controlling the spatial location and size of subjects through bounding box keyframes without needing detailed masks or frame-by-frame input. 

2) Both the bounding boxes and prompts can be keyframed to alter the trajectory and behavior of subjects over time, providing an intuitive interface for users.

3) The generated subjects fit naturally within specified environments, providing a pipeline for video storytelling and animation. 

4) It is computationally efficient, requiring no finetuning or training, just simple edits to the attention maps in a pre-trained model.

In summary, it contributes a straightforward yet effective method to control subject motion and integrate subjects into environments in diffusion video synthesis using high-level bounding box guidance. The key advantage is enabling intuitive control for casual users without specialized artistic input or model retraining.

It leverages bounding boxes and keyframes specified by the user to edit the spatial and temporal attention maps in a pre-trained model at inference time. This provides a simple way to direct subject trajectories without extra training or optimization. Overall, the key focus is on enhancing controllability over synthesized video content using high-level bounding box guidance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions inheriting common failure cases from the underlying diffusion model. What are some of the key limitations of current diffusion models that could be improved to enhance the results of this method?

2. The method relies on manipulating spatial and temporal attention maps. What are some alternative ways the pre-trained model could be guided to achieve similar trajectory control without directly editing attention maps?

3. How robust is the method to changes in hyperparameters like the number of editing steps, editing coefficients, and number of trailing attention maps? Is there an optimal set of hyperparameters or does it require tuning on a case-by-case basis?  

4. The paper composites multiple object latents to handle multi-object scenes. How does this scene compositing approach compare to other strategies like sequential generation or joint generation? What are the key tradeoffs?

5. The method produces perspective effects as the bounding box size changes dynamically. What properties of the pre-trained model enable these complex perspective effects to emerge from simple bbox manipulation?  

6. How does the choice of underlying pre-trained model impact the types of motion and behaviors that can be controlled with this method? Would a video model trained on more diverse motion data improve controllability?  

7. The paper uses keyframing to smoothly interpolate bounding box trajectories and prompts. What other interpolation strategies could produce realistic motion transitions between keyframes?  

8. How robust is the method to non-rigid deformations and changes in aspect ratio of the bounding box over time? Under what conditions does it start to break down?

9. Could conditional models like text-conditioned variational autoencoders enable greater control over subject appearance while still maintaining natural motion?

10. What quantitative metrics beyond FID/IS/KID would be most indicative of progress in this particular task of trajectory control for text-to-video generation?
