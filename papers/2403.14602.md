# [ReNoise: Real Image Inversion Through Iterative Noising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14602)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled powerful image manipulation capabilities when guided by text prompts. However, applying these techniques to real images requires first inverting the images into the domain of the pretrained diffusion model, which remains challenging. This is especially difficult for recent models trained to generate images using very few diffusion steps. Existing inversion methods either struggle to reconstruct details accurately or lack editability.

Method:
This paper introduces ReNoise, an inversion technique that improves reconstruction accuracy without increasing computational cost. It builds upon diffusion sampling methods that approximate the inverse by reversing the forward diffusion directions. To refine this approximation, ReNoise employs an iterative "renoising" process at each step, which repeatedly applies the diffusion model and averages the predictions. 

Key ideas:
- Leverage fixed-point iteration strategy to progressively refine inversion trajectory point estimates 
- Introduce editability regularization and noise correction to balance reconstruction quality and editability
- Demonstrate reconstruction improvement, especially for few-step models, with no slowdown

Results:
- Evaluated on multiple models (SD, SDXL, SDXL Turbo, LCM) and sampling methods 
- Outperforms baseline inverses for both accuracy and speed
- Enables high-quality inversion for recent fast few-step models
- Preserves image editability, as shown through text-guided edits

Main contributions:
- High quality-to-computation inversion technique, improving on tradeoffs
- Enables invertibility of recent fast diffusion models for the first time
- Carefully balances reconstruction and editability 
- Versatile approach that works across models and samplers

The method facilitates improved real image manipulation leveraging recent progress in few-step diffusion models.
