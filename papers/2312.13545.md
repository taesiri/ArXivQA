# [Developing Interactive Tourism Planning: A Dialogue Robot System Powered   by a Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13545)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing interactive dialogue systems for tourist guidance is challenging due to the complexity of natural conversations and travel planning. Prior dialogue competitions had simpler tasks over shorter conversations.

Proposed Solution:
- They propose a dialogue robot system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to have more flexible conversations and generate travel plans.
- The system divides the complex travel planning task into 5 phases, each focused on a subtask (inquiry, spot selection, etc). Transitions between phases are automated based on turn limits or model outputs.  
- LLMs are used to generate responses in each phase based on specialized prompts and external APIs provide up-to-date data.
- A web interface displays images and maps of tourist spots to aid conversations. 

Main Contributions:
- A phased, prompt-based approach to simplifying complex travel planning conversations and automatically controlling dialogue flow.
- Utilizing LLMs for flexible dialogue and travel plan generation based on live APIs and datasets.
- A customizable system architecture validated through real user evaluations on robot platforms.
- Analysis of issues discovered during an open dialogue system competition to guide future research.

The paper provides useful insights into managing complex conversations with the latest neural approaches. The proposed methods demonstrate improvements in developing reliable dialogue agents for practical applications.
