# [UniDexFPM: Universal Dexterous Functional Pre-grasp Manipulation Via   Diffusion Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12421)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of dexterous functional pre-grasp manipulation. In real-world scenarios, objects are not always positioned optimally for functional grasping, which requires properly grasping objects for their intended use (e.g. grasping the spray nozzle of a spray bottle instead of randomly grasping the bottle body). To achieve this, objects often need to be repositioned and reoriented into a suitable pre-grasp pose first, before they can be functionally grasped. However, learning such dexterous manipulation skills with precise position, orientation and finger contacts is challenging, especially for diverse objects and functional grasp poses.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a teacher-student learning approach to address this challenge. It introduces a novel mutual reward to prevent the teacher policy (trained with full state access using RL) from getting stuck in local optima. This significantly improves the learning of high-quality teachers. To further enhance generalization, the teachers are trained on different subsets using a mixture-of-experts strategy. Finally, a diffusion policy is used to distill the multiple complex manipulation policies into a single robust student policy which only relies on object pose observations.

Main Contributions:
1) A mutual reward is designed to optimize policy learning towards jointly achieving precise relative position, orientation and contacts. This prevents getting trapped in local minima.

2) A pipeline integrating mixture-of-experts and diffusion policy is proposed to acquire diverse manipulation behaviors and effectively consolidate them into a single policy.

3) The method achieves 72.6% manipulation success rate across 30+ everyday object categories and 10,000+ goal poses, using only object pose observations. The robustness and feedback adjustment capability enhance real-world applicability.

To summarize, the paper presents a learning framework to acquire universal dexterous functional pre-grasp manipulation policies that can manipulate diverse objects into goal functional grasp poses purely based on object pose information. The approach demonstrates promising performance and robustness.
