# [Learning Hierarchical Color Guidance for Depth Map Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Depth map super-resolution (DSR) aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) depth map from a low-resolution (LR) one. It is an ill-posed inverse problem due to the lack of a unique mapping between LR and HR depth maps.  
- Accurately recovering fine details like sharp boundaries is particularly challenging, especially for large upsampling factors.
- HR color images can provide guidance for DSR due to structural similarity with depth maps. But how to best utilize color information remains an open issue. Current methods have limitations in exploiting color guidance fully and effectively.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a hierarchical color guidance network (HCGNet) that distinguishes the roles of low-level and high-level color information and makes them guide depth reconstruction in a divide-and-conquer manner.

- Design a low-level detail embedding (LDE) module to leverage low-level color features to enhance high-frequency details of depth features. Learn a residual mask to highlight spatial locations where color features are most consistent with depth, thereby transferring valid information.

- Propose a high-level abstract guidance (HAG) module where high-level abstract color features are used to perform content correction on initial reconstruction results. Encode global guidance in a semantic mask to alleviate semantic shifts and maintain consistency.

- Further propose an attention-based feature projection (AFP) module with a multi-scale content enhancement block and adaptive attention projection blocks. Make full use of multi-scale information and project critical information in an attention manner to optimize reconstruction performance.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive validation shows proposed HCGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
- Effectively distinguishes and utilizes low-level and high-level color information via LDE and HAG modules for hierarchical guidance in depth reconstruction. 
- AFP module selectively projects informative regions while suppressing redundancy, improving efficiency of computation and accuracy of reconstruction.

In summary, the paper re-explores color guidance for DSR and proposes a novel hierarchical usage of color information along with an attention-based projection module to achieve significant performance improvement over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a hierarchical color guidance network (HCGNet) for depth map super-resolution that utilizes low-level color details and high-level color semantics to guide depth map reconstruction in a coarse-to-fine manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It rethinks the utilization of color information in depth map super-resolution (DSR) and proposes to use color guidance hierarchically - using low-level color features to enhance high-frequency details through the Low-level Detail Embedding (LDE) module, and using high-level abstract color features to maintain semantic consistency through the High-level Abstract Guidance (HAG) module.

2) It designs an Attention-based Feature Projection (AFP) module to make full use of multi-scale information and project effective information in an attention manner for reconstruction. The AFP module contains a Multi-scale Content Enhancement (MCE) block and multiple Adaptive Attention Projection (AAP) blocks.

3) Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Hierarchical Color Guidance Network (HCGNet) achieves state-of-the-art performance in depth map super-resolution, outperforming previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel framework for hierarchical color-guided depth map super-resolution, with specially designed modules to leverage color information at different levels to guide the reconstruction process.
