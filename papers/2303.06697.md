# [Traj-MAE: Masked Autoencoders for Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06697)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How to design an efficient masked autoencoder framework to generate consistent trajectory predictions by modeling complex interactions between agents and capturing multi-granularity map information?The key points are:- Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving systems, but existing methods struggle with inconsistent/colliding predictions due to not sufficiently capturing interactions and map context. - Self-supervised learning via masked autoencoders has shown promise in NLP and CV for learning useful representations from unlabeled data. - The paper proposes Traj-MAE, a masked autoencoder framework tailored for trajectory prediction, using diverse masking strategies and a continual pre-training approach.- The goal is to learn latent semantics and capture social/temporal interactions and multi-granularity map structure to produce consistent trajectory predictions.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that a properly designed masked autoencoder framework can effectively model complex interactions and map context for trajectory prediction in a self-supervised manner, leading to more consistent predictions. The experiments aim to validate the benefits of the proposed Traj-MAE in achieving this.
