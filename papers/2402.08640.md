# [Forecasting high-impact research topics via machine learning on evolving   knowledge graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08640)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Exponential growth of scientific publications makes it hard for researchers to discover new high-impact research ideas beyond their expertise. 
- Existing methods to predict a paper's future impact need the research to already be completed and published.
- There is a need for methods that can predict potential impact of new research ideas not yet investigated.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a large evolving knowledge graph with 21+ million papers represented as concepts (nodes) connected by edges when they are studied together.
- Augment it with citation information to quantify impact. Captures what concepts were studied when, and how impactful that research was over time.   
- Use machine learning on historic evolution to forecast future high-impact connections between not-yet-connected concepts.

Main Contributions:
- Knowledge graph creation methodology and dataset spanning 300+ years with 37K concepts and 26M+ concept connections.
- Demonstrate heavy-tail distribution in growth of impact over time.
- Achieve high accuracy in predicting future high-impact connections between concepts never studied together before.
- Show it goes beyond just link prediction by predicting intrinsic citation impact features.
- Extract highly impactful clusters of concepts as inspirations for new research directions.

The key idea is that by training machine learning models to predict evolution of this knowledge graph, one can forecast potential impact of new research ideas represented by currently disconnected concepts. This can suggest new directions long before research starts, to accelerate science.
