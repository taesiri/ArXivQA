# [Human Understanding AI Paper Challenge 2024 -- Dataset Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16509)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper introduces the dataset and task for the 2024 Human Understanding AI Paper Challenge, which focuses on analyzing lifelog sensor data to develop models that can infer indicators related to sleep quality, emotions, and stress levels. 

Dataset
The dataset comprises a train set from 2020, and validation/test sets from 2023. The train set has 22 participants over 508 days. The validation and test sets have 4 participants each over 105 and 115 days, respectively. The data includes:
- Daily surveys on sleep, emotions, stress 
- Smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, activities, GPS, app usage, sound, light intensity)  
- Smartwatch sensor data (HR, steps, light)
- Sleep mat sensor data  

Seven target metrics are derived from the surveys and sleep sensor: 
- 3 questionnaire metrics (Q1-Q3): sleep quality, emotions, stress
- 4 sleep metrics (S1-S4): total sleep time, efficiency, latency, wake time  

The task is to classify each metric as 0 or 1 for each participant-day, indicating below or above average.

Submission and Evaluation
Submissions should contain inferred classifications for the 7 metrics for the 4 test set participants over 115 days. Evaluation uses macro F1 score averaged over the 7 metrics.

In summary, the paper introduces a multi-modal lifelog dataset and binary classification task to infer daily health and wellness indicators related to sleep, emotions, and stress. The goal is to develop sensor-based models that can effectively predict these indicators.
