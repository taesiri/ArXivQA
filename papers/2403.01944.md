# [Fourier-basis Functions to Bridge Augmentation Gap: Rethinking Frequency   Augmentation in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01944)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Computer vision models suffer performance degradation when deployed in the real world due to unexpected input variations not seen during training. Data augmentation is commonly used to improve robustness by increasing data variety. 
- However, common visual augmentations have limitations in improving robustness against frequency domain perturbations and unexpected corruptions.

Proposed Solution  
- The authors propose Auxiliary Fourier-basis Augmentation (AFA) to complement visual augmentations by bridging their robustness gap in the frequency domain.

- AFA adds Fourier basis functions as adversarial noise to images' frequency spectrum. This is more efficient than other frequency manipulation techniques.

- An auxiliary model component is used to account for the adversarial distribution shifts. Along with a dual loss function, this enhances performance under distribution shifts.

Main Contributions
- AFA expands the augmentation space complementary to visual augmentations, using amplitude- and phase-adjustable frequency noise in an adversarial setting.

- Experiments show AFA improves models' robustness to common corruptions, OOD generalization, and consistency against increasing perturbations, with minimal impact on standard performance.

- AFA benefits are complementary to visual augmentations. When combined, they further boost robustness, especially against high-severity corruptions and perturbations.

- AFA has lower computational requirements than other adversarial augmentation methods, allowing large-scale usage.

In summary, the paper introduces AFA as an efficient frequency-based augmentation technique to complement visual augmentations and enhance model robustness.
