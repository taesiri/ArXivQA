# [VFusion3D: Learning Scalable 3D Generative Models from Video Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12034)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The key challenge in developing foundation 3D generative models is the limited availability of 3D data compared to the vast quantities of images, videos and text. Acquiring high-quality 3D data requires specialized equipment and techniques and is difficult to scale. This severe shortage of 3D data hinders progress in 3D generative modeling.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using a video diffusion model (EMU Video), pretrained on large volumes of text, images and videos, as a scalable source of 3D data. By fine-tuning EMU Video on 100K 3D assets, the model learns to generate diverse and 3D consistent multi-view videos from text and image prompts. This unlocks its capability as a multi-view data engine to produce synthetic datasets for training 3D models. 

Using EMU Video, the authors generate a dataset of 2.7 million multi-view videos with associated text prompts from web-scale sources. This large-scale synthetic dataset is then utilized to train VFusion3D, a 3D generative model based on LRM architecture. To enable stable training on noisy synthetic data, they introduce improved strategies including multi-stage training and image-level losses. VFusion3D is further fine-tuned on the 100K 3D assets to boost performance.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates video diffusion models as scalable 3D data generators via fine-tuning, alleviating data scarcity in 3D modeling.
- Produces a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset using the fine-tuned video model to train feed-forward 3D generative models. 
- Presents VFusion3D, a 3D generative model trained on synthetic data, that creates high-quality 3D assets from images in seconds and outperforms SOTA methods.
- Provides training strategies to stabilize learning on noisy synthetic multi-view data.
- Establishes a promising direction of utilizing synthetic data from video models to develop foundation 3D generative models.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel paradigm for 3D generative modeling by unlocking the 3D capabilities of video diffusion models to massively scale up training data. VFusion3D demonstrates superior generative abilities thanks to this scalable data source.
