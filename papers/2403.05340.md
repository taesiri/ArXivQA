# [Embedded Deployment of Semantic Segmentation in Medicine through   Low-Resolution Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05340)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- When deploying neural networks in real-world applications, size and computational requirements are often limiting factors, especially in resource-constrained environments like medical devices.  
- State-of-the-art lightweight networks reduce resolution to meet hardware constraints, but this hurts prediction quality.
- Existing networks are rigid, leaving end-users with little freedom to tradeoff between throughput speed and quality.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel architecture that takes low-resolution inputs but leverages available high-resolution ground truths to improve prediction quality.
- Architecture adds extra upsampling layers to end of any U-Net style architecture, allowing higher-resolution predictions from lower-resolution inputs.
- Additional upsampling layers have minimal impact on model complexity but help exploit informative high-res ground truths.
- Also propose multi-scale loss function comparing outputs at each upsample resolution to match ground truths.

Contributions:
- Architecture improves prediction quality by 5.5% on 16x16 Decathlon inputs and reaches similar scores to 32x32 baseline on BraTS while adding only 0.1 images/sec throughput.
- Can extend any U-Net architecture to leverage high-res ground truths with minimal overhead.
- Detailed ablation studies demonstrate improved prediction quality over comparable methods on Decathlon prostate and BraTS brain tumor segmentation.
- Analysis shows proposed architecture reaches higher prediction quality with less model complexity compared to U-Net and ELU-Net.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel architecture to efficiently combine low-resolution inputs and high-resolution ground truths for improved prediction quality in resource-constrained segmentation scenarios.
