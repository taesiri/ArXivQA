# [Modular Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting: Interpretability   and Feature Selection using Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16834)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel modular neural network model called Attention Modular Networks (AMN) for interpretable multivariate time series forecasting and classification. The model consists of three main components: a recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture temporal dependencies, an attention-based feature selection module to identify the most relevant input features, and independent modular networks that each learn non-linear relationships between one selected feature and the target. A key innovation is the use of attention weights from feature selection to initialize the weights of the modular networks, improving performance. Experiments on real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AMN matches or exceeds the predictive accuracy of non-interpretable methods like LSTM and XGBoost, while providing interpretability through visualizations of learned feature-target relationships. Compared to other interpretable models, AMN also shows better performance. The modular architecture and attention-based feature selection enable AMN to handle both regression and classification tasks effectively. By learning sparse feature representations aligned with prediction, AMN is more accurate and transparent than prior interpretable time series models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel modular neural network model for interpretable multivariate time series forecasting that uses attention-based feature selection to improve predictive performance while providing modular explanations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel modular neural network model called Attention Modular Networks (AMN) for multivariate time series forecasting. The key innovations are:

1) Using an attention-based feature selection component (AFS) to select the most relevant features from the input time series data. This improves performance by focusing on salient features and ignoring redundant ones. 

2) Introducing Attention-based Node Bootstrapping (ANB) to weight the selected features from AFS and use those weights to bootstrap the training of each feature-specific module network. This further improves performance.

3) Showing that AMN provides interpretability through visualizations of the contribution of each module network (similar to Neural Additive Models), while achieving better predictive performance than other interpretable models and matching non-interpretable models like LSTMs.

So in summary, the main contribution is an interpretable and high-performing modular network architecture for time series forecasting, enabled by novel use of attention mechanisms for feature selection and node bootstrapping.
