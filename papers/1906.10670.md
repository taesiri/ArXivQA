# [Improving performance of deep learning models with axiomatic attribution   priors and expected gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10670)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) Can imposing constraints on a deep learning model's feature attributions during training lead to models with more desirable properties, such as being more interpretable or robust? 

2) Can new types of constraints on attributions, beyond just setting attributions of some features to specific target values, be formulated? Specifically, can constraints be imposed that encode "high-level" priors about relationships between features, rather than just priors about individual features?

3) Can a new attribution method be developed that is more axiomatically justified, efficient to compute, and well-suited to being incorporated into the training process through an attribution prior?

The authors introduce the concept of "attribution priors", which constrain a model's feature attributions during training to have certain properties. They hypothesize that novel attribution priors can be formulated to encode things like smoothness, sparsity, and similarity between related features. They also hypothesize that their new attribution method, expected gradients, will enable more effective training with attribution priors due to its theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. 

The central goals are to demonstrate:
- New types of attribution priors beyond previous work
- That these novel priors improve model interpretability and performance
- That the expected gradients attribution method outperforms previous methods when incorporated into training through attribution priors.

The key hypotheses are that attribution priors are a flexible framework for encoding human domain knowledge into models, that the specific new priors introduced will be beneficial, and that expected gradients will be both axiomatically and empirically superior as the attribution method for imposing such priors.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that using axiomatically correct feature attributions (such as expected gradients) to encode high-level priors into deep learning models can improve their performance and interpretability on real-world tasks. 

Specifically, the paper proposes using differentiable functions of a model's axiomatic feature attributions as regularization terms during training. This allows encoding flexible priors that capture relationships between features, rather than just encouraging attributions towards predetermined target values. 

The main hypotheses tested are:

1) Attribution priors based on axiomatic attributions like expected gradients will outperform previous attribution priors based on simple gradients.

2) Novel high-level priors encoded via expected gradients attributions can improve model performance in image classification, drug response prediction, and healthcare tasks. 

3) The proposed expected gradients attribution method will better identify important features on benchmark tasks compared to previous attribution methods.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that axiomatically correct attributions enable more effective high-level priors that in turn improve model performance and interpretability compared to previous attribution-based regularization approaches. Experiments across computer vision, biology, and healthcare domains aim to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a flexible framework called "attribution priors" for incorporating domain knowledge into deep learning models by penalizing their feature attribution explanations during training. This allows encoding priors that features should be smooth, sparse, etc without needing to know exact importance values.

2. It develops a new axiomatic attribution method called "expected gradients" that enables efficiently training attribution priors by reformulating attributions as expectations that can be estimated with sampling. This also satisfies desirable properties like implementation invariance. 

3. It demonstrates the effectiveness of training with attribution priors and expected gradients on several real-world tasks:

- Using a smoothness prior on images improves robustness and interpretability

- Using a biological graph prior on gene expression data improves prediction and captures relevant pathways

- Using a sparsity prior on healthcare data improves prediction with limited data

Overall, the key ideas are developing more flexible attribution priors beyond previous work, enabling efficient training with axiomatic attributions, and showing performance gains across diverse domains. The proposed methods improve interpretability and robustness without sacrificing accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is introducing a new framework for incorporating feature attribution methods into the training of deep learning models, called "attribution priors". The key ideas are:

- Attribution priors allow encoding high-level domain knowledge about how models should treat input features into the training process. This is done by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training that depends on the feature attributions (e.g. integrated gradients) of the model.

- The paper demonstrates several new types of flexible attribution priors that improve model performance and interpretability without needing to pre-specify target attribution values for individual features. These include priors for smoothness, sparsity, and using biological graph information.

- The paper introduces a new attribution method called "expected gradients" that is efficient to calculate and integrate into training while satisfying important axiomatic properties like implementation invariance. 

- Across image, biological, and healthcare experiments, the authors show that using expected gradients attributions to calculate priors (rather than simpler gradients) substantially improves performance.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting attribution priors as a general framework for encoding domain knowledge via feature attributions, demonstrating new flexible priors, and showing that using axiom-satisfying attributions like expected gradients enables significiant gains. This provides tools to induce desirable behaviors in deep learning models aligned with human intuition.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary and comparison of the key points of this paper to other related work:

The paper introduces a method for using axiomatic feature attributions (explanations of model predictions based on input features) to encourage desirable behaviors in deep neural network models during training. The key contributions are:

- Presenting attribution priors as a general framework for incorporating differentiable functions of a model's feature attributions into the training loss. This allows encoding high-level domain knowledge as regularization terms. 

- Demonstrating new types of flexible attribution priors beyond just encouraging attributions to match specified targets. These include smoothness over images, biological graphs, and sparsity.

- Introducing expected gradients, a novel attribution method that satisfies key axioms and enables efficient computation of attributions for regularization.

This relates to prior work as follows:

- Attribution priors build on the idea of "Right for the Right Reasons" regularization introduced by Ross et al. (2017), but are more general and flexible. They also outperform gradient-based regularization.

- Using attributions in training was also explored in recent works like Liu et al. (2019) and Rieger et al. (2020) but with more limited attribution methods and less sophisticated priors. Expected gradients enable more efficient training.

- New attribution priors go beyond just matching target values, allowing more flexible shaping of model behavior based on domain knowledge.

- Expected gradients provides a fast, axiomatically sound attribution method. It outperforms integrated gradients on benchmarks.

So in summary, this paper significantly expands the framework and demonstrates the value of encoding domain knowledge via attribution priors. The new methods and ideas could have broad impact on applied deep learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is how it compares and relates to other research in the field:

- The paper introduces a new method called "attribution priors" for incorporating human domain knowledge into deep learning models using feature attribution methods. This builds on prior work like "Right for the Right Reasons" by Ross et al. that also trained models to have correct attributions. The key advances are using more sophisticated attribution methods that satisfy important axioms and introducing flexible priors that encode relationships between features rather than just target values.

- The flexible priors like smoothness over images or graphs are novel ways to encode human intuition that have not been explored before. Prior work focused on getting attributions close to pre-set targets. Encoding relationships between features is a more natural way for humans to express preferences.

- Using an attribution method like expected gradients that satisfies key axioms like implementation invariance sets this work apart from just using gradients, which can fail for common architectures. The efficiency of expected gradients also enables training complex priors in a reasonable time.

- Recent work like CDEP also incorporates explanations into training but is limited to certain architectures and optimizing explanations for groups rather than individual features. The flexibility of attribution priors to use any differentiable model and any feature-wise penalty is an advantage.

- The empirical benefits like increased robustness and biological interpretability demonstrate the practical value of this approach over just training for accuracy. This relates to growing work on how explanations can improve models rather than just diagnose them.

- Overall, attribution priors advance the state-of-the-art in encoding human domain knowledge into deep learning models by introducing flexible, high-level priors and efficient, axiomatically-sound attributions. The gains across diverse tasks validate the benefits of this approach.

In summary, this work moves beyond previous limitations in training with explanations and enables rich human knowledge to be incorporated through intuitive priors that improve model performance and interpretability. The results substantiate the advantages of this framework for many real-world applications.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest several promising directions for future research:

1. Developing new attribution priors: While the paper introduces useful priors like smoothness, sparsity, and graph-based priors, there is ample opportunity to design novel priors that encode other types of human intuition or domain knowledge. The authors propose that surveying domain experts could help determine the most useful priors for different applications.

2. Improving expected gradients: The expected gradients attribution method could potentially be improved, for example by using more advanced sampling techniques. Exploring other axiomatic attribution methods in place of expected gradients is also suggested. 

3. Applications to additional domains: The authors demonstrate the usefulness of attribution priors on images, biological data, and healthcare data. Applying the framework to more domains like audio, video, natural language processing, and others could be impactful.

4. Connections to human-in-the-loop learning: The paper notes that attribution priors provide a way for humans to insert domain knowledge into models. Combining attribution priors with interactive learning systems and human annotation could be a fruitful direction.

5. Theoretical analysis: While empirical results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed methods, theoretical analysis of attribution priors could provide better understanding of why and how they work. Analyzing the induced priors, optimization landscape changes, generalizability, and other theoretical properties is suggested.

In summary, the authors propose improving upon the core methods in the paper, applying them to new domains, connecting them to human-AI interaction, and theoretically analyzing attribution priors as key areas for future work. Overall, they position attribution priors as a general framework with the potential to significantly advance interpretable and reliable AI.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

They suggest surveys of domain experts could help determine the best priors for different applications.

- Studying different attribution methods: The authors used expected gradients in this work, but note that other attribution methods could potentially be used as well within their general attribution prior framework. Examining the effectiveness of other explainable AI methods as priors could be valuable future work.

- Broadening adoption of attribution priors: The authors believe their work motivates broader adoption of attribution priors in applied machine learning, as their advances help address previous theoretical and computational limitations. Testing their methods on more real-world tasks is an area for future exploration.

- Attribution priors in human-in-the-loop systems: The authors discuss the potential for attribution priors to expand the ways humans can influence model training in human-in-the-loop systems. Studying how best to incorporate attribution priors into such systems is suggested as future work.

- Determining optimal priors: While the authors introduced new priors, determining the truly optimal prior for different tasks through theoretical analysis or empirical evaluation is posed as an open question.

- Applications to other domains: The authors demonstrated results on images, graphs/biology, and healthcare but suggest attribution priors may benefit many other domains as well. Testing their approach in other applied fields could be impactful.

In summary, the main future directions focus on improving and expanding on the attribution priors introduced in this work, integrating them into more real-world systems, and better understanding their theoretical properties. The authors position their work as enabling broader adoption of attribution priors across machine learning.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new method for incorporating human intuition and domain knowledge into deep learning models using attribution priors. Attribution priors involve adding a penalty term to the model loss function that encodes preferences about how the model should assign importance to input features when making predictions. The authors propose flexible new attribution priors that improve model interpretability and performance on image, biological, and healthcare tasks without needing pre-specified target values for feature importances. They also introduce a new attribution method called expected gradients that efficiently estimates feature importance, unlike prior work which required extra computational steps. Expected gradients satisfies key axioms like implementation invariance and completeness. 

Across three domains, the authors' new attribution priors and expected gradients method outperforms previous techniques like directly penalizing gradients. On images, they show an attribution prior encouraging smoothness between pixels makes models more robust to noise. On gene expression data, incorporating network information about related genes improves prediction and captures more relevant biological pathways. Finally, on healthcare data, directly encouraging a global sparse set of features performs better than weight decay or Dropout when data is limited. Overall, this work greatly expands the flexibility and scalability of incorporating human knowledge through attribution priors with axiomatic attribution methods.

This paper introduces a new method for using axiomatic feature attributions to encourage desirable behaviors in deep neural network models. The key ideas are 1) attribution priors, which incorporate differentiable functions of a model's feature attributions into the training loss to encode domain knowledge and 2) expected gradients, a new attribution method that satisfies key axioms and enables efficient training.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new framework called attribution priors, which enables incorporating human intuition and domain knowledge into deep learning models by regularizing their training objectives based on axiomatic feature attributions. The attribution prior is a penalty on the model's feature attributions calculated by an axiomatic method like expected gradients. This penalty encodes priors and inductive biases about relationships between features, such as attributions should be smooth in images or attributions of related genes should be similar, without needing preset targets for each feature's attribution. The proposed attribution method, expected gradients, estimates attributions by taking expectations over data samples, avoiding issues with selecting arbitrary baseline inputs in prior methods. Experiments demonstrate that this framework improves performance and interpretability compared to baselines across image, biological, and healthcare tasks by penalizing sophisticated properties of attributions like smoothness, sparsity, and graph structure rather than simply constraining attributions to preset values.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a framework called "attribution priors" for incorporating feature attribution methods into the training of deep neural network models. Feature attribution methods assign an importance score to each input feature for a given prediction. The attribution prior framework allows penalizing an arbitrary differentiable function of a model's feature attributions during training. This enables encoding meaningful priors and domain knowledge that are difficult to formulate directly on the model parameters. The authors introduce a new attribution method called expected gradients that satisfies key axioms like implementation invariance. Expected gradients reformulates integrated gradients into an expectation that allows efficient estimation using sampling. The authors demonstrate how to encode priors like smoothness over images, sparsity of features, and smoothness over biological graphs into differentiable penalties on expected gradients attributions. Across image, biological, and healthcare experiments, they show that training with these flexible attribution priors improves model interpretability and performance compared to previous gradient-based regularization techniques. The modular framework and fast differentiable attributions enable incorporating meaningful human knowledge during deep model training.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a method for using axiomatic feature attributions to encourage desirable behaviors in deep learning models. Feature attribution methods assign importance scores to input features to explain a model's predictions. The authors propose using these attributions, not just for model interpretation, but also to optimize the training objective itself. They refer to this approach as "attribution priors". 

The authors argue that previous attribution priors rely on methods like gradients that lack theoretical guarantees. They introduce a new attribution method called expected gradients that satisfies important axioms like completeness and implementation invariance. This enables integrating attribution priors into training efficiently.

The paper demonstrates attribution priors that encode domain knowledge without needing predetermined target values for features' importances. These include an image prior encouraging smoothness, a graph prior using biological networks, and a sparsity prior. Across image, biological, and healthcare experiments, these priors improved performance over baselines.

The main innovations are 1) flexible new attribution priors encoding higher-level relationships between features rather than just target importances and 2) the expected gradients method that makes incorporating attribution priors efficient while satisfying axioms. Overall, the work provides tools to encode human domain knowledge as regularization of axiomatically sound feature attributions during training.
