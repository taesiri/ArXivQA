# [Trading off Consistency and Dimensionality of Convex Surrogates for the   Mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10818)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In multiclass classification with a large number of outcomes, optimizing a consistent and convex surrogate loss often requires a very high dimensional (n-1 dims) prediction space, which is computationally intractable. 
- The paper examines ways to trade off between surrogate loss dimension, consistency, and number of problem instances.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using polytope embeddings that map outcomes to the vertices of low dimensional polytopes to reduce the prediction space. 
- This induces a natural loss function and link function between the prediction and outcome spaces.
- The paper analyzes the consistency properties of these surrogate losses, showing there always exist both calibrated and "hallucination" regions where consistency does or does not hold respectively.
- Under low noise assumptions, consistency can be restored. Examples are shown for cube and permutahedron embeddings.
- With multiple problem instances, consistency for the mode can be achieved over the whole simplex using just n/2 dimensions.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization and analysis of polytope embedding based surrogates for multiclass classification.
- Proof that some consistency always holds, but hallucinations are inevitable in low dims.
- Demonstration of consistency under low noise for cube and permutahedron embeddings.  
- Result showing the mode can be elicited over the whole simplex using n/2 dims and multiple problem instances.
- Provides guidance to practitioners on appropriate embedding dim tradeoffs.

In summary, the paper provides an extensive analysis of polytope embedding based surrogates, highlighting tradeoffs between consistency, dimension, and problem instances. Key results help guide the practical usage of such computationally simpler surrogates.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates tradeoffs between surrogate loss dimension, number of problem instances, and consistency region size for multiclass classification, analyzing polytope embeddings that map outcomes to vertices and showing both calibrated and hallucinating regions always exist.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It investigates ways to trade off surrogate loss dimension, number of problem instances, and restricting the region of consistency in the simplex for multiclass classification. Specifically, it examines an intuitive embedding procedure that maps outcomes into the vertices of convex polytopes in a low-dimensional surrogate space.

2) It shows that full-dimensional subsets of the simplex exist around each point mass distribution for which consistency holds, but also, with less than n-1 dimensions, there exist distributions where "hallucination" can occur (the optimal report under the surrogate is an outcome with zero probability). 

3) It derives a result to check if consistency holds under a given polytope embedding and low-noise assumption, providing insight into when to use a particular embedding. It provides examples of embedding 2^d outcomes into the d-dimensional unit cube and d! outcomes into the d-dimensional permutahedron under low-noise assumptions.

4) It demonstrates that with multiple problem instances, the mode can be learned with n/2 dimensions over the whole simplex.

In summary, the main contribution is investigating tradeoffs between dimension, consistency regions, and number of problem instances for multiclass classification surrogates using polytope embeddings. The paper provides theoretical guidance on when such embeddings can be effectively used in practice.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Surrogate losses - Used in place of intractable discrete target losses. Seek to design consistent and convex surrogates.

- Consistency - Ensuring the surrogate loss leads to the same model or estimates the same statistic as directly minimizing the discrete loss. 

- Convex elicitability - Sufficient condition for consistency. Characterizes the minimizing reports of a loss function.

- Prediction dimension - The dimension of the surrogate loss function. Bounds relate to consistency and computational complexity.

- Polytope embeddings - Embedding discrete outcomes into the vertices of convex polytopes in low-dimensional surrogate spaces. 

- Hallucination regions - Sets where the minimizing report under the surrogate is an outcome that has zero probability under the true distribution. Represents worst-case inconsistency.

- Calibration regions - Sets of distributions where the surrogate loss is consistent for the target loss. Seek to characterize or expand these regions.

- Low-noise assumptions - Consistency holds for subsets of distributions satisfying assumptions like the maximum outcome probability is bounded away from zero. 

- Multiple problem instances - With multiple problem instances, can elicit properties like the mode in lower dimensions over all distributions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using polytope embeddings to trade off consistency, surrogate loss dimension, and restricting the region of consistency. How does the choice of polytope used for embedding impact these tradeoffs? For example, are some polytopes better suited for certain outcome spaces or label spaces?

2. The concept of "hallucination regions" is introduced to characterize cases where the optimal surrogate report corresponds to an outcome with zero probability under the true distribution. What techniques could be used to estimate or bound the size of hallucination regions for a given embedding? 

3. Theorem 3 shows that every polytope embedding leads to consistency under some low noise assumption. How sensitive is this result to the level of noise allowed by the assumption? Can we quantify the robustness?

4. The paper demonstrates consistency under low noise for embedding outcomes into a cube and permutahedron. What other standard polytopes could we analyze for low noise consistency? Are there any for which consistency provably does not hold?  

5. How does leveraging multiple problem instances to enable full elicitation over the simplex impact statistical efficiency or sample complexity compared to a single high-dimensional surrogate?

6. Algorithm 2 provides an approach to combine multiple problem instances with inconsistent reports in practice. How could this algorithm be refined or improved? Are there other principled ways to reconcile conflicts between problem instances?

7. Can we develop a computationally efficient method to construct or identify strict calibration regions for a given polytope embedding? What properties would such a method need?

8. Is there an analog of hallucination regions for non-polytope based embeddings? What would be an appropriate definition and how could we estimate/bound it?

9. The paper focuses on classification/the 0-1 loss. To what extent do the consistency tradeoffs explored here apply to other common prediction tasks like regression or ordinal regression?

10. How do the elcitability and consistency results change if we require convexity of the surrogate losses induced by the polytope embeddings? Does restricting to convex surrogates limit the possible embeddings or tradeoffs?
