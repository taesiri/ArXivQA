# [Set-level Guidance Attack: Boosting Adversarial Transferability of
  Vision-Language Pre-training Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14061)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: How can we generate more transferable adversarial examples to attack vision-language pre-training (VLP) models? 

Specifically, the paper observes that existing attack methods exhibit strong performance in white-box settings but have limited transferability when attacking other black-box VLP models. Thus, the authors aim to develop a more transferable attack that can fool different VLP models in black-box settings. 

To achieve this, the paper proposes a new attack method called Set-level Guidance Attack (SGA) that enhances adversarial transferability in two main ways:

1) By using alignment-preserving augmentations to create diverse multimodal input sets rather than just single examples. This increases variability and makes the attack more generalizable.

2) By incorporating cross-modal guidance to disrupt alignments and interactions between modalities when generating adversarial examples. This makes the attack less dependent on specifics of individual models.

The central hypothesis is that by using these techniques, SGA can craft adversarial examples that will more effectively transfer to other black-box VLP models compared to prior attack methods. The experiments then aim to validate whether SGA indeed provides stronger transferability across different models and tasks.

In summary, the key research question is how to improve transferability of adversarial attacks on VLP models, with the central hypothesis that techniques like alignment-preserving augmentation and cross-modal guidance in SGA will allow for more transferable attacks. The paper aims to demonstrate and validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents Set-level Guidance Attack (SGA), a novel adversarial attack method to generate transferable adversarial examples for vision-language pre-training (VLP) models. The key contributions are:

1. SGA is the first work to systematically study and improve the transferability of adversarial attacks on VLP models. It provides empirical analysis showing existing attacks exhibit poor transferability across models. 

2. SGA proposes using alignment-preserving augmentations with cross-modal guidance to enhance transferability. It leverages diverse multimodal interactions through set-level image and text data.

3. Extensive experiments demonstrate SGA consistently improves transferability over state-of-the-art attacks on various VLP models and tasks. On image-text retrieval, SGA boosts attack success rate by over 30% when transferring across models.

4. Analysis shows alignment diversity and cross-modal guidance are crucial for transferability. The scale-invariant image set and matching caption set help align perturbations to generalize across models.

In summary, the main innovation is using set-level augmentations and cross-modal guidance to enable highly transferable adversarial attacks on multimodal VLP models. SGA significantly outperforms prior work and provides a robust benchmark for evaluating model security.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other potential applications of set-level guidance attacks beyond image-text retrieval tasks. The authors propose set-level guidance attacks for generating adversarial examples on image-text retrieval tasks. They show it is effective for disrupting the cross-modal interactions in this setting. However, the authors suggest exploring whether this attack strategy could be beneficial for other multimodal tasks as well.

- Testing set-level guidance attacks on a wider range of vision-language models. The experiments in the paper focus on evaluating set-level attacks on several representative VLP models. The authors recommend investigating the attack on more diverse VLP architectures and objectives. 

- Developing defensive techniques to improve model robustness against set-level attacks. The high effectiveness of set-level attacks in black-box settings poses security risks. The authors highlight the need for developing defenses to enhance model robustness, especially methods that take multimodal interactions into account.

- Extending the set-level attack idea to other modalities beyond vision and language. The key concept of using guidance from cross-modal interactions could potentially be generalized to other multimodal learning settings as well, such as audio-visual learning. The authors suggest this as an interesting future direction.

- Theoretically analyzing the properties of set-level attacks. While the paper empirically demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed attack, the authors point out that a formal theoretical analysis of why and how set-level guidance enhances transferability is still lacking. 

In summary, the main future work directions focus on expanding the applications of set-level attacks, evaluating on more diverse models, developing defenses, extending to other modalities, and theoretical analysis. Exploring these directions could provide deeper insight into multimodal adversarial attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Set-level Guidance Attack (SGA), a new method to generate adversarial examples that can effectively transfer across different vision-language pre-training (VLP) models. The key ideas are using alignment-preserving augmentation and cross-modal guidance. For augmentation, SGA builds a diverse set of images by resizing to different scales and selecting multiple paired captions. For guidance, SGA iteratively pushes representations away between modalities, disrupting interactions to create harmonious perturbations. Experiments on image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual grounding show SGA significantly improves transferability versus prior attacks. On retrieval, SGA boosts attack success rate from the source ALBEF model to target TCL by over 30%, and outperforms existing methods on attacking other VLP models like CLIP. The improved transferability is attributed to thoroughly modeling multimodal alignments and interactions through SGA's set-level augmentation and cross-modal guidance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a highly transferable adversarial attack method for vision-language pre-training (VLP) models called Set-level Guidance Attack (SGA). The key ideas are using alignment-preserving augmentations and cross-modal guidance to generate more transferable adversarial examples. 

The authors first analyze the limitations of existing attack methods like PGD, BERT-Attack, and Co-Attack in terms of transferability when attacking VLP models. They find these methods exhibit lower transferability because they lack diversity in cross-modal guidance by only using single image-text pairs. To address this, SGA incorporates an alignment-preserving augmentation step that builds a diverse multimodal input set by creating multi-scale images and finding multiple matched captions per image. Then it generates adversarial examples through iterative cross-modal guidance that pushes the representations away between modalities. Experiments across different VLP models, datasets, and vision-language tasks demonstrate SGA significantly improves transferability over prior methods. For example, on image-text retrieval using ALBEF and TCL, SGA obtains absolute gains of 30.21% and 9.78% in attack success rates over the state-of-the-art.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a highly transferable multimodal attack method called Set-level Guidance Attack (SGA) to generate adversarial examples that can fool vision-language pre-training (VLP) models. SGA leverages diverse cross-modal interactions among multiple image-text pairs. It first constructs an augmented input set by selecting the most matching captions for each image from the dataset and generating multi-scale versions of the image. Then it generates adversarial captions by maximizing the distance between each caption and the original image in the embedding space. Using these adversarial captions as guidance, it optimizes an adversarial image to be far away from all the augmented multi-scale versions in the embedding space. Finally, it generates an adversarial caption by maximizing its distance from the adversarial image. The key aspects are using set-level augmentation to increase diversity and performing cross-modal guidance through an iterative sequence of "text-image-text" to enhance transferability across VLP models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper investigates the adversarial transferability of recent vision-language pretraining (VLP) models. Prior work has mainly focused on white-box attacks, but transferability across different VLP models is not well studied. 

- The authors observe that existing attack methods exhibit much lower transferability compared to their strong attack performance in white-box settings. The transferability degradation is partly due to the underutilization of cross-modal interactions in VLP models.

- The paper proposes a highly transferable attack method called Set-level Guidance Attack (SGA). The key ideas are: (1) Use alignment-preserving augmentation to enrich image-text pairs while keeping alignments intact; (2) Generate adversarial examples with carefully designed cross-modal guidance that leverages interactions among multiple alignments.

- Experiments show SGA can generate adversarial examples that transfer strongly across different VLP models and tasks. On image-text retrieval, SGA achieves significantly higher attack success rates compared to prior arts when transferring attacks from one VLP model to another.

In summary, the paper studies the transferability of adversarial attacks on VLP models, identifies limitations of existing methods, and proposes a novel attack approach SGA that enhances transferability by effectively modeling cross-modal interactions through set-level guidance. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of SGA for adversarial transferability.
