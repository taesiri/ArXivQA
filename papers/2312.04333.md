# [Beyond Surface: Probing LLaMA Across Scales and Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04333)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive probing of the LLaMA series of large language models to assess their capabilities and limitations across different sizes and layers. Through specially designed tests spanning calculation, mathematical reasoning, logical reasoning, fact checking, and multilingual understanding, the authors uncover several notable findings: Horizontally, increasing model size brings gradual improvements in reasoning abilities and truthfulness, but not computational skills or factual knowledge, only beyond certain size thresholds. Vertically, lower layers exhibit multilingual prowess and abstract thinking but lack real-world knowledge and calculation prowess found concentrated in upper layers. Optimal reasoning ability manifests in middle layers rather than the final layer. The analysis provides unique perspectives into LLaMA's current competencies, showing room for advancement in integrating knowledge and reasoning evenly across model scales and layers. The well-crafted probing tasks and insights contribute significantly to demystifying and advancing large language model design.
