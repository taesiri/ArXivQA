# [Beyond Surface: Probing LLaMA Across Scales and Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04333)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive probing of the LLaMA series of large language models to assess their capabilities and limitations across different sizes and layers. Through specially designed tests spanning calculation, mathematical reasoning, logical reasoning, fact checking, and multilingual understanding, the authors uncover several notable findings: Horizontally, increasing model size brings gradual improvements in reasoning abilities and truthfulness, but not computational skills or factual knowledge, only beyond certain size thresholds. Vertically, lower layers exhibit multilingual prowess and abstract thinking but lack real-world knowledge and calculation prowess found concentrated in upper layers. Optimal reasoning ability manifests in middle layers rather than the final layer. The analysis provides unique perspectives into LLaMA's current competencies, showing room for advancement in integrating knowledge and reasoning evenly across model scales and layers. The well-crafted probing tasks and insights contribute significantly to demystifying and advancing large language model design.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper probes the capabilities of LLaMA language models across different sizes and layers on tasks like calculation, math problem solving, logical reasoning, and fact checking, finding that increasing model size improves reasoning ability but not computational skills or knowledge, while knowledge and computation exist mostly in upper layers but lower layers still show some reasoning capacity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It conducts a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically the LLaMA model, by designing probing tasks to test its performance in higher-order tasks like reasoning, computation, and detecting hallucinations. 

2) It evaluates LLaMA's abilities from two perspectives - horizontally across different model sizes, and vertically across different layers of the same model size. This provides insights into how performance in these higher-order tasks scales with model size and varies across layers.

3) Through the probing tasks, it unveils several key findings about LLaMA's capabilities and limitations:
- Increasing model size primarily enhances reasoning abilities and reduces hallucinations, but does not impart much additional factual knowledge or computational prowess. 
- Lower layers lack arithmetic and factual knowledge but have some logical thinking and multilingual abilities, while most real-world knowledge and computation happens in upper layers.
- Peak performance in tasks like math problem solving is often a few layers before the last layer rather than the absolute final layer.

4) It designs cross-lingual math reasoning tasks to evaluate LLaMA's multilingual reasoning abilities across layers, finding lowered performance in non-English languages for deeper layers.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive analysis to elucidate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, using LLaMA as a case study, across different probing tasks and model configurations. The findings provide valuable insights into understanding current LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the use of multiple-choice questions to probe LLaMA provide advantages over assessing the model solely through its generative capabilities? What are some of the key limitations of evaluating the model generatively?

2. Why did the authors focus on higher-order tasks like mathematical reasoning and factual knowledge detection to probe LLaMA? What capabilities were they hoping to uncover through these tasks specifically?  

3. What were some of the key findings from probing LLaMA horizontally across different model sizes? For example, what did the authors discover about how computational skills, reasoning abilities and hallucination issues change with model size?

4. What hypotheses do the authors have for why the lower layers of LLaMA lack substantial factual knowledge and computational skills? How might this inform future architecture designs for large language models?  

5. The peak performance for computational tasks was often found to be in layers before the last layer. Why might this be the case? Does this align with findings in other literature?

6. For the cross-lingual math reasoning tasks, performance decreased in deeper layers. What explanations are provided for this finding? How does it contrast with the monolingual results?

7. Do the authors believe the multiple-choice probing methodology fully captures LLaMA's capabilities? What are some examples of higher-order skills that might require different evaluation approaches?  

8. How reproducible and reliable are the trends uncovered across tasks and model variations? What controls were in place to ensure consistency?

9. Can the knowledge gains from larger model sizes be attributed to the architectural changes or simply the increase in parameters? How might the authors isolate these factors?

10. The paper indicates even the 70B model lacks strong abstract reasoning skills - what benchmarks would need to be met to demonstrate stronger general intelligence capabilities? How far are we from that presently?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper aims to probe the intrinsic understanding abilities and higher-order capacities of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically the open-source LLaMA model, across different model sizes and layers. Prior work has focused more on assessing LLMs through their generative capabilities. There is a lack of research comprehensively analyzing the relationship between advanced reasoning skills in contemporary LLMs and factors like model scale and layers.

Methods: 
The authors design 5 probing tasks targeting calculation, mathematical problem solving, logical reasoning, truthfulness, and factual knowledge detection. They probe LLaMA models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters through multiple choice questions instead of open generation to enable controlled and efficient evaluation. The tasks are used to probe LLaMA's capabilities horizontally (across model sizes) and vertically (across layers of the same sized model).

Key Findings:
Horizontally, increasing model size primarily enhances reasoning skills and reduces hallucination beyond certain size thresholds, but does not impart additional factual knowledge or computational abilities. 

Vertically, lower layers lack arithmetic and factual knowledge but possess logical thinking abilities. As layers deepen, there is a leap in computational power and real-world knowledge concentrated in the top layers. Peak performance is often found in penultimate layers rather than the final layer.  

In cross-lingual mathematical reasoning tasks, performance decreases in deeper layers, indicating earlier layers retain multilingual features.

Contributions:
The paper provides novel insights into intrinsic capabilities and limitations of LLMs through fine-grained probing. Key observations include: emergent reasoning abilities and reduced hallucinations only beyond size thresholds; concentration of real-world knowledge and computational skills in top layers; consistent abstract thinking across layers; and multilingual abilities in earlier layers. Findings can guide future advances in LLM architecture and training.
