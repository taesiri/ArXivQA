# [End-User Development for Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17878)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes organizing a half-day workshop titled "End-User Development for Human-Robot Interaction (EUD4HRI)" at the 2024 International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). The motivation is that while end-user development (EUD) is an exciting and growing field within human-robot interaction, its role is still unclear and there is a need to broaden its scope, increase interdisciplinary collaborations, and discuss divergent trends. 

The paper argues that EUD for HRI has so far focused heavily on end-user programming (i.e. initial creation of programs) rather than the whole life cycle of programs. It has also relied more on traditional symbolic representations over logic rather than leveraging advances in related HRI fields like learning from demonstration, natural language communication, and personalization. Furthermore, there is currently no standard for evaluating or reporting EUD research contributions.

To address these issues, the proposed half-day workshop will bring together researchers from academia and industry working on EUD and related topics in HRI. The format will include keynote talks, author presentations, expert panels, and breakout group discussions. Topics will focus on expanding the scope of EUD, increasing interdisciplinary collaborations, assessing emerging trends, and finding consensus on key open questions. 

The target audience is EUD researchers, HRI researchers from relevant technical fields that EUD can leverage, researchers who apply EUD in their work, and industry researchers. The call for participation welcomes diverse submissions including research papers, position papers, software libraries, and proposed methodologies. The goal is to stimulate discussion to better situate EUD within the growing field of human-robot interaction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a half-day workshop at the 2024 International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction aimed at broadening the scope of end-user development within human-robot interaction, increasing interdisciplinary collaborations, and discussing divergent trends in the field.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution is organizing the first End-User Development for Human-Robot Interaction (EUD4HRI) workshop at the 2024 International Conference of Human-Robot Interaction. Specifically, the goals of the workshop are to:

1) Broaden the scope of end-user development (EUD) within human-robot interaction (HRI) and increase interdisciplinary collaborations.

2) Address divergent trends in the EUD for HRI field and work towards consensus on critical open questions. 

3) Involve a diverse set of perspectives from academia and industry to stimulate discussion and challenge the current state of EUD for HRI.

So in summary, the main contribution is organizing this inaugural workshop to expand the role of EUD in HRI and bring together various stakeholders to advance the field.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the proposed method in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that EUD for HRI has focused heavily on "design-before-use" but not as much on "design-during-use". What are some specific ways the authors could incorporate more "design-during-use" aspects into their proposed workshop format or future EUD research? 

2. How specifically will the workshop gather consensus around defining key user groups that EUD researchers should target? What methods will be used during the breakout discussions or expert panels?

3. Standardization of terminology and use cases is mentioned as a workshop focus area. What specific outcomes or consensus documents might come out of those discussions? What process will be used?

4. The paper talks about utilizing advances in learning and planning within EUD. Can you elaborate on 1-2 specific advances that could be incorporated and how the workshop will stimulate that cross-pollination?  

5. What processes and methods will be used during the workshop to foster more open source initiatives and maintenance of EUD tools emerging from research? 

6. What specific guidance or recommendations around evaluation methods and metrics for EUD contributions do the organizers hope will emerge from the panels and discussions?

7. How will the workshop address tensions between different EUD interface paradigms preferred by different researchers? What specific consensus or guidance around those interfaces could result?

8. What specific interdisciplinary research collaborations does the workshop hope to stimulate through its activities and participant mix? Can you elaborate on 1-2 examples?

9. The paper mentions longer-term HRI interactions as an area underexplored by EUD. What specific outcomes, projects, or guidance around longevity might the workshop produce? 

10. What processes will be used to record and disseminate outcomes from the variable format workshop so that non-participants can benefit from the consensus and guidance produced?
