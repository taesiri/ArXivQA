# [End-User Development for Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17878)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes organizing a half-day workshop titled "End-User Development for Human-Robot Interaction (EUD4HRI)" at the 2024 International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). The motivation is that while end-user development (EUD) is an exciting and growing field within human-robot interaction, its role is still unclear and there is a need to broaden its scope, increase interdisciplinary collaborations, and discuss divergent trends. 

The paper argues that EUD for HRI has so far focused heavily on end-user programming (i.e. initial creation of programs) rather than the whole life cycle of programs. It has also relied more on traditional symbolic representations over logic rather than leveraging advances in related HRI fields like learning from demonstration, natural language communication, and personalization. Furthermore, there is currently no standard for evaluating or reporting EUD research contributions.

To address these issues, the proposed half-day workshop will bring together researchers from academia and industry working on EUD and related topics in HRI. The format will include keynote talks, author presentations, expert panels, and breakout group discussions. Topics will focus on expanding the scope of EUD, increasing interdisciplinary collaborations, assessing emerging trends, and finding consensus on key open questions. 

The target audience is EUD researchers, HRI researchers from relevant technical fields that EUD can leverage, researchers who apply EUD in their work, and industry researchers. The call for participation welcomes diverse submissions including research papers, position papers, software libraries, and proposed methodologies. The goal is to stimulate discussion to better situate EUD within the growing field of human-robot interaction.
