# [AudioPaLM: A Large Language Model That Can Speak and Listen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12925)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we build a single large language model that can process and generate both text and speech interchangeably? The key ideas and contributions towards addressing this are:- Proposing a unified architecture called AudioPaLM that fuses text and speech modalities into a single model. This is done by extending the vocabulary of a text language model like PaLM with audio tokens that represent speech.- Showing that initializing AudioPaLM with a pretrained text language model like PaLM allows it to leverage the linguistic knowledge and text capabilities from the base model.- Demonstrating that AudioPaLM can be trained on a mixture of speech and text tasks in a multitask setting, including speech recognition, speech translation, text translation etc. - Evaluating AudioPaLM on benchmarks and showing state-of-the-art results on speech translation tasks, competitive performance on speech recognition, and features like cross-lingual voice transfer.- Analyzing the zero-shot speech translation capability of AudioPaLM, derived from the underlying text model's ability to translate.In summary, the key hypothesis is that a unified model trained on speech and text can match or exceed specialized models, while gaining flexibility and broader capabilities. The AudioPaLM architecture and experiments provide evidence towards this hypothesis.
