# [Statistically Distinct Plans for Multi-Objective Task Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07292)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies the problem of finding statistically distinct system plans when optimizing for multiple competing objectives under uncertainty in multi-robot pickup and delivery (MRPD). Specifically, the authors formulate a multi-objective optimization problem for online MRPD that considers minimizing the mean values of different cost objectives related to quality of service, human-centric metrics, etc. while also requiring the variance of the costs to be statistically significantly different. They propose an adaptive sampling algorithm to find a set of MRPD policies that (i) are approximately Pareto-optimal, (ii) well-approximate the expected Pareto front, and (iii) are statistically distinguishable in terms of the variance of their attained cost distributions. The algorithm uses an information-theoretic statistical test to guide the selection of new samples and theoretically prove completeness. Through simulations with two and three objectives, they demonstrate the approach can find better approximations of the Pareto front compared to baseline methods, showcasing its ability to provide a palette of distinct options for configuring fleet behavior. The framework is generalizable to other stochastic multi-objective problems in robotic planning.
