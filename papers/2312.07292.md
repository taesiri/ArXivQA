# [Statistically Distinct Plans for Multi-Objective Task Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07292)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of multi-objective multi-robot pickup and delivery (MO-MRPD) where a fleet of robots needs to fulfill dynamically arriving transportation requests. In practice, MRPD systems often need to optimize for multiple competing objectives such as quality of service (captured by delivery times) and operational costs. The challenge is to find a set of MRPD policies that represent different trade-offs between the objectives. This is difficult because:
1) MRPD is computationally hard, so only heuristic solutions can be obtained in practice.
2) Due to the stochastic arrival of tasks, the objectives are random variables. Thus the policies should not only differ in the expected value of objectives, but also be statistically significantly different. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors pose MO-MRPD as a multi-objective optimization problem. They convert it into a single objective problem using linear scalarization, i.e. a weighted sum of the costs. The weights balance the different objectives. The key idea is to find a set of weights, each defining an MRPD policy, such that:
1) The expected values of the resulting cost distributions approximate the Pareto-front.
2) The policies are statistically distinct according to a hypothesis test.

They propose an adaptive sampling algorithm that greedily minimizes the dispersion, i.e. the maximum distance between sampled Pareto points. It iteratively picks the next weight as the midpoint on the edge between existing weights that exhibits the largest difference in costs. Before adding a new policy, a statistical test ensures it is distinct from previous ones.

Contributions:
1) Formal problem statement for MO-MRPD considering variance 
2) Adaptive sampling algorithm with proofs of completeness
3) Example adaptation of a state-of-the-art MRPD solver to multi-objective optimization
4) Evaluation in simulations showing advantages over baseline methods

The approach is generalizable to other multi-objective problems with stochastic inputs. Overall, it enables approximating the set of optimal trade-offs using few samples, while ensuring statistical difference between solutions.
