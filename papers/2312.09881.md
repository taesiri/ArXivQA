# [Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Multi-Level Prototypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09881)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies a new challenging problem called Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning (DHFL). DHFL assumes that there is heterogeneity in data distributions across clients as well as dynamically changing distributions within each client over time. Specifically, there are two key issues:

1) Local catastrophic forgetting: As new data keeps coming to each client, the local model tends to forget previously learned representations and overfit to the new data distribution. 

2) Global concept drift: Due to heterogeneity across clients andskewed global class distributions, the aggregated global model tends to shift away from the optimal solution.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a federated learning framework called Federated Multi-Level Prototypes (FedMLP) to address the above issues in DHFL. The key ideas are:

1) Construct multi-level prototypes: Prototypes and semantic prototypes are computed locally and globally to capture correlations between sample representations. This provides rich generalization knowledge.

2) Introduce federated multi-level regularizations: Three losses are added during local model updates - prototype regularization, semantic prototype regularization, and inter-task regularization. These mitigate local forgetting, provide minority class support, and maintain stability.

Main Contributions:

1) Identifies and formulates the novel problem of Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning (DHFL).

2) Proposes a federated learning framework, FedMLP, that constructs multi-level prototypes and trains models using customized federated regularizations.

3) Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST, FEMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under various experimental settings. 

4) Ablation studies demonstrate the impact of different components of the proposed method.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a federated learning framework called Federated Multi-Level Prototypes (FedMLP) with federated multi-level regularizations to address the challenges of local catastrophic forgetting and global concept drift in the novel task of Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a novel and practical problem setting called Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning (DHFL), which assumes heterogeneous data distributions across clients as well as dynamic tasks within each client over time.

2. It proposes a new federated learning framework called Federated Multi-Level Prototypes (FedMLP) to address the key challenges in DHFL, namely local catastrophic forgetting and global concept drift. 

3. It develops a set of federated multi-level regularizations as part of the FedMLP framework, including prototype-based regularization, semantic prototype-based regularization, and federated inter-task regularization. These regularizations help maintain model stability and consistency during federated learning.

4. It conducts extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, showing state-of-the-art performance of the proposed FedMLP method compared to previous federated learning techniques. The results demonstrate FedMLP's ability to train robust and generalizable federated models while preserving privacy and reducing communication costs.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the FedMLP framework and associated techniques to enable effective federated learning under heterogeneous and dynamic data distributions across clients.

 Based on my review of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with it:

- Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning (DHFL) - The novel task introduced in the paper that assumes heterogeneous data distributions among clients and dynamic tasks within clients.

- Local catastrophic forgetting - One of the key issues in DHFL where local models forget previously learned information due to inconsistent class distributions across tasks. 

- Global concept drift - The other key issue in DHFL where the aggregated global model shifts due to differences in class distributions across clients.

- Federated Multi-Level Prototypes (FedMLP) - The proposed framework that utilizes prototypes and semantic prototypes to provide generalization knowledge.

- Prototype-based regularization - One of the federated multi-level regularizations used to maintain consistency of the global prototype space.

- Semantic prototype-based regularization - Another federated regularization that provides supplementary generalization information using semantic prototypes.

- Federated inter-task regularization - The regularization used to mitigate local catastrophic forgetting by ensuring continuity between tasks.

So in summary, the key terms cover the problem formulation, issues tackled, proposed methods, and regularization techniques in the paper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
