# [Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Multi-Level Prototypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09881)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies a new challenging problem called Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning (DHFL). DHFL assumes that there is heterogeneity in data distributions across clients as well as dynamically changing distributions within each client over time. Specifically, there are two key issues:

1) Local catastrophic forgetting: As new data keeps coming to each client, the local model tends to forget previously learned representations and overfit to the new data distribution. 

2) Global concept drift: Due to heterogeneity across clients andskewed global class distributions, the aggregated global model tends to shift away from the optimal solution.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a federated learning framework called Federated Multi-Level Prototypes (FedMLP) to address the above issues in DHFL. The key ideas are:

1) Construct multi-level prototypes: Prototypes and semantic prototypes are computed locally and globally to capture correlations between sample representations. This provides rich generalization knowledge.

2) Introduce federated multi-level regularizations: Three losses are added during local model updates - prototype regularization, semantic prototype regularization, and inter-task regularization. These mitigate local forgetting, provide minority class support, and maintain stability.

Main Contributions:

1) Identifies and formulates the novel problem of Dynamic Heterogeneous Federated Learning (DHFL).

2) Proposes a federated learning framework, FedMLP, that constructs multi-level prototypes and trains models using customized federated regularizations.

3) Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST, FEMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under various experimental settings. 

4) Ablation studies demonstrate the impact of different components of the proposed method.
