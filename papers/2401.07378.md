## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is an important measure of similarity between probability distributions, with applications in computer vision and other domains. 
- However, computing exact EMD relies on computationally intensive linear programming methods, hindering its scalability and applicability to large-scale problems.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes NNS-EMD, a novel approximate EMD algorithm based on nearest neighbor search (NNS). 
- Instead of exhaustively comparing all point pairs like exact EMD, NNS-EMD focuses only on nearest neighbors. This significantly reduces computations.
- NNS preserves local structures well and offers opportunities for parallelization.

Key Contributions:
- Theoretical analysis providing error bounds between NNS-EMD and exact EMD, as well as time complexity.
- Highly parallel GPU implementation of NNS-EMD using both data and batch parallelism.
- Comprehensive evaluation showing NNS-EMD achieves up to 135x speedup over exact EMD with only minor accuracy loss of 1-5\%.
- Comparison to other state-of-the-art approximate EMD methods on tasks like image classification, retrieval and color transfer. NNS-EMD demonstrates best overall accuracy and efficiency.
- Exploration of design choices like distance metrics and protocols for handling multiple neighbors. $L_2$ distance and a greedy allocation protocol deliver high accuracy.  

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in developing an efficient yet accurate approximate EMD algorithm using intuitions from NNS, with thorough theoretical and empirical validation of its advantages. The GPU-accelerated NNS-EMD method clearly advances the state-of-the-art in practical EMD computation.
