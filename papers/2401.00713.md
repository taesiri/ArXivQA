## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the applications of graph neural networks (GNNs) in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). ITS encompasses various areas related to transportation, including traffic forecasting, autonomous vehicles, traffic signal control, transportation safety, demand prediction and parking management. 

The paper first gives necessary background on ITS and its different research domains. It then provides fundamentals on graphs, graph data, and graph neural networks. After laying the groundwork, the paper conducts an in-depth investigation of research works from 2018-2023 that apply GNNs to tackle problems across the six ITS domains mentioned above. 

For each ITS domain, the paper summarizes the key ideas, methodologies, innovations and contributions of the most relevant GNN-based studies. It carefully examines the graph construction techniques used, the spatial and temporal modules employed, and how domain-specific challenges are addressed. These findings are presented through informative tables and lists that compare different approaches.

The paper makes three main contributions:
(1) It provides a comprehensive review of GNN applications in ITS, covering more areas beyond just traffic forecasting. 
(2) It offers a useful taxonomy to categorize the surveyed literature based on criteria like research field, graph methods utilized and challenges faced. This multidimensional perspective helps readers thoroughly understand the state-of-the-art.
(3) It identifies significant open challenges when applying GNNs to ITS, such as issues with data, model design, computation, robustness and interpretability. It also suggests potential future directions in this domain.

Overall, this paper delivers an extensive investigation into the intersection of GNNs and ITS. By reviewing recent progress and laying out remaining challenges, it paves the way for further research and development of GNNs in transportation systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper categorizes graph neural networks into several types like convolutional-based GNNs and spatial-temporal GNNs. Can you elaborate on the key differences between these categories and how they capture spatial and temporal dependencies differently?

2. The paper discusses various techniques like attention mechanisms and graph transformers for enhancing GNN performance. Can you explain how attention allows models to focus on the most salient features in graph data? And what benefits do graph transformers provide over standard transformers?

3. In the traffic forecasting section, models like AGCRN, HGC-RNN, and STSGCN are discussed. Can you contrast how these different models combine RNNs and GNNs to model spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data? What are their relative strengths and weaknesses?  

4. For autonomous vehicles, the paper talks about methods like Point Transformer, CurveNet and DeltaConv. Can you explain the core ideas behind these methods and how they advance point cloud processing and understanding?

5. How exactly does the risk of zero-inflation arise in transportation safety tasks? And what solutions like loss function handling and data augmentation are proposed to address this?

6. In traffic signal control, approaches like GraphLight, STMARL and CoLight are mentioned. Can you elaborate on how reinforcement learning and attention are combined with GNNs in these models? And how do they capture intersection dependencies?

7. For parking management, what specific challenges exist compared to other ITS domains? And how do models like dConvLSTM-DCN and SHARE address issues like spatial-temporal autocorrelations?  

8. Can you expand more on why traditional zone-based demand prediction is suboptimal? And how do proposals like DMVST-VGNN and DSTGNN improve on this through flexible graph generation?

9. The paper identifies challenges like robustness, scalability and modeling dynamic dependencies. In your view, what open problems still exist in effectively applying GNNs for real-world ITS systems?

10. Can you suggest some new and underexplored ways in which GNNs can be integrated with other techniques like transfer learning, GANs and Bayesian networks to tackle unique issues in ITS domains?
