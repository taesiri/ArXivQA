# [A Survey on Graph Neural Networks in Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00713)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the applications of graph neural networks (GNNs) in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). ITS encompasses various areas related to transportation, including traffic forecasting, autonomous vehicles, traffic signal control, transportation safety, demand prediction and parking management. 

The paper first gives necessary background on ITS and its different research domains. It then provides fundamentals on graphs, graph data, and graph neural networks. After laying the groundwork, the paper conducts an in-depth investigation of research works from 2018-2023 that apply GNNs to tackle problems across the six ITS domains mentioned above. 

For each ITS domain, the paper summarizes the key ideas, methodologies, innovations and contributions of the most relevant GNN-based studies. It carefully examines the graph construction techniques used, the spatial and temporal modules employed, and how domain-specific challenges are addressed. These findings are presented through informative tables and lists that compare different approaches.

The paper makes three main contributions:
(1) It provides a comprehensive review of GNN applications in ITS, covering more areas beyond just traffic forecasting. 
(2) It offers a useful taxonomy to categorize the surveyed literature based on criteria like research field, graph methods utilized and challenges faced. This multidimensional perspective helps readers thoroughly understand the state-of-the-art.
(3) It identifies significant open challenges when applying GNNs to ITS, such as issues with data, model design, computation, robustness and interpretability. It also suggests potential future directions in this domain.

Overall, this paper delivers an extensive investigation into the intersection of GNNs and ITS. By reviewing recent progress and laying out remaining challenges, it paves the way for further research and development of GNNs in transportation systems.
