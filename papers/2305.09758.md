# [A Video Is Worth 4096 Tokens: Verbalize Story Videos To Understand Them   In Zero Shot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09758)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs) to improve video understanding, given the lack of large annotated training datasets for complex story videos?The key hypothesis appears to be:By verbalizing complex story videos into coherent natural language descriptions, we can take advantage of the powerful reasoning and zero-shot capabilities of LLMs to perform video understanding tasks directly on the generated text, without requiring large amounts of video training data.In particular, the paper proposes:1) A framework to convert long, multimodal videos into textual "stories" by extracting and combining modalities like speech, text, visual frames using a LLM. 2) Using these generated stories to perform video understanding tasks in a zero-shot manner by formulating the tasks as natural language prompts.3) Demonstrating that this approach outperforms video-based supervised baselines on tasks like topic classification, emotion recognition, and persuasion strategy identification for story videos.4) Releasing a new dataset for studying persuasion strategies in video ads.So in summary, the core hypothesis is that representing videos as text stories can allow LLMs to reason about them effectively without large labeled video datasets. The paper aims to validate this via experiments on several video understanding benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a method to convert long videos containing multiple modalities (text, audio, visuals) into coherent textual stories by verbalizing keyframes, audio, and text overlays using large language models (LLMs). 2. Demonstrating the utility of the generated stories for video understanding by conducting experiments on several benchmark datasets across 5 tasks - topic classification, emotion classification, persuasion strategy identification, action retrieval, and reason retrieval/generation. The results show the proposed method achieves better performance than supervised baselines despite being zero-shot.3. Releasing the first dataset for studying persuasion strategies in video advertisements to enable research on understanding messaging strategies in ads.4. Through extensive experiments and analysis, showing that crystallizing the knowledge from various video modalities into a textual story using LLMs leads to better video understanding compared to using just the raw modalities.In summary, the main contribution is a novel video understanding framework that verbalizes multimodal videos into textual stories using LLMs, and then performs complex video understanding tasks on the generated stories in a zero-shot manner, outperforming supervised baselines and alleviating the need for large labeled datasets. The paper also contributes a new dataset and benchmark for an important but less studied problem of understanding persuasion strategies in video ads.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper proposes verbalizing videos into coherent stories using large language models, and then performing video understanding tasks on the generated stories instead of the original videos, achieving strong results without any dataset-specific finetuning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of video and story understanding:- The key novel contribution of this paper is using large language models (LLMs) to verbalize videos into coherent stories, and then performing video understanding tasks on the generated stories instead of the original videos. This is a unique approach compared to most prior work that focuses on understanding videos directly using computer vision techniques. - The idea of verbalizing videos into stories/descriptions has been explored before in video captioning and visual storytelling research. However, this paper takes it a step further by showing the utility of the generated stories for downstream video understanding tasks. Rather than just describing video content, the stories are used as a proxy for the videos to enable complex reasoning.- For video understanding, most prior work relies on supervised training of deep neural networks on large labeled video datasets. This paper shows strong performance on multiple tasks using a zero-shot approach without any video-level supervision. This demonstrates the power of leveraging pre-trained LLMs.- The paper evaluates on a diverse set of video understanding tasks including topic classification, emotion recognition, action/reason analysis, and persuasion strategy identification. Many prior papers focus on only one or two tasks. The results across multiple tasks really highlight the versatility of the proposed verbalization approach.- Releasing a new dataset for persuasion strategy identification in ads is a valuable contribution, given the lack of resources to study messaging techniques in video ads. This can enable further research on this important but understudied problem.- Compared to state-of-the-art video pre-training models like VideoMAE, the verbalization approach seems to achieve better generalization and transfer learning, despite not seeing any video-level labels. This challenges the notion that large-scale video pre-training is necessary for video understanding.In summary, the proposed verbalization framework, zero-shot modeling approach, and new dataset make this paper a uniquely comprehensive contribution to the field of video and story understanding. The results convincingly demonstrate the power of leveraging language models for multimodal reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:1. Improving video story generation: The authors note that there is room for improvement in generating more detailed and human-like stories from videos. They suggest exploring techniques like iterative refinement to improve coherence, use of commonsense knowledge, and controlling the level of abstraction in the generated stories.2. Leveraging other modalities: The current approach focuses mainly on visual and textual modalities. The authors suggest incorporating other modalities like audio, speech, etc. to generate richer descriptions of events, actions, environments, etc.3. Evaluating on more complex tasks: The authors evaluate on tasks like classification and retrieval, and suggest evaluating on more complex video QA and summarization tasks in future work.4. Evaluating on longer videos: The videos used for evaluation are relatively short advertisements and movie clips. Testing the approach on longer videos like documentaries and user generated content is suggested.5. Real-world applications: The authors suggest exploring real-world video understanding applications like analyzing tutorials, sports videos, video lectures, etc. using the proposed video-to-text approach.6. Studying messaging strategies: Since advertisements aim to persuade people, the authors suggest conducting behavioral studies to understand the impact of different messaging strategies.7. Detecting harmful content: The verbalized video representations could potentially enable detecting harmful brand messaging in advertisements.In summary, the main future directions are improving video story generation, incorporating more modalities, evaluating on more complex and longer videos, exploring real-world applications, and conducting behavioral studies on persuasion strategies and harmful content detection.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a framework to generate stories from videos and perform video understanding tasks on the generated stories instead of the original videos. First, they extract keyframes, audio transcripts, text, and metadata from the video. This information is used to prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate a coherent story capturing the video's narrative. They experiment on benchmark datasets for video storytelling, topic classification, emotion recognition, persuasion strategy identification, and action-reason retrieval/generation. Their method achieves state-of-the-art results on video storytelling. For video understanding tasks, their zero-shot framework outperforms supervised baselines without using any annotated examples. They show converting videos to textual stories enables leveraging recent LLM advancements for complex video understanding. Additionally, they release the first dataset on identifying persuasion strategies in ads to enable research on this important problem. Overall, the paper demonstrates representing videos as stories generated via LLMs is an effective approach to video understanding without reliance on large labeled datasets.
