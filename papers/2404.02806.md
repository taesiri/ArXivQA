# [The RealHumanEval: Evaluating Large Language Models' Abilities to   Support Programmers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for code has primarily relied on static benchmarks like HumanEval which measure the ability of LLMs to generate complete code that passes unit tests. As LLMs are increasingly used to assist programmers, it is important to study whether gains on existing benchmarks translate to gains in programmer productivity when coding with LLMs. The paper investigates the utility of preference metrics like code acceptance rates as proxies for measuring LLM helpfulness.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces RealHumanEval, a web interface to measure the ability of LLMs to assist programmers through autocomplete or chat. A user study was conducted where 213 users interacted with 6 LLMs of varying performance. Users solved coding tasks either with no LLM, autocomplete from CodeLlama or GPT models, or chat with the corresponding chatty variants of those models. RealHumanEval logged detailed interaction telemetry to quantify productivity metrics like time taken and tasks completed. It also captured proxy metrics like autocomplete acceptance rates and chat code copy rates.  

Key Contributions:
1) Despite benchmarks not incorporating humans, benchmark performance gains lead to productivity gains when coding with LLM assistance. However, additional benchmark gains do not necessarily translate to equivalent productivity gains.

2) Proxy metrics like acceptance rates correlate with user perceptions of helpfulness but not actual productivity. This shows the need for careful evaluation when using proxy metrics.  

3) The study data and open-sourced RealHumanEval platform can facilitate more human-centric evaluations of code LLMs to advance them as better programming partners.

In summary, the paper demonstrates using RealHumanEval that while static benchmarks provide some signal regarding downstream utility of code LLMs, more nuanced human-centric evaluations are critical to truly understand the productiveness of programmer-LLM interactions.
