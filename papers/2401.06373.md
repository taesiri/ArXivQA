# [How Johnny Can Persuade LLMs to Jailbreak Them: Rethinking Persuasion to   Challenge AI Safety by Humanizing LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06373)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a taxonomy of persuasion techniques grounded in decades of social science research. This taxonomy helps bridge the gap between social science and AI safety research.

2. It introduces a method to automatically generate persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs by leveraging the proposed taxonomy. 

3. It conducts comprehensive jailbreak experiments using PAPs. The results show PAPs can effectively jailbreak major LLMs like Llama-2, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with over 92% attack success rate, outperforming previous attacks.

4. It analyzes the effectiveness of existing defense methods against PAPs and finds a significant gap - many defenses fail to address risks from subtle human communication.

5. It proposes and tests adaptive defenses tailored to mitigate risks from PAPs. The defenses are shown to be effective for not only PAPs but also other attacks, suggesting the need to study links between persuasion and jailbreaking in future research.

In summary, the paper introduces a new perspective to treat LLMs as human-like communicators and systematically studies the overlooked risks elicited through everyday persuasion techniques. The findings underscore the need to expand threat models and develop more fundamental solutions to ensure AI safety.

The paper introduces a taxonomy of persuasion techniques drawn from social science literature and uses it to automatically generate persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) to jailbreak large language models. It studies the risks posed by such everyday human-like persuasive communication compared to traditional algorithmic attacks, proposes methods to generate PAP at scale, evaluates their attack performance, analyzes gaps in current defenses, and explores adaptive defense strategies. The key terms cover the core conceptual contributions around persuasion, adversarial risks, and AI safety centered in this paper.
