# [Consistent Query Answering for Expressive Constraints under   Tuple-Deletion Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies consistent query answering (CQA) in relational databases in the presence of integrity constraints called disjunctive embedded dependencies with inequalities (DEDs). 
- DEDs generalize tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs), equality-generating dependencies (EGDs) and universal constraints.
- The paper focuses on CQA under tuple-deletion repair semantics, where repairs correspond to maximal subsets of the database that satisfy the constraints.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper studies four decision problems related to CQA under tuple-deletion semantics: 
   (1) repair checking 
   (2) skeptical query entailment (does a query evaluate to true in every repair?)
   (3) intersection-repair query entailment (does a query evaluate to true in the intersection of all repairs?)
   (4) weak consistency (can a subset of the database be extended to a repair?)
- These problems are studied for DEDs and subclasses obtained by restricting to linear, acyclic and forward-deterministic DEDs.

Main Contributions:
- Establishes data complexity bounds for the four decision problems above across different classes of DEDs
- Identifies new subclasses of DEDs where these problems are tractable or even first-order rewritable
- Introduces forward-deterministic DEDs, shows they enjoy same complexity as full TGDs
- Shows that for all cases except skeptical query entailment, combining acyclicity and forward determinism leads to FO rewritability
- Provides FO rewriting techniques for weak consistency checking and query answering for acyclic forward-deterministic DEDs

In summary, the paper significantly advances the understanding of CQA for expressive integrity constraints, identifying tractable cases and providing FO rewriting techniques. The techniques could enable developing practical CQA systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper studies the complexity of consistent query answering and related decision problems under tuple-deletion repair semantics for an expressive class of database dependencies, identifying new tractable fragments and first-order rewritable cases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It studies consistent query answering (CQA) in the context of a very expressive class of schema constraints called disjunctive embedded dependencies with inequalities (DEDs). This constraint language captures and generalizes previous languages like tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs) and equality-generating dependencies (EGDs).

2) It establishes the data complexity of several key reasoning tasks related to CQA under tuple-deletion semantics for DEDs and important subclasses like linear, acyclic, and forward-deterministic DEDs. Specifically, it studies problems like repair checking, query entailment, intersection-repair entailment, and weak consistency.

3) It identifies new subclasses of DEDs like forward-deterministic and combinations of linear, acyclic, and forward-deterministic DEDs where the studied reasoning tasks become tractable or even first-order rewritable. 

4) Compared to prior work, the results show that moving to expressive DEDs and unions of conjunctive queries with inequalities does not increase the data complexity of CQA. Rather, new tractable cases are identified.

In summary, the paper significantly advances the study of CQA by considering more expressive constraints and queries while also revealing new tractable fragments. The results should be useful both theoretically and towards developing practical CQA techniques.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Consistent query answering (CQA)
- Database repairs
- Tuple-deletion semantics
- Tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs)
- Equality-generating dependencies (EGDs)  
- Disjunctive embedded dependencies with inequalities (DEDs)
- Repair checking
- Query entailment
- Weak consistency
- Linear dependencies
- Acyclic dependencies
- Forward-deterministic (FDET) dependencies

The paper studies consistent query answering in the context of an expressive class of database constraints called disjunctive embedded dependencies with inequalities. It establishes complexity results for problems like repair checking, query entailment, and weak consistency under different semantics and for different subclasses of DEDs defined based on properties like linearity, acyclicity and forward-determinism. The key focus is on data complexity analysis. So these are the main technical concepts and terms that seem most relevant to categorize this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new class of dependencies called "forward deterministic" (FDET) dependencies. How is this class defined? How does it generalize previous classes of dependencies like full dependencies? What are some key properties of FDET dependencies?

2. The paper studies the complexity of consistent query answering (CQA) for different classes of dependencies, including combinations of acyclic, linear, and FDET dependencies. What is the complexity of CQA for FDET dependencies alone? How does this compare to previous results for other classes of dependencies?

3. The paper shows that repair checking is in AC0 for acyclic dependencies. Can you explain the first-order rewriting technique used to prove this result? What are the key insights that enable getting AC0 complexity here?  

4. For acyclic FDET dependencies, the paper gives an algorithm called Acyclic-FDET-IRS-CQEnt for intersection-repair entailment of queries. Can you walk through how this algorithm works and why it is correct? 

5. What is the weakness consistency problem studied in the paper? Why is it an important problem to consider in the context of CQA? How does the complexity of weakness consistency translate to complexity results for other CQA problems?

6. Can you explain the forward closure construction used in the paper for FDET dependencies? What properties does it satisfy and how is it used in algorithms/proofs?

7. Compare the complexity results for skeptically entailed queries under the AR and IR semantics. When do they differ and why? When are they the same?

8. The paper identifies a query entailment problem called "intersection-repair entailment". How does this semantics differ from the typical AR semantics? When can IR entailment be decided tractably?

9. For acyclic linear dependencies, the paper gives a first-order rewriting for deciding query entailment. Can you explain how this rewriting works at a high level? What about the general strategy could be applied to other classes of dependencies?

10. The paper studies combinations of acyclic, linear, and FDET dependencies. What new insights does considering interactions between properties like acyclicity and FDET-ness yield in terms of CQA complexity?
