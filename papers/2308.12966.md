# Qwen-VL: A Frontier Large Vision-Language Model with Versatile Abilities

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:How can we develop a large-scale vision-language model that achieves strong performance across a diverse range of multimodal tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, visual grounding, and multilingual abilities? The key hypotheses tested seem to be:1) By initializing with a powerful pre-trained language model (Qwen-7B) and visual encoder (OpenCLIP ViT-bigG), then doing multi-stage pre-training on large multimodal datasets, we can develop a model (Qwen-VL) with strong general abilities for multimodal tasks.2) By doing further supervised fine-tuning using instruction datasets, we can enhance the model's (Qwen-VL-Chat) capabilities for interactive tasks like open-ended dialogue and localization. 3) Using model architectures tailored for efficiency and multi-image inputs can enable flexible conversational abilities like multi-image chat.4) Pre-training the model on multilingual and OCR data can impart cross-lingual and fine-grained visual understanding abilities.In summary, the core research question is how to develop a general large-scale vision-language model with strong performance across diverse multimodal tasks, by leveraging scale, model architecture, and multi-stage pre-training. The paper seems to hypothesize these techniques can produce a model with versatile vision-language abilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Introducing the Qwen-VL series, a set of large-scale vision-language models with two versions - Qwen-VL and Qwen-VL-Chat. 2. Qwen-VL model architecture incorporates a visual encoder, language model, and position-aware vision-language adapter. It is pre-trained on a large corpus of image-text data and fine-tuned for instruction following.3. Qwen-VL demonstrates strong performance on a wide range of vision-language tasks like image captioning, VQA, text-VQA, refer expression comprehension and instruction following. It outperforms prior generalist models.4. Qwen-VL-Chat supports flexible interactions like multi-image interleaved dialog, localization abilities and multilingual conversation.5. The models, training details and benchmarks are open-sourced to facilitate research in large multimodal models.In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and benchmarking of Qwen-VL, a series of large-scale multimodal models with strong vision-language capabilities and flexible interaction support. The open-sourcing aims to advance research in this emerging field.
