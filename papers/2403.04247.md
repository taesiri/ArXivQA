# [UltraWiki: Ultra-fine-grained Entity Set Expansion with Negative Seed   Entities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04247)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional entity set expansion (ESE) methods rely solely on positive seed entities to represent a target semantic class. This poses challenges for representing ultra-fine-grained semantic classes which have significant entity overlap. Using positive seeds alone causes issues with (1) ambiguity between classes, and (2) inability to define "unwanted" semantics.

- Existing ESE datasets lack the concept of negative seed entities and ultra-fine-grained classes. 

Solution:
- Introduce negative seed entities in the inputs, which belong to the same fine-grained class as the positives but differ in certain attributes. This eliminates ambiguity and allows defining "unwanted" semantics.

- Construct UltraWiki, the first large-scale ESE dataset with 50k entities and 394k sentences covering 236 ultra-fine-grained classes. Each class uses 3-5 positive and 3-5 negative seeds.

- Propose retrieval-based framework RetExpan using BERT and generation-based framework GenExpan using LLaMA to assess large language models on ultra-fine-grained ESE.

- Devise 3 strategies to enhance models' comprehension: contrastive learning, retrieval augmentation, and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Contributions:
- Formalized more challenging problem of ultra-fine-grained ESE and introduced concept of negative seed entities

- Constructed first dedicated dataset UltraWiki with 261 ultra-fine-grained classes  

- Designed retrieval and generation frameworks to benchmark large language models

- Proposed multiple techniques to improve model understanding of ultra-fine semantics  

- Experiments show effectiveness of techniques and significant potential for better comprehension of ultra-fine-grained entities
