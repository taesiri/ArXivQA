# [Are Large Language Models Good Fact Checkers: A Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17355)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated fact-checking. The authors systematically test the performance of LLMs like GPT-3.5, GLM, and LLaMa on the various subtasks of fact-checking, including check-worthiness detection, evidence retrieval, fact verification, and explanation generation. They design suitable prompts to frame each subtask as a question for the LLM to answer. The results show that while LLMs can perform these tasks to some extent with the right prompting, there is still a significant gap compared to state-of-the-art specialized models. Challenges highlighted include handling Chinese language data, hallucinations in evidence retrieved by the LLM's knowledge, and difficulty analyzing the full fact-checking pipeline. The authors conclude that more research is needed to improve LLMs as reliable fact-checkers, but they demonstrate the potential capability of LLMs on this complex language reasoning task. Key future work includes mitigating factual hallucinations and better adapting LLMs to non-English languages. Overall, this is a valuable benchmark study of LLMs on automated fact-checking.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a preliminary investigation into the potential of large language models for fact-checking, systematically evaluating their capabilities across specific subtasks like check-worthiness detection, evidence retrieval, fact verification, and explanation generation, and comparing their performance against pre-trained and state-of-the-art low-parameter models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a systematic evaluation of the performance of large language models (LLMs) on fact-checking tasks. Specifically:

- The paper investigates whether LLMs can perform well on fact-checking subtasks like check-worthiness detection, evidence retrieval, fact verification, and explanation generation in 0-shot, few-shot, and zero-shot settings. 

- It analyzes the impact of different prompts and prompt enhancement techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and task definitions on the performance of LLMs.

- The paper evaluates LLMs on both English and Chinese fact checking datasets to test their cross-lingual capability.

- It examines whether LLMs can solve the entire fact-checking pipeline simultaneously, acting as both a reasoning model and knowledge base for evidence retrieval.

- The experiments benchmark the capabilities of LLMs as fact checkers, compare them to state-of-the-art models, and reveal challenges like hallucination that need to be addressed to make LLMs reliable for fact checking.

In summary, the key contribution is a thorough evaluation of LLMs for fact checking that provides performance benchmarks, revealing both the potential and current limitations of LLMs as automated fact checkers. The paper discusses future research directions to build on the strengths of LLMs for this task.
