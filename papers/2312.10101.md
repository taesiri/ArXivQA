# [A Review of Repository Level Prompting for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10101)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- As coding tasks become more complex, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automated code generation on isolated problems. However, performance drops significantly on real-world repository-level tasks which require understanding context and dependencies.  

- Two methods have been proposed to address this - Repository-Level Prompt Generation which optimizes prompts, and RepoCoder which uses iterative retrieval and generation. This paper reviews these methods, their trade-offs and best practices.

Repository-Level Prompt Generation
- Compiles code prompts from relevant segments in the repository to provide context for the LLM (Codex). Evaluates prompts based on if they lead to successful code generation.

- Models prompt choices as a vector and defines a loss function to classify useful prompts. Uses this to train models RLPG-H and RLPG-R to select optimal prompts.

- Retrieves prompts from current, parent, child, imported and sibling files and classes to provide relevant context.

RepoCoder
- Uses BM25 retrieval on code before and after the gap to find relevant snippets. Iteratively regenerates code using previous output as query.

- Repository contexts include names of imported modules and identifiers in code around the gap. Fuzzy matching further expands the context.

Results
- Both methods show significant gains over baseline Codex, with over 25% reduction in edit distance and 35% boost in success rate.

- RepoCoder achieves 44.6% success on repository test cases, much higher than in-file retrieval. RLPG-H gives best performance on prompt selection.

- Analysis shows parent, sibling and child classes provide highly useful context for generation.

Recommendations
- Combine iterative prompt refinement from RepoCoder with optimized prompt selection from RLPG for best results.

- Integrate these methods into more complex benchmarks like SWE-Bench to solve limitations of current retrieval techniques.

- Look towards agent-based LLMs as inference times fall, to further advance state-of-the-art.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides an in-depth analysis and comparison of two innovative approaches for prompting large language models to generate contextually relevant code completions at the repository level: Repository-Level Prompt Generation, which uses a neural network to classify effective prompts, and RepoCoder, an iterative retrieval and generation technique.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a thorough review and analysis of two innovative approaches for improving Large Language Model (LLM) performance in generating code completions at the repository level:

1) Repository-Level Prompt Generation: This method uses a classifier model to evaluate and select the most effective prompts for an LLM to generate missing code in a repository. It provides a more direct way to identify useful prompts compared to sparse retrieval techniques.

2) RepoCoder: This is an iterative retrieval and generation technique that progressively refines the context provided to an LLM to produce better code completions. It focuses on optimizing the prompt refinement process. 

The paper provides an in-depth comparison of these two methods, analyzing their respective strengths, weaknesses and trade-offs. It demonstrates the potential for combining these strategies to address limitations of current techniques and significantly enhance LLM performance on software engineering tasks.

Additionally, the paper charts a course for future work by proposing the integration of these methods into more complex systems and environments (like the Software Engineering Bench benchmark) as well as exploring agent-based LLM usage as inference times decrease.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive analysis of cutting-edge techniques for repository-level prompting of LLMs to generate contextually relevant code, providing essential insights to guide further research and development of automated coding assistants.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts covered include:

- Repository-level code generation - Generating code completions at the scale of entire software repositories rather than just individual problems.

- Prompt engineering - Crafting effective prompts to provide optimal context and guide the language model's code generation process.  

- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) - Leveraging existing code from a repository as a knowledge base to produce more accurate and contextually relevant code completions.

- Iterative refinement - Progressively improving the prompts and retrieved context over multiple rounds to incrementally boost language model performance on code generation.

- Repository-Level Prompt Generation - A specific technique that uses a classifier model to evaluate and select the most effective prompts for code completion from a repository.

- RepoCoder - Another approach based on iterative retrieval and generation to continuously refine the context provided to the language model. 

- Software Engineering Bench (SWE-Bench) - A complex, real-world benchmark for evaluating language models on solving GitHub issues by generating missing code.

- Agent-based LLMs - Using reinforcement learning and search techniques to guide the language model through the problem space.

The core focus is on strategies to provide better context from repositories to enhance the language model's ability to produce relevant, syntactically and functionally correct code completions. The integration of prompt engineering, retrieval, iteration, and agent-based methods represents promising directions for future work.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. How does the iterative retrieval and generation process used in RepoCoder allow for incremental improvements in code generation versus a one-step retrieval and generation approach? What are the tradeoffs?

2. What are the key differences in how Repository Level Prompt Generation and RepoCoder perform retrieval for code generation? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach? 

3. The paper suggests combining aspects of RepoCoder and Repository Level Prompt Generation. What would an optimal integration look like? What components of each method should be used and why?

4. How could the prompt classification model from Repository Level Prompt Generation be adapted to work iteratively like in RepoCoder? What changes would need to be made?

5. The paper mentions using BM25 for retrieval in Repository Level Prompt Generation underperforms. Why might this be? How could a different retrieval method improve performance?

6. What kinds of repositories or coding tasks might be better suited for RepoCoder versus Repository Level Prompt Generation? Explain why.

7. How robust are the test benchmarks used in RepoCoder for evaluating code generation quality? What limitations do they have and how could they be improved? 

8. What are the key challenges in scaling up repository-level prompting techniques to even more complex software engineering tasks as mentioned?

9. Both papers use optimal "oracle" retrieval systems as comparison points. What are limitations of these oracle systems? Could better oracles be designed?

10. The paper suggests combining agent-based LLM usage with iterative prompting and retrieval. What are the main technical barriers to realizing this currently? How might progress in areas like inference speed help enable it?
