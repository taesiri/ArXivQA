## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents the first experimental demonstration of a continuous-variable thermodynamic computer for AI applications, implemented as an 8-unit cell printed circuit board called the Stochastic Processing Unit (SPU). The SPU leverages the natural stochastic dynamics of capacitively coupled RLC circuits with added noise to perform useful computations. Specifically, by appropriately tuning circuit parameters like inductances and capacitances, the SPU can sample from multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions or invert matrices, which are key primitives in probabilistic AI. The authors experimentally validate Gaussian sampling and matrix inversion up to 8 dimensions on their prototype. They further demonstrate the applicability to AI by implementing Gaussian process regression and neural network uncertainty quantification on the SPU. Extrapolating the SPU's performance, the authors argue its potential for orders of magnitude speedup and energy savings compared to GPUs for high-dimensional sampling and linear algebra. The experimental SPU represents an important proof-of-concept for physics-based AI acceleration and thermodynamic computing.
