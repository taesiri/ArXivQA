# [Visual Inertial Odometry using Focal Plane Binary Features (BIT-VIO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09882)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Visual odometry (VO) systems that use conventional cameras suffer from high latency, high power consumption, and inability to perform computations on the image sensor itself. 
- Focal Plane Sensor-Processor Arrays (FPSPs) like SCAMP-5 can perform vision computations on the sensor at low power, but prior FPSP-based VO methods like BIT-VO produce trajectories with high-frequency noise.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents BIT-VIO, the first visual inertial odometry method using an FPSP (SCAMP-5) fused with an IMU.
- It uses an iterated Extended Kalman filter (iEKF) to fuse 300 FPS VO estimates from SCAMP-5 with 400 Hz IMU predictions.
- BIT-VO corner/edge detection happens on SCAMP-5, while pose optimization happens on a host laptop. 
- Uncertainty propagation is done for BIT-VO's pose based on its binary edge-based matching and reprojection error.
- The iEKF corrects for IMU drift and filters out BIT-VO's high-freq noise.

Main Contributions:
- First FPSP-based VIO system, fused using iEKF at high FPS
- Uncertainty propagation for BIT-VO's binary feature-based pose
- Demonstrated accuracy improvements over BIT-VO, with much smoother and drift-free trajectories
- Robust performance under fast, agile motions due to FPSP's low latency

The method was evaluated on real-world trajectories against a motion capture system. BIT-VIO outperformed BIT-VO in trajectory accuracy while eliminating high-frequency noise. The fusion provides robust and low latency performance not possible with conventional cameras.
