# [UPOCR: Towards Unified Pixel-Level OCR Interface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02694)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes UPOCR, a unified pixel-level optical character recognition (OCR) interface that can simultaneously perform multiple pixel-level OCR tasks such as text removal, text segmentation, and tampered text detection. The key idea is to unify the paradigm, architecture, and training strategy across different OCR tasks. Specifically, UPOCR unifies the paradigm as RGB image to RGB image translation, employs a vision Transformer (ViT) based encoder-decoder architecture with learnable task prompts that guide the model to adapt to different tasks, and optimizes the model by minimizing discrepancies between predicted and ground truth images. Without any specialized components for individual tasks, UPOCR with shared parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three tasks, significantly outperforming existing specialized models. Comprehensive experiments and analyses verify UPOCR's effectiveness and provide insights into developing generalist OCR models. The simple yet unified design of UPOCR and its strong performance across multiple pixel-level OCR tasks make it an important step towards unified OCR interfaces.
