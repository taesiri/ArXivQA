# [LaCour!: Enabling Research on Argumentation in Hearings of the European   Court of Human Rights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05061)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces LaCour!, the first corpus of multi-lingual oral arguments from hearings at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The corpus consists of 154 full hearings spanning 267 hours of video footage, linked to corresponding final court judgments. The hearings, originally only available as videos without transcripts, were processed through an automatic speech recognition pipeline followed by extensive manual corrections and annotations. The resulting corpus contains 2.1 million tokens across sentences that are timestamped and labeled for speaker role (judge, applicant, etc) and language. Along with the transcripts, the paper provides some preliminary analyses exploring connections between judges' questions during hearings and their subsequent dissenting opinions in final judgments. While unable to draw definitive conclusions, the authors showcase the potential of the new corpus to enable future empirical research at the intersection of legal debates and final case outcomes. The freely available LaCour! corpus opens possibilities for studying ECHR proceedings more holistically and for various legal NLP tasks.
