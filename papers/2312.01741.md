# [SRSNetwork: Siamese Reconstruction-Segmentation Networks based on   Dynamic-Parameter Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01741)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Siamese Reconstruction-Segmentation Network (SRSNet) for weak target image segmentation. The core innovation is a Dynamic-Parameter Convolution (DPConv) module that generates adaptive convolutional kernels based on input features to better capture complex data distributions. SRSNet jointly trains a reconstruction network and a segmentation network in a siamese architecture, with DPConv linking the two tasks. The key insight is that the unsupervised reconstruction task can provide beneficial domain knowledge to boost segmentation performance without altering the segmentation network structure. Experiments across medical and infrared datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the versatility of SRSNet. The dual-task framework allows improving segmentation accuracy by simply collecting more reconstruction data, overcoming limitations like scarce labeling. Overall, SRSNet sets a new state-of-the-art for weak target segmentation, enabled by the proposed DPConv and siamese training scheme that transfers indirect supervision from the auxiliary reconstruction task.
