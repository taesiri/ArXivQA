# [Healthcare Copilot: Eliciting the Power of General LLMs for Medical   Consultation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13408)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown impressive capabilities, but require extensive resources to train and fine-tune. There is a need for methods to enhance LLMs for complex tasks without additional fine-tuning.
- In the medical domain, while medical LLMs fine-tuned on specific datasets exist, they struggle with practical medical consultation tasks and have safety concerns. General LLMs also face limitations in real-world medical scenarios.
- There is a lack of publicly disclosed details on existing commercial medical consultation services using AI.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Healthcare Copilot framework to unlock the power of general LLMs for medical consultation without requiring fine-tuning. 
- The Healthcare Copilot has 3 key components:
   1) Dialogue component: Enables safe and effective conversation through function, safety and doctor oversight modules.
   2) Memory component: Enhances accuracy by providing patient's historical and current conversation data.
   3) Processing component: Generates visit summary reports.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a pioneering Healthcare Copilot approach that unlocks the capability of general LLMs for medical consultation without needing specialized fine-tuning.
- Develops an innovative 3-component framework enabling multi-round medical conversations, safety checks, doctor oversight and report generation.
- Demonstrates significantly enhanced performance of general LLMs on medical consultation using auto-evaluation, especially for GPT-4 Copilot.
- Highlights generalizability across LLMs and provides ablation studies on component effectiveness.
- Introduces an accessible methodology for developing LLM copilots for complex real-world tasks.

In summary, the paper presents a valuable Healthcare Copilot methodology to unlock general LLM potential for practical medical consultation while ensuring safety, accuracy and explainability. The proposed techniques offer promise for deploying LLMs in healthcare and other domains.
