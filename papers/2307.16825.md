# [Random Sub-Samples Generation for Self-Supervised Real Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16825)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an effective self-supervised learning method for real image denoising that does not require paired noisy/clean training data? The key points are:- Supervised deep learning methods require paired noisy/clean images for training, which are difficult to obtain for real-world images. - Existing self-supervised methods like Noise2Void make assumptions (e.g. pixel-wise independent noise) that are not valid for real images.- The authors propose a new self-supervised framework called SDAP that uses random sub-samples generation and a cyclic sampling difference loss to achieve state-of-the-art results in real image denoising without needing paired training data.So in summary, the main research question is how to do effective self-supervised real image denoising without paired training data, which SDAP aims to address through its proposed methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here are the main contributions of this paper:- The paper proposes a new self-supervised real image denoising framework called Sampling Difference As Perturbation (SDAP) based on Random Sub-samples Generation (RSG) with a cyclic sample difference loss. - It provides a new perspective that adding appropriate perturbations to the training data can improve the performance of Blind-Spot Network (BSN) for self-supervised denoising. The paper suggests using the difference between sub-samples generated by sampling as a type of perturbation.- It proposes the random sub-samples generation (RSG) strategy to obtain more diverse sub-samples and make the sampling difference closer to random perturbation compared to pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD).- A new cyclic sampling difference BSN loss is proposed to make full use of the sub-samples generated by RSG.- Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods on real-world datasets like SIDD and DND.In summary, the key novelty is proposing the idea of using sampling difference as perturbation for self-supervised real image denoising, as well as the associated techniques like RSG and the new cyclic loss function. The proposed SDAP framework achieves new state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?
