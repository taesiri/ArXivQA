# [Removing Biases from Molecular Representations via Information   Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00718)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Removing Biases from Molecular Representations via Information Maximization":

Problem:
- High-throughput drug screening is important for assessing drug-effect relationships, but divided into multiple experiments over time, introducing batch effects (systematic non-biological errors).  
- Existing molecular representation learning methods using 2D chemical structures fail to capture nuanced drug-phenotype relationships. 
- Recent works leverage multimodal contractive learning between structures and high-content screens (gene expression, cell images) but have difficulty generalizing due to batch effects.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose InfoCORE, an information maximization approach to refine molecular representations by removing batch effects.  
- Establish a variational lower bound on the conditional mutual information (CMI) of the latent representations given batch identifier.
- Adaptively reweigh sample pairs in InfoNCE loss based on similarity of representation posteriors of coming from same batch.
- Update encoders and batch classifiers iteratively. Reweighting scheme enables adaptive strategy for each sample.

Main Contributions:
- Theoretically show InfoCORE maximizes a variational lower bound on CMI given batch identifier.
- Empirically demonstrate superior performance over baselines in molecular property prediction and molecule-phenotype retrieval tasks using gene expression and cell imaging datasets.
- Show InfoCORE offers a general framework beyond drug discovery - also improves representation fairness by removing sensitive attributes on several benchmark datasets.

In summary, the paper proposes an information maximization approach, InfoCORE, to refine molecular representations by removing batch effects and other biases. It is shown, both theoretically and empirically, to outperform previous methods and provide a versatile framework for debiasing representations.
