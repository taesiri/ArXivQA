# [Removing Biases from Molecular Representations via Information   Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00718)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes InfoCORE, a new method for removing biases from molecular representations using information maximization. The key challenge is dealing with batch effects in high-throughput drug screening data, which can introduce systematic errors and spurious associations. InfoCORE establishes a variational lower bound on the conditional mutual information between latent representations and batch identifiers. It reweights contrastive sample pairs based on similarity of posterior batch distributions, emphasizing pairs less affected by batch. This adaptively equalizes batch effects across samples. Extensive experiments on gene expression and cell imaging profiles demonstrate InfoCORE's effectiveness for tasks like molecular property prediction and molecule-phenotype retrieval. Significant performance gains over baselines highlight its ability to extract refined, biologically-relevant molecular representations. Additionally, InfoCORE offers a general framework beyond drug discovery - experiments on representation fairness with sensitive attributes indicate versatility across domains. Theoretically justified and empirically shown to maximize latent information unrelated to batches, InfoCORE is a promising approach for debiasing representations.
