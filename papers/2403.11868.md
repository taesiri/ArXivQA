## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "View-Consistent 3D Editing with Gaussian Splatting":

Problem: 
The paper considers the problem of text-driven 3D model editing, where the goal is to modify a 3D model according to user-specified text instructions. A recent promising approach is to use rendered 2D images of the 3D model as guidance to edit the model. However, this image-guided approach suffers from a critical multi-view inconsistency issue - the edited images across different views exhibit significant discrepancies, leading to artifacts and mode collapse when used to update the 3D model.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes View-Consistent Editing (VcEdit), a framework to address the multi-view inconsistency issue in image-guided 3D editing. VcEdit employs two novel consistency modules integrated within an iterative editing pipeline:

1) Cross-Attention Consistency Module (CCM): Consolidates the cross-attention maps from all rendered views to synchronize the model's attentive 3D regions across views, making edited images more consistent.

2) Editing Consistency Module (ECM): Further calibrates edited images by fine-tuning and re-rendering a clone 3D model, rectifying remaining inconsistencies.

These modules fit within an iterative pipeline that progressively refines consistency between rendered images and the updated 3D model.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes effective CCM and ECM modules to harmonize inconsistent multi-view guidance images for 3D editing.

- Constructs an iterative editing pipeline around these modules to enable high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting editing. 

- Pioneers a paradigm integrating 3D model characteristics for ensuring multi-view consistency in image-guided 3D editing.

The proposed VcEdit framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively resolving multi-view inconsistency issues and achieving superior editing quality across diverse test cases.
