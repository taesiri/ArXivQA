# CharacterChat: Learning towards Conversational AI with Personalized   Social Support

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the key points and central focus of this paper appear to be:- Introducing a new framework called "Social Support Conversation" (S2Conv) for providing personalized emotional support through conversations. - Developing the MBTI-1024 Bank, which consists of 1024 virtual characters with distinct personas and memories based on MBTI personality types.- Generating the MBTI-S2Conv dataset, which contains 10,240 personalized social support dialogues between characters in the MBTI-1024 Bank.- Investigating the role of interpersonal matching between seeker and supporter personas in improving social support conversations. - Presenting CharacterChat, an S2Conv system comprising a persona/memory-based dialogue model and an interpersonal matching plugin to connect seekers to suitable supporters.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that an S2Conv framework with personalized supporter agents matched using an interpersonal mechanism can provide more effective social and emotional support compared to traditional methods like Emotional Support Conversations. The key contributions are developing the personas, dialogues, and models to enable this personalized framework and demonstrating its advantages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introducing the concept of Social Support Conversation (S2Conv), a personalized emotional support framework using supporter agents and interpersonal matching. 2. Creating the MBTI-1024 Bank, which contains 1024 virtual characters with distinct profiles based on MBTI personas.3. Developing the MBTI-S2Conv dataset, which consists of conversations between characters in the MBTI-1024 Bank. This is used to study the impact of interpersonal matching on support conversations.4. Presenting CharacterChat, a comprehensive S2Conv system comprising a conversational model driven by personas and memories, and a matching model to connect seekers to optimal supporters from the MBTI-1024 Bank.In summary, the key innovations of this work seem to be proposing the S2Conv framework to address limitations of traditional emotional support methods, leveraging MBTI personas to create personalized supporter agents, and demonstrating the advantages of interpersonal matching for providing effective social support conversations. The main tangible contributions are the MBTI-1024 Bank, MBTI-S2Conv dataset, and the CharacterChat system.
