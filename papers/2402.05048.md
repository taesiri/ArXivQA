# [How VADER is your AI? Towards a definition of artificial intelligence   systems appropriate for regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05048)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are being rapidly developed and deployed, stirring the need for regulation. However, existing AI regulation proposals adopt different AI definitions, some of which are too broad and fail to properly distinguish between AI and non-AI systems.  
- Overly broad AI definitions risk negatively impacting non-AI information and communication technologies (ICT) systems as well as works from other fields like mathematics, statistics and engineering through overregulation.
- There is a lack of structured frameworks to assess the appropriateness of proposed AI definitions for regulation.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a framework called VADER (validated as appropriately-defined for regulation) to score AI definitions based on their compliance with 7 premises that should underlie appropriate AI definitions. 
- The premises aim to reproduce principles from successful technology regulations and properly scope the definition to AI systems only. 
- The framework includes a dataset of representative examples of AI, non-AI ICT and non-ICT systems to help identify scope issues.
- Based on premise compliance, VADER labels AI definitions as appropriate for regulation, needing revision, or posing concrete risk of overregulation.  

Main Contributions:
- Identification of 7 premises from technical and policy literature that AI definitions should comply with to be appropriate for regulation
- Publicly available online VADER framework to score AI definitions' compliance with those premises 
- Dataset of representative examples of AI and non-AI systems to help identify scope issues
- Critical assessment of major worldwide AI regulation proposals demonstrating that none achieved full compliance, with 5 of 7 posing concrete risk due to overbroad definitions

The paper makes important contributions towards ensuring AI regulations are built on appropriate AI definitions that properly distinguish AI from non-AI systems. The proposed VADER framework can assist policymakers globally in evaluating and revising definitions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework to score how validated as appropriately-defined for regulation (VADER) an AI definition is, based on a set of premises identified from technical and policy literature, and uses the framework to critically review key worldwide AI regulation proposals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called VADER (validated as appropriately-defined for regulation) to score how appropriate an AI definition is for regulation. The key aspects of the VADER framework are:

1) It identifies a set of premises that AI definitions for regulation should satisfy, based on principles from successful technology regulations and the need to properly scope what is considered AI. These premises cover aspects like technology neutrality, exclusion of non-ICT works, and inclusion of all AI techniques.

2) It includes a dataset of representative examples of AI, non-AI ICT, and non-ICT techniques and systems. This helps identify scope issues with AI definitions. 

3) It assigns definitions one of three scores - appropriate for regulation, revision needed, or concrete risk. Based on the score, it provides recommendations on how policymakers can improve their AI definitions.

4) It demonstrates the framework by assessing major AI regulation proposals from key countries and regions. It finds issues with existing definitions, including concretely posing a risk of overregulation.

In summary, the main contribution is the VADER framework to systematically assess and provide guidance on improving AI definitions for the purposes of regulation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the main keywords or key terms associated with this paper include:

- Artificial intelligence (AI)
- Regulation 
- Policy recommendations
- AI definitions
- Technology regulation 
- Overregulation
- Information and communication technologies (ICT)
- Validation framework
- Premises
- Dataset of examples
- Critical risk
- Revision needed
- Appropriate for regulation 

The paper proposes a framework called VADER to validate the appropriateness of AI definitions for the purpose of regulation. It identifies premises that should underlie good AI definitions and provides a dataset of AI, non-AI ICT, and non-ICT examples to help assess scope. The framework can score AI definitions as posing critical risk, needing revision, or being appropriate for regulation. It demonstrates the framework by critically reviewing major worldwide AI regulation proposals. So the core focus is on evaluating and improving definitions of AI to enable effective, risk-based regulation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a framework called VADER to validate the appropriateness of AI definitions for regulation. What are the key components and scoring metrics of this framework? How does it determine if a definition is appropriate, needs revision, or poses concrete risk?

2. What are the 7 premises outlined in the paper that AI definitions should comply with to be considered appropriate for regulation? Explain each premise briefly. 

3. The paper discusses the need for a dataset of representative examples of AI, non-AI ICT, and non-ICT techniques and systems. What is the purpose of having this dataset? How can it help identify issues with the scope of proposed AI definitions?

4. The VADER framework has specific recommended actions for policymakers based on the score outcome. Can you outline 2-3 key recommended actions for definitions that are scored as needing revision? What about for definitions scored as posing concrete risk?

5. The paper demonstrates the application of the VADER framework by evaluating definitions from regulation proposals in the US, EU, UK and Brazil. Which country's proposal was scored as needing revision and why? Can you summarize the main issue identified with its AI definition?

6. When discussing the evaluation of the EU AI Act's definition, the paper states it violates 2 specific premises leading to a critical risk score. What are those 2 premises and why does the EU definition violate them?  

7. For the UK's AI Bill, the VADER framework identified issues with both objectivity and scope exclusion in its AI definition. Can you briefly explain what those issues are?

8. The OECD AI definitions from 2019 and 2023 are analyzed in the paper. How does the 2023 definition improve in terms of VADER score compared to the 2019 version? But what premise does it still violate?

9. Can you summarize the approach taken in the Brazilian PL 2338 AI definition, including how it differs from the original OECD 2019 definition? What leads it to get a VADER score of needing revision?

10. In your opinion, what are some limitations or challenges that policymakers may face in revising their AI definitions based on the VADER score feedback? How may they address those?
