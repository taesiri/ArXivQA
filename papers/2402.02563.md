# [DefInt: A Default-interventionist Framework for Efficient Reasoning with   Hybrid Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02563)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning abilities, but face challenges in handling complex reasoning problems efficiently due to rapidly increasing token costs. This is especially problematic for open-ended real-world tasks with huge solution spaces.  

- Prior works have focused predominately on enhancing reasoning accuracy but overlook efficiency, lacking a balance between accuracy and cost.

Solution - DefInt Framework:  
- Motivated by the dual process theory of human cognition, the authors propose a Default-Interventionist framework (DefInt) to unleash the synergistic potential of hybrid LLMs. 

- DefInt efficiently generates "default" low-cost reasoning thoughts using smaller-scale LLMs, resembling fast intuitions of System 1. 

- If default thoughts are low-confidence, DefInt intervenes with scaled-up LLMs for high-effort reflective reasoning, akin to System 2 override.

- Besides intervention when needed, DefInt also periodically invokes System 2 reasoning as "gatekeeping" to ensure reasoning stays on course.

Main Contributions:
- DefInt achieves state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy and solution diversity on 5 representative reasoning tasks, including both close-ended and open-ended problems.

- Compared to the second best baselines, DefInt reduces token costs substantially by 49-79%, with even higher 75% average reduction on open-ended tasks.

- Analysis shows DefInt improves efficiency by leveraging smaller LLM intuitions as defaults, while retaining accuracy via reflective interventions - unleashing the synergistic potential of hybrid LLMs.

- Results provide insights on designing cost-effective LLM reasoning models by balancing intuitive and reflective reasoning.

In summary, the paper introduces DefInt, an efficient hybrid LLM reasoning framework achieving superior accuracy-cost trade-offs by adaptively synergizing smaller and larger language models. DefInt draws ideas from dual process theory to reconcile intuitive and reflective thinking for human-like efficient reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes DefInt, a default-interventionist framework that adaptively utilizes both smaller-scale and larger-scale language models to achieve efficient and accurate reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes DefInt, a novel default-interventionist framework that unleashes the synergistic potential of hybrid large language models (LLMs) for efficient reasoning. DefInt adaptively combines the strengths of smaller LLMs that produce low-cost intuitions (System 1) and larger LLMs capable of reflective reasoning (System 2).

2. It conducts extensive experiments on five reasoning tasks including both close-ended and open-ended problems. The results demonstrate that DefInt achieves state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy and solution diversity on all tasks, while substantially reducing the token cost by 49-79% compared to the second best method.

3. It provides an analysis on the feasible range of intervention rates in DefInt, offering useful insights into designing cost-effective LLM reasoning models in practice without requiring additional training or fine-tuning.

In summary, the key contribution is a new framework (DefInt) that enables efficient and accurate reasoning by exploiting the synergistic potential of hybrid LLMs of different scales. DefInt consistently improves reasoning performance across tasks while significantly cutting down the computational costs.

 Based on my review of the paper, I would suggest the following key terms and keywords associated with this work:

The paper proposes a new framework called "DefInt" that combines intuitive reasoning from smaller LLMs (System 1) with reflective reasoning from larger LLMs (System 2) to balance accuracy and efficiency for complex reasoning tasks. The key innovation is the default-interventionist mechanism that relies primarily on low-cost intuitive reasoning, with reflective reasoning used to override intuitions when they have low confidence. Experiments across five reasoning tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially reduced token cost compared to prior methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the DefInt method proposed in the paper:

1. How exactly does DefInt implement the "System 1" module with multiple smaller language models? What considerations went into choosing GPT-3.5, PaLM2 and Gemini specifically?

2. The paper mentions using an "independent confidence evaluator LLM" to assess the coherence of the intuitions from System 1. What approach is used to train this evaluator model? Does it require task-specific fine-tuning? 

3. The interval parameter T controls how often the reflective reasoning of System 2 intervenes. Is there an adaptive way to set T based on monitoring the confidence scores during reasoning instead of using a fixed value?

4. How sensitive is DefInt's performance to the choice of language models used for System 1 and System 2? Have alternative model combinations been experimented with and how did they compare?

5. DefInt achieves substantially higher diversity scores across tasks compared to prior methods. Does the analysis provide any insight into what specific mechanisms account for this? 

6. For the open-ended tasks especially, what are some examples of incorrect or lower quality directions the reasoning could drift into without the periodic interventions of System 2?

7. The paper analyzes the theoretical constraints on the intervention rate r for DefInt to maintain cost savings. How could the framework be adapted if a higher r was necessitated by complex tasks? 

8. How might the default-interventionist approach of DefInt compare if applied to other modalities like mathematical or visual reasoning instead of language tasks?

9. Does DefInt's dual-process approach lead to any observable differences in the natural language explanations generated compared to single-system reasoning models?

10. The paper focuses on accuracy and efficiency, but are there other quality metrics around interpretability, fairness or transparency that could be impacted by DefInt's hybrid reasoning approach?
