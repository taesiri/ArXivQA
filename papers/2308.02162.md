# [Learning Referring Video Object Segmentation from Weak Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02162)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is on developing a weakly supervised framework for referring video object segmentation (RVOS). The main hypothesis is that the requirement for dense mask annotations in fully supervised RVOS is very expensive and time-consuming. The authors propose a new weak annotation scheme that only requires a mask for the first frame where the object appears and bounding boxes for subsequent frames. This greatly reduces the annotation cost while still providing enough supervision for training RVOS models. The main contributions are:- Proposing a new weak annotation scheme for RVOS that is much more efficient than dense mask annotation.- Designing a cross frame segmentation method that leverages the mask annotation in the first frame to supervise other frames, making full use of the limited mask annotation.- Developing a bi-level contrastive learning approach to learn more discriminative representations from the weak annotations.- Demonstrating through experiments that their proposed framework achieves competitive performance to fully supervised methods with significantly lower annotation cost.In summary, the central hypothesis is that an effective weakly supervised RVOS framework can be developed based on the proposed annotation scheme and learning methods, reducing reliance on expensive dense mask annotations. The experiments seem to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new weak annotation scheme for referring video object segmentation (RVOS), where only the first frame where the target object appears is densely annotated with a mask, while subsequent frames just have bounding box labels. This reduces annotation cost substantially compared to fully supervised RVOS. 2. To learn effectively from this weak annotation, the paper develops two main technical contributions:- A language-guided cross frame segmentation (LGCFS) method that uses the language-guided filters from all frames to predict the segmentation in each frame. This allows the single mask annotation to supervise other frames.- A bi-level contrastive learning (BLCL) approach with language-vision and consistency contrasts to learn more discriminative foreground/background representations from both mask and box annotations. 3. Experiments show their method achieves strong performance on YouTube-RVOS compared to fully supervised techniques, with 8x less annotation cost. Ablations verify the benefits of the LGCFS and BLCL components.In summary, the main novelty is in the weakly supervised RVOS formulation and the model design to effectively learn from mixed mask and box supervision across frames. The results demonstrate the viability of reducing annotation cost for RVOS.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes a new weakly supervised annotation scheme for referring video object segmentation that uses a mask for the first frame and boxes for subsequent frames, as well as methods for cross frame segmentation and bi-level contrastive learning to effectively learn from this weak annotation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in the field of referring video object segmentation (RVOS):- Most prior work in RVOS focuses on fully supervised settings that require dense pixel-level mask annotations for all video frames. This paper explores weak supervision with only a mask for the first frame and boxes for subsequent frames, which significantly reduces annotation cost. - The paper proposes two main technical contributions - a language-guided cross frame segmentation method and a bi-level contrastive learning approach - to enable learning an effective RVOS model from the proposed weak annotations.- Many recent RVOS methods rely on extra datasets like image referring segmentation datasets (e.g. RefCOCO) for pretraining or joint training to alleviate insufficient training data. This work shows competitive performance can be achieved with just a single weakly annotated RVOS dataset.- The paper demonstrates strong results on the key YouTube-RVOS benchmark compared to recent state-of-the-art fully supervised methods, showing the promise of the weak supervision paradigm and associated techniques proposed.- The work focuses specifically on the RVOS task guided by referring expressions, in contrast to related tasks like semi-supervised video object segmentation and video instance segmentation that have different problem settings.In summary, this paper makes contributions in introducing and showing the effectiveness of a weakly supervised setting for RVOS, and developing associated methods that allow learning with weak mask and box annotations instead of dense pixel masks like most prior work. The experiments demonstrate competitive results can be achieved using the proposed techniques with significantly reduced annotation cost.
