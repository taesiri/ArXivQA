# [ADaPT: As-Needed Decomposition and Planning with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05772)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces ADaPT, a recursive approach that dynamically decomposes complex sub-tasks using language models, intervening with planning only when the executor model fails, in order to complete interactive decision-making tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces ADaPT, a recursive algorithm for using large language models (LLMs) for decision-making tasks that require planning and adapting to the environment. ADaPT employs separate LLM modules for planning and execution. When given a complex task, it first attempts to accomplish it entirely with the executor LLM. If this fails, ADaPT uses the planner LLM to decompose the task into subtasks. It then recursively calls itself on each subtask until successful completion. This allows ADaPT to dynamically adjust the decomposition to both the complexity of the task and the capabilities of the executor LLM. Empirically, ADaPT achieved substantially higher success rates compared to strong baselines on three interactive environments - ALFWorld, WebShop, and a new text game called TextCraft. Through analysis, the authors demonstrated the importance of recursive decomposition in ADaPT and how it adapts to both task complexity and executor capabilities. The key advantage of ADaPT is performing decomposition in an as-needed manner based on executor failures instead of full upfront planning.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

The paper introduces ADaPT (As-Needed Decomposition and Planning with Language Models), a new approach for using large language models (LLMs) as agents for complex decision-making tasks that require interacting with environments. ADaPT employs a recursive algorithm that leverages separate LLM modules for planning and execution. Given a complex task, ADaPT first attempts to accomplish it using an iterative LLM executor. If the executor fails, ADaPT intervenes and leverages a separate LLM planner to decompose the task into simpler sub-tasks. This decomposition happens dynamically and only when needed, adapting to both task complexity and the capabilities of the executor LLM. ADaPT is evaluated on three interactive environments - ALFWorld, WebShop, and a new text game called TextCraft. Results demonstrate that ADaPT substantially outperforms strong iterative executor baselines like ReAct and plan-and-execute approaches. Through analysis, the paper shows that ADaPT's recursive decomposition is crucial to performance, and that it dynamically adjusts the level of decomposition based on both the task complexity and executor capabilities. A key advantage is that ADaPT only plans when the executor fails, avoiding unnecessary planning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces ADaPT, a recursive algorithm that dynamically decomposes complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks using separate language model modules for planning and execution, intervening with further decomposition only when the executor module fails at a sub-task.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question that this paper addresses is:

How can we build an agent that effectively leverages large language models (LLMs) for complex decision-making tasks requiring planning and adapting to the environment?

The key hypothesis is that explicitly decomposing complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks in an as-needed, adaptive manner will allow LLMs to succeed on tasks that iterative LLM executors alone struggle with. 

Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates ADaPT, an approach that uses one LLM as an executor to try executing tasks directly, and another LLM as a planner to recursively decompose tasks into simpler sub-tasks when the executor fails. The hypothesis is that this as-needed decomposition will dynamically adapt to both task complexity and LLM capabilities, allowing ADaPT to outperform non-adaptive baselines.

The central research questions revolve around whether:

1) Recursive decomposition in ADaPT leads to better performance compared to fixed decomposition baselines.

2) ADaPT can effectively cater to LLMs with different execution capabilities. 

3) ADaPT can incorporate task complexity and decompose more for harder tasks.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is on the benefits of as-needed, adaptive decomposition for LLM-based planning, which is evaluated through ADaPT's performance on complex decision-making tasks. The research questions focus on validating ADaPT's ability to dynamically decompose based on both LLM capabilities and task complexity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting ADaPT, an approach for using large language models (LLMs) for interactive decision-making tasks that require planning and adapting to the environment. The key ideas are:

- Employing separate LLM modules for low-level execution and high-level planning. 

- Recursively decomposing complex sub-tasks into smaller sub-tasks using the planner LLM only when the executor LLM fails at a sub-task. This allows dynamical adaptation based on the capabilities of the executor LLM.

- The planner LLM generates short abstract plans to provide flexibility for further decomposition if needed. The executor LLM assesses its own success to determine if further decomposition is necessary.

- Evaluation on three diverse decision-making datasets - ALFWorld, WebShop, and a new TextCraft game - shows ADaPT substantially improves over prior LLM decision-making methods by dynamically adapting decomposition to task complexity and executor capabilities.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting and evaluating ADaPT, a novel modular and recursive approach to dynamically leverage LLM planning abilities to decompose complex decision-making tasks on an as-needed basis based on executor capabilities and task complexity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related work in using large language models for decision-making tasks:

- The paper introduces a new method called ADaPT that dynamically decomposes complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks using a separate LLM planner module, intervening only when the LLM executor fails at a sub-task. This differentiates it from prior iterative executor approaches like ReAct that do all planning implicitly, and from plan-and-execute methods that use fixed plans without adapting to executor capabilities.

- Empirically, ADaPT outperforms strong baselines like ReAct, plan-and-execute, and other adaptive methods like Reflexion across three text-based decision environments - ALFWorld, WebShop, and a new dataset TextCraft introduced in the paper. The gains are substantial, up to 28.3% higher success rate over baselines.

- The paper provides extensive analysis and ablations to demonstrate ADaPT's ability to dynamically adapt decomposition to both the LLM executor's capabilities as well as inherent task complexity. This showcases the approach's versatility.

- Unlike some prior works, ADaPT does not rely on task-specific feedback, memory modules, or search. The modular LLM-based planner and executor design is also more generalizable.

- For hierarchical planning, ADaPT draws inspiration from classical AI methods but differs in using LLMs for autonomous decomposition based on their world knowledge rather than hand-specified plan libraries.

- Overall, by introducing recursive decomposition and as-needed planning driven by executor capabilities, ADaPT pushes forward research on effectively combining planning and execution for LLM-based decision-making. The gains over strong baselines highlight the significance of this adaptive approach.

In summary, the paper presents impressive empirical gains using the novel ADaPT algorithm while also providing detailed analysis into its adaptive properties. The introductions of new datasets also expands resources for continued research in this emerging area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Exploring how to best combine knowledge from stronger and weaker LLMs within the ADaPT framework, as has been studied for mathematical reasoning. They suggest specializing different components to different LLMs.

- Improving the self-evaluation capabilities of LLMs to address the shortcomings of using LLMs to generate success heuristics. The authors note that the heuristic was overly optimistic on the WebShop dataset. 

- Incorporating complementary techniques like using LLMs to develop heuristics for search or storing feedback in memory into the ADaPT framework. The authors note these could be integrated into the planner or executor modules.

- Exploring how ADaPT could be used with different planning formalisms like hierarchical planning in classical AI. The authors suggest investigating how LLMs can autonomously decompose complex tasks using their world knowledge without predefined plan libraries.

- Studying how the communication between modules could be improved, for example by propagating rationales or improving instructions to the planner.

- Scaling ADaPT to more complex environments and tasks.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the modules within ADaPT (the planner, executor, and their communication), integrating complementary LLM techniques, connecting ADaPT to more classical AI planning approaches, and testing it on more complex tasks. The key theme is further developing the modular, dynamically adaptive approach of ADaPT.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the ADaPT method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that ADaPT dynamically decomposes complex sub-tasks on an "as-needed" basis, intervening only when the task is too complex for the executor LLM. How does ADaPT determine when a sub-task is too complex for the executor? What heuristics or metrics are used to make this assessment?

2. One key benefit of ADaPT seems to be its ability to recursively decompose tasks to align with the capabilities of the executor LLM. How does ADaPT determine the appropriate level of recursion/decomposition for a given executor? Does it learn a capability model of the executor or use some other technique?

3. The planner LLM in ADaPT generates relatively short and abstract plans with 3-5 steps. What motivates this design choice compared to having the planner generate more detailed step-by-step plans upfront? How does the abstract nature of plans aid the recursive decomposition?

4. The paper shows that ADaPT adapts its decomposition based on task complexity, with more complex tasks requiring more recursion/decomposition. What specific features or properties of the tasks trigger more extensive decomposition? Are there any tasks where excessive decomposition is detrimental?

5. How does ADaPT balance the tradeoff between delegating tasks to the executor vs. decomposing them further using the planner? At what point does it decide the executor is unlikely to succeed on its own?

6. The success heuristic generated by the executor LLM is a key signal used by ADaPT to determine when to further decompose tasks. How reliable is this self-assessed success signal compared to the ground truth environment reward? Under what conditions might it be inaccurate?

7. The paper demonstrates combining different LLM models as the planner and executor within ADaPT. What factors determine good combinations of planner and executor models? When would a smaller executor paired with a stronger planner be preferred?

8. How does the communication between planner and executor modules via the controller enable ADaPT's recursive decomposition? What key pieces of state/information need to be propagated? How does this differ across environments?

9. How suitable is ADaPT for online adaptation in changing environments, where task complexity may evolve over time? Does it handle shifts in the executor's capabilities or changes to goal specifications gracefully?

10. The comparison focuses on improvements over baseline LLMs without finetuning. Could the recursive decomposition of ADaPT be integrated with offline or online LLM finetuning to further enhance capabilities? How can both approaches complement each other?
