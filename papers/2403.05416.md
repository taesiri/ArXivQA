# [SIRST-5K: Exploring Massive Negatives Synthesis with Self-supervised   Learning for Robust Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05416)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Infrared small target detection aims to detect small targets from cluttered backgrounds in infrared images. However, it faces challenges due to limited training data, small target sizes, weak intensity, and lack of distinguishable features.

- Existing datasets have limited diversity and scale. Data augmentation techniques may alter semantics and cause label absence. 

- With the development of Transformers, model scale keeps increasing but performance improvement is limited by data scarcity.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a negative sample augmentation strategy to generate challenging pseudo-data for self-supervised representation learning.

- A Noise2Noise displacement module is used to sample and model noise from training data. This noise is fused with images to increase diversity.

- A negative augmentation module rotates target patches to create different negatives while maintaining semantics.

- Generated pseudo-data and labels are used for self-supervised learning to learn robust features.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a synthetic SIRST-5K dataset with 5,562 infrared images, enhancing quality, quantity and diversity.

- Noise2Noise displacement introduces real-world noise to improve model robustness.

- Negative augmentation enriches diversity while preserving semantics. 

- Self-supervised learning paradigm with pseudo-data achieves faster convergence, lower loss and better performance.

- Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results on NUDT-SIRST dataset for probability of detection, false alarm rate and intersection over union.
