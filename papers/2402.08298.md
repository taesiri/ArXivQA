# [Time to Stop and Think: What kind of research do we want to do?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08298)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper reflects on the concerning trends in research practices in the field of metaheuristic optimization. The authors argue that research is often conducted by blindly following established traditions without questioning their appropriateness. This leads to problems like the overuse of statistical tests without considering their necessity or usefulness. 

The paper distinguishes two fundamental approaches to research: engineering and scientific. In the engineering approach, the goal is to solve relevant real-world optimization problems. Thus the impact lies in the relevance of the problem being solved. In the scientific approach, the goal is to gain knowledge by understanding problems/algorithms. This can be done theoretically or experimentally when problems get too complex for theoretical analyses.

The authors argue that the engineering approach is not suitable for using classical problems like TSP unless there is interest in the solutions themselves from a real application. On the other hand, the scientific approach can use classical problems to gain insights, not just to achieve state-of-the-art results. The paper draws parallels between the scientific method in natural sciences and an experimental approach in metaheuristic optimization research.

The key contributions are:
(1) Identifying concerning trends in research practices 
(2) Distinguishing engineering vs. scientific approaches and their implications on experimentation
(3) Drawing parallels between scientific method in natural sciences and an experimental approach in metaheuristic optimization 
(4) Arguing for more questioning of established traditions rather than blindly following them
(5) Calling for a reflection on fundamentals of how research is conducted

The authors aim to spark a discussion in the research community through this paper to address some of the issues around goals and practices of research in the field.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key point made in the paper:

The paper argues that researchers in metaheuristic optimization should reflect on and clearly define whether their work aims to solve practical engineering problems or advance scientific knowledge, as this fundamentally changes the approach, methods, and assessment of the research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is to promote critical reflection and discussion within the research community about the fundamentals and proper methodology of research in the field of metaheuristic optimization. 

Specifically, the authors argue that research should be guided by clear goals that differentiate an "engineering" approach (focused on solving practical real-world problems) from a "scientific" approach (focused on gaining knowledge and understanding). They contend that many research projects, especially those aimed solely at achieving state-of-the-art results on classical problems, lack practical relevance and contribute little to advancing the field. 

The authors advocate for sincere critical assessment of research practices, questioning inertia and blind adherence to tradition. They promote thoughtful experimental design aligned to research goals, rather than formulaic use of benchmarks and statistical tests. Overall, their aim is to spur productive debate within the community about what constitutes valuable, meaningful research and how it should be conducted and evaluated. The paper itself, therefore, serves mainly as a call for reflection rather than making direct technical contributions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The authors distinguish between an "engineering" and a "scientific" approach to research. In your view, what are the key differences between these approaches in terms of goals, methodology, and assessment of impact? 

2. The paper argues that much research in metaheuristic optimization focuses too narrowly on achieving state-of-the-art results on classical problems. Why do you think this occurs and what harm does it cause? How should the community shift its focus?

3. The parallel drawn between experimental natural sciences and experimental applied mathematics is intriguing. In what ways do you think the scientific method can and should be applied to metaheuristic optimization research? What are the limitations?

4. The paper advocates for more "observational" research that quantitatively characterizes algorithm performance across diverse problem instances. What specific observations would be most valuable and how should performance be quantified? 

5. Once substantial observational data is collected, what types of hypotheses would be worthwhile to formulate and test regarding algorithm behavior and problem structure? Can you propose any initial hypotheses?

6. The paper is critical of research that hand-picks benchmarks to show algorithm improvements. How prevalent do you think this problem is? What steps should researchers and reviewers take to combat this?

7. For an engineering research approach, proper problem instance selection is key. What criteria should guide the selection process? How can relevance and diversity be balanced?

8. The paper argues research should be assessed based on its potential impact. For metaheuristic optimization, what constitutes high impact research in your view, for both engineering and scientific approaches?

9. The paper advocates reflecting on research fundamentals due to some problematic trends. What other fundamental issues beyond experimentation deserve discussion in the metaheuristic optimization community?  

10. The paper aims to "sew the seed" of critical assessment and reflection. What specific steps do you think researchers should take, individually and as a community, to put these ideas into practice? What resistance do you expect?
