# [Time to Stop and Think: What kind of research do we want to do?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08298)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper reflects on the concerning trends in research practices in the field of metaheuristic optimization. The authors argue that research is often conducted by blindly following established traditions without questioning their appropriateness. This leads to problems like the overuse of statistical tests without considering their necessity or usefulness. 

The paper distinguishes two fundamental approaches to research: engineering and scientific. In the engineering approach, the goal is to solve relevant real-world optimization problems. Thus the impact lies in the relevance of the problem being solved. In the scientific approach, the goal is to gain knowledge by understanding problems/algorithms. This can be done theoretically or experimentally when problems get too complex for theoretical analyses.

The authors argue that the engineering approach is not suitable for using classical problems like TSP unless there is interest in the solutions themselves from a real application. On the other hand, the scientific approach can use classical problems to gain insights, not just to achieve state-of-the-art results. The paper draws parallels between the scientific method in natural sciences and an experimental approach in metaheuristic optimization research.

The key contributions are:
(1) Identifying concerning trends in research practices 
(2) Distinguishing engineering vs. scientific approaches and their implications on experimentation
(3) Drawing parallels between scientific method in natural sciences and an experimental approach in metaheuristic optimization 
(4) Arguing for more questioning of established traditions rather than blindly following them
(5) Calling for a reflection on fundamentals of how research is conducted

The authors aim to spark a discussion in the research community through this paper to address some of the issues around goals and practices of research in the field.
