# [Understanding Why Label Smoothing Degrades Selective Classification and   How to Fix It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14715)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Label smoothing (LS) is a popular regularization technique used during training of neural network classifiers. It improves test accuracy by discouraging overfitting to the training labels.
- The paper shows empirically that using LS degrades performance on the task of selective classification (SC). SC aims to reject potential misclassifications by using the model's predictive uncertainty.
- The paper reveals LS as a potential cause for previous results showing strong classifiers underperforming at SC, since many high-performing models use LS during training.

Proposed Solution:  
- By analyzing the logit-level gradients, the paper shows LS regularizes the maximum logit more when the probability of error is low, and less when probability of error is high. This exacerbates overconfidence and underconfidence issues.
- The paper demonstrates logit normalization effectively recovers the lost SC performance caused by LS. Logit normalization increases uncertainty as the maximum logit increases.

Main Contributions:
- Shows empirically that LS degrades SC across tasks and architectures, despite improving accuracy. Reveals LS as a potential cause of strong classifiers underperforming at SC.  
- Provides analysis via logit-level gradients to explain how LS exacerbates overconfidence and underconfidence by regularizing maximum logit based on probability of error.
- Demonstrates logit normalization effectively recovers lost SC performance of LS-trained models and explains why it is effective through the analysis.

In summary, the paper clearly shows LS negatively impacts SC, provides insights into why, and shows logit normalization can mitigate the issues specifically caused by LS.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper shows that label smoothing, a common technique for improving classification accuracy, degrades models' ability to selectively classify by exacerbating overconfidence and underconfidence, and proposes logit normalization as a method to mitigate this issue.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It shows empirically, across a range of network architectures and vision tasks, that training with label smoothing (LS) consistently leads to degraded performance on selective classification (SC), even if LS may improve accuracy.

2. It explains this behavior by analyzing the logit-level gradients of the LS loss, showing that LS exacerbates overconfidence and underconfidence by regularizing the max logit more when the probability of error is low, and less when the probability of error is high.

3. It demonstrates the empirical effectiveness of logit normalization for recovering lost SC performance caused by LS. Furthermore, based on the gradient analysis, it explains why such normalization is effective - it compensates for the imbalanced regularization caused by LS.

In summary, the key contribution is revealing, analyzing, and proposing a solution to the negative impact of the commonly used label smoothing technique on selective classification performance. The analysis of gradients and connections to overconfidence/underconfidence provides insight into this behavior.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Label smoothing (LS)
- Selective classification (SC) 
- Risk-coverage (RC) curve
- Overconfidence
- Underconfidence
- Logit gradients
- Logit normalisation
- Aleatoric uncertainty
- Epistemic uncertainty
- Maximum softmax probability (MSP)

The paper investigates how label smoothing, a popular regularization technique, negatively impacts a model's ability to perform selective classification. Key findings include that label smoothing exacerbates overconfidence and underconfidence by regularizing logit gradients differently based on the true probability of error. The paper also demonstrates how logit normalization can help recover lost selective classification performance for models trained with label smoothing. Throughout the analysis, concepts like aleatoric vs. epistemic uncertainty and the maximum softmax probability score play an important role.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I have formulated about the methods proposed in this paper:

1) How exactly does the proposed logit gradient analysis in Section 3.2 elucidate the degradation in selective classification performance when using label smoothing? Explain the key insights it provides into the overconfidence and underconfidence caused by label smoothing.

2) The paper claims that logit normalization is highly effective at recovering the lost selective classification performance when using label smoothing. Analyze the mathematical justification provided in Result 1 and explain how it supports the effectiveness of logit normalization.  

3) What are the limitations of only considering the relative rankings of uncertainty scores U(x) for selective classification, as done in this work? When would it be more appropriate to analyze the absolute uncertainties for this task?

4) How could the proposed methods be extended to classification tasks with highly imbalanced datasets? Would the gradient analysis in Section 3.2 still hold in such scenarios?

5) The paper focuses solely on the maximum softmax probability (MSP) for uncertainty estimation. How could the analysis be expanded to other notions of uncertainty such as mutual information or variance based estimates?

6) Aside from selective classification, what other downstream tasks could label smoothing negatively impact? And how might the analysis framework provided in this paper be adapted to study such scenarios?  

7) The paper argues both label smoothing and mixup techniques directly modify training labels. How does this interference with training labels degrade selective classification and how might one compensate when using both techniques?

8) How well would the proposed logit normalization technique transfer when using different neural network architectures? Would the effectiveness vary across CNNs, ViTs, RNNs etc?

9) How could logit normalization be adapted for regression tasks where the output is continuous rather than categorical classification probabilities? Would a similar analysis in terms of the gradient regularisation hold?

10) The paper focuses solely on vision tasks. How would the negative impacts of label smoothing potentially change for language tasks like translation and speech recognition? Would the proposed fixes still apply?
