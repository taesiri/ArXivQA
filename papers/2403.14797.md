# [Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting through Memory Networks in Continuous   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14797)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Modern vision systems struggle with catastrophic forgetting when continuously fine-tuned on new tasks. Despite progress in continual image classification, complex vision tasks like detection still face challenges in retaining performance on old tasks while adapting to new ones. A key unaddressed issue is that of "background relegation", where objects from old tasks reappear unannotated in new tasks, causing them to be implicitly treated as background.

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces a memory-based detection transformer called MD-DETR to adapt a pretrained Deformable DETR detector through continuous fine-tuning. It uses an integrated memory with a novel localized query function for efficient retrieval. Two continual optimization techniques are proposed: 1) Gradient masking and thresholding on class embeddings to prevent updating previous task information, 2) Background thresholding to generate pseudo-labels for unannotated old objects to prevent them being relegated as background.

Contributions:
1) MD-DETR - A memory-augmented, replay buffer free continual detection system built on DETR, with localized memory retrieval.

2) Identifies the background relegation issue in continual detection and provides optimization strategies to address it. 

3) Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets, showing MD-DETR surpasses prior arts by 5-7% in continual detection, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Limitations:
While addressing background relegation, two key issues still remain - bounding box deformation on old classes due to the stability-plasticity dilemma and reduction in confidence scores for old classes. Future work should aim to address these.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions in developing efficient memory networks for continual detection and tackling the critical but previously unaddressed problem of background relegation. The proposed MD-DETR advances state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks by a large margin.
