# [From Principle to Practice: Vertical Data Minimization for Machine   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10500)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel vertical data minimization (vDM) workflow for machine learning that aims to limit the amount of detailed personal data collected from individuals. The key idea is to generalize detailed attributes to less granular versions (e.g. specific age to age buckets) that preserve utility for the machine learning task while reducing potential privacy risks. The authors formalize the vDM problem, propose appropriate metrics to measure the privacy-utility tradeoff, and introduce a diverse set of adversarial attack scenarios that aim to reconstruct private attributes. To address this problem, they develop a range of baseline vDM algorithms as well as a novel method called Privacy-aware Tree (PAT) based on decision trees. The authors demonstrate through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets that PAT consistently achieves superior privacy-utility tradeoffs compared to other techniques. A key advantage of the proposed workflow is that after selecting a suitable generalization, no full-resolution personal data needs to be collected during model development or deployment. By open-sourcing their library of methods and evaluation frameworks, the authors take an important step towards establishing standards for operationalizing data minimization principles in machine learning systems.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel vertical data minimization (vDM) workflow for machine learning that aims to collect only the minimal amount of data necessary from clients to train accurate models. The key idea is to generalize detailed personal attributes to lower resolutions (e.g. instead of exact age, use age buckets) such that no full-resolution data needs to be collected. The authors formalize finding optimal generalizations as trading off utility, measured by model accuracy on the generalized data, and empirical privacy risk, measured against a comprehensive set of adversaries aiming to reconstruct private attributes. They propose strong baseline minimization algorithms as well as Privacy-aware Tree (PAT), a decision tree-based algorithm that outperforms baselines on several datasets. Overall, this work provides a principled foundation for vDM research and practice.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a vertical data minimization workflow and algorithm for machine learning that reduces the granularity of collected data to improve privacy while preserving utility, and introduces a set of adversaries to evaluate the privacy risks.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper does not have a single central research question or hypothesis. Instead, it aims to address the following two key questions related to vertical data minimization (vDM) for machine learning:

1) What are the unique privacy challenges posed by data minimization (DM) regulations and why are existing approaches insufficient for addressing them?

2) Can we devise an approach for principled application and evaluation of vDM that addresses these concerns for practical machine learning use-cases?

To answer these questions, the paper formalizes the vDM setting and workflow, defines utility and empirical privacy risk metrics, proposes a set of adversaries to evaluate privacy risk, introduces several vDM algorithms, and performs an extensive experimental evaluation. The overall goal is to lay the foundations for adoption of vDM principles in real-world machine learning applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the area of vertical data minimization (vDM) for machine learning:

1. It formalizes the vDM setting and workflow, proposing to reduce data granularity via generalization functions while ensuring no full-resolution data enters the system after the minimization phase. 

2. It defines a comprehensive set of adversaries to evaluate the empirical privacy risks of vDM solutions, covering reconstruction attacks, linkability, and singling out individuals.

3. It introduces several baseline vDM algorithms as well as a novel algorithm called Privacy-Aware Tree (PAT) which outperforms the baselines.

4. It provides an extensive experimental evaluation, demonstrating the practical viability of vDM on several real-world datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed adversaries, and showing that PAT achieves favorable privacy-utility tradeoffs.

In summary, the main contribution is a principled foundation for vertical data minimization in machine learning, including problem formalization, risk assessment, algorithms, and empirical demonstration of feasibility. The proposed PAT algorithm and adversary set are also key technical contributions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several notable contributions compared to prior work on data minimization for machine learning:

1. It formally defines the vertical data minimization (vDM) setting and problem, including concepts like generalization functions and empirical privacy risk. This provides a clear framework for studying vDM that was lacking before. 

2. It proposes a comprehensive set of adversaries for evaluating the empirical privacy risks of vDM methods. These capture diverse realistic threats like reconstruction, linkability, and singling out attacks. Prior work did not systematically study such risks.

3. It introduces several vDM algorithm baselines, including a novel method called Privacy-Aware Tree (PAT). Experiments across multiple datasets show PAT outperforms prior approaches in terms of privacy-utility tradeoffs.

4. It demonstrates the feasibility of vDM on real-world tasks, showing that substantial data minimization is possible without large utility losses. This helps make the case for adopting vDM principles in practice.

Overall, the paper significantly advances the foundations and understanding of vDM for machine learning. It addresses gaps in problem formalization, evaluation procedures, algorithms, and empirical demonstrations that should benefit and stimulate further research in this policy-relevant direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest four key areas for future work on vertical data minimization (vDM):

1. Combining vDM with other ML privacy topics like differential privacy and secure computation. This includes exploring the interplay between vertical and horizontal data minimization.

2. Adapting vDM methods to other data domains beyond tabular data, such as images or text. 

3. Developing formal privacy guarantees on the utility-fairness tradeoffs of vDM methods. This is noted as a challenging open problem.

4. Developing new vDM algorithms that achieve better utility-privacy tradeoffs than the Privacy-aware Tree (PAT) algorithm proposed in this paper.
