## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper addresses the question of whether chaos exists in partial differential equations (PDEs) and if so, how it can be characterized and analyzed mathematically. The main hypothesis is that techniques from dynamical systems theory used to study chaos in finite-dimensional systems can be extended to infinite-dimensional PDEs. Specifically, the paper aims to develop a systematic theory of chaos for PDEs, with a focus on nonlinear wave equations.

The key elements of the proposed theory include:

- Using Banach spaces as phase spaces for PDEs and defining concepts like fixed points, periodic orbits, invariant manifolds etc. in this setting.

- Extending tools like Poincaré sections, Birkhoff bifurcation theory, and symbolic dynamics to construct chaotic behavior in PDEs. 

- Applying Melnikov analysis to locate chaotic regimes and homoclinic/heteroclinic orbits in perturbations of integrable PDEs.

- Proving the existence of Smale horseshoes and topological conjugacy to Bernoulli shifts for PDEs near transversal homoclinic points.

- Establishing shadowing lemmas to rigorously demonstrate chaos in PDEs evolution operators.

The goal is to show that the signatures and mathematical framework of chaos from finite-dimensional systems translate over to infinite-dimensional PDE systems as well. The paper aims to develop these analogues and provide a foundation for studying chaotic PDEs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a new Lax pair for the 2D Euler equation. The main contributions are:

- It provides a Lax pair formulation for the 2D Euler equation, showing that this equation admits a Lax representation. Having a Lax pair is important as it is a sign of integrability and allows access to techniques from integrable systems theory.

- The paper gives explicit expressions for the L and A operators in the Lax pair. These operators involve the vorticity and stream function of the fluid flow. 

- The Lax pair allows for the development of a Bäcklund transformation (a special type of nonlinear superposition formula) for generating new solutions of the 2D Euler equation from existing ones. The paper develops this Bäcklund transformation.

- The existence of a Lax pair and Bäcklund transformation suggest there could be interesting solution structures like solitons and infinite conserved quantities for the 2D Euler equation. These structures are characteristic of integrable PDEs.

So in summary, the main contribution is introducing a Lax pair structure for the 2D Euler equation and developing the associated Bäcklund transformation. This reveals the 2D Euler equation has an integrable system structure that was not previously known, and opens opportunities to apply integrability techniques to study this important fluid equation. The results suggest that more hidden structure may exist behind the 2D Euler equation.
