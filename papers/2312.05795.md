## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deploying large multimodal models (LMMs) like AntGMM in real-world applications introduces challenges of increased latency (from 85ms to 700ms) and high energy consumption, conflicting with green AI goals. 
- Compressing LMMs is difficult due to the prohibitive cost of retraining them, multi-level redundancy, and complexity of text generation tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- A multi-stage LMM compression strategy involving pruning and distillation to balance efficiency and performance:
  1) Block Pruning: Remove some final blocks to reduce model depth
  2) Inter-Module Pruning: Reduce hidden dimensions of feedforward networks and attention 
  3) Input/Output Pruning: Shrink input/output dimensions of all blocks
- Calculate parameter importance for pruning decisions 
- Custom distillation loss using KL divergence and pairwise loss to enhance text generation capability  

Contributions:
- Constructed Multimodal Advertisement Audition Dataset (MAAD) from Alipay
- Reduced AntGMM size by 18x and improved inference by 7.7x with marginal 0.8% performance drop
- Achieved 90ms latency online (700ms originally), estimated 75 million kWh less annual electricity 
- Framework adopted in Alipay for 3 months since Sept 2023, maintaining performance while significantly enhancing efficiency
- Demonstrated effectiveness of multi-stage compression strategy for deploying LMMs aligned with green AI goals


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a multi-stage compression strategy for large multimodal models to achieve substantial reduction in model size and latency while maintaining performance through small data finetuning, multilayer pruning, and specialized distillation loss design.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose a novel multi-stage compression strategy for compressing large multimodal models like AntGMM. The strategy involves multiple stages - block pruning, inter-module dimension pruning, and input/output dimension pruning - to tackle redundancy at different levels of the model.

2) To address the challenges of compressing generative models, the authors introduce innovations like using small training datasets, a multi-stage approach to prune different levels of redundancy, and a specialized distillation loss design for sequential token generation tasks.  

3) The authors construct a new dataset called the Multimodal Advertisement Audition Dataset (MAAD) using real-world data from Alipay. They use this dataset to evaluate their compression strategy on an industry-relevant multimodal task.

4) The proposed compression strategy is deployed in Alipay's production environment for over 3 months. It reduces latency from 700ms to 90ms and is estimated to save 75 million kWh of electricity consumption annually, showing the practical impact.

In summary, the main contribution is a multi-stage compression strategy tailored to large multimodal models that maintains accuracy while improving efficiency, as demonstrated by both offline evaluations and real-world deployment. The innovations in distillation loss design and the new MAAD dataset are also notable contributions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions three key challenges when compressing generative language models. Can you elaborate on why retraining language models is cost-prohibitive and how the proposed method addresses this challenge?

2. The multi-stage pruning approach tackles redundancy at different levels. Can you explain why identifying multi-level redundancy in one shot would negatively impact performance? How does the staged approach avoid this issue?

3. The distillation loss function incorporates a pairwise loss term. What is the rationale behind this design choice? How does it help address the complexities of sequential token generation?

4. The experiments utilize a proprietary Multimodal Advertisement Audition Dataset (MAAD). What are some of the key characteristics and tasks contained in this dataset? Why was an internal business-focused dataset needed?

5. The multi-stage compression strategy balances model performance and efficiency. What metrics were used to evaluate this balance both in the experiments and in the online operational deployment?

6. Could you analyze the trends in model accuracy, latency, and electricity consumption savings at each pruning stage? What do these trends reveal about the compression technique?

7. One experiment compared single-level vs multi-stage pruning. Why would pruning at only one level fail to preserve model performance during compression of large multimodal models?

8. How does the sample size used for knowledge distillation correlate with final model accuracy? What reasons account for this correlation? What was the sample size chosen for the deployed model?

9. What modifications were made to the distillation loss function design compared to standard approaches? How do these innovations address the intricacies of generative tasks?

10. The proposed compression technique maintained online performance over three months. How did the accuracy and latency metrics compare between the compressed model and alternative approaches? What business impacts did this improved efficiency have?
