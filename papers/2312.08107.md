# [Causal Optimal Transport of Abstractions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08107)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces COTA, a novel method for learning causal abstraction maps from observational and interventional data without assuming complete knowledge of the underlying causal models. COTA formulates the problem as a multi-marginal optimal transport optimization with constraints based on do-calculus and a cost function informed by the abstraction mapping. Specifically, COTA leverages interventional data to construct joint distributions between base and abstract models, enforces consistency between distributions via do-calculus constraints, and uses the abstraction mapping to define a meaningful cost. A key theoretical result is proving the convexity of COTA, guaranteeing an optimal solution. Experiments on synthetic datasets and a real-world electric battery manufacturing task demonstrate COTA's ability to learn superior abstractions compared to non-causal and independent solutions. Further tests showcase the sensitivity of COTA's informed cost to the diversity of interventions and its effectiveness as a data augmentation technique to improve performance on downstream tasks. Overall, COTA advances the state-of-the-art in learning interpretable and consistent abstractions between causal models directly from data.
