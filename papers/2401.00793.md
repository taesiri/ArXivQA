# [SecFormer: Towards Fast and Accurate Privacy-Preserving Inference for   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00793)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models hosted on cloud platforms for inference services raise major privacy concerns regarding sensitive user data and model parameters. 
- Using Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) for Privacy-Preserving Inference (PPI) leads to considerable slowdowns and performance declines due to the abundance of nonlinear operations (e.g. Softmax, GeLU, LayerNorm) in Transformer models which are inefficient and difficult to optimize in SMPC.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose SecFormer, an optimization framework for PPI with Transformers that balances performance and efficiency.

- Model Design Optimization:
    - Eliminates expensive exponential and max operations in Softmax using multiplication/division approximations.
    - Employs knowledge distillation, with original Transformer as teacher and approximate Transformer as student, to regain performance lost from approximations while retaining SMPC compatibility.

- SMPC Protocol Design Optimization: 
    - Novel privacy-preserving GeLU algorithm based on segmented polynomials, enhancing efficiency.
    - Efficient algorithms for Softmax and LayerNorm using Goldschmidt's method and input deflation to avoid nonlinear initial value computations.

Main Contributions:
- SecFormer outperforms prior state-of-the-art PPI methods, improving performance by 5.6% and 24.2% over MPCFormer for BERT-Base and BERT-Large respectively.
- It demonstrates 3.4x and 3.2x speedup over Puma for BERT-Base and BERT-Large, highlighting efficiency gains.
- Establishes new state-of-the-art in balancing performance and efficiency for PPI with Transformers, while ensuring privacy.
- Holds promise for scaling to larger language models while meeting privacy, accuracy and latency requirements.

In summary, SecFormer strategically optimizes both the Transformer model design and the SMPC protocols to develop an advanced PPI solution that sets a new bar for performance and efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

SecFormer is a framework that optimizes both the Transformer model design and SMPC protocol design to achieve an optimal balance between performance and efficiency for privacy-preserving inference of Transformer models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting SecFormer, a comprehensive optimization framework for privacy-preserving inference (PPI) of Transformer models. SecFormer combines optimizations in both SMPC protocol design and Transformer model design to achieve better efficiency and performance trade-offs in PPI compared to prior works. Specifically:

1) In model design, SecFormer eliminates expensive exponential and maximum operations in the Softmax layer via approximations while preserving accuracy through knowledge distillation. 

2) In protocol design, SecFormer proposes efficient SMPC algorithms for handling nonlinear operations like GeLU, LayerNorm, and Softmax using techniques like segmented polynomials and Goldschmidt's method.

3) Experiments show SecFormer matches the performance of state-of-the-art protocol optimization methods while achieving 3.2-3.4x speedup over state-of-the-art model optimization methods. Thus it strikes an optimal balance between performance and efficiency for PPI of Transformers.

In summary, SecFormer advances PPI for Transformers by synergistically co-optimizing both the model architecture and the secure computation protocols to achieve better efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
