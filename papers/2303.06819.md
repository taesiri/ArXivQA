# [TranSG: Transformer-Based Skeleton Graph Prototype Contrastive Learning   with Structure-Trajectory Prompted Reconstruction for Person   Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06819)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn effective representations from skeleton graphs for person re-identification (re-ID). Specifically, the paper proposes a new approach called TranSG to:

1) Fully capture relations within skeleton graphs, including body structure and motion patterns, and integrate them into graph representations. 

2) Learn the most discriminative and identity-related features (graph prototypes) via contrastive learning on both the skeleton and sequence levels.

3) Exploit spatial-temporal contexts of skeleton graphs to prompt the reconstruction of structure and trajectory, for capturing richer semantics and patterns.

The key hypothesis is that by integrating skeletal relation learning, graph prototype contrastive learning, and graph structure-trajectory prompted reconstruction, the proposed TranSG approach can learn superior graph representations for skeleton-based person re-ID compared to existing methods. Experiments demonstrate that TranSG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.
