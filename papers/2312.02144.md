## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel method to automatically generate optimal camera configurations, including camera locations, orientations, and fields-of-view, for multi-view pedestrian detection systems. The key innovation is a transformer-based camera configuration generator that interacts with a simulation environment to explore vast combinations of camera placements and searches for those that maximize detection accuracy on a training dataset. Specifically, the generator predicts the configuration of the next camera in a sequential manner, while a reinforcement learning scheme based on PPO trains it to maximize the final multi-view detection performance. Additional regularization terms encourage camera diversity and focus. Experiments across various simulated urban scenes demonstrate that the learned generator consistently finds better configurations than random search, heuristic methods, and even human experts, by mastering techniques like maximizing coverage, minimizing occlusion, and enabling collaboration between views. The proposed framework sheds light on automatically designing camera systems for complex recognition tasks.
