# [StateFlow: Enhancing LLM Task-Solving through State-Driven Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11322)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to solve complex, multi-step tasks that require sequences of reasoning and interaction with tools/environments. However, it is challenging to reliably track and control LLMs' progress and decisions throughout such long task-solving processes. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes StateFlow, a framework that models LLM task-solving workflows as finite state machines. Key ideas:

- Conceptualize task-solving process as transitions through different states, each representing progress status.  
- In each state, execute predefined actions like prompting LLM, calling tools. Output functions depend on full context history.
- State transitions controlled dynamically based on LLM outputs, tool feedback, explicit checks.
- Enables precise tracking and control over LLM during complex workflows.

The paper also proposes SF_Agent, where different LLM agents perform specialized actions in different states. Reduces context history length.

Contributions:
1) Proposes StateFlow and SF_Agent to model LLM workflows as state machines for enhanced control and efficiency.
2) Guidelines provided on constructing models based on understanding workflows.
3) Evaluation on SQL and Bash tasks shows StateFlow improves success rates over baselines by 6-10% and reduces cost by 3-6x.
4) Case study illustrates identifying and constructing workflow from SQL task into StateFlow model. Refining baselines with this workflow also improves performance.

In summary, modeling LLM workflows as state machines enables precise tracking and control over complex task solving processes, enhancing efficiency and performance. The state-based paradigm offers promising capabilities for advancing LLM-based problem solving.
