# [Distinguishing the Knowable from the Unknowable with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03563)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit both epistemic uncertainty (due to lack of knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (due to inherent entropy in the distribution). It is useful to distinguish between these two types of uncertainty, as epistemic uncertainty in LLM generations could potentially be addressed to reduce issues like factual hallucinations. However, the ground truth probabilities are unknown in free-form text, making this challenging.

Proposed Solution:
Use a significantly larger LLM as a proxy for the ground truth distribution. Identify tokens where a small LLM is uncertain but the large LLM is highly confident as instances of epistemic uncertainty for the small model. Train classifiers on embeddings from the small LLM to predict when this will occur. Also propose an unsupervised method based on in-context learning.

Key Contributions:
- Show that small linear probes can accurately predict when a large LLM will be confident, based only on activations from a smaller LLM (AUC > 0.9). Transfers between domains.
- Propose unsupervised method based on in-context learning that elicits how "suggestible" LLMs are to hints. Achieves non-trivial accuracy on predicting large LLM confidence.
- First steps toward identifying epistemic uncertainty in free-form text generations, which could potentially improve reliability of LLMs.

The work demonstrates that LLMs contain internal representations of different types of uncertainty that could be leveraged to make their confidence estimates more informative in practical settings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies methods for distinguishing between epistemic uncertainty (reflecting a lack of knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness) in the outputs of large language models, using larger models as a proxy for ground truth.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing methods to identify epistemic (knowledge-based) uncertainty in the outputs of large language models over free-form text. Specifically:

1) They show that small linear probes trained on the embeddings of frozen, pretrained models can accurately predict when larger models will be more confident at the token level. These probes transfer between text domains, suggesting they rely on robust internal representations of uncertainty.

2) They propose an unsupervised method inspired by in-context learning that achieves non-trivial accuracy at identifying tokens where a larger model is confident but a smaller one is uncertain. 

3) They interpret these results as evidence that LLMs naturally contain internal representations of different types of uncertainty that could potentially be leveraged to improve model confidence estimates in diverse settings.

The key innovation is using the discrepancy between small and large LLM confidence as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty in the absence of ground truth, and showing this signal can be elicited with both supervised and unsupervised methods. The paper demonstrates a proof of concept for distinguishing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in free-form text generation.

 Based on a review of the paper's content, some of the main keywords or key terms appear to be:

- Out-of-distribution generalization

The paper discusses methods for distinguishing between epistemic uncertainty (reflecting a model's lack of knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (inherent entropy) in the outputs of large language models. It explores using larger models as a proxy for ground truth probabilities, and training linear probes or using unsupervised techniques to try to identify when smaller models exhibit epistemic uncertainty. The key themes relate to representing, identifying, and leveraging different types of uncertainty in LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper explores using a larger language model as a "proxy for the ground truth" to label tokens in a smaller model as having epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty. What are some potential issues with relying on a larger model in this way rather than true ground truth labels? How could the noise introduced impact results?

2. The linear probes trained on embeddings from the smaller models transfer reasonably well out-of-domain (e.g. from Wikipedia to code). Does this suggest the probes are identifying some general notion of "epistemic uncertainty" rather than relying on superficial cues? What further experiments could help validate this? 

3. The unsupervised ICLT method seems promising but appears to sometimes fail in cases that seem ambiguous even to humans. What could be done to make the method more robust in these gray area cases? Are there ways to quantify or account for "partial copying" behavior?

4. The authors use a binary classification setup with a gap between label bins to simplify the initial experiment. How might removing this gap impact performance? Would a regression setup always be preferable? What are the tradeoffs?

5. What mechanisms could explain why language models might form useful internal representations of epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty during pretraining? Do the authors' hypotheses seem convincing?  

6. The paper hints that identifying epistemic uncertainty could help reduce factual hallucinations. Concretely, how would a system leveraging these methods accomplish that? What interventions would be enabled and how impactful could they be?

7. Why does the ICLT method fail for Pythia models? The authors speculate it could relate to differences in separation tokens - does this seem plausible? What experiments could further test this?

8. How scalable are the proposed methods to much larger models, like 100B+ parameter models? Would noise introduced by epistemic uncertainty in the "large" model eventually overwhelm the signal?

9. The authors filter data heavily to construct balanced binary classification tasks. How do the methods perform on highly imbalanced real-world data? Are the classifiers precise for rare minority cases?

10. What role could ensemble-based uncertainty quantification techniques play in conjunction with or as an alternative to the authors' approach? What are the tradeoffs of each method?
