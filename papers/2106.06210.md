# [Learning to Pool in Graph Neural Networks for Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06210)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to design a pooling function for graph neural networks (GNNs) that enables effective generalization and extrapolation to out-of-distribution data. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new pooling function called Generalized Norm-based Pooling (GNP) and hypothesizes that simply using this pooling function in place of commonly used ones like sum, max, or mean will allow GNNs to extrapolate much better on a variety of graph-based tasks.

The key ideas are:

- Existing choices of pooling functions like sum, max, etc. act as strong inductive biases that make GNNs fail to generalize out-of-distribution without careful tuning per task.

- GNP is a flexible pooling function that can approximate many useful pooling behaviors based on learning the parameters p and q.

- By using GNP, GNNs can learn the right pooling behavior for a task in an end-to-end manner, avoiding the need to hand-design the pooling per task.

- This allows GNNs with GNP to successfully extrapolate on tasks where fixed choices like sum or max fail.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed GNP pooling function can enable effective extrapolation across diverse graph-based tasks when used as a drop-in replacement for standard pooling choices. The paper empirically verifies this hypothesis through experiments on graph classification, node classification, and set-based tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new pooling function called Generalized Norm-based Pooling (GNP) for graph neural networks. The key points are:

- GNP is a trainable and flexible pooling function that generalizes common pooling operations like sum, mean, max, and min. It is formulated as an L^p norm-like function with learnable parameters p and q.

- GNP can be applied to arbitrary graph neural network architectures and tasks with minimal overhead. It is designed to improve the generalization and extrapolation ability of GNNs. 

- The paper demonstrates through extensive experiments on node, graph and set prediction tasks that simply replacing standard pooling with GNP enables GNNs to successfully extrapolate to out-of-distribution data.

- GNP is shown to often perform comparably or better than carefully hand-designed pooling choices for each task. It can learn to approximate the ideal pooling function for a given task automatically.

- The paper introduces techniques like splitting positive/negative p and using different learning rates to stabilize the training of GNP.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a simple yet flexible pooling function GNP that can improve generalization of GNNs across diverse tasks, requiring minimal architecture changes. The effectiveness of GNP for extrapolation is demonstrated through extensive experiments.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new learnable pooling function called Generalized Norm-based Pooling (GNP) that can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing pooling functions in graph neural networks to improve their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some ways this paper on learning to pool in graph neural networks for extrapolation compares to other related research:

- This paper proposes a new pooling method called Generalized Norm-based Pooling (GNP) that can be applied to graph neural networks for improved extrapolation. Other research has proposed different pooling methods, but GNP is novel in its use of a trainable norm-based approach that generalizes common pooling functions like sum, mean, max, etc.

- A key contribution is showing that proper choice of pooling is crucial for graph neural networks to extrapolate well to out-of-distribution data. This builds on recent work by Xu et al. (2021) that highlighted the importance of pooling choices for extrapolation. This paper provides a method to learn good pooling functions.

- Compared to other learning-based pooling methods, GNP is more generic and task-agnostic rather than being tailored to specific applications. The focus is on improving extrapolation ability rather than just interpolation performance on particular tasks.

- The paper provides both theoretical analysis showing conditions where GNP can extrapolate, as well as extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic graph data demonstrating strong extrapolation ability. This provides broader empirical evidence compared to prior work.

- The training techniques proposed to stabilize GNP training are novel compared to prior norm-based pooling approaches. This enables effective end-to-end learning of the pooling function parameters.

In summary, this paper advances the state-of-the-art in graph neural network pooling functions, with a novel method that is both more flexible and better able to extrapolate than prior approaches. The theoretical and empirical analyses of the extrapolation abilities are more comprehensive than related works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

1. Develop theoretical arguments regarding under what conditions models constructed with GNP will extrapolate well. The authors showed empirically that GNP enables models to extrapolate on a variety of tasks, but did not provide theoretical analysis on when and why it works. Developing a more rigorous understanding could be an interesting direction.

2. Apply and evaluate GNP on other graph-based and set-based tasks. The authors demonstrated GNP on several node-level, graph-level and set-related tasks, but only scratched the surface. Testing it on a wider range of applications could reveal new insights. 

3. Investigate other methods to stabilize and improve training of GNP. The authors proposed techniques to address training difficulties with GNP, but more work could be done to make training even more stable and enable faster convergence.

4. Study how the components of GNP (GNP+ and GNP-) balance and interact. The authors showed empirically that one component tends to dominate, but further analysis on their interplay could lead to improvements.

5. Apply ideas from GNP to other permutation-invariant functions beyond pooling. The flexibility and learning aspect of GNP could have broader applicability.

6. Explore extending GNP to handle variable sized inputs. The current formulation of GNP assumes fixed sized node sets, which could be generalized.

7. Examine combinations of GNP with known pooling functions. Integrating GNP with common pooling functions like sum, mean, max rather than replacing them entirely may be fruitful.

In summary, the authors highlighted opportunities to better understand GNP theoretically, apply it to more applications, improve training, analyze its components, generalize its ideas, and combine it with other techniques. Advancing these research directions could further demonstrate and extend the usefulness of learned pooling functions like GNP.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new pooling function called Generalized Norm-based Pooling (GNP) for graph neural networks. GNP is based on an L^p norm formulation that allows negative p values, making it more flexible than prior norm-based pooling approaches. A key benefit of GNP is that it can be readily applied to arbitrary graph learning tasks as both an aggregation and readout function, with minimal overhead. Through experiments on node, graph, and set prediction tasks, the authors demonstrate that simply using GNP consistently enables graph networks to successfully extrapolate to out-of-distribution data. Remarkably, GNP sometimes even outperforms carefully hand-designed pooling choices. Theoretically, GNP generalizes common pooling operations like sum, mean, max, and min. Empirically, GNP is shown to effectively learn to approximate the ideal pooling function for a given task when one exists. Overall, GNP provides a simple yet powerful pooling formulation to improve graph network generalization.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular approach for deep learning on graph-structured data. They have shown state-of-the-art performance on tasks like drug discovery, social network analysis, and chip design. However, recent work has found that the choice of pooling functions used for aggregation and readout operations in GNNs is crucial for enabling them to generalize to out-of-distribution data. Without proper choices for these pooling functions, which vary by task, GNNs can completely fail to extrapolate. But with a huge number of potential pooling functions, it is unclear how to select the right ones a priori. 

This paper proposes a new pooling method called Generalized Norm-based Pooling (GNP) that can be applied to any GNN architecture. GNP formulates pooling as an L^p norm-like function with learnable parameters p and q. It generalizes common pooling functions like sum, mean, max, and min. Through experiments on graph-level, node-level, and set-related tasks, the authors show GNP can identify proper pooling functions to enable successful extrapolation. By simply using GNP for all pooling operations, GNNs extrapolated as well or better than carefully choosing the best pooling function per task. GNP provides a generic, flexible pooling function to improve GNN generalization.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a $L^p$ norm-like pooling function called Generalized Norm-based Pooling (GNP) that can be applied to graph neural networks (GNNs) for any task. GNP has learnable parameters p and q that allow it to express a wide range of pooling operations, including common ones like sum, mean, max, and min pooling. It splits into a positive part GNP+ with p>0 and a negative part GNP- with p<0 to stably switch between positive and negative p values. GNP can replace existing pooling functions in GNNs with minimal overhead. The authors propose techniques to stabilize training of GNP. They show empirically that GNNs equipped with GNP can successfully extrapolate to out-of-distribution graphs on a variety of synthetic and real-world graph-level, node-level, and set-related tasks. The flexibility of GNP allows the GNNs to learn proper pooling functions for each task that lead to good generalization.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of how to enable graph neural networks (GNNs) to generalize well on out-of-distribution data. Specifically, it focuses on the importance of the choice of pooling functions used in GNNs for aggregation and readout operations, and how this impacts the ability of GNNs to extrapolate to unseen data.

The key questions the paper aims to address are:

- How can we design pooling functions to make GNNs successfully extrapolate to out-of-distribution data?

- Is it possible to have a generic pooling function that works well across different tasks, instead of needing to carefully choose different pooling functions for each task? 

- Can we develop a flexible pooling function that generalizes most existing pooling functions and can be optimized in an end-to-end manner?

The paper proposes a new pooling function called Generalized Norm-based Pooling (GNP) to address these questions. GNP is formulated as a trainable $L^p$ norm-like function that includes most commonly used pooling functions as special cases. The paper shows experimentally that simply using GNP consistently enables GNNs to extrapolate well on a variety of tasks, avoiding the need to hand-pick pooling functions.

In summary, the key contribution is a new pooling method that provides a generic and flexible way to make GNNs successfully generalize to out-of-distribution data across tasks. This addresses the limitation of prior work which showed the importance of pooling function choice but provided no clear principles or methods for how to select good pooling functions.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a novel pooling method called Generalized Norm-based Pooling (GNP) to improve the ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to extrapolate to out-of-distribution data. The key contributions are:

1) GNP is a flexible pooling function inspired by Lp norms that can express most existing pooling operations like sum, mean, max, and min as special cases. It has two components - GNP+ for positive p and GNP- for negative p, allowing it to smoothly interpolate between different behaviors. 

2) GNP can be applied to arbitrary tasks and improves GNNs' extrapolation ability with minimal overhead. Theoretically, they show a 1-layer GNN with GNP can extrapolate on a harmonic task while standard GNNs fail. Empirically, GNNs with GNP successfully extrapolate on 9 graph, node and set tasks, comparable or better than carefully-chosen baselines.

3) They propose training techniques like input masking, separate learning rates, and clipping to make GNP training stable. Experiments confirm GNP can imitate ideal pooling like sum or max on suitable tasks.

4) On real-world graph classification and influence maximization, just replacing standard pooling in SAGPool, ASAPool, and MONSTOR with GNP improves performance, showing the benefits of learnable pooling.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions by proposing GNP, a flexible and end-to-end learnable pooling method to improve GNNs' generalization ability. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments on diverse tasks validate GNP's effectiveness for extrapolation. The techniques introduced also enable stable training of GNP.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new graph neural network pooling function called Generalized Norm-based Pooling (GNP). GNP is a trainable pooling function that generalizes common pooling functions like sum, mean, max, and min. The key idea is to formulate pooling as an L^p norm-like function, where p is a learnable parameter. By training p in an end-to-end fashion on a given task, GNP can learn to effectively aggregate node features in a graph and produce graph-level representations. The authors show how GNP expresses various standard pooling functions as special cases. They also introduce techniques to stabilize training when learning p. Through extensive experiments on node classification, graph classification, and combinatorial optimization tasks, the authors demonstrate that simply replacing standard pooling functions with GNP enables graph neural networks to generalize well to out-of-distribution graphs at test time. The proposed GNP pooling provides a flexible and practical solution for learning graph representations that can extrapolate.
