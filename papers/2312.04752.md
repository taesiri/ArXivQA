# [A Test-Time Learning Approach to Reparameterize the Geophysical Inverse   Problem with a Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04752)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Geophysical inversions, which estimate subsurface physical property models from geophysical measurements, are ill-posed inverse problems that require regularization to obtain reasonable solutions. Conventional methods use explicit regularization terms, but recently there has been interest in exploring implicit regularization effects from deep neural networks. This paper explores using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to parameterize the inverse problem for DC resistivity data to provide an implicit regularization effect.

Methods:
The authors propose a test-time learning approach called Deep Image Prior Inversion (DIP-Inv) where a CNN with random weights maps an arbitrary input vector to a conductivity model defined on the model mesh. This model is fed into the DC resistivity forward simulation to compute predicted data. The CNN weights are updated to minimize an objective function with a data misfit term and a smallness regularization term relative to a reference model. No explicit spatial smoothness term is used since the CNN architecture is hypothesized to provide an implicit smoothness effect.

Contributions:
- Compare DIP-Inv to conventional inversions on synthetic examples. DIP-Inv better recovers dipping structures and distinguishes compact bodies in close proximity, showing usefulness of implicit regularization.
- Demonstrate the bilinear upsampling layers in the CNN provide significant smoothing effects. Adding dropout layers can also improve recovery. 
- Provide implementation details for connecting the PyTorch neural network with the SimPEG forward simulation.

In summary, the paper illustrates the potential of using a CNN to parameterize the model space in a Tikhonov-style geophysical inversion, allowing the CNN architecture to provide an implicit regularization effect. Key components providing the smoothing effect are identified. This approach could be extended to other inversion problems.
