# [PIPsUS: Self-Supervised Dense Point Tracking in Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04969)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Finding point-level correspondences in ultrasound (US) images over time can enable tracking of landmarks for image guidance in surgeries. However, most existing tracking methods were designed for RGB images, not US images, leading to suboptimal performance. 
- Supervised training requires expensive ground truth labels. Unsupervised methods have only been validated on a small number of landmarks.
- Optical flow methods only consider consecutive frames so are sensitive to drift.

Proposed Solution:
- A new model called PIPsUS to track an arbitrary number of points in US by modeling points as moving particles.
- Utilizes both feature correlation across frames and motion history to improve tracking.
- A self-supervised training strategy:
    - Use point trajectories from teacher model PIPs++ (designed for RGB) as pseudo labels to supervise PIPsUS.
    - Also use simulated US videos with known transformations as extra supervision.

Main Contributions:
- First report of a particle video model adapted to enable dense point tracking in US images.
- A streaming architecture that aggregates information across frames while keeping compute constant.
- A self-supervised training strategy utilizing a RGB tracking model to supervise a US model, along with simulated data.
- Demonstrated higher accuracy than baseline optical flow methods on US datasets from neck surgery and echocardiograms.

In summary, this paper presents a novel streaming dense point tracking model for ultrasound images, trained in a self-supervised manner, that achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy. The key innovation is aggregating information across frames to improve robustness.
