# [Y-Diagonal Couplings: Approximating Posteriors with Conditional   Wasserstein Distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13433)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In Bayesian inverse problems, generative models often learn an approximation to the posterior by minimizing some distance between the joint measure $P_{Y,X}$ and an approximating joint measure $P_{Y,G_\theta}$. 
- For the KL divergence, minimizing the joint KL implies minimizing the expected KL between posteriors due to the chain rule. However, this does not hold for the Wasserstein distance in general.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce a conditional Wasserstein distance $W_{p,Y}$ which restricts couplings to be diagonal along the observation variable Y.
- Show that minimizing $W_{p,Y}$ equals minimizing the expected Wasserstein distance between posteriors.
- Derive a dual representation for $W_{1,Y}$ to motivate conditional Wasserstein GAN objectives rigorously.
- Identify conditions when minimizing the joint Wasserstein distance suffices to get posterior convergence guarantees.

Contributions:
- Formal definition and analysis of conditional Wasserstein distance $W_{p,Y}$.
- Establishing connection between $W_{p,Y}$ and expected posterior error to motivate use in Bayesian inverse problems.  
- Derivation of conditional Wasserstein GAN dual that gives more regularity than previous works.
- Sufficient conditions for when joint Wasserstein distance optimizes posterior distance.
- Numerical experiments validating theory and showing posterior approximation capabilities.

In summary, the paper provides theoretical justification for using conditional generative models to approximate Bayesian posteriors by introducing the conditional Wasserstein metric $W_{p,Y}$. The analysis and experiments support the usefulness of this metric in Bayesian inverse problems.
