# [Global-guided Focal Neural Radiance Field for Large-scale Scene   Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12839)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Applying neural radiance fields (NeRF) to render large-scale scenes typically results in significant artifacts and blurred rendering due to NeRF's limited model capacity. Existing methods address this issue by partitioning the scene into blocks handled by separate sub-NeRFs. However, these sub-NeRFs are trained independently from scratch leading to inconsistencies across the scene in geometry and appearance. Consequently, the rendering quality fails to improve much despite expanding model capacity.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a global-guided focal neural radiance field (GF-NeRF) to achieve high-fidelity rendering of large-scale scenes. The key idea is to utilize a two-stage architecture:

1) Global Stage: Employs a hash encoder to obtain a coarse, continuous representation of the entire scene.

2) Focal Stage: Partitions the scene into blocks with distinct sub-encoders to capture fine-grained details. 

Additionally, a global-guided training strategy is used where the sub-encoders are fine-tuned based on the global encoder to reduce training complexity and maintain consistency. Spatial and error information from global stage also guides training in focal stage to focus on crucial areas.

Main Contributions:

1) A global and focal architecture that expands NeRF capacity while maintaining global consistency.

2) A global-guided training strategy that fully utilizes rich priors from the global stage to guide focal stage training.

3) Demonstrates high-fidelity, natural rendering results on large-scale street-view and aerial-view datasets, outperforming existing methods.

The key advantage is that it does not rely on any scene-specific priors, making it adaptable to various large-scale scene types. The global guidance helps focus on important areas and reduces training complexity in focal stage while ensuring consistency.
