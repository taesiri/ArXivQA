# [View Transition based Dual Camera Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11184)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Smartphones nowadays have dual camera systems with a wide-angle (W) camera and a telephoto (T) camera. The T camera has higher image quality but smaller field-of-view compared to the W camera. 
- In the overlap region between the W and T cameras, fusing the images from the two cameras can generate a higher quality image.
- However, due to different views of the W and T cameras, there exist many occlusion regions where objects are visible in one view but not the other. Enhancing these occlusion regions using pixels from the T image is an ill-posed problem and difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Existing methods align and fuse the T image to the W image view, but the occlusion regions still lack high-quality references from the T image, limiting the enhancement quality.
- The key insight is that since the W and T cameras are closely arranged in phones, users may not care if the fused image is in the W view or T view.
- The paper proposes a view transition method to transform both W and T images to meet in a mixed middle view in the overlap region.
- In the center region, the T view is used to minimize occlusions. In the boundary regions, the W view is kept to maintain consistency with areas outside the overlap region. And there is smooth transition between the boundary and central regions.

Main Contributions:
- The view transition strategy effectively reduces occlusion areas, allowing incorporating more high-quality pixels from the T image to improve the fusion result, while avoiding apparent shape distortions.
- By adjusting optical flow vectors and image warping, the method transforms the W and T images to the target mixed view.
- Experiments show the proposed method reduces occlusions substantially compared to traditional fusion in W view, and achieves the best image quality.

In summary, the key novelty is the view transition concept to meet the W and T images in a mixed view that minimizes occlusions and blends more T image content, generating a higher quality fusion result in the overlap region.
