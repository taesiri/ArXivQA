## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A Survey of Privacy Threats and Defense in Vertical Federated Learning: From Model Life Cycle Perspective":

Problem: 
Vertical federated learning (VFL) enables collaborative machine learning without sharing raw data. However, it is susceptible to various privacy attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the collaborative learning process to infer sensitive information. Understanding privacy risks and developing effective defenses are critical for the widespread adoption of VFL.

Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of privacy attacks and defenses in VFL, structured around the machine learning life cycle stages: data preprocessing, model training, model deployment, and model inference. 

Key contributions:

1) Compares privacy considerations in VFL and horizontal FL, showing VFL's increased risks.

2) Proposes taxonomies to characterize privacy attacks (based on goal, knowledge, behavior/capability) and defenses (cryptographic vs non-cryptographic).

3) Reviews state-of-the-art privacy attacks targeting VFL, categorized as:
- Label inference attacks 
- Feature inference attacks
- Model extraction attacks

4) Surveys defense strategies against these attacks, including:
- Cryptographic: homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation
- Non-cryptographic: differential privacy, data obfuscation, adversarial training

5) Structures discussion of attacks and defenses based on VFL phases, offering guidance to protect privacy across the model's life cycle. 

6) Identifies research gaps and challenges regarding multi-party VFL, tree models, limitations of defenses, end-to-end privacy, and suggests future directions.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive characterization and analysis of the landscape of privacy threats and defense strategies in VFL, guiding future research to enable secure and practical VFL deployments.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this survey paper on privacy attacks and defenses in vertical federated learning:

1. The paper categorizes defenses as either cryptographic or non-cryptographic. What are some of the key differences between these two types of defenses in terms of their capabilities and limitations? How can they potentially be combined for more robust privacy protection?

2. The paper discusses the use of homomorphic encryption (HE) as a cryptographic defense. What are some of the main challenges and tradeoffs involved in applying HE schemes to secure vertical federated learning? How can these issues be addressed? 

3. The paper highlights adversarial training (AT) as a non-cryptographic defense strategy. What novel adversarial objectives could be incorporated into the training process to specifically counter potential attacks that exploit vertical federated learning's unique vulnerabilities?

4. The taxonomy includes attack strategies like prediction inversion and intermediate result inversion. What modifications would need to be made to these strategies to effectively attack tree-based models commonly used in vertical federated learning? 

5. The paper notes gaps around understanding privacy risks in multi-party vertical federated learning settings. What new attack vectors could colluding adversaries in a multi-party setting potentially exploit? How can defenses be enhanced to protect against such collusion threats?

6. Functional encryption (FE) is discussed as an emerging cryptographic technique with promise for vertical federated learning privacy. What optimizations would be needed to make FE schemes practical for defending real-world vertical federated learning deployments?

7. What kinds of new validation methodologies could be developed to effectively evaluate the robustness of privacy defenses against adaptive attackers who alter their strategies in response?

8. The paper suggests self-supervised learning as a route to improve both model utility and privacy. What types of analysis could be done to quantify privacy gains and justify any tradeoffs around utility?  

9. How can existing privacy auditing techniques be customized and extended to provide quantitative assessments of privacy risks and protections unique to the vertical federated learning setting?

10. What kinds of incentives could encourage participants to adopt privacy protections that introduce efficiency costs? Are there ways to optimize cryptographic defenses to reduce this tradeoff between privacy and efficiency?
