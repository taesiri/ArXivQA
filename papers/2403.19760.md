# [Leveraging Counterfactual Paths for Contrastive Explanations of POMDP   Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19760)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- As AI systems are increasingly adopted, explaining their reasoning and behavior is important for transparency and trust. 
- Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a useful framework for planning under uncertainty, but their solutions can seem unintuitive and lack transparency.
- Prior work on explainable planning has limitations in leveraging user feedback and providing contrastive explanations comparing algorithm vs user reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a method to generate contrastive explanations for POMDP policies using user-provided counterfactual paths. 
- User draws an alternative path they expected/preferred. This is translated into an open-loop policy.
- Compare features expectations of user policy vs original (optimal) policy. Features relate to objectives that compose reward function.
- Explain why original policy performs better in expectation over features that matter most.

Contributions:
- Way to incorporate user feedback as counterfactuals for contrastive explanations of POMDP policies.
- Use feature expectations to summarize and compare performance of alternative policies.
- Provide explanatory power while limiting burden on user.
- Demonstrate approach in SAR domain, with explanations relating to uncertainty, observability of objectives, and problem constraints.

The paper overall presents a novel method to make POMDP policy solutions more interpretable to users through contrastive explanations based on user-provided alternative paths and feature expectation analysis.
