# [Towards Explaining Satellite Based Poverty Predictions with   Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00416)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores using low-resolution daytime satellite images with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict wealth levels in Tanzania. The CNN is first trained to predict nighttime light intensity, then the CNN features are used in a regression model to estimate a wealth index. This approach achieves a high accuracy with an R^2 of 0.67, outperforming human experts viewing high-resolution satellite images. Several explainability techniques are then applied to understand what features the CNN uses for prediction. Shuffling image tiles and frequency filtering indicate small details 20-30 meters in size are most important. Lab color space analysis shows prediction works even with only one color cluster kept intact. Guided Grad-CAM highlights small infrastructure features like roads and buildings as driving the CNN output. Overall, the number of these small man-made structures in the image, rather than color or materials, appears essential for the wealth prediction. This demonstrates an impressive capability to estimate economic prosperity from low-resolution satellite data that should be further analyzed to enable policy applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores using convolutional neural networks to predict wealth index from low-resolution satellite images of Tanzania, finding that small details like roads and buildings enable good predictions that outperform human evaluators looking at high-resolution images, with experiments indicating predictions are based on the number of such infrastructure elements detected in images rather than specific materials.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is using multiple explainability methods to provide insights into what features a convolutional neural network bases its predictions of wealth index on when using low-resolution satellite images as input. The key findings are:

1) Small details around 20-30 meters in size, corresponding to things like roads, buildings, etc. are important for the predictions. 

2) Combining multiple low-resolution images (3x3 grid) improves predictions compared to using a single image, likely because it increases the probability of capturing important small details. 

3) Color information alone is not enough for good predictions, structure and details are important. 

4) Feature attribution methods like Guided Grad-CAM indicate that the number of small infrastructure details in the image determines the CNN output.

5) Feature visualization shows the CNN associates high wealth index with images looking like city roads and buildings.

Overall, the paper provides one of the more thorough attempts at explaining what drives CNN-based wealth predictions from satellite imagery that I've seen. The use of multiple explainability methods to triangulate the evidence is a key contribution.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown high accuracy in predicting poverty levels from satellite images, but the reasons behind the predictions are unclear. 
- Previous attempts at explaining the CNN predictions have been limited, only showing some example filter visualizations without analyzing how they relate to poverty prediction.
- There is a need for more systematic analysis to understand what features in the images these CNNs use for poverty prediction.

Methods:
- The paper trains a CNN (MobileNetV2) to predict nighttime lights from low-resolution daytime satellite images of Tanzania and surrounding areas. 
- The CNN features are then used in a ridge regression model to predict the DHS Wealth Index. Achieves accuracy comparable to models using higher resolution images.
- Several explainability methods are used to analyze the CNN:
   - Grid shuffling: Tiles of image shuffled to break up structures.
   - Frequency filtering: Filters applied to remove/keep certain frequencies.
   - L*a*b* color analysis: Modify chromaticity of pixel clusters. 
   - Feature attribution methods: Grad-CAM, Guided Backprop, etc.
   - Feature visualization: Optimize input to maximize CNN output.

Results:
- Details around 100-600m size are important, while color alone not sufficient.  
- Combining multiple images improves accuracy, indicating small structures important.
- Modifying colors has little effect; number of small structures more important.
- Guided Grad-CAM highlights small structures that correlate with prediction.
- Feature visualization shows roads/buildings that maximize wealth prediction.

Conclusions:
- CNN bases poverty prediction on number of small details like roads and buildings.  
- Material/color less important than structure.

Main Contributions:
- First thorough quantitative analysis about what low-resolution satellite image features drive CNN poverty predictions.
- Variety of explainability methods used to triangulate evidence.
- Shows predictions competitive to higher resolution images, and better than humans.
- Provides directions for future work to further analyze intermediate CNN features.
