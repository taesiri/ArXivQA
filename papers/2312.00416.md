# [Towards Explaining Satellite Based Poverty Predictions with   Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00416)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores using low-resolution daytime satellite images with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict wealth levels in Tanzania. The CNN is first trained to predict nighttime light intensity, then the CNN features are used in a regression model to estimate a wealth index. This approach achieves a high accuracy with an R^2 of 0.67, outperforming human experts viewing high-resolution satellite images. Several explainability techniques are then applied to understand what features the CNN uses for prediction. Shuffling image tiles and frequency filtering indicate small details 20-30 meters in size are most important. Lab color space analysis shows prediction works even with only one color cluster kept intact. Guided Grad-CAM highlights small infrastructure features like roads and buildings as driving the CNN output. Overall, the number of these small man-made structures in the image, rather than color or materials, appears essential for the wealth prediction. This demonstrates an impressive capability to estimate economic prosperity from low-resolution satellite data that should be further analyzed to enable policy applications.
