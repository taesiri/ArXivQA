# [An Invitation to Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08365)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper provides an accessible introduction to deep reinforcement learning, framing it as a method for optimizing non-differentiable objectives. It starts by showing how core RL techniques like value learning and policy gradients can be applied to single-step supervised problems with non-differentiable metrics. It then extends these ideas to sequential decision making, introducing temporal difference learning for off-policy methods and policy gradient algorithms like REINFORCE for on-policy learning. Common challenges and solutions in deep RL are covered, culminating with the state-of-the-art SAC and PPO algorithms. Throughout, the authors connect back to concepts in supervised deep learning, easing understanding for readers already familiar with that material. The result is an intuitive 24-page overview of modern deep RL, enabling the reader to understand recent advances like using RL for text generation and code optimization.
