 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "An Invitation to Deep Reinforcement Learning":

Problem: 
Supervised learning requires differentiable loss functions to train models via gradient descent. Many real-world objectives like rewards, execution speed or intersection over union are not differentiable, limiting the applicability of supervised learning. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution to optimize non-differentiable objectives. However, RL is difficult to get started with due to extensive literature and a strong focus on theoretical foundations. 

Solution:
This paper provides an easy introduction to modern deep RL techniques by connecting them to concepts from supervised learning. It introduces RL through the lens of optimizing non-differentiable objectives. The two core ideas of RL are presented:

1. Value Learning: Learn a critic model to predict expected rewards (Q-function). The policy is defined implicitly by taking actions that maximize predicted rewards. Popular algorithms are Q-Learning and Soft Actor-Critic.

2. Policy Gradients: Directly learn a policy model by reinforcing actions proportionally to received rewards, ignoring the non-differentiable gap. Algorithms based on this idea are called REINFORCE. 

These ideas are first introduced for single-step problems to connect RL with supervised learning objectives. The paper then extends them to sequential decision making problems which introduce additional challenges like exploration, sparse rewards and compounding errors during online data collection. Important concepts like temporal difference learning, advantage estimation and proximal policy optimization are presented.

Contributions:
- Connects modern deep RL to supervised learning concepts
- Provides intuitive explanations of core RL ideas using easy-to-understand examples
- Structures RL concepts based on optimizing non-differentiable objectives and sequential vs single-step problems
- Covers important algorithms like Soft Actor-Critic, Q-Learning, REINFORCE and Proximal Policy Optimization
- Discusses practical challenges and solutions when applying RL

In only 24 pages, this paper enables readers with knowledge of supervised learning to understand modern deep RL techniques. It lowers the barrier for applying RL to real-world problems.
