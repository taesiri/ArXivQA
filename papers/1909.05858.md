# [CTRL: A Conditional Transformer Language Model for Controllable   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is on developing a large-scale conditional language model called CTRL that can generate coherent and controllable text. The key ideas explored in the paper are:

- Training a transformer-based language model on a diverse corpus of text data conditioned on control codes that govern aspects like style, content, and task-specific behavior. 

- Deriving the control codes from natural structure in the training data (like URLs, document boundaries) to allow more explicit control over text generation while preserving the advantages of unsupervised pre-training.

- Releasing multiple full-sized pretrained versions of CTRL to enable controllable text generation and analyzing correlations learned by the language model.

So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that conditioning the language model training on control codes derived from the natural structure of diverse text data can enable more explicit control over text generation while still benefiting from unsupervised pre-training. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the released CTRL models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing CTRL, a large-scale conditional language model. Key points:

- CTRL is a 1.63 billion parameter conditional transformer language model trained on control codes that govern style, content, task behavior, etc. 

- The control codes allow for more explicit control over text generation compared to unconditional language models like GPT-2.

- The codes are derived from natural structure in the training data to preserve the advantages of unsupervised learning.

- CTRL can be used for controlled text generation, crossing domains and behaviors.

- The relationship between codes and training data allows CTRL to predict the training source most likely for a given sequence, enabling analysis of data.

- The model incorporates task-specific data for question answering and translation without harming general capabilities.

- The authors have released multiple full-sized pretrained versions of CTRL to enable further research into controllable text generation.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing CTRL, a very large conditional language model that allows for more explicit control over text generation through the use of control codes. The codes provide a way to guide the model while retaining the benefits of unsupervised pretraining.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper introduces CTRL, a 1.63 billion parameter conditional transformer language model trained on control codes to generate controllable text. The key contribution is adding control codes to the training data to allow more explicit human control over text generation while preserving the advantages of unsupervised pretraining.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in natural language processing and language modeling:

- Scale: At 1.63 billion parameters, CTRL is one of the largest publicly released language models to date, behind only models like GPT-2 and Megatron in terms of size. So it represents pushing the boundaries of model scale.

- Controllability: A key focus of this paper that distinguishes it is the use of control codes to make generation more controllable. This builds on other work using task prefixes/descriptions for controllable generation, but provides a more systematic framework of codes.

- Multi-task learning: The incorporation of question answering and translation data reinforces capabilities on those specific tasks. This follows a general trend in NLP toward multi-task learning rather than isolated models.

- Training data: The model trains on a diverse dataset of 140GB of text from various domains. Using such a heterogeneous dataset reflects gathering more and more text data for model pretraining.

- Specific architectures: The model uses a Transformer architecture, which has become dominant for language modeling based on models like BERT and GPT-2. The large scale also relies on technical innovations like TPUs.

- Analysis: The source attribution analysis provides a way to probe relationships between the model and training data. This kind of analysis of correlations learned during pretraining has been less common.

- Ethics/Release: The paper discusses responsible release and implications of large generative models, contributing to increasing awareness of ethics in NLP. But many open questions remain regarding generative model biases and potential misuse.

So in summary, CTRL pushes forward model scale, controllability, and training data diversity while also contributing analyses around interpretability and thoughtful release. But it represents an incremental step in the rapid progress in language modeling.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Extending CTRL to more control codes and finer-grained control. The authors suggest further exploiting URL structure and extracting more structure from training data to enable more fine-grained control over text generation.

- Applying CTRL to more NLP tasks like question answering and machine translation. The authors suggest exploring whether CTRL can learn to effectively perform more complex NLP tasks while preserving its general capabilities. 

- Analyzing the relationships between CTRL and its training data. The authors propose using CTRL's explicit relationship with its training data to better understand the correlations it has learned from different data sources.

- Making the interface between humans and language models more intuitive. The authors suggest studying how CTRL's control codes could enhance beneficial applications of text generation.

- Studying ethics and governance related to releasing large language models. The authors recommend continuing discussions around responsible generation and use of models like CTRL.

In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding CTRL's capabilities and control mechanisms, applying it to more NLP tasks, analyzing its training data, improving human interaction, and studying ethical implications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces CTRL, a 1.63 billion parameter conditional transformer language model trained on control codes derived from naturally co-occurring structure in text data. The control codes govern aspects of text generation like style, content, and task-specific behavior. CTRL can generate text conditioned on these codes, which provides more explicit control over the generation process compared to unconditional language models. The codes also allow CTRL to predict which parts of the training data are most likely given an input sequence, enabling analysis of correlations learned from different domains. The authors have released multiple full-sized pretrained versions of CTRL to push towards more controllable, general natural language processing models. Experiments demonstrate controllable generation, source attribution for analyzing training data correlations, and zero-shot mixing of control codes. The paper concludes by discussing future research directions and ethical considerations around releasing large language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces CTRL, a 1.63 billion parameter conditional transformer language model for controllable text generation. CTRL is trained on a diverse dataset of 140 GB of text from sources like Wikipedia, books, news articles, Reddit, and others. Unique control codes derived from the natural structure of the training data are prepended to the raw text sequences. These allow CTRL to condition on aspects like style, content, domain, entities, and dates during text generation in a more explicit way than previous models. Users can flexibly combine control codes to guide the model's generation. 

The authors also show CTRL's learned correlations between text sequences and training domains can be exploited for basic source attribution. By ranking training domains based on their likelihood given a sequence, CTRL provides a method to analyze relationships between the model and training data. The authors release multiple full-sized pretrained versions of CTRL to facilitate further research into controlled text generation. They also discuss responsible release practices like expert reviews, scenario planning, and requesting user feedback, considering potential malicious uses of large language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents CTRL, a 1.63 billion parameter conditional transformer language model for controllable text generation. The key idea is to train the model on raw text that has been prepended with control codes indicating the domain, style, topics, entities, and other attributes of the text. This allows the model to generate text conditioned on these codes, providing more explicit control over text generation compared to typical language models. The control codes are derived from metadata like URLs that naturally co-occurs with the raw text data used for training. This allows the model to learn associations between codes and text patterns in an unsupervised manner, while still providing explicit control at generation time. The model is trained on a diverse dataset comprising Wikipedia, news, books, web text, Reddit, and other sources. It demonstrates controllable generation capabilities like varying style/domain and answering questions when conditioned on the appropriate control codes.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is presenting a new conditional language model called CTRL that allows for more controllable text generation. The key problems/questions it seems to be addressing are:

- How can large scale language models that show promising text generation capabilities be controlled more explicitly by users? The paper introduces control codes that allow aspects like style, content, and task-specific behavior to be specified. 

- Can unsupervised learning of language models be combined with capabilities for specific tasks without losing generality? The paper shows control codes can trigger skills like question answering and translation while retaining broad capabilities.

- What is the relationship between large language models and their training data? CTRL allows attributing text to likely training data sources since control codes are derived from metadata.

- How can text generation systems be designed to make the interface between humans and language models more intuitive? The control codes are intended to allow more predictable, controllable generation.

So in summary, it tackles challenges around controllability, combining general and specific skills, understanding relationships to training data, and human interpretability - all within large scale language models for text generation. The overall goal seems to be moving towards more controllable, general purpose NLP systems.
