# [FanOutQA: Multi-Hop, Multi-Document Question Answering for Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14116)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of resources to evaluate complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), especially for "fan-out" questions. These are multi-hop, multi-document questions that require gathering information about multiple entities from different documents.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present FanOutQA, a new dataset consisting of over 1,000 high-quality fan-out questions over Wikipedia, along with human-written decompositions and answers.

- They formulate 3 challenge settings to benchmark LLMs: closed-book (no access to documents), open-book (must retrieve relevant Wikipedia articles), and evidence-provided (given relevant articles).

- 7 LLMs were evaluated, including GPT-4, LLaMA 2.0, Claude 2.1, and others. Human performance was also evaluated.

Key Results:
- Closed-book was difficult for models (accuracy < 50%), showing lack of general knowledge needed.

- In open-book, models struggled with long contexts from retrieved articles. Human accuracy was 68.5%.

- Evidence-provided performance correlated strongly with context length, indicating the dataset properly tests long-range reasoning.

Main Contributions:
- A new high-quality dataset for complex reasoning over multiple documents covering multiple entities

- Formulation of 3 distinct challenge settings tapping into different LLM capabilities

- Benchmarking of SOTA models to establish baseline performance levels on this new challenging task, plus comparison to human performance

- Open-sourced dataset and tools to allow further research

Overall the paper makes a solid contribution in creating a valuable resource for testing and advancing complex reasoning abilities of large language models. The analysis clearly demonstrates current weaknesses and opportunities for progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents FanOutQA, a new question answering dataset and benchmark requiring complex reasoning across multiple Wikipedia documents to answer "fan-out" style questions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The development of FanOutQA, a new high quality dataset of complex, multi-hop, multi-document "fan-out" questions over Wikipedia. The dataset contains over 1,000 questions with human-written decompositions and answers. The paper formulates 3 challenge settings over this dataset to test different capabilities of large language models: closed-book, open-book, and evidence-provided. It benchmarks the performance of 7 state-of-the-art LLMs on these settings, finding that models still have significant room for improvement, especially on retrieving and reasoning over long inter-document contexts. The authors provide the dataset and tools to facilitate further research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- FanOutQA - The name of the dataset presented in the paper for evaluating complex, multi-hop reasoning over multiple documents.

- Multi-hop reasoning - Reasoning that requires multiple steps of inference across documents to answer a question.

- Long context modeling - Modeling long sequences of text that exceed typical model context lengths.

- Retrieval augmented generation - Using information retrieval over large corpora to provide useful context to generative language models. 

- Question answering - Answering natural language questions by reasoning over provided context.

- Decomposition - Breaking down complex questions into simpler sub-questions.

- English Wikipedia - The corpus used as the knowledge source for the FanOutQA dataset and benchmark tasks.

The key focus areas are on multi-hop, multi-document question answering and the long range reasoning capabilities of large language models. The FanOutQA dataset and accompanying benchmark tasks aim to evaluate these capabilities.
