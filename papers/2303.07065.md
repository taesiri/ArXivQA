# [MSINet: Twins Contrastive Search of Multi-Scale Interaction for Object   ReID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07065)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we design an effective neural architecture search scheme and model architecture specifically suited for object re-identification tasks?The key points are:- Existing NAS methods are designed for image classification and do not account for the differences in training schemes between classification and re-ID (an open-set retrieval task). - Current re-ID models use backbones designed for classification which may not be optimal. Some works design re-ID specific architectures but have limitations.- The paper proposes a new NAS scheme called Twins Contrastive Mechanism to better match re-ID training schemes by separating training and validation categories. - They design a Multi-Scale Interaction search space focusing on flexible interaction between multi-scale features at different layers.- A Spatial Alignment Module is introduced to enhance cross-domain generalization capability.- Experiments demonstrate their resulting architecture called MSINet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both in-domain and cross-domain re-ID.In summary, the main hypothesis is that designing a NAS scheme and architecture specifically for re-ID can significantly improve performance over existing methods. The paper aims to demonstrate this through their proposed approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a novel Twins Contrastive Mechanism (TCM) for NAS to provide more appropriate supervision for ReID architecture search. TCM reduces the category overlap between the training and validation data to better simulate real-world ReID training schemes.2. Designing a Multi-Scale Interaction (MSI) search space to search for rational interaction operations between multi-scale features. The search space focuses on exchanging information between shallow and deep network layers.3. Introducing a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) to enhance the attention consistency of the model when confronted with images from different domains. SAM improves cross-domain generalization. 4. Obtaining a light-weight yet effective ReID model architecture called MSINet through the proposed NAS scheme. Experiments show MSINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both in-domain and cross-domain ReID tasks.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel NAS scheme tailored for ReID that searches for an effective architecture (MSINet) through a new search space and training mechanism. The resulting model achieves excellent in-domain and cross-domain performance for ReID.
