# [MSINet: Twins Contrastive Search of Multi-Scale Interaction for Object   ReID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07065)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we design an effective neural architecture search scheme and model architecture specifically suited for object re-identification tasks?The key points are:- Existing NAS methods are designed for image classification and do not account for the differences in training schemes between classification and re-ID (an open-set retrieval task). - Current re-ID models use backbones designed for classification which may not be optimal. Some works design re-ID specific architectures but have limitations.- The paper proposes a new NAS scheme called Twins Contrastive Mechanism to better match re-ID training schemes by separating training and validation categories. - They design a Multi-Scale Interaction search space focusing on flexible interaction between multi-scale features at different layers.- A Spatial Alignment Module is introduced to enhance cross-domain generalization capability.- Experiments demonstrate their resulting architecture called MSINet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both in-domain and cross-domain re-ID.In summary, the main hypothesis is that designing a NAS scheme and architecture specifically for re-ID can significantly improve performance over existing methods. The paper aims to demonstrate this through their proposed approach.
