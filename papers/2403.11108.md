# [HarmPot: An Annotation Framework for Evaluating Offline Harm Potential   of Social Media Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11108)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a rise in online content spurring real-world physical violence in India, exacerbated by low digital literacy and existing social divisions. Many incidents of mob lynchings and violence have links to online rumors, hate speech, and misinformation spreading on social media platforms.

- Existing datasets and frameworks focus on identifying abusive, hateful, or offensive language but do not model the relationship between online content and potential for triggering offline harm and violence.  

Proposed Solution - HarmPot Framework:
- The paper proposes the "HarmPot" framework to annotate the potential of online posts to cause real-world physical harm. It incorporates contextual factors like victim identity, socio-political situation of the post, speaker's intention conveyed through mood and modality, and the post's role in the overall discourse.

- The framework has parameters to mark the magnitude of potential physical or sexual harm, identity of potential victim(s), contextual timing like elections or riots, linguistic devices indicating speaker's purpose and rationale behind the post. Detailed guidelines are provided on annotating the parameters.  

Contributions:
- The paper presents a novel perspective by moving beyond identification of hate speech to modeling harm potential, covering the nuances of what content can spur real-world violence.

- It emphasizes modeling contextual, pragmatic and socio-political aspects that shape interpretation and impact of online posts to understand their harm potential.

- A comparative analysis maps the HarmPot framework to existing hate speech frameworks like HASOC, OLID and ComMA to study relationships between constructs.

- A dataset of over 2000 social media posts related to offline hate crimes is annotated using the framework to demonstrate its application. Guidelines and inter-annotator agreement metrics are also reported.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a new annotation framework, HarmPot, for evaluating the offline harm potential of social media texts by incorporating contextual factors like targeted identities, the socio-political situation, speaker intention through mood and modality analysis, and discursive roles.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The development of a new annotation framework called "HarmPot" to evaluate the offline harm potential of social media texts. The key aspects of the framework include:

1) Defining a scale to annotate the magnitude of potential for physical or sexual harm caused by a text. The scale ranges from 0 (no harm potential) to 3 (high harm potential).

2) Annotating the identity of potential victims referred to in the text (e.g. caste, gender, religion etc.) and marking intersectionality.

3) Capturing the broader socio-political context of when the text was posted such as during riots, elections etc. 

4) Annotating linguistic features like mood, modality and affect to understand the speaker's intentions and evaluations. 

5) Marking the discourse role of the text such as whether it attacks, defends, instigates etc.

The paper also describes the collection and annotation of a new dataset of over 2,000 social media posts using this framework. It also compares the framework to existing hate speech datasets and frameworks like HASOC, OLID and ComMA.

In summary, the main contribution is the development of an annotation schema to create datasets that can be used to train models to predict the potential of online content to cause real-world harm.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Harm potential - The potential for online public posts to cause real-world physical harm or violence. This is the main concept the paper focuses on modeling and evaluating.

- Annotation framework - The paper discusses the development of an annotation framework ("HarmPot") to annotate social media texts with features related to their harm potential.

- Tagset - The set of tags and labels used in the HarmPot annotation framework to capture different aspects of texts like identity of target, context, speaker intent, etc. 

- Mood and modality - Linguistic features marked in the texts related to speaker intention and evaluation. Categories include realis mood, irrealis mood, illocutionary moods, epistemic modality, deontic modality.

- Offline harm incidents - Real-world physical violence events that the authors collected social media posts related to, in order to study online content linked with offline harm.

- Comparative analysis - Comparison conducted between the HarmPot framework and other existing frameworks for hate speech, offensive language, etc.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around the proposed annotation framework for evaluating harm potential, the specific labels/tags used, the linguistic features annotated, the offline incidents studied, and comparative analyses with other relevant frameworks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses developing an annotation framework called "HarmPot" to evaluate the offline harm potential of social media texts. Can you expand more on why existing hate speech datasets don't directly capture the notion of "harm potential"? What is lacking in current datasets?

2. The HarmPot framework incorporates contextual factors like the identity of the victim, socio-political situation of the discourse, and the discursive role of the text. Can you elaborate on why capturing this contextual information is important for evaluating harm potential? 

3. The framework captures semantic information like mood and modality of the text. What is the motivation behind marking mood and modality? How do variations in these relate to harm potential?

4. The paper annotated a dataset of social media posts linked to real incidents of offline violence. Can you describe the data collection process in more detail? What were some challenges faced and how did you address them?  

5. Inter-annotator agreement scores were initially low but improved after revisions to the annotation guidelines. What were some disagreements annotators had and what changes were made to resolve them?

6. The paper compares the HarmPot framework against existing hate speech schemes like HASOC, OLID and ComMA. Can you summarize some key differences in scope and methodology between HarmPot and these other frameworks?  

7. One limitation mentioned is the lack of multimodal information in the dataset. Why would incorporating images and videos be useful? How might the framework need to be adapted to handle multimodal data?

8. What are some ethical concerns with creating datasets of high harm potential social media posts? How did you aim to address issues like annotator bias and psychological impact?

9. The disaggregated annotations showing disagreement will be publicly released. What is the motivation behind this? How could it be useful for future research?

10. What are some directions for future work? What other types of evaluation do you plan to undertake to demonstrate the utility of the HarmPot framework?
