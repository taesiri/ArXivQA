# [HarmPot: An Annotation Framework for Evaluating Offline Harm Potential   of Social Media Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11108)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a rise in online content spurring real-world physical violence in India, exacerbated by low digital literacy and existing social divisions. Many incidents of mob lynchings and violence have links to online rumors, hate speech, and misinformation spreading on social media platforms.

- Existing datasets and frameworks focus on identifying abusive, hateful, or offensive language but do not model the relationship between online content and potential for triggering offline harm and violence.  

Proposed Solution - HarmPot Framework:
- The paper proposes the "HarmPot" framework to annotate the potential of online posts to cause real-world physical harm. It incorporates contextual factors like victim identity, socio-political situation of the post, speaker's intention conveyed through mood and modality, and the post's role in the overall discourse.

- The framework has parameters to mark the magnitude of potential physical or sexual harm, identity of potential victim(s), contextual timing like elections or riots, linguistic devices indicating speaker's purpose and rationale behind the post. Detailed guidelines are provided on annotating the parameters.  

Contributions:
- The paper presents a novel perspective by moving beyond identification of hate speech to modeling harm potential, covering the nuances of what content can spur real-world violence.

- It emphasizes modeling contextual, pragmatic and socio-political aspects that shape interpretation and impact of online posts to understand their harm potential.

- A comparative analysis maps the HarmPot framework to existing hate speech frameworks like HASOC, OLID and ComMA to study relationships between constructs.

- A dataset of over 2000 social media posts related to offline hate crimes is annotated using the framework to demonstrate its application. Guidelines and inter-annotator agreement metrics are also reported.
