# [Mamba-ND: Selective State Space Modeling for Multi-Dimensional Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05892)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Transformers have become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling tasks, but they have quadratic complexity in terms of sequence length. 
- Recently, Mamba, a state space model (SSM) architecture, has shown strong performance on 1D text modeling while having linear complexity. 
- However, it's not straightforward to extend Mamba to handle multi-dimensional data like images, video, and scientific data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Mamba-ND, a simple yet effective way to adapt Mamba to multi-dimensional data. 
- The key idea is to alternate the sequence ordering between Mamba layers, while keeping the internal 1D SSM layer design unchanged. 
- For 2D data, Mamba-ND alternates between H+H-W+W- scan orderings. For 3D data, it uses H+H-W+W-T+T-.

- The paper conducts extensive experiments on layer-level designs (e.g. bi-directional, ND-SSM) and block-level arrangements (e.g. alternating, bi-directional).
- Surprisingly, the simple alternating scan orderings perform the best. More complicated designs don't necessarily translate to better performance.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes Mamba-ND that extends SSMs to multi-dimensional data via alternating scan orderings.
- Achieves superior performance over Transformers on image classification, video action recognition and weather forecasting.
- Reduces model size and quadratic complexity of Transformers.  
- Provides extensive experiments on various SSM designs for multi-dimensional data. The simplicity of alternating orderings is shown to work the best.

In summary, the paper successfully adapts Mamba, a linear-complexity SSM architecture, to multi-dimensional data through a surprisingly simple yet effective technique of alternating the sequence ordering. This allows Mamba-ND to surpass Transformers on several tasks while using fewer parameters. The extensive experiments provide useful guidelines for adapting 1D sequence models to higher dimensions.
