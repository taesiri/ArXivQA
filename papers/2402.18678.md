# [RORA: Robust Free-Text Rationale Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18678)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Evaluating free-text rationales is challenging due to the diversity of reasoning paths and lack of definitive ground truth. 
- Existing metrics rely on how much the rationale supports a given label, making them vulnerable to "label leakage" where the rationale simply restates or paraphrases the label. This creates a spurious shortcut that leads to inflated evaluation scores.

Proposed Solution - Rora:
- Quantifies the new information supplied by a rationale to justify the label, using conditional V-information. 
- Detects potential leakage tokens in the rationale using gradient attributions from a small model.  
- Augments training data via counterfactual editing of leakage tokens.
- Trains an evaluation model invariant to label leakage using Invariant Risk Minimization.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes a robust evaluation approach called Rora that mitigates the impact of label leakage.
- Outperforms existing metrics in evaluating diverse rationales with or without label leakage. 
- Provides evaluations that better correlate with human judgment across synthetic and model-generated rationales.
- Demonstrates strong robustness in evaluating rationales for both fixed-label and open-label QA datasets.

In summary, the paper presents Rora, a novel rationale evaluation method designed to be robust against label leakage by detecting and ignoring leakage tokens. Rora consistently provides more reliable and accurate measurements that align better with human perception of rationale quality.
