# [Chitchat as Interference: Adding User Backstories to Task-Oriented   Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15248)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In task-oriented dialogues (TODs), users naturally incorporate elements of chitchat or backstory into their requests, interfering with the flow of conversation. 
- Existing TOD systems and datasets treat turns as exclusively task-oriented or exclusively chitchat. It is unclear how systems trained on such data would handle user turns seamlessly combining both.
- Manually creating data to address this is expensive. Existing live chat logs demonstrating this phenomenon have privacy restrictions limiting their use.

Proposed Solution:
- Automatically enhance MultiWOZ dialogues by generating user backstories and system reactions and adding them to existing exchanges. 
- User backstories are based on human-generated chitchat from the FusedChat dataset and expanded via few-shot prompting of Llama-2-70B.
- System reactions are designed to provide support while avoiding derailing the task.
- Enhanced dataset contains 3529/458/488 train/dev/test dialogues.

Experiments:
- Compare SimpleTOD model to SimpleTOD-fused (exposed to separate chitchat during training) and SimpleTOD-inter (trained on generated backstories).
- SimpleTOD is robust but dismissive of backstories; SimpleTOD-fused focuses too heavily on chitchat.  
- SimpleTOD-inter handles backstories consistently while efficiently progressing the task, as confirmed by human evaluation.

Main Contributions:
- Novel task treating chitchat as disruptive elements in TODs
- Automated approach to generate controlled testbed of chitchat interference
- Analysis of model limitations in handling such interference
- Demonstration that automatically generated data can train a model to smoothly handle interference
