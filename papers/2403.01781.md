# [Integrating Efficient Optimal Transport and Functional Maps For   Unsupervised Shape Correspondence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01781)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 

Establishing accurate correspondences between 3D shapes is critical for many computer vision and graphics applications like tracking, registration, texture transfer etc. Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted or data-driven features. Recent works utilize spectral methods, especially functional maps (FMs), that compactly represent correspondences between shapes. However, most FM works focus on feature learning that optimizes FM regularizers and do not explicitly align features across shapes. Aligning features is challenging as shapes can undergo complex deformations.  

Solution:

The paper proposes to integrate functional maps with optimal transport (OT) to promote explicit feature alignment. Shapes are treated as discrete probability measures. Features across shapes are aligned by minimizing the discrepancy between probability measures via OT cost. However, standard OT has high computational complexity. Hence, the paper employs the sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) which is an efficient OT metric with closed form solution. 

Two novel unsupervised loss functions based on SWD are introduced - bidirectional SWD and bidirectional energy-based SWD loss. These losses minimize the SWD between features of one shape and softly permuted features of the other shape, thereby promoting feature alignment. FM regularizers are also optimized to impose smoothness.   

Additionally, an adaptive refinement strategy is introduced. Pseudo correspondences are estimated using entropic regularized OT and used to iteratively refine features, improving mapping accuracy.

Contributions:

1) First work to integrate efficient OT (SWD) with FMs for unsupervised shape matching

2) Derives two novel OT-based loss functions using SWD to align features across shapes  

3) Adaptive refinement strategy using entropic OT to iteratively improve mapping

4) State-of-the-art results on diverse datasets including near-isometric (FAUST, SCAPE etc.) and non-isometric (SMAL, DT4D etc.) shape matching and downstream tasks like segmentation transfer
