# [From Correspondences to Pose: Non-minimal Certifiably Optimal Relative   Pose without Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05995)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the classic problem of estimating the relative camera pose (rotation and translation) between two calibrated camera views from a set of 2D-2D correspondences. The standard approach involves two steps 1) Computing the essential matrix, which encodes the epipolar geometry, using either an approximate or globally-optimal method 2) Disambiguating among the four possible solutions that explain the estimated essential matrix to select the geometrically correct one. This second step adds overhead.

Proposed Solution: 
The key contribution of this paper is a novel globally-optimal method called C2P that for the first time estimates the correct relative camera pose directly from 2D matches in a single step, without needing an additional disambiguation step. 

Main ideas:
- Derive necessary and sufficient geometric constraints, based on cheirality and manifold structure, that disambiguate the pose during optimization
- Formulate the problem as a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP)
- Relax the QCQP to a Semidefinite Program (SDP) that can be efficiently and globally solved 
- Theoretically prove conditions for tightness of the relaxation 
- Show that the geometrically correct pose corresponds to dominant singular vector 
- Method can also automatically detect pure rotation scenarios

Experiments:
- Exhaustive analysis with synthetic and real data
- Demonstrated superior computational efficiency, scaling better than previous state-of-the-art
- Achieves comparable or better accuracy than existing globally-optimal techniques
- First method that jointly estimates essential matrix and disambiguates pose in a single step

Overall, the paper presents a certifiably globally optimal solution to directly estimate the relative camera pose from matches, doing away with the traditional two-step pipeline needing a disambiguation step. This is achieved by an elegant optimization strategy incorporating geometric constraints. Thorough experimentation validates the efficacy of the approach.
