# [A Precision Drone Landing System using Visual and IR Fiducial Markers   and a Multi-Payload Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Precision landing of drones is challenging due to GPS errors. While waypoint navigation is reliable with typical GPS errors, landing requires more precision to avoid obstacles. Existing methods have limitations - downward facing cameras can lose sight of the landing pad, using pose estimation introduces orientation ambiguity issues. Most methods also depend on extra data like altitude above ground or distance to landing pad.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an autonomous precision landing method using a gimbal-mounted multi-payload camera to track AprilTag visual and infrared fiducial markers on the landing pad. The key aspects are:

1) Primarily uses the pan/tilt angles from the drone to the pad. Avoids using data like altitude or distance to pad. This allows switching between different cameras and zoom factors.

2) Leverages zoom camera for long range detection, wide angle camera for short range, IR camera for day/night operation. Tests both actively heated and novel passive unpowered IR tags.  

3) Develops a robust control policy to manage search for pad, re-acquisition if lost, final alignment and descent. Allows recovery if pad temporarily obscured.

Main Contributions:

- Precision landing with average error of 0.19m, lower than most prior work
- Operates from longer distances of up to 168m horizontal and 102m vertical  
- Works with both visual and IR AprilTags using multiple camera payloads
- First use of passive, unpowered IR tag exploiting reflectivity differences
- Control policy enables search, re-acquisition and recovery behaviors

The method is shown via real-world experiments to achieve high accuracy landing without needing data like altitude or range. It can handle temporary occlusion of the landing pad and switch between different cameras and tags. This makes it adaptable to various conditions.
