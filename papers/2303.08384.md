# [Rethinking Optical Flow from Geometric Matching Consistent Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08384)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper addresses is:

Can using geometric image matching as a pre-training task help learn better feature representations for optical flow estimation?

The key hypothesis is that geometric image matching shares some common challenges with optical flow estimation (e.g. large displacement, appearance change). So pre-training on the geometric image matching task, which has large-scale labeled real-world data, can help the model learn more robust features before tackling the harder task of estimating optical flow. The matching pre-training allows the model to first learn fundamental feature correlations without prematurely forming potentially confusing priors about complex 3D multi-object motion.

In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates the idea of using massive geometric image matching data to pre-train the feature extractor of an optical flow model. This is hypothesized to help the model learn good representations for handling consistent motion and common challenges faced by both tasks.
