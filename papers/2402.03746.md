# [Tuning Large Multimodal Models for Videos using Reinforcement Learning   from AI Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03746)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent video large multimodal models (VLMMs) have shown impressive capabilities in video understanding by combining large language models (LLMs) with visual encoders. 
- However, aligning video and text modalities remains challenging due to the limited volume and quality of multimodal instruction-tune datasets compared to text-only data. This often leads to generated responses that are not properly grounded in the visual context.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel alignment method called Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) that allows the VLMM to supervise itself by providing preference feedback on its own generated responses. 
- Specifically, context-aware reward modeling is introduced where detailed video descriptions are provided as context to the VLMM when generating preference feedback. This enriches the model's understanding of video content.
- The supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage is also enhanced by expanding the training dataset and applying a curriculum learning strategy.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of RLAIF framework for VLMMs to align video and text modalities using self-preference feedback
- Context-aware reward modeling to improve clarity in video content understanding 
- Expanded SFT training dataset and curriculum learning strategy
- State-of-the-art results demonstrated across diverse video understanding benchmarks including video question answering, text-to-video retrieval and action recognition

In summary, the paper presents a novel self-supervision method using RLAIF to improve video-text alignment in VLMMs, validated through superior performance over previous models on various standardized benchmarks. The solutions help overcome data limitations and facilitate better video grounding.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) to align the video and text modalities of video large multimodal models (VLMMs). Can you explain in more detail how the RLAIF framework works and how it helps with multimodal alignment?

2. The context-aware reward modeling technique enriches the AI's understanding of video content by providing detailed video descriptions as context. How does this detailed context help the AI generate better quality and more nuanced preferences for response pairs?

3. The paper expands the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset by augmenting it with additional instruction-following datasets. What is the rationale behind augmenting the dataset and what types of additional datasets are used?

4. A two-stage curriculum supervised fine-tuning strategy is proposed for enhancing multimodal alignment. Can you explain the basis of using a curriculum strategy and how the SFT dataset was divided into 'easy' and 'hard' tasks? 

5. How does the size of the preference dataset impact the performance of the proposed VLM-RLAIF method? What trends were observed when the preference dataset size was scaled up?

6. What is the effect of using different LLM sizes for the policy model versus the reward model in VLM-RLAIF? What optimal configuration worked the best?

7. How does segmenting the video into multiple clips and using their aggregated captions as context information help with preference selection and reward modeling?

8. Can you analyze some sample responses from the SFT versus the VLM-RLAIF model and highlight the differences qualitatively? Which one seems more grounded in the visual context?

9. The proposed VLM-RLAIF model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a diverse set of video understanding benchmarks. Can you summarize some of the major benchmarks used and the improvements observed over prior VLMM models?
