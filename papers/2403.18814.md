## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Mini-Gemini: Mining the Potential of Multi-modality Vision Language Models":

Problem:
Despite recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) that facilitate visual dialog and reasoning, a significant performance gap persists compared to more advanced private models like GPT-4 and Gemini. The goal is to enhance current VLMs to bridge this gap, approaching the capabilities of leading private models, while maintaining reasonable computational resources suitable for academic settings.  

Proposed Solution (Mini-Gemini):
The paper proposes a simple yet effective framework called "Mini-Gemini" to enhance VLMs from three key aspects:

1. High-resolution visual tokens: Uses an additional visual encoder to efficiently generate high-resolution visual token candidates without increasing token count, enhancing detail. 

2. High-quality data: Compiles high-quality datasets from diverse public sources to ensure rich and varied data foundation, bolstering performance.

3. VLM-guided generation: Integrates enhanced VLM with latent diffusion models to support concurrent high-quality image and text generation.

Key aspects of Mini-Gemini:

- Dual vision encoders for low-res embedding and high-res candidates in "patch info mining"
- Strategic dataset compilation of 1.2M alignments and 1.5M conversations 
- 13K text-only data to activate VLM's generation ability without compromise
- Supports 2B to 34B parameter LLM configurations
- Any-to-any workflow supporting image and text as input and output

Main Contributions:

- Proposes an efficient framework to enhance multi-modality VLMs approaching private model performance at acceptable compute
- Strategic mining of VLM potential through framework design, data quality and scope expansion 
- State-of-the-art results surpassing prior arts and even private models on MMB and MMU
- Leading capability in complex image understanding and reasoning-based generation tasks
- Strong benchmark for image comprehension and VLM-guided generation

The proposed Mini-Gemini framework effectively mines the potential of VLMs to empower image understanding, reasoning and generation with computational efficiency. Extensive experiments prove it achieves superior performance over previous state-of-the-arts.
