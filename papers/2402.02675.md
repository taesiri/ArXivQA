# [Verifiable evaluations of machine learning models using zkSNARKs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02675)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
As machine learning models become increasingly commercialized and closed-source, model developers can make claims about a model's performance or fairness that are impossible for end users to verify. This reduces transparency and accountability. End users have no way to confirm that the model they are using matches claims made about capabilities or biases without expensive auditing or reproducing benchmarks.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a framework to generate "verifiable evaluation attestations" for machine learning models using zero-knowledge proofs. Specifically:

1. The model provider runs inference on a dataset and generates proofs that the outputs match the model with a specific set of private weights (hashed for privacy). 

2. These proofs are aggregated into a performance claim, like accuracy on a dataset, along with the weight hash. 

3. End users can verify the claim is authentic without access to model weights.

4. End users can also challenge the model provider to prove a new inference comes from the same model, confirming it matches the original performance claim.

Main Contributions:

- A general framework for neural networks and ML models to make verifiable performance claims using zkSNARKs

- A "challenge" based model for end users to confirm models match hashed weights from performance claims

- Analysis of costs and incentives around verification

- Demonstrates the system across neural networks, CNNs, LSTM, and small transformers

- Provides a reference implementation for generating proofs and attestations

The key insight is that zero-knowledge proofs allow performance claims without revealing sensitive model details. This increases accountability and transparency for end users without imposing excessive costs on model providers. Though verification is expensive, selective challenges incentivize using the claimed model.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a method for generating verifiable evaluation attestations of machine learning models using zero-knowledge proofs to demonstrate model performance and fairness without revealing private model weights.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method for generating verifiable evaluation attestations of machine learning models using zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs). Specifically:

- The paper proposes a framework to create proofs of model inference that can be aggregated into verifiable attestations showing that a model with fixed private weights achieves stated performance metrics on public benchmark datasets. 

- This allows model providers to make verifiable claims about a model's accuracy, fairness, etc. without revealing the private model weights. 

- It also enables model users to verify that a model being used matches the one that was evaluation-attested, using challenge-response proofs of inference.

- The flexibility of the approach is demonstrated by generating attestations for various model types including CNNs, LSTM, transformers etc.

In summary, the key contribution is enabling verifiable evaluation of private machine learning models, which helps address issues around trust, transparency and accountability in AI systems. The paper presents the first end-to-end demonstration of this using zkSNARKs.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper are:

- zkSNARKs - Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge, the cryptographic technique used to generate proofs of computation

- secure ML - Applying security and privacy techniques to machine learning models and inference

- verifiable evaluation attestations - The proofs generated to demonstrate model performance or other characteristics

- model evaluations - Evaluating the accuracy, fairness, biases etc of ML models

- benchmarking - Testing model performance on standard datasets 

- zero-knowledge proofs - Cryptographic proofs that prove knowledge of some secret without revealing the secret

- model transparency - Allowing inspection and auditing of ML models

- model auditing - Checking models for issues like biases or performance degradation

- neural networks - The machine learning models being evaluated, including MLPs, CNNs, VAEs, etc.

The core focus is on using zero-knowledge proofs of computation to let model developers prove claims about their models' performance or characteristics without revealing the full model details. This supports transparency and auditing for private or commercial ML models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed method of using zkSNARKs for verifiable model evaluation address the key limitations of other approaches like multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The paper discusses converting models to ONNX format. What are some of the challenges or limitations around supporting the full range of model architectures in ONNX? How could the framework be extended to support other model formats?

3. The paper argues this method can enable verifying claims about private models in both academic and commercial settings. What are some real-world examples where you think this could have high impact if deployed? What barriers still exist to adoption?

4. Proof generation time seems to be a major bottleneck. The paper suggests several approaches to improving efficiency - which do you think are most promising in the near term and why? What hardware or systems innovations could accelerate proofs?

5. How should the choice of evaluation datasets be made to balance performance measurement and bias checking? What are limitations around current benchmark datasets and how could more robust benchmarks be constructed?

6. The paper discusses challenge-based model auditing. What economic incentives and market structures would be needed to make this adoption worthwhile in practice? How to balance costs between users and providers?

7. What kind of private or obscured benchmark datasets could be useful? What mechanisms could prove facts about those datasets while preserving confidentiality?

8. How well would this approach extend to verifiable evaluation of other advanced models like generative models, multimodal models, or ensemble methods? What new challenges emerge?

9. If this method sees adoption, how could it impact norms and practices around releasing model details and evaluation results in both research and commercial settings? Could it lead to less transparency?

10. What other mechanisms alongside technical solutions like this could improve accountability and trust in AI systems? How does verifiable evaluation fit into the broader goals of AI safety, transparency, and eliminating harms?
