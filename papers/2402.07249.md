# [The Impact of Domain Knowledge and Multi-Modality on Intelligent   Molecular Property Prediction: A Systematic Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07249)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
This paper addresses two key issues in applying deep learning for molecular property prediction (MPP): (1) how to effectively integrate domain knowledge into models, and (2) whether using multi-modal data can improve prediction accuracy over single data source methods. MPP is critical for drug discovery but complex due to the intricate relationships between molecular structures and properties. More domain knowledge integration and multi-modal data utilization are needed to enhance MPP performance.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper provides a comprehensive review of recent deep learning approaches for MPP, analyzing encoder architectures like RNN, GNN, Transformer, CNN, and multi-modal methods. There is a focus on alignment with molecular structural knowledge and integration of domain knowledge like atom/bond attributes, substructures, reactions, and properties. Various training strategies are also examined including self-supervised, semi-supervised, transfer, and multi-task learning, which aim to address the common issue of limited labeled data.

Key Contributions:
1) Quantitative analysis reveals integrating substructure information improves regression MPP by 3.98% on average and classification MPP by 1.72% on average, confirming the value of domain knowledge.

2) Experiments show utilizing 3D data together with 1D and 2D data boosts MPP performance substantially, up to 4.2% on average, highlighting the benefits of multi-modal learning.

3) The paper offers crucial guidance to advance MPP through effective domain knowledge integration and multi-modal data utilization, both identified as pivotal directions.

In summary, this paper makes vital contributions towards advancing deep learning techniques for MPP by systematically reviewing methods, benchmarking model performance, and quantifying the significant impact of leveraging domain expertise and multi-modal data.
