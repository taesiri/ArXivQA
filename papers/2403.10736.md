# [Stackelberg Meta-Learning Based Shared Control for Assistive Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper addresses the challenges in human-vehicle shared control for autonomous driving, where the human driver and the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) collaborate to drive the vehicle. The key challenges are: (1) The asymmetric interaction between human and ADAS due to human's limited cognitive capability; (2) Uncertainty in modeling human driver's behavior; (3) The need for ADAS to quickly adapt to different types of drivers.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Stackelberg meta-learning framework to enable customized and robust shared control strategies. The key ideas are:

(1) Model the human-ADAS interaction as a Stackelberg game to capture the asymmetric collaboration, with ADAS as leader and human as follower. 

(2) Use a quantal response model to characterize the bounded rationality and uncertainty in human's decision making.

(3) Leverage meta-learning to learn a generalized human driver model across different driver types. This forms the basis to quickly adapt to new drivers.

(4) Perform utility adaptation using small amount of driver-specific data to customize the meta-learned model for assisting the new driver.

(5) Use receding horizon control strategy during driving for continual assistance.

Main Contributions:

- A Stackelberg meta-learning framework for enabling customized and robust shared control between human drivers and ADAS.

- Algorithms for meta-learning across driver types to obtain generalized driver models.

- Rapid adaptation schemes using small driver-specific data.

- Demonstration of assisting diverse types of drivers in a simulated lane changing scenario. The adapted shared control improves efficiency and robustness against driver errors over driver-only control.
