# [Heterogeneous Graph Reasoning for Fact Checking over Texts and Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13028)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Heterogeneous Graph Reasoning for Fact Checking over Texts and Tables":

Problem:
- Fact checking aims to predict the veracity of a claim by reasoning over multiple evidence pieces containing both unstructured text and structured tables. 
- Existing approaches have limitations:
    - Fine-tuning PLMs by concatenating all evidence fails to explore complex evidence relationships.
    - Existing graph-based methods use sentence-level nodes and homogeneous connections, unable to capture fine-grained semantics.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel word-level heterogeneous graph model called HeterFC for fact checking over texts and tables.
- Construct a heterogeneous evidence graph with words as nodes. Add 3 types of connections:
    - Intra-sentence & intra-table edges: between words & local contexts 
    - Inter-evidence edges: between same keywords in different evidence
- Employ relational graph networks (R-GCN) to propagate neighborhood information.
- Readout evidence embeddings and utilize attention to integrate information.
- Combine with a PLM for final veracity prediction.  
- Use a multitask loss to differentiate valid and invalid evidence.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a word-level heterogeneous graph model that captures fine-grained semantics for fact checking over texts and tables.
- Design a heterogeneous evidence graph with customized edges to model relationships.
- Achieve superior performance over several competitive baselines on the FEVEROUS dataset.
- Demonstrate the efficacy of various model components through ablation studies.

In summary, the paper presents a novel graph-based neural architecture that reasons over both unstructured and structured evidence for fact checking, outperforming existing approaches. The heterogeneous design and word-level modeling facilitate nuanced semantic modeling.
