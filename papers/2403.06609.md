# [Guiding Clinical Reasoning with Large Language Models via Knowledge   Seeds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06609)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Clinical reasoning is a critical cognitive process for physicians to evaluate and treat patients, but requires extensive medical knowledge and clinical experience. This poses challenges in developing countries with limited healthcare resources.
- Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown potential in medical tasks but suffer from hallucination problems due to lack of medical knowledge. Their reasoning process may also not align well with physicians.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors propose a novel framework called In-Context Padding (ICP) to enhance LLMs for clinical reasoning. 
- ICP first extracts medical entities from the context and infers relevant "knowledge seeds" using a medical knowledge graph. These seeds are then padded into the prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning process.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes ICP framework that incorporates knowledge graph and in-context learning of LLM to bridge knowledge gaps for clinical reasoning.
- Knowledge seeds inferred from context serve as reasoning anchors to align LLM's generation with physicians' decision process.  
- Experiments on two clinical question datasets validate ICP's effectiveness in improving accuracy and interpretability of LLM.
- In addition to final answer, ICP also provides reasoning description to make the process more transparent.
- The framework has broad applicability to enhance LLMs in specialized domains like healthcare.

In summary, the key innovation is using knowledge seeds padded into the prompt to guide the LLM's clinical reasoning process, ensuring generations better align with physician logic while also enhancing accuracy and transparency. This has significant potential to promote equity in global healthcare through AI.
