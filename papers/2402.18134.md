# [Learning to Deblur Polarized Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18134)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Polarization cameras can capture four polarized images in a single shot, which is useful for computing polarization parameters like degree of polarization (DoP) and angle of polarization (AoP). However, the images tend to have motion blur due to longer exposure time required. Existing image/video deblurring methods fail to handle multiple polarized images well since they don't consider polarization constraints across images. So there is a need for a specialized method to deblur polarized images while maintaining polarization information.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a polarized image deblurring pipeline that divides the problem into two sub-problems:
1) Deblurring unpolarized image to get sharp content without polarization constraint. 
2) Using the sharp unpolarized image to guide deblurring of polarized images while recovering polarization constraint.

The pipeline is implemented as a two-stage neural network:
Stage 1: An unpolarized image estimator uses the blur-resistant Stokes images S1, S2 as priors along with the blurry unpolarized image to estimate a sharp unpolarized guide image. Custom Stokes guided skip connections propagate polarization information across features.  
Stage 2: A polarized image reconstructor transfers semantic information from the guide image to blurry polarized images using a multiscale context transferring encoder. It also uses polarization-based grouping of polarized images into pairs (Iα1+Iα3 and Iα2+Iα4) that share parameters, making the problem simpler.

The method is trained on a synthesized polarized image dataset using content, gradient and Stokes losses.

Main Contributions:
1) First specialized method to deblur multiple polarized images using polarization information effectively.
2) Two-stage divide-and-conquer pipeline and network design to simplify the ill-posed problem.
3) Usage of Stokes images and unpolarized guide image to repair degraded features at multiple levels.
4) State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance on synthetic and real blurred polarized images. 
5) Demonstrated improvement in polarization-based vision applications like dehazing and reflection removal when using the proposed method for deblurring.
