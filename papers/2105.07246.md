# [An End-to-End Framework for Molecular Conformation Generation via   Bilevel Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07246)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Predicting molecular conformations (3D structures) from molecular graphs is an important task with applications in drug design, material science, etc. Existing approaches typically predict inter-atomic distances first and then generate conformations by solving a separate distance geometry problem. However, the predicted distances may not properly preserve local geometry, leading to unsatisfactory generated structures.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an end-to-end deep generative model called ConfVAE to directly predict molecular conformations from graphs. It formulates the problem as a bilevel program within a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) framework:

- The CVAE encodes the molecular graph into a latent variable z and decodes it to conformations. 

- The decoding is a bilevel program: the inner loop predicts inter-atomic distances by a continuous normalizing flow conditioned on z and the graph; the outer loop generates conformations by minimizing the RMSD between predicted and true structures.

- The model is trained end-to-end by stochastic gradient descent, using hypergradient descent to differentiate through the inner-loop optimization of distance geometry.

Main Contributions:
- First end-to-end deep generative model for conformation prediction that keeps rotational/translational invariance.

- Novel application of bilevel optimization to integrate the distance prediction and distance geometry modules.

- Significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on conformation generation and distance modeling tasks on benchmarks.

- Achieves better performance than traditional methods even with additional force-field refinement, demonstrating practical usefulness.

- Provides insights on the importance of end-to-end training objectives for this problem.

In summary, the key innovation is the end-to-end learning framework with bilevel programming that overcomes limitations of previous two-stage approaches for this important molecular 3D structure prediction problem.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes ConfVAE, an end-to-end framework for molecular conformation generation based on bilevel programming and conditional variational autoencoders.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an end-to-end framework called ConfVAE for molecular conformation generation via bilevel programming. Specifically:

1) The paper formulates the problem of generating molecular conformations as a bilevel program, with the inner loop solving a distance geometry problem to recover 3D structures from predicted distances, and the outer loop directly optimizing the reconstruction loss defined on the 3D structures.

2) The framework is built on a conditional variational autoencoder, where the molecular graph is encoded into the latent space and the decoder generates distances that are then converted to conformations through the distance geometry inner loop.

3) The model is trained end-to-end via hypergradient descent through the bilevel optimization formulation, allowing the distance prediction model to be directly supervised by the realism of final conformations.

4) Experiments show the proposed ConfVAE outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in conformation generation, distance modeling, and property prediction tasks. The end-to-end training is demonstrated to be vital for generating valid and stable molecular conformations.

In summary, the key innovation is formulating conformation generation as a principled bilevel program that enables end-to-end learning, overcoming limitations of previous two-stage methods while keeping rotational/translational invariance.
