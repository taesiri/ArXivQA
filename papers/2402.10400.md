# [Chain of Logic: Rule-Based Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10400)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rule-based reasoning is an important capability for legal tasks, but language models struggle to perform this type of reasoning, especially for complex "compositional" rules made up of multiple logical conditions.  
- Existing prompting methods like chain of thought and self-ask also have difficulty guiding language models to reason accurately about compositional rules.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a new prompting approach called "chain of logic" to decompose the reasoning process for compositional rules into clear steps. 
- First, the rule is broken into logical "elements". Then each element is posed as a question and answered. Finally, the logical relationships between elements are explicitly evaluated to reach an overall conclusion.
- This leverages insights from the IRAC legal reasoning framework where lawyers break down reasoning into issue, rule, application, conclusion.

Key Contributions:
- Chain of logic prompting outperforms other methods like chain of thought across 8 rule-based reasoning tasks from the LegalBench benchmark, using both open-source and commercial language models.
- It elicits more accurate and interpretable step-by-step reasoning compared to other prompting approaches.
- Given just a single demonstration, models can generalize this approach to new unseen rules and cases. This reduces the need for rule-specific training data.
- Overall, chain of logic represents an advancement in guided reasoning techniques for complex compositional rules, with potential applications beyond the legal domain.

In summary, the key innovation is a new prompting technique to decompose and recompose reasoning over compositional rules, leading to improved performance and explainability compared to existing methods.
