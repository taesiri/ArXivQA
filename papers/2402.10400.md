# [Chain of Logic: Rule-Based Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10400)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rule-based reasoning is an important capability for legal tasks, but language models struggle to perform this type of reasoning, especially for complex "compositional" rules made up of multiple logical conditions.  
- Existing prompting methods like chain of thought and self-ask also have difficulty guiding language models to reason accurately about compositional rules.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a new prompting approach called "chain of logic" to decompose the reasoning process for compositional rules into clear steps. 
- First, the rule is broken into logical "elements". Then each element is posed as a question and answered. Finally, the logical relationships between elements are explicitly evaluated to reach an overall conclusion.
- This leverages insights from the IRAC legal reasoning framework where lawyers break down reasoning into issue, rule, application, conclusion.

Key Contributions:
- Chain of logic prompting outperforms other methods like chain of thought across 8 rule-based reasoning tasks from the LegalBench benchmark, using both open-source and commercial language models.
- It elicits more accurate and interpretable step-by-step reasoning compared to other prompting approaches.
- Given just a single demonstration, models can generalize this approach to new unseen rules and cases. This reduces the need for rule-specific training data.
- Overall, chain of logic represents an advancement in guided reasoning techniques for complex compositional rules, with potential applications beyond the legal domain.

In summary, the key innovation is a new prompting technique to decompose and recompose reasoning over compositional rules, leading to improved performance and explainability compared to existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Chain of Logic, a new prompting method to improve rule-based reasoning in large language models by decomposing complex rules into elements, solving them independently, then recomposing the answers to resolve the underlying logical expression.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a new prompting approach called "Chain of Logic" to elicit better rule-based reasoning from large language models. Specifically:

- Chain of logic guides models to reason about compositional rules (rules with multiple logical conditions) by decomposing the rule into elements, solving each element separately, and then recomposing the element answers to resolve the full logical expression.

- This approach outperforms other prompting methods like chain of thought and self-ask on rule-based reasoning tasks from the LegalBench benchmark, using both open-source and commercial language models.

- Chain of logic creates an interpretable reasoning path that allows debugging of incorrect conclusions by tracing errors back to specific rule elements or logical relationships.

- The paper shows that with a single demonstration, models can learn to generalize the chain of logic approach to new rules and fact patterns, enhancing their reasoning capabilities through in-context learning.

In summary, the key contribution is a new prompting technique to improve rule-based reasoning in language models by eliciting logical decomposition and recomposition.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Rule-based reasoning - Using rules to draw conclusions by accurately applying them to facts. A key capability explored in legal settings.

- Compositional rules - Rules made up of multiple logical conditions joined together. More complex to reason about. 

- Chain of logic - The new prompting method introduced to improve reasoning about compositional rules. Involves decomposing rules into elements, solving elements separately, then recomposing answers.

- Legal reasoning - Reasoning tasks common in the legal domain, such as applying statutes and case law.

- In-context learning - Using a demonstration example within the prompt to teach the model, rather than fine-tuning on a dataset.

- Logical expressions - Boolean expressions using AND/OR relationships to capture logic between rule elements. 

- IRAC framework - Common legal reasoning approach involving Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion steps. Inspiration for chain of logic.  

- LegalBench - Legal reasoning benchmark used for experiments. Contains tasks based on legal rules.

- Language models - Large neural network models trained on text data. Assessed for rule-based reasoning capabilities.

So in summary, key terms cover the prompting method, compositional rules, legal reasoning concepts, and language models explored.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the chain of logic method proposed in the paper:

1. The chain of logic method draws inspiration from the IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) legal reasoning framework. In what ways does chain of logic adapt ideas from IRAC? How does it extend or improve upon IRAC for applying rules to fact patterns?

2. During the rule decomposition step, chain of logic assigns elements of a rule to variables. What is the purpose of this step? How does explicitly denoting rule elements aid in the overall reasoning process?

3. The logical expression created in step 3 aims to capture relationships between rule elements. Why is recognizing these logical relationships important for accurately applying compositional rules? Can you provide an example where failing to account for logical relationships would result in an incorrect conclusion?

4. The question answering step poses a series of sub-questions, one for each rule element. How does the construction of these questions differ from the self-ask approach? What specifically makes the chain of logic line of questioning more effective? 

5. When recombining element answers during recomposition, how does explicitly plugging sub-answers into the logical expression improve reasoning over directly stating a final conclusion? What errors can this step help prevent?

6. The structured input used in step 1 is shown to significantly impact overall performance. Why do you think formatting the task inputs plays such a pivotal role? What aspects of the structure are most useful for the downstream reasoning steps?

7. The ablation study demonstrates the importance of both rule decomposition and constructing the logical expression. Why are these two steps, in particular, critical precursors before the question answering step?

8. The strongest baseline method across tasks is zero-shot prompting. Why do you think the zero-shot approach outperforms standard prompting and chain of thought? What deficiencies exist in those methods that are addressed by chain of logic?

9. Chain of logic relies entirely on a single demonstration and is not iteratively improved. Do you think a multi-pass approach could enhance results further? If so, how might additional passes be used to augment the method?

10. The paper focuses narrowly on rule-based reasoning tasks involving deterministic outcomes. How might the chain of logic approach translate to more complex settings with rules dictating non-binary consequences that require their own reasoning?
