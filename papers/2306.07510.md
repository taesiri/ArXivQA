# [Require Process Control? LSTMc is all you need!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07510)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Can an LSTM controller (LSTMc) offer an effective alternative control framework that combines the simplicity of a PI controller with the grade-to-grade (G2G) transferability of a model predictive controller (MPC)?The key hypothesis appears to be that an LSTMc can leverage process data and sequential machine learning models to develop a superior controller with high accuracy in setpoint tracking and seamless transferability across varying operating conditions. Specifically, the paper investigates whether the proposed LSTMc can consistently outperform a traditional PI controller and an MPC in terms of setpoint tracking for a complex chemical process (batch crystallization). The performance metrics evaluated include setpoint deviation, resilience to measurement noise, computational efficiency, and grade-to-grade (G2G) transferability.In summary, the central research question examines if an LSTMc offers a novel data-driven controller paradigm that overcomes limitations of existing PI and MPC approaches for complex chemical processes. The key hypothesis is that the LSTMc can achieve superior control performance by effectively utilizing process data and LSTM networks.
