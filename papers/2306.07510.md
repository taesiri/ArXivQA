# [Require Process Control? LSTMc is all you need!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07510)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Can an LSTM controller (LSTMc) offer an effective alternative control framework that combines the simplicity of a PI controller with the grade-to-grade (G2G) transferability of a model predictive controller (MPC)?The key hypothesis appears to be that an LSTMc can leverage process data and sequential machine learning models to develop a superior controller with high accuracy in setpoint tracking and seamless transferability across varying operating conditions. Specifically, the paper investigates whether the proposed LSTMc can consistently outperform a traditional PI controller and an MPC in terms of setpoint tracking for a complex chemical process (batch crystallization). The performance metrics evaluated include setpoint deviation, resilience to measurement noise, computational efficiency, and grade-to-grade (G2G) transferability.In summary, the central research question examines if an LSTMc offers a novel data-driven controller paradigm that overcomes limitations of existing PI and MPC approaches for complex chemical processes. The key hypothesis is that the LSTMc can achieve superior control performance by effectively utilizing process data and LSTM networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing a novel model-free, data-driven controller framework called LSTM controller (LSTMc). The key features and contributions of LSTMc are:- It is the first controller design that leverages LSTM networks to develop a model-free, data-driven controller. - It uses an augmented input tensor with state evolution and error dynamics from current and previous time steps to predict the optimal manipulated input for the next time step. This allows it to learn complex relationships between states, errors, and control actions.- Its internal LSTM gates enable selective focusing on significant process changes like control actions, while filtering out noise and disturbances. This results in superior setpoint tracking. - It combines the simplicity of a PI controller with the grade-to-grade transferability of a model predictive controller. This allows seamless adaptation across varying operating conditions.- It consistently outperforms a PI controller and LSTM-based MPC in setpoint tracking for a batch crystallizer case study, even with noisy measurements. - It offers computational efficiency, fast response times, and easy implementation compared to MPC strategies.In summary, the paper introduces LSTMc as a novel data-driven controller paradigm that leverages process data and LSTM networks to deliver superior performance and transferability for complex chemical processes. It demonstrates a promising alternative approach to traditional PI and MPC controllers.
