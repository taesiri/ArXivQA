# [Geo-located Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for Crowdsourced   Evaluation of Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12253)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) model that is tailored for analyzing sentiment in crowdsourced textual appraisals of urban environments. 

Problem: Existing sentiment analysis methods used in urban planning are only able to extract overall sentiment of a text, but cannot identify sentiments towards specific aspects within the text. Although ABSA methods are gaining popularity, most models are trained on non-urban datasets like consumer reviews. There is a need for ABSA tailored to analyzing crowdsourced urban textual data.  

Proposed Solution: The authors create a dataset of 2500 Google Places reviews of public parks in Boston which they manually annotate with aspect terms and corresponding sentiment labels. They train a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with Local Context Focus on this dataset for concurrent Aspect Term Extraction and Aspect Sentiment Classification.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of an annotated dataset of crowdsourced urban reviews for ABSA
- An ABSA model tailored for urban text data that outperforms baseline BERT models in Accuracy, achieving F1 scores of 0.83 for Aspect Term Extraction and 0.75 for Aspect Sentiment Classification
- Demonstrative spatial analysis of extracted aspects and sentiments across Boston

In conclusion, the authors present an ABSA framework specialized for fine-grained crowdsourced evaluation of urban environments. They highlight its potential for supporting urban planning activities through granular, location-based sentiment analytics. Their model and dataset contribute the capabilities needed to unlock richer insights from civic textual data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops an Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis model to extract aspects and sentiments from geo-located crowdsourced textual appraisals of urban environments for fine-grained evaluation of public spaces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

The development of an Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) model capable of extracting high level topics/aspects contained within geo-located textual urban appraisals, along with aspect sentiment classification. The model is trained on a new dataset of 2500 crowdsourced reviews of public parks that the authors collected and manually labeled. The model achieves improved accuracy on identifying urban aspects and sentiment compared to baseline models. The authors demonstrate the utility of the model by analyzing and visualizing the spatial distribution of positive and negative sentiment towards different urban aspects in Boston parks.

In summary, the key contribution is an ABSA model tailored for fine-grained sentiment analysis of textual appraisals of urban environments, which can enable more nuanced evaluation of public spaces to inform urban planning and design.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)
- Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) 
- Local Context Focus (LCF)
- Aspect Term Extraction (ATE)
- Aspect Polarity Classification (APC) 
- Urban planning
- Crowdsourced evaluation
- Public spaces
- Geo-located reviews
- Sentiment analysis
- Topic modeling
- Spatial analysis

The paper develops an ABSA model using BERT with LCF to extract aspects and classify sentiment from geo-located crowdsourced textual reviews of urban public spaces like parks. It demonstrates the model's performance and shows some spatial analysis examples for urban planning applications. So the key terms revolve around aspect-based sentiment analysis, BERT, crowdsourcing, urban planning, and spatial analysis.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using BERT with Local Context Focus for the ABSA model architecture. Can you explain in more detail how the Local Context Focus mechanism works and why it is beneficial for this task? 

2. The paper collects park reviews from Google Places API. What other crowdsourced data sources could be potential alternatives and what would be their advantages/disadvantages compared to Google Places?

3. The paper manually annotates the dataset for aspect terms and sentiment. Could you propose an automated or semi-automated way to generate the annotations that could scale up more easily while maintaining accuracy? 

4. Could you suggest some ways to expand the annotated dataset in terms of size, diversity of places, geographic coverage etc. to improve model generalization? What challenges might this present?

5. The demonstrative analysis visually shows positive and negative aspect spatial distributions. Could you propose some additional geospatial analyses enabled by the geo-located aspect-based sentiment data?

6. What are some limitations of relying on crowdsourced consumer reviews for understanding public space experiences? How might the methodology be adapted to address these? 

7. How suitable do you think this aspect-based sentiment analysis approach would be for textual data sources other than consumer reviews e.g. social media, municipal surveys etc.? What adaptations might be required?

8. The paper focuses on parks but mentions applicability to urban planning/governance in general. What are some other key potential urban planning use cases you envision for this methodology?  

9. The analysis identifies frequently occurring aspects. How could the granularity of the extracted aspects be tuned to provide insights at different levels of specificity depending on the application?

10. What additional performance metrics beyond accuracy would be valuable for evaluating the utility of the model for urban planning applications? Why?
