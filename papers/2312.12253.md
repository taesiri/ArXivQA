# [Geo-located Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for Crowdsourced   Evaluation of Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12253)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) model that is tailored for analyzing sentiment in crowdsourced textual appraisals of urban environments. 

Problem: Existing sentiment analysis methods used in urban planning are only able to extract overall sentiment of a text, but cannot identify sentiments towards specific aspects within the text. Although ABSA methods are gaining popularity, most models are trained on non-urban datasets like consumer reviews. There is a need for ABSA tailored to analyzing crowdsourced urban textual data.  

Proposed Solution: The authors create a dataset of 2500 Google Places reviews of public parks in Boston which they manually annotate with aspect terms and corresponding sentiment labels. They train a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with Local Context Focus on this dataset for concurrent Aspect Term Extraction and Aspect Sentiment Classification.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of an annotated dataset of crowdsourced urban reviews for ABSA
- An ABSA model tailored for urban text data that outperforms baseline BERT models in Accuracy, achieving F1 scores of 0.83 for Aspect Term Extraction and 0.75 for Aspect Sentiment Classification
- Demonstrative spatial analysis of extracted aspects and sentiments across Boston

In conclusion, the authors present an ABSA framework specialized for fine-grained crowdsourced evaluation of urban environments. They highlight its potential for supporting urban planning activities through granular, location-based sentiment analytics. Their model and dataset contribute the capabilities needed to unlock richer insights from civic textual data.
