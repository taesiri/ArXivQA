# [Can We Learn Communication-Efficient Optimizers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02204)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Communication is a major bottleneck in distributed deep learning training. Local SGD and its variants help alleviate this issue by allowing workers to take multiple local gradient steps before communicating, thereby reducing communication frequency. However, local SGD can lag behind more advanced optimizers like Adam. Learned optimization is a promising technique but has not been explored in the context of communication-efficient distributed training.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using learned optimization to improve upon local SGD. Specifically, it introduces two learned optimizer architectures - LAgg-A and LOpt-A - that aggregate the local model updates from workers into an improved global update. LAgg-A has access to the individual worker updates while LOpt-A only sees the averaged update. The optimizers are meta-trained to produce better convergence compared to local SGD.

Main Contributions:
- First work to apply learned optimization in communication-efficient distributed setting
- Proposes two architectures for learned aggregation of local SGD updates 
- Shows learned optimizers can outperform local SGD and sophisticated baselines like SlowMo
- Demonstrates generalization to unseen datasets/architectures, including ImageNet, ViTs and LMs
- Highlights promise of using learned optimizers to improve communication efficiency in distributed training

In summary, this work makes a case for using meta-learned optimizers to boost the performance of local SGD, allowing models to converge faster while retaining the communication-efficiency of local updates. The learned optimizers generalize well to varied tasks not seen during meta-training. This demonstrates their potential to advance communication-efficient distributed deep learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using meta-learned optimizers to aggregate model updates in communication-efficient distributed training, demonstrating improved performance over local SGD baselines while maintaining computational and communication efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Demonstrating for the first time that learned optimizers can be used to augment local SGD for communication-efficient distributed learning, outperforming strong baselines and maintaining benefits even for a high number of local steps.

2. Proposing and evaluating two architectures for the learned optimization of local SGD - a worker-aware optimizer (LAgg-A) and a worker-invariant optimizer (LOpt-A), from which one can choose depending on the use-case. 

3. Demonstrating that the proposed learned optimizers, even when meta-learned on a single or few architecture and dataset combinations, can generalize to new and much larger datasets and architectures, including ImageNet, ResNets, Vision Transformers (ViTs), and new modalities such as language modeling, obtaining competitive results in communication-efficient distributed settings.

In summary, the main contribution is showing the potential of using learned optimizers to improve communication-efficient distributed learning algorithms like local SGD, including the ability to generalize to unseen tasks.
