# [Active Learning Guided Federated Online Adaptation: Applications in   Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Medical image analysis faces major bottlenecks in data privacy, storage, and distribution shifts across different medical facilities and patient demographics. Data cannot be easily shared across patients, doctors, and facilities due to privacy laws. Each patient's data needs to be analyzed separately in real-time as data arrives. However, one would like to take advantage of accumulated knowledge across healthcare systems as more patient data is analyzed, while also incorporating feedback from doctors to improve model accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a federated learning based method for medical image segmentation that adapts to each incoming batch of patient data (online adaptation), incorporates doctor feedback through active learning, and assimilates knowledge across medical facilities without sharing patient data. 

Specifically, they propose DrFRODA - Doctors-in-the-loop Federated Online Domain Adaptation. It uses:

1) Online test-time adaptation (TTA) to adapt a pre-trained model to each batch of incoming target patient data, avoiding need for storage.

2) Selective image pruning to select most informative images in each batch for doctor annotations. This minimizes annotation burden.

3) Uncertainty-based budgeted pixel sampling to select the most uncertain pixels in selected images for doctor annotations.

4) Federated learning to aggregate model updates across medical facilities without sharing patient data, facilitating performance improvement over time.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes first method to integrate federated learning with online test-time adaptation and active learning for medical image segmentation. Enables privacy-preserving, storage-efficient adaptation.

2) Proposes innovative image pruning and pixel sampling strategies to minimize doctor annotation burden.

3) Experiments show the method exceeds unsupervised online adaptation methods and achieves near offline active learning performance, despite being online.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a federated test-time adaptation framework with doctor-guided active learning for privacy-preserving and storage-efficient medical image segmentation that progressively improves a global model by aggregating knowledge from multiple distributed local models adapted on-the-fly using limited annotations from doctors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing DrFRODA, a novel federated test time adaptation (TTA) framework with doctors-in-the-loop active learning for medical image segmentation. Specifically:

- DrFRODA is the first setup to explore both federated TTA and the integration of active learning to TTA. It allows online adaptation of models in a privacy-preserving distributed manner without needing to store or share medical image data.

- An innovative image pruning strategy is proposed to significantly reduce the annotation burden on each local user/doctor. Only the most informative subset of images and pixels are selected for annotation.

- Extensive experiments on public medical image datasets show DrFRODA outperforms existing unsupervised TTA methods by a large margin. It also reaches near offline active domain adaptation performance despite being an online approach.

- DrFRODA provides an effective solution for collaborative learning across healthcare facilities to handle distribution shifts in medical images, while maintaining data privacy, convenience, and improved performance over state-of-the-art online methods.

The paper proposes a framework called DrFRODA that combines ideas from test time adaptation, federated learning, online domain adaptation, active learning, and medical image segmentation. It allows privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare centers to improve medical image segmentation models in an online fashion by aggregating knowledge while incorporating active feedback from doctors. The goal is to adapt models to varying distributions of medical images in a practical healthcare setting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an innovative image pruning technique to select the most informative images from an online batch for active learning. Can you explain in detail how the KL divergence between source batch norm statistics and target image batch norm statistics is used to determine informativeness? What are the limitations of this approach?

2. The paper uses an acquisition function that combines both uncertainty and regional impurity for sampling the most useful pixels from the selected images. Can you explain how uncertainty and regional impurity are quantified? Why is using both metrics better than using only one?

3. The paper compares pixel-level and region-level annotations under the same annotation budget. What are the relative merits and demerits of both forms of annotation in the context of online active learning? When would you prefer one over the other?

4. How exactly does the proposed active learning strategy alleviate catastrophic forgetting of source knowledge in test time adaptation? Explain the working mechanism with relevant formulations.

5. The weighted FedAvg algorithm is used to aggregate local model updates on the central server. What are the challenges in defining appropriate weights for FedAvg in an online setup compared to offline federated learning?

6. From a system design perspective, what are the additional infrastructural requirements and assumptions needed to realize the proposed real-time federated active learning framework in a hospital?

7. The paper demonstrates results on multiple domain shifts like vendor shifts in MRI machines and phase shifts in MRI sequencing. How can the method be extended for handling more complex distribution shifts like cross-modality or cross-dataset shifts?  

8. What are the privacy and security implications of allowing doctors to directly annotate patient data for online adaptation? How can potential risks be mitigated?

9. The paper uses a ResNet18 backbone. How will the performance vary with more complex segmentation architectures? What adjustments would be needed to scale the method?

10. The focus is on segmenting anatomical structures. How can the method be customized for lesion or abnormality segmentation tasks where label scarcity is even more severe?
