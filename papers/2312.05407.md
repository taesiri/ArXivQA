# [Active Learning Guided Federated Online Adaptation: Applications in   Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Medical image analysis faces major bottlenecks in data privacy, storage, and distribution shifts across different medical facilities and patient demographics. Data cannot be easily shared across patients, doctors, and facilities due to privacy laws. Each patient's data needs to be analyzed separately in real-time as data arrives. However, one would like to take advantage of accumulated knowledge across healthcare systems as more patient data is analyzed, while also incorporating feedback from doctors to improve model accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a federated learning based method for medical image segmentation that adapts to each incoming batch of patient data (online adaptation), incorporates doctor feedback through active learning, and assimilates knowledge across medical facilities without sharing patient data. 

Specifically, they propose DrFRODA - Doctors-in-the-loop Federated Online Domain Adaptation. It uses:

1) Online test-time adaptation (TTA) to adapt a pre-trained model to each batch of incoming target patient data, avoiding need for storage.

2) Selective image pruning to select most informative images in each batch for doctor annotations. This minimizes annotation burden.

3) Uncertainty-based budgeted pixel sampling to select the most uncertain pixels in selected images for doctor annotations.

4) Federated learning to aggregate model updates across medical facilities without sharing patient data, facilitating performance improvement over time.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes first method to integrate federated learning with online test-time adaptation and active learning for medical image segmentation. Enables privacy-preserving, storage-efficient adaptation.

2) Proposes innovative image pruning and pixel sampling strategies to minimize doctor annotation burden.

3) Experiments show the method exceeds unsupervised online adaptation methods and achieves near offline active learning performance, despite being online.
