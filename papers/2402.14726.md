# [Incorporating Expert Rules into Neural Networks in the Framework of   Concept-Based Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14726)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper aims to incorporate expert rules into neural network models to improve concept-based learning. Concept-based learning uses human-defined concepts as features or labels to make model decisions more interpretable.  
- However, existing concept-based models can overfit when images have incomplete concept annotations. They also do not effectively integrate expert knowledge rules that connect concepts to each other or final labels.

Proposed Solution:
- Represent expert rules as logical functions of concept indicator variables. Formulate constraints so that predicted concept probabilities satisfy the rules.
- Model the feasible set of concept probability distributions that satisfy rules as a convex polytope. Find vertices or define faces of this polytope.  
- Construct different "concept head" modules to guarantee network outputs obey rules:
  - Base head: Filter invalid joint probabilities to satisfy rules 
  - Admissible state head: Only predict valid joint probabilities
  - Vertex-based head: Generate marginal probabilities from polytope vertices
  - Constraints head: Map embeddings directly to satisfy inequality constraints
- Optionally reduce state space by only considering concepts used in rules

Main Contributions:
- First formulation of incorporating expert rules into neural networks for concept-based learning
- Multiple approaches to enforce network outputs to satisfy arbitrary logical constraints over concepts
- Concept heads compensate for incomplete annotations and provide interpretable decisions
- Rules allow learning from datasets even missing some final labels  
- Broadly defines "expert rules" as any logical function over concepts, expanding applicability

In summary, the paper proposes new concept head architectures to integrate expert knowledge rules into standard neural networks to improve concept-based learning and interpretability. Both toy experiments and multi-label classification of MNIST demonstrate the benefits.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes approaches to incorporate expert rules formulated using human-interpretable concepts into neural networks for classification, in order to improve model accuracy and interpretability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is formulating the problem of incorporating expert rules into machine learning models to extend concept-based learning, and proposing several approaches to solve this problem. Specifically:

- The paper shows how to represent expert rules as logical functions of concepts and define constraints on the joint probability distribution over concepts to satisfy the rules. 

- It proposes ways to construct and train neural networks that predict concept probabilities while guaranteeing the output probabilities satisfy the expert rules. This is done by modeling the feasible set of probability distributions as a convex polytope and using its vertices or faces.

- Four specific approaches are presented for implementing this idea: Base Head, Admissible State Head, Vertex-based Head, and Constraints Head. Each has different complexity and applicability.

- The proposed models can compensate for incomplete concept labeling in datasets as well as partial availability of targets in the training set, by using the expert rules.

In summary, the key contribution is formulating the problem of incorporating expert rules into concept-based learning models, and providing concrete techniques to achieve this integration for improving model accuracy and interpretability. The paper opens up a new direction for combining inductive learning and deductive expert knowledge.
