# [From Movements to Metrics: Evaluating Explainable AI Methods in   Skeleton-Based Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12790)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of testing on the applicability and reliability of explainable AI (XAI) evaluation metrics in the domain of skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR). Established metrics like "faithfulness" and "stability" have not been evaluated in this context.

- There is also no comparative analysis between different XAI methods like Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to understand their relative efficacy. 

- Existing approaches to perturb skeleton data for analysis may distort the standard human skeletal structure that models are trained on. Biomechanically inaccurate perturbations can potentially lead to misleading conclusions.

Methods:
- The paper tests "faithfulness" and "stability" metrics on CAM and Grad-CAM explanations from an EfficientGCN model trained on the NTU RGB+D dataset.

- A novel perturbation approach is introduced that respects human biomechanical constraints to ensure skeleton graph variations are realistic.

- The impact of varying perturbation magnitudes on the XAI metrics is assessed. 

- A random attribution method serves as a baseline to compare against CAM and Grad-CAM.

Key Contributions:

- Testing established XAI metrics in the skeleton-based HAR domain and evaluating their applicability. "Faithfulness" is found to falter while "stability" emerges as more reliable.

- Introducing a biomechanically-valid skeleton graph perturbation technique for XAI evaluation.

- Revealing issues with relying on prediction probability shifts to assess explanation fidelity for certain models like EfficientGCN. 

- Finding that CAM and Grad-CAM produce very similar explanations and metric outcomes, highlighting a need for more diverse XAI methods.

- Identifying opportunities for developing novel metrics and testing different explanation techniques tailored to skeleton-based HAR.

In summary, the key gap addressed is the lack of analysis on XAI evaluation approaches for the emerging domain of skeleton-based action recognition. Both the shortcomings of certain metrics and the need for more diverse techniques are highlighted through systematic experimentation.
