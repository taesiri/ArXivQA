# Can Large Language Models design a Robot?

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Can large language models like ChatGPT-3 replace or supplement human engineers in the design process for creating new robots?The authors explore whether and to what extent ChatGPT-3 can guide a human through the conceptual design of a robot, provide relevant technical details, and accelerate the overall design process. They test this through an example of collaboratively designing a robotic crop harvesting gripper using ChatGPT-3 prompts and selections. The key hypothesis appears to be that large language models can enable, teach, and guide humans in building robots from scratch by leveraging their emerging capabilities for dialogue, reasoning, and technical knowledge. The authors aim to investigate the potentials and limitations of this human-AI collaborative design approach.
