# [Pose-Guided Self-Training with Two-Stage Clustering for Unsupervised   Landmark Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16194)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of unsupervised landmark discovery (ULD) for object categories like faces. ULD aims to detect semantically meaningful landmarks on objects without using any manual annotations during training. This is challenging as landmarks need to be invariant to viewpoint changes, occlusions and other variations while capturing the shape perception of non-rigid objects like faces. Existing methods struggle to detect consistent landmarks under large intra-class variations.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new diffusion-based ULD approach called D-ULD++ that leverages the implicit correspondence cues in pre-trained diffusion generative models. The key ideas are:

1) A simple baseline (ZeroShot) that clusters the internal representations from a pre-trained diffusion model at random pixel locations. This surprisingly outperforms prior ULD methods.

2) An algorithm called D-ULD that fine-tunes the diffusion model and uses clustering to obtain pseudo-labels for landmarks. These are used in a self-training loop leading to improved performance over ZeroShot.

3) A pose-guided proxy task using a VAE that reconstructs predicted landmark heatmaps after projecting them to a latent pose space. This adds pose awareness.

4) A two-stage clustering mechanism that first clusters images based on latent pose codes from the VAE and then clusters landmarks within each pose cluster. This captures pose variations better.

The combination of ideas 3) and 4) with D-ULD results in the proposed D-ULD++ algorithm.

Main Contributions:

- A simple yet effective ZeroShot baseline for exploration of diffusion models for ULD

- D-ULD algorithm involving diffusion feature fine-tuning and self-training with pseudo-labels 

- Pose-guided proxy task and two-stage clustering to make D-ULD robust to pose variations

- Consistent and significant improvement over prior state-of-the-art on four datasets including human and cat faces

The main highlight is leveraging correspondence cues in diffusion models via careful fine-tuning and self-training to push the envelope in ULD performance. The introduction of explicit pose modeling and two-stage clustering leads to the best results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new unsupervised landmark discovery method called D-ULD++ that leverages diffusion model features, a pose-guided proxy task, and two-stage clustering to significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art on detecting semantically meaningful landmarks across different object categories.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a simple zero-shot baseline for unsupervised landmark discovery that is based on clustering diffusion model features. This baseline outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. 

2) Developing an unsupervised landmark detection algorithm called D-ULD that is based on diffusion features. It uses clustering to obtain pseudo-labels for landmarks, which are then used for self-training. D-ULD shows significant improvements over the zero-shot baseline.

3) Introducing a pose-guided proxy task and two-stage clustering mechanism in D-ULD to deal with challenges due to large pose variations. This results in the proposed D-ULD++ algorithm. 

4) Conducting extensive experiments on four datasets - AFLW, MAFL, CatHeads, and LS3D. D-ULD++ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance by large margins compared to previous methods for unsupervised landmark discovery.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the D-ULD++ algorithm for unsupervised landmark discovery that leverages diffusion model features along with self-training, a pose-guided proxy task, and two-stage clustering to achieve significantly improved performance over prior art.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a zero-shot baseline method that performs surprisingly well despite its simplicity. What features of the pre-trained diffusion model enable the zero-shot method to work as well as it does? How might those features be improved or better utilized?

2) The paper introduces a two-stage clustering mechanism to generate pseudo-labels. How exactly does decomposing the clustering into two stages, one based on pose and one on descriptors, help improve performance over regular clustering? What are the limitations of this approach?

3) The paper claims the latent codes from the pose-guided proxy task capture relevant pose information without any pose supervision. What properties of the proxy task facilitate learning a pose-related latent space? How could the latent codes be analyzed or evaluated to better understand what is being captured? 

4) What are the key benefits of using self-training based on clustering rather than a standard self-supervised learning approach? What unique advantages does clustering provide in this application? What disadvantages might it have?

5) How does the performance scale with the number of clusters used for pseudo-labels? Is there a point of diminishing returns and if so, what factors determine what that point is?

6) How robust is the method to occlusions, extreme lighting or image quality changes? What failure cases exist and why?

7) Can the method generalize to new object categories not seen during training? What adaptations would be needed to enable zero-shot generalization?

8) How does the computational efficiency of feature extraction compare between the baseline diffusion model and the fine-tuned model? Is there a runtime tradeoff?

9) Could the method be extended to video input for temporal consistency of landmarks? What modifications would that entail?

10) Where does the method still fall short of supervised methods? Are there fundamental limitations of the unsupervised approach or just current lack of sophistication?
