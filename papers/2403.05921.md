# [OntoChat: a Framework for Conversational Ontology Engineering using   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05921)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Ontology engineering (OE) in large collaborative projects faces challenges due to the complex interactions between various stakeholders, domain experts, and ontology designers. This can lead to inconsistencies and bottlenecks in defining ontology requirements, design, evaluation and reuse. Current OE methodologies rely heavily on manual activities.  

Proposed Solution: The authors propose OntoChat, a conversational framework for ontology engineering powered by large language models (LLMs). OntoChat aims to reduce the complexity of interactions and accelerate key OE tasks such as:

1) Requirement Elicitation: Assists stakeholders in collaboratively creating user stories to define requirements. Extracts competency questions (CQs) from stories through LLM interaction.

2) Analysis: Removes redundant CQs, clusters them into themes to help organize requirements. 

3) Testing: Verbalizes ontologies into text for LLM to verify if CQs are addressed, also tests for errors.

Main Contributions:

- Evidence from survey that the most demanding OE tasks needing computational support are: requirement collection, CQ extraction, analysis and testing.

- Design of OntoChat leveraging LLMs to reduce multi-party interactions and accelerate the above tasks through conversational workflows.  

- Prototype implementation and preliminary evaluation with domain experts and engineers. Showed positive reception, indicated time-savings, but also areas for improving data examples in stories and CQ entity scoping.

- Underscores the potential of LLMs and conversational interfaces to enhance efficiency and collaboration in ontology engineering.
