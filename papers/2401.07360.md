# [Promptformer: Prompted Conformer Transducer for ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07360)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-turn interactions in automatic speech recognition (ASR) can benefit from contextual information from previous turns. However, existing methods to incorporate textual context into ASR models increase model complexity and training overhead.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a novel context fusion method inspired by hyper-prompting to integrate textual context into the attention mechanism of the encoder in conformer-transducer models. 
- Context is generated from previous ASR hypotheses using either a BERT model or the internal RNN-T prediction network's sentence piece model (SPM) encoder.
- The context embedding is concatenated with acoustic representations to augment the keys and values in multi-headed self-attention (MHSA). This allows shared acoustic and textual kernels to produce fused representations without increasing sequence length.

Main Contributions:
- The proposed prompting method consistently outperforms cross-attention and feature concatenation baselines, while adding fewer parameters.
- Achieves 5.9% relative WER reduction on a multi-turn test set and is robust when context is unavailable.  
- Shows internal SPM encoder can outperform external BERT model for context generation.
- Demonstrates comparable gains when only fine-tuning the MHSA modules and projections, reducing training overhead.

In summary, the paper presents a novel and effective prompting mechanism to incorporate textual context into streaming conformer-transducers to improve ASR for multi-turn interactions. Key advantages are model simplicity, training efficiency and robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel mechanism to fuse textual context with acoustic representations in the attention mechanism of a conformer-transducer ASR model, achieving 5.9% relative WER reduction on a multi-turn test set.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel mechanism to integrate textual context into the attention mechanism of the encoder of conformer-transducer ASR models, in order to improve performance on multi-turn interactions. Specifically:

- They propose to concatenate textual representations (derived from previous ASR recognitions) with acoustic representations in the keys and values of the multi-headed self-attention mechanism. This draws inspiration from hyper-prompting and fuses the multimodal information.

- They show this approach outperforms other context integration methods like cross-attention and feature concatenation, while being more parameter and computationally efficient. 

- Their best model achieves a 5.9% relative word error rate reduction on a multi-turn test set. They also show the approach does not degrade performance when context is not available.

- They demonstrate the gains can be achieved even when only fine-tuning a small subset of model parameters related to the multi-headed self-attention and projection layers. This enables computational savings.

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient and effective method to incorporate textual context into streaming conformer-transducer models to improve ASR for multi-turn interactions, without sacrificing performance on non-contextual speech.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel mechanism for fusing textual context with acoustic representations in the attention mechanism of the encoder. Can you explain in detail how this fusion approach works and how it is different from prior works? 

2. The paper evaluates two approaches for generating token representations of the textual context - using an external BERT model and using the internal pretrained sentence piece model (SPM). What are the tradeoffs between these two approaches in terms of performance, computational complexity, and ease of deployment?

3. The paper explores different techniques for consuming the textual context representations, including cross-attention, feature concatenation, and the proposed prompting approach. Can you analyze the differences between these techniques and why prompting works the best?

4. The prompting approach is inspired by hyper-prompting from NLP. How is the global prompt used in this work different from the typical hyper-prompting approach? What adaptations were made to make it suitable for an ASR model?

5. The paper shows that fine-tuning just the multi-headed self-attention modules and projections achieves comparable performance to fine-tuning the entire model. Why does this work and what does this suggest about how the model is able to effectively incorporate context?

6. The experiments show that token-level context representations generally outperform sentence-level representations. Provide some hypotheses about why this is the case in the context of an end-to-end ASR model.

7. While most of the gains are obtained when context is available, the model still shows some improvements on utterances without context. What factors might contribute to these gains even without context?

8. The approach adds very few parameters to the baseline model. Discuss the benefits of being parameters-efficient versus prior contextual modeling techniques for ASR that require full architecture changes. 

9. Could this approach be extended to incorporate other forms of context beyond just previous ASR transcripts? What kinds of contextual signals could be relevant?

10. The paper focuses on a streaming setup. How could the ideas be adapted to work in an offline context-aware ASR system? What modifications would need to be made?
