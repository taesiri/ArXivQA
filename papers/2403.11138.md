# [Spiking Wavelet Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11138)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are energy-efficient but lag behind in accuracy compared to ANNs. Recently, Spiking Transformers have shown promise by incorporating self-attention, but they rely on global operations so struggle to capture high-frequency visual patterns like edges and textures.  
- Capturing frequency information is important for SNNs since neuromorphic data conveys brightness changes as high frequencies. However, frequency analysis relies on matrix multiplications, which is challenging for the sparse, spike-based computing of SNNs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Spiking Wavelet Transformer (SWformer), a novel attention-free architecture that effectively captures spatial-frequency patterns in a spike-driven manner.

- Key innovation is the Frequency-Aware Token Mixer (FATM) with three branches: 
    1) Spiking wavelet learner to enable frequency domain learning
    2) Convolution-based learner for spatial feature extraction
    3) Spiking pointwise convolution for cross-channel aggregation

- The paper also introduces a robust spiking frequency representation by combining wavelet transform sparsity with ternary spike values, allowing accurate signal projection.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of SWformer that outperforms SOTA SNNs in capturing high frequencies using FATM and spiking wavelet transforms.

- Introduction of a spike-based frequency representation for robust, event-driven signal transformation in SNNs.

- Extensive experiments showing SWformer advances SOTA on ImageNet and a variety of neuromorphic datasets. It reduces parameters by 21.1% and energy consumption by over 50% compared to Spiking Transformers.

In summary, the paper makes SNNs more effective at learning spatial-frequency patterns by proposing the SWformer architecture and spiking frequency representation approach. This allows neuromorphic models to achieve better accuracy while retaining their efficiency benefits.
