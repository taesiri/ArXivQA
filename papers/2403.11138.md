# [Spiking Wavelet Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11138)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are energy-efficient but lag behind in accuracy compared to ANNs. Recently, Spiking Transformers have shown promise by incorporating self-attention, but they rely on global operations so struggle to capture high-frequency visual patterns like edges and textures.  
- Capturing frequency information is important for SNNs since neuromorphic data conveys brightness changes as high frequencies. However, frequency analysis relies on matrix multiplications, which is challenging for the sparse, spike-based computing of SNNs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Spiking Wavelet Transformer (SWformer), a novel attention-free architecture that effectively captures spatial-frequency patterns in a spike-driven manner.

- Key innovation is the Frequency-Aware Token Mixer (FATM) with three branches: 
    1) Spiking wavelet learner to enable frequency domain learning
    2) Convolution-based learner for spatial feature extraction
    3) Spiking pointwise convolution for cross-channel aggregation

- The paper also introduces a robust spiking frequency representation by combining wavelet transform sparsity with ternary spike values, allowing accurate signal projection.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of SWformer that outperforms SOTA SNNs in capturing high frequencies using FATM and spiking wavelet transforms.

- Introduction of a spike-based frequency representation for robust, event-driven signal transformation in SNNs.

- Extensive experiments showing SWformer advances SOTA on ImageNet and a variety of neuromorphic datasets. It reduces parameters by 21.1% and energy consumption by over 50% compared to Spiking Transformers.

In summary, the paper makes SNNs more effective at learning spatial-frequency patterns by proposing the SWformer architecture and spiking frequency representation approach. This allows neuromorphic models to achieve better accuracy while retaining their efficiency benefits.

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

3. Incorporating negative spike dynamics, a simple yet effective approach to provide robust frequency representation in SNNs, from theoretical and experimental observation.

4. Demonstrating through extensive experiments that the proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN performances, achieving over 50% reduction in energy consumption, 21.1% reduction in parameter count, and 2.40% performance improvement on ImageNet compared to vanilla Spiking Transformers.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel Spiking Wavelet Transformer architecture that effectively captures spatial-frequency information in an event-driven manner, outperforming prior SNN models.
