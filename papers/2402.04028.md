# [AlbNews: A Corpus of Headlines for Topic Modeling in Albanian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04028)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper introduces AlbNews, a new corpus for conducting topic modeling research on Albanian texts. The authors point out that there is a lack of text corpora for low-resource languages like Albanian, which limits the ability to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques. 

To address this, the authors created a corpus called AlbNews which contains 3200 news headlines in Albanian collected from online news portals from 2022-2023. From these, 600 headlines were manually annotated with four topical categories: "pol" for politics, "cul" for culture, "eco" for economy, and "spo" for sports. The remaining 2600 headlines are unlabeled.

The paper presents some basic statistics on the headline lengths, showing they range from 5 to 33 tokens long, with an average of around 14 tokens. Some example labeled headlines are provided to illustrate the four topics.

The authors experiment with several traditional machine learning classifiers on the labeled subset to establish some baseline results for future research. The models tested include logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, and ensemble methods like gradient boosting and random forests. The best accuracy of 85% was achieved by logistic regression, with SVM close behind at 84% accuracy. The other methods did not perform as well, indicating potential issues with overfitting on this small labeled dataset.

In conclusion, the paper's main contribution is the introduction of the AlbNews corpus for enabling topic modeling research on Albanian texts. The baseline classification results provide a starting point for future experiments with this new resource. The authors suggest pretraining language models on Albanian texts as a direction for improving performance further. Overall, AlbNews helps address the lack of resources for low-resource languages like Albanian to advance NLP capabilities.
