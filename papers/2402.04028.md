# [AlbNews: A Corpus of Headlines for Topic Modeling in Albanian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04028)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper introduces AlbNews, a new corpus for conducting topic modeling research on Albanian texts. The authors point out that there is a lack of text corpora for low-resource languages like Albanian, which limits the ability to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques. 

To address this, the authors created a corpus called AlbNews which contains 3200 news headlines in Albanian collected from online news portals from 2022-2023. From these, 600 headlines were manually annotated with four topical categories: "pol" for politics, "cul" for culture, "eco" for economy, and "spo" for sports. The remaining 2600 headlines are unlabeled.

The paper presents some basic statistics on the headline lengths, showing they range from 5 to 33 tokens long, with an average of around 14 tokens. Some example labeled headlines are provided to illustrate the four topics.

The authors experiment with several traditional machine learning classifiers on the labeled subset to establish some baseline results for future research. The models tested include logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, and ensemble methods like gradient boosting and random forests. The best accuracy of 85% was achieved by logistic regression, with SVM close behind at 84% accuracy. The other methods did not perform as well, indicating potential issues with overfitting on this small labeled dataset.

In conclusion, the paper's main contribution is the introduction of the AlbNews corpus for enabling topic modeling research on Albanian texts. The baseline classification results provide a starting point for future experiments with this new resource. The authors suggest pretraining language models on Albanian texts as a direction for improving performance further. Overall, AlbNews helps address the lack of resources for low-resource languages like Albanian to advance NLP capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces AlbNews, a new corpus of 600 labeled and 2600 unlabeled Albanian news headlines for conducting topic modeling research, reports baseline classification results using the labeled data, and calls for developing pretrained language models for Albanian.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be the introduction of AlbNews, which is described as "a collection of 600 labeled news headlines and 2600 unlabeled ones in Albanian". The paper states that the goal of this new dataset is to "foster research on Topic Modeling of Albanian texts". 

So in summary, the key contribution is the creation and release of a new dataset called AlbNews, consisting of Albanian news headlines, with a portion annotated by topic, aimed to enable further research on topic modeling for the Albanian language.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key terms and topics associated with this paper include:

- AlbNews - The name of the corpus of Albanian news headlines introduced in the paper.

- Topic modeling - One of the main applications the AlbNews corpus is intended for. The paper discusses topic modeling research and resources.

- Text classification - Another task the AlbNews data can be used for. The paper presents some preliminary text classification experiments. 

- Low-resource languages - The paper situates its contributions in the context of NLP for low-resource languages like Albanian.

- Albanian - The language of the texts in the AlbNews corpus.

- Headlines - The paper collects news headlines from Albanian news websites.

- Machine learning - Traditional machine learning classifiers are experimented with for baseline topic classification.

- Results - Classification accuracy results are reported which show simpler ML models outperforming ensemble methods.

In summary, the key topics cover the AlbNews corpus introduction, its utility for NLP tasks like topic modeling and text classification, the low-resource language motivation, and the initial classification experiments and results.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that AlbNews was created by collecting headlines from Albanian news articles published during February 2022 - December 2023. What was the rationale behind selecting this specific timeframe for data collection? How might the selection of a different timeframe impact the corpus?

2. In Section 3, the paper states that initially about 6000 headlines were crawled but some were dropped due to being too short or having bad formatting. What were the specific criteria used to filter out headlines (minimum length, formatting issues, etc.)? How might changing these criteria impact the quality and usefulness of the final corpus? 

3. The paper annotated only 600 of the 3200 collected headlines due to limited manpower. What approaches could be used to expand the labeled subset in a cost-effective way, such as active learning or crowdsourcing? What factors need to be considered?

4. Section 4.1 mentions applying TF-IDF vectorization to the headline texts. How does the choice of vectorization technique impact topic modeling and classification performance? What other vectorization methods could be explored?

5. In Section 4.2, why do you think simpler machine learning methods like Logistic Regression outperformed more complex ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting and Random Forest? What modifications could make the ensemble methods more effective?  

6. The paper suggests that overfitting may have been an issue for the ensemble methods due to the small dataset size. What techniques could be used to reduce overfitting when working with small corpora?

7. How well do you expect the models trained on this news headline corpus to generalize to other types of Albanian text? What steps could be taken to improve generalizability?

8. The discussion section mentions that creating pre-trained language models for Albanian could improve performance. What considerations would need to be made in developing those models? What data should they be trained on?

9. What other traditional machine learning and deep learning methods should be explored as potential baselines beyond what was tested in the paper? What challenges might arise in applying them?

10. The paper focuses only on multi-class topic classification. How could the AlbNews corpus be utilized for unsupervised topic modeling as well? What methods could be applied?
