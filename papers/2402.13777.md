 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Deep Generative Models for Offline Policy Learning: Tutorial, Survey, and Perspectives on Future Directions":

Problem:
Offline policy learning aims to learn effective policies for robotic control or decision-making from pre-existing, static datasets, without any additional interactions with the environment. It includes two main branches: offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) and imitation learning (IL). There has been great progress in applying deep generative models (DGMs), including variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), normalizing flows (NFs), transformers and diffusion models (DMs), for computer vision and natural language processing tasks. This paper provides the first comprehensive review on harnessing the advancements of DGMs to enhance offline policy learning.

Solution:
The paper systematically reviews algorithms that incorporate DGMs into offline RL and IL across five main generative models: VAEs, GANs, NFs, transformers and DMs. For each DGM, it introduces the mathematical foundations, overview of major variants, applications in offline RL and IL by providing necessary background, categorizing related works based on DGM usage, and highlighting the evolution of algorithms targeting specific issues. 

Main Contributions:
- First review paper on deep generative models for offline policy learning that covers a wide array of topics including five mainstream DGMs and their applications in both offline RL and IL
- Distills key algorithmic schemes and selectively highlights seminal research works as tutorials on respective topics
- Traces the evolution of DGM-based offline policy learning in parallel with the progress in generative models themselves
- Provides in-depth discussions that analyze common and unique usages of different DGMs, summarize seminal works and targeted issues/extensions in each category
- Presents perspectives on future research directions regarding data, benchmarking, theories and algorithm designs

Overall, this paper offers a hands-on reference for understanding the progress and inspiring improved DGM-based offline RL/IL algorithms.
