# [4M: Massively Multimodal Masked Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06647)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces 4M, a novel framework for training scalable and versatile foundation models for computer vision using a multimodal masked modeling objective. The method trains a single Transformer encoder-decoder on multiple modalities including images, text, geometry, and semantics. It tokenizes all modalities into discrete tokens, allowing the model to map between modalities by predicting tokens. A key aspect is the training objective, which randomly masks subsets of tokens from all modalities as inputs and targets. This allows scaling to multiple modalities while keeping costs low. Experiments demonstrate 4M's ability to perform diverse vision tasks out-of-the-box and transfer well to unseen tasks when fine-tuned. The learned representations also enable flexible conditional generation between modalities, allowing various multimodal editing capabilities. Thorough ablations provide insights into model design choices and show 4M scales well with data, compute, and model size. The simplicity and strong performance of the approach demonstrates potential for 4M to serve as versatile foundation models for vision.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Current machine learning models for computer vision are often specialized for a single task and modality, lacking the versatility and scalability seen in large language models. There is a need for similarly capable foundation models for vision that can handle multiple modalities and tasks in a unified manner.

Method - 4M:
The paper proposes a multimodal training framework called 4M that trains a single Transformer encoder-decoder model using a masked modeling objective across diverse input/output modalities:

- Modalities: RGB, depth, surface normals, semantics, bounding boxes, captions, CLIP features
- Unifies modalities into discrete tokens using modality-specific tokenizers 
- Trains on large pseudo-labeled Conceptual Captions dataset (CC12M)
- Scalable training via input and target masking - predicts subsets of tokens 

Key Capabilities:
- Performs many vision tasks out-of-the-box e.g. segmentation, depth estimation
- Transfers very well to unseen downstream tasks through fine-tuning
- Functions as conditional generative model, enabling diverse multimodal editing

Contributions:
- Proposes 4M method for training versatile foundation models using multimodal masked modeling
- Shows strong performance on vision tasks out-of-the-box and when fine-tuned
- Demonstrates powerful generative capabilities via conditioning on arbitrary modalities
- Provides extensive experimental analysis into the method's capabilities and limitations

The key innovation is training a single model on multiple modalities with a masking objective for versatility and scalability. The experiments and analyses clearly validate 4M's effectiveness as a general-purpose vision model with both discriminative and generative abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multimodal masked modeling framework called 4M for training a single unified Transformer encoder-decoder on diverse modalities like images, text, and neural network features using a masked modeling objective to enable strong cross-modal predictive coding abilities and achieve scalability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose a method called \method (4M) for training versatile and scalable foundation models for vision using a multimodal masked modeling objective. This allows training a single model on multiple modalities and tasks.

2) They demonstrate the efficacy of their approach through extensive experiments, showing these models can perform many key vision tasks out of the box, and achieve highly competitive performance when fine-tuned on unseen downstream tasks. 

3) They showcase the flexible and steerable generative capabilities enabled by training with the \method objective, allowing various multimodal editing tasks through conditioning on arbitrary modalities.

4) They conduct an extensive ablation analysis to study the factors affecting \method's performance and provide insights into the behavior and design of these models.

In summary, the key contribution is the \method framework itself for training scalable and versatile vision foundation models in a multimodal setting, along with analyses demonstrating its capabilities and potential.
