# [Coupled Confusion Correction: Learning from Crowds with Sparse   Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07331)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called Coupled Confusion Correction (CCC) to address the problem of learning from noisy labels collected via crowdsourcing. CCC trains two models simultaneously, enabling each model to correct the confusion matrices (modeling annotator expertise) learned by the other model using a small "meta" dataset distilled from that model. This allows confusion matrices to be corrected even for annotators who provided very few labels, overcoming the annotation sparsity problem. Further, CCC clusters annotators by expertise so their confusion matrices can be corrected together as a group, providing more supervision. The paper also identifies an issue with existing synthetic crowdsourcing datasets not reflecting the real-world presence of annotators providing very few labels. CCC addresses this by generating labels using a Beta distribution, better mimicking real crowdsourcing data properties. Experiments on synthetic and real-world image and music classification datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of CCC versus other learning-from-crowds methods. The results show CCC significantly outperforms baselines, especially for few-label annotators, validating the approach can overcome annotation sparsity to improve model training with crowdsourced data.
