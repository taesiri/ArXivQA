# [Optimizing Illuminant Estimation in Dual-Exposure HDR Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02449)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- High dynamic range (HDR) imaging captures multiple frames of a scene with different exposure settings to enhance the dynamic range. This is done either via burst capture or staggered sensors that simultaneously capture short and long exposures.  
- Illuminant estimation is a key step in camera image signal processing (ISP) to estimate the color of the scene's light source for white balancing. 
- Despite having multiple frames, conventional methods perform illuminant estimation on just a single frame, missing chances to utilize information from other frames.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose using dual-exposure images readily available in HDR pipeline - a long exposure frame and short exposure frame of the scene.  
- Introduce a "dual-exposure feature" (DEF) capturing chromatic differences between the long and short exposure frames using a color mapping matrix and covariance matrix.
- Use DEF in a small multilayer perceptron (EMLP) and by integrating into convolutional color constancy method (ECCC).

Main Contributions:
- Novel dual-exposure feature (DEF) leveraging extra frames in HDR imaging to guide illuminant estimators.
- Lightweight EMLP network with only 354 parameters achieving comparable accuracy to complex models with millions of parameters.
- Modified CCC framework, called exposure-based CCC (ECCC), also using DEF and achieving better results than classic CCC with 50% fewer parameters.
- Collect new multi-exposure dataset with ground truth illuminants for validation. Experiments show EMLP and ECCC obtain promising performance using reasonable parameters.
