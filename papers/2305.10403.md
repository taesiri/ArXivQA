# [PaLM 2 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10403)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on skimming through the paper, it appears the main research questions and hypotheses are:1. What scaling laws should be followed when scaling up model size, dataset size, and compute for large language models? The paper validates recent findings that model size and dataset size should be scaled proportionally, rather than scaling up model size much faster than dataset size.2. Can improvements beyond just model scaling lead to better performance and efficiency? The paper aims to show that innovations in architecture, training objectives, and data diversity can yield improved performance even with smaller model sizes.3. How does the new PaLM 2 model compare to previous models like PaLM and GPT-4 across a variety of natural language tasks? The paper systematically benchmarks PaLM 2 against previous models to quantify the gains.4. What are PaLM 2's capabilities and limitations regarding multilinguality, reasoning, code generation, translation, etc? The paper evaluates PaLM 2 extensively on multilingual and reasoning tasks to characterize its strengths and weaknesses.5. How does PaLM 2 perform on responsible AI benchmarks? The paper analyzes potential harms, biases, and memorization to assess risks and inform downstream usage.In summary, the central hypotheses appear to be that scaling laws need revisiting at large scales, and that innovations beyond just model scaling can improve efficiency and performance across languages, reasoning, and applications. The paper aims to comprehensively characterize and benchmark the new PaLM 2 model.
