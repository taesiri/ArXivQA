# [T-Code: Simple Temporal Latent Code for Efficient Dynamic View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11015)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Efficient dynamic view synthesis for reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes is challenging. Key difficulties include 1) compressing temporal variations into a compact representation without confusion across time, 2) coping with structural differences between time domain and spatial domain, and 3) handling different data types (multi-camera vs monocular). Prior works either use complex models that are computationally heavy and require lots of storage, or use tangled representations that cause confusion.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a compact 1D temporal encoding called "T-Code" to disentangle temporal features from spatial ones. T-Code uses multi-resolution hash encoding to fuse information across time in a compact and decoupled manner. It is flexible to combine with other modules for dynamic view synthesis under different data types and scenarios.

Key Contributions:
1) First to use a compact 1D encoding in time domain to explicitly disentangle temporal and spatial features for general dynamic reconstruction.

2) Propose "HybridNGP" which combines T-Code with spatial hash encoding to achieve high fidelity and efficient multi-camera reconstruction. Outperforms state-of-the-arts in speed and storage while maintaining quality.

3) Propose "DNGP-T" which combines T-Code with deformation network and hash grid to handle monocular data. Achieves state-of-the-art quality and training speed compared to baselines.  

The decomposed and compact T-Code representation enables customization for different scenarios to yield optimized results. Experiments validate the efficiency and flexibility of T-Code for high performance dynamic view synthesis.
