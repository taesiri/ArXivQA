# [Debiased Offline Representation Learning for Fast Online Adaptation in   Non-stationary Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11317)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on offline reinforcement learning in non-stationary environments. Specifically, it addresses the challenges of learning an adaptable policy using only offline datasets in settings where the environment dynamics (transition functions) unpredictably change over time within an episode. This is an important and challenging problem since policies trained assuming stationary dynamics often fail in real-world applications where dynamics are inherently non-stationary. However, only limited prior work has looked at this problem, particularly in the offline setting where interaction with the environment is not allowed during training/adaptation.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework called DORA (Debiased Offline Representation for fast online Adaptation) for this problem setting. DORA learns a dynamics sensitive "context encoder" using offline datasets that maps recent state-action pairs to a representation of the current dynamics. This allows a contextual policy network to rapidly adapt online as the dynamics change. 

The key ideas are:
(1) Maximize mutual information between the learned representations and environment dynamics while minimizing mutual information between representations and behavior policy actions. This "information bottleneck" principle extracts essential dynamics information while debiasing from the behavior policy.
(2) Practical tractable losses implementing the information bottleneck, including an InfoNCE lower bound to maximize dynamics-representation mutual information, and a KL divergence upper bound to minimize policy-representation mutual information.
(3) Use of the learned debiased encoder and contextual policy network to achieve swift online adaptation without needing to collect any contexts trajectories before evaluation as in prior work.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new problem formulation of offline RL adaptation in non-stationary dynamics which is important but overlooked.
- Provides a new method (DORA) achieving state-of-the-art performance by learning debiased dynamics representations and enabling fast online adaptation.
- Derives novel information theoretic losses for debiasing in the offline meta RL setting.
- Demonstrates strong empirical performance over baselines on MuJoCo tasks with varying dynamics.
