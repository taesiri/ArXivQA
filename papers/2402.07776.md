# [TELLER: A Trustworthy Framework for Explainable, Generalizable and   Controllable Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07776)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing deep learning models for fake news detection lack transparency and struggle to generalize to diverse data. 
- Increasing use of large language models (LLMs) poses risks like hallucinations and societal harms.
- Thus, there is a need for trustworthy fake news detection frameworks that ensure explainability, generalizability and controllability.

Proposed Solution - TELLER Framework:
- A dual-system framework inspired by human psychology consisting of a cognition system and a decision system.
- Cognition system transforms human expertise into question templates, instantiates them for given news input using LLMs to get logic atoms.  
- Decision system aggregates logic atoms into logic rules using a neural-symbolic model, enabling transparent decisions.
- Framework ensures explainability via questions and symbolic rules, generalizability by combining human guidance and model learning, and controllability through rule adjustment.

Main Contributions:  
- Identification of key principles of trustworthy fake news detection systems.
- Novel dual-system TELLER framework to detect fake news while adhering to explainability, generalizability and controllability.
- Comprehensive evaluation on multiple datasets showing accuracy improvements and trustworthiness.
- Analysis of feasibility to scale performance with more powerful LLMs and integrate human oversight.

In summary, the paper proposes an interpretable and robust fake news detection framework called TELLER that can generalize effectively across domains while upholding transparency and controllability standards.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a dual-system framework, TELLER, for fake news detection that integrates a cognition system to transform human expertise into logic predicates answered by language models and a decision system to aggregate them into interpretable rules, ensuring explainability, generalizability and controllability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel dual-system framework called TELLER for fake news detection that prioritizes explainability, generalizability, and controllability. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Identifying three crucial principles - explainability, generalizability, and controllability - for establishing trustworthy fake news detection systems.

2) Proposing a cognition system that transforms human expertise into logic predicates and leverages large language models to evaluate logic atoms, ensuring explainability and controllability. 

3) Developing a decision system using a differentiable neural-symbolic model to learn interpretable logic rules from data automatically, guaranteeing generalizability across domains.

4) Conducting comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and large language models to demonstrate the feasibility, explainability, generalizability and controllability of the proposed TELLER framework.

In summary, the main contribution is designing a novel dual-system framework that adheres to principles of trustworthy AI for fake news detection.
