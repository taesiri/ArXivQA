# [Towards Accurate Lip-to-Speech Synthesis in-the-Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01087)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Lip-to-speech synthesis, which involves generating speech from silent talking face videos, is challenging. Current models struggle to learn language and speech attributes well because they try to learn both solely from speech supervision. This leads to poor performance, with generated speech often being unintelligible or out-of-sync with the lip movements.

Proposed Solution:
The key idea is to use the advancements in lip-to-text models which have already learned to extract content from lips using text supervision. Specifically:

1) Use a pre-trained lip-to-text model to get noisy text transcripts and visual features from the silent input video. 

2) Design a visual text-to-speech (TTS) model conditioned on the noisy text and visual features to generate speech that precisely syncs with the input video.

Main Contributions:

1) Show that learning lip-to-speech without text understanding is very difficult, which is why current models perform poorly. Propose using lip-to-text to aid lip-to-speech.

2) Approach involves training a visual TTS network to synthesize speech conditioned on visual features and noisy text from a lip-to-text model. Outperforms state-of-the-art on quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

3) Enables accurate and natural speech generation for silent videos of any speaker, in any desired voice. Demonstrate first real-world application by voicing silent lip movements of an ALS patient.

In summary, this paper clearly identifies issues in current lip-to-speech models and proposes an effective solution using recent advancements in the sibling task of lip-to-text generation. The high quality outputs across benchmarks and real-world demonstration showcase the applicability of their method.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel approach for accurate and natural multi-speaker lip-to-speech synthesis in unconstrained environments by incorporating noisy text supervision from pre-trained lip-to-text models into a visual text-to-speech network that generates speech synchronized with silent talking face videos.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach for multi-speaker lip-to-speech synthesis in unconstrained environments. Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

1) Current lip-to-speech models struggle to learn language and speech attributes directly from speech supervision alone. To address this, the paper proposes using the outputs (text predictions and visual features) of a pre-trained lip-to-text model to aid in lip-to-speech generation. 

2) The approach involves training a visual text-to-speech model that takes the noisy text predictions and visual features as input to synthesize speech that precisely syncs with the input video. 

3) Experiments show the approach outperforms existing multi-speaker lip-to-speech models on several benchmarks and generates more accurate and natural speech outputs. The model works for silent videos of any speaker.

4) The paper demonstrates a real-world application by generating speech from the silent mouth movements of an ALS patient, which shows the usefulness for assistive technology.

In summary, the key contribution is an effective approach to generate accurate and natural speech from silent talking face videos of unseen speakers by incorporating visual information and noisy text supervision from pre-trained lip-to-text models.
