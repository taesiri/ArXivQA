# [MARIS: Referring Image Segmentation via Mutual-Aware Attention Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15727)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel referring image segmentation method called MARIS, which leverages the powerful Segment Anything Model (SAM) and introduces a mutual-aware attention mechanism to enhance cross-modal fusion. Specifically, the mutual-aware attention consists of Vision-Guided Attention and Language-Guided Attention to bidirectionally model the relationship between visual and linguistic features. This generates language-aware visual features and vision-aware linguistic features. To enable explicit linguistic guidance in the mask decoder, a multi-modal query token is proposed to integrate linguistic information and interact with visual features simultaneously. The image encoder from SAM is frozen to preserve generalization capabilities. A Feature Enhancement module is introduced to integrate global and local visual features from SAM and transfer knowledge into the referring segmentation task. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The mutual-aware attention brings significant improvements by weighting words in the expression and image regions bidirectionally. The multi-modal query token and explicit linguistic guidance also enhance consistency with the expression. Freezing the encoders and Feature Enhancement lead to excellent generalization abilities. Overall, the novel mutual-aware attention mechanism and integration of SAM's capabilities enable MARIS to advance the state-of-the-art in referring image segmentation.
