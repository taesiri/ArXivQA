# [Simple Transferability Estimation for Regression Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00656)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes two simple and efficient approaches, Linear MSE and Label MSE, for estimating the transferability between regression tasks in deep transfer learning. These methods estimate transferability by training a regularized linear regression model between extracted features or "dummy" labels from a source task and the true labels of a target task. The paper proves novel theoretical results connecting the proposed estimators to the actual transferability obtained from transfer learning. Extensive experiments on keypoint detection datasets demonstrate that, despite their simplicity, the proposed approaches significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art methods for regression transferability estimation in both effectiveness and efficiency. On average, the proposed methods improve correlation results by up to 36% compared to prior work while also being over 27% faster. The strengths of the approaches are their simplicity, strong theoretical grounding, superior empirical performance over existing methods, and ability to work for both general transfer learning settings as well as in cases where the source and target tasks share the same inputs.
