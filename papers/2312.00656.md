# [Simple Transferability Estimation for Regression Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00656)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Transfer learning is important for applying deep learning models to new tasks efficiently. However, assessing how well a model will transfer between tasks, known as transferability estimation, is still a challenging problem.
- Most prior work focuses on classification tasks. There has been little attention on transferability estimation for regression problems.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new definition of transferability for regression that aims to compare actual transfer performance between tasks. 
- Two simple and efficient approaches are proposed to estimate transferability: Linear MSE and Label MSE. They train a linear model between extracted features or "dummy" labels from the source task and true labels of the target data.
- The estimators have advantages in simplicity, speed, and ability to handle small target data regimes.
- Theoretical properties are proven to relate the estimators to actual transferability.

Key Contributions:
- New problem formulation for transferability estimation that works for comparing regression tasks.
- Linear MSE and Label MSE estimators which are simple, fast, and have theoretical justifications.
- Experiments on large keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrating superior accuracy and efficiency over prior regression transferability methods.
- Up to 36% improvement in correlation with actual transfer results while being 27% faster than previous methods.
- Useful for applications like source task selection and model selection for transfer learning.

In summary, the paper addresses the important but under-studied problem of transferability estimation for regression. It proposes two simple yet effective approaches that have both theoretical and empirical advantages over prior work. The findings can help improve performance and reduce costs for applying transfer learning.
