# [Advancing Time Series Classification with Multimodal Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12371)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper identifies several key limitations with the predominant learning-to-classify paradigm for time series classification (TSC):
1) Encoding labels as one-hot vectors fails to capture similarities between categories.
2) Models have poor transferability across domains due to variability in channels. 
3) Inability to effectively incorporate rich side information.

Proposed Solution - InstructTime:
The paper proposes reshaping TSC as a learning-to-generate problem by treating it as a multimodal understanding task. The key idea is to use domain-aware instructions and time series features as prompts to directly generate label texts using a pre-trained language model (PLM). 

To enable this, the paper introduces:
1) A time series discretization module using vector quantized networks to convert continuous time series into discrete tokens.
2) An aligned projector layer (MLP) to bridge modality representation gaps before inputting tokens into the PLM.
3) A two-phase tuning approach involving i) auto-regressive pre-training across domains to improve transferability and ii) supervised fine-tuning on the target domain.

Main Contributions:
1) Novel formulation of TSC as a multimodal language generation problem to mitigate limitations of prior learn-to-classify approaches. 
2) New time series discretization methodology using vector quantized networks.
3) Introduction of aligned projector layer to reconcile modality representation differences.
4) Two-phase tuning strategy involving auto-regressive pre-training and supervised fine-tuning to enhance model transferability and domain-specific performance.

The proposed InstructTime framework sets a new state-of-the-art across multiple TSC benchmark datasets, demonstrating the promise of reshaping TSC as a learning-to-generate paradigm powered by pre-trained language models. The design choices introduce domain invariance while retaining specificity, paving the way for universal foundation models in TSC.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes InstructTime, a novel time series classification approach that formulates the task as a multimodal language modeling problem by treating time series data and textual instructions as inputs to generate target label texts using pre-trained language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing InstructTime, a novel approach that reshapes time series classification as a learning-to-generate task instead of the traditional learning-to-classify paradigm. Specifically, InstructTime formulates time series classification as a multimodal language understanding problem, where time series data and textual instructions are treated as two distinct modalities. It introduces several key innovations:

1) A time series discretization module that converts continuous time series data into discrete tokens using vector quantized networks, enabling the processing of time series data by language models. 

2) A hybrid encoding strategy with an aligned projector layer to bridge the representation gap between time series tokens and textual words.

3) A two-phase tuning process involving cross-domain auto-regressive pre-training and domain-specific generative fine-tuning to enhance model generalization and adaptation.

Through extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates the superior performance of InstructTime over strong baselines, establishing its efficacy and potential as a universal foundation model for time series classification across diverse domains. The overall conceptualization of reshaping time series classification as a multimodal language generation task is the key contribution.
