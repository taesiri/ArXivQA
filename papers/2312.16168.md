# [Social-Transmotion: Promptable Human Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16168)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Social-Transmotion: Promptable Human Trajectory Prediction":

Problem:
- Accurately predicting human trajectories is critical for autonomous vehicles, robotics, etc. to avoid accidents. 
- Existing models often fail to fully leverage non-verbal social cues that humans communicate when navigating spaces.
- They typically only use a sequence of x-y coordinates for each person, neglecting additional signals like body language, social interactions, gaze directions that convey intended trajectories.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce the concept of "promptable human trajectory prediction" - predict trajectories given any available "prompt" such as past trajectories, body poses, etc.
- Propose Social-Transmotion, a generic dual-transformer model to handle diverse/numerous visual cues, capturing multi-modal nature of human behavior.
- Translate idea of "prompts" from NLP to trajectory prediction. A prompt can be a sequence of coordinates, bounding boxes, or body poses that augments trajectory data.
- Model comprises Cross-Modality Transformer (CMT) to encode agent behavior from visual cues, and Social Transformer (ST) to capture interactions between CMT outputs.
- Employ training strategy with selective masking of cue types/quantities for generality and robustness.

Main Contributions:
- First generic Transformer model for promptable trajectory prediction that flexibly utilizes various visual cues for improved accuracy.
- Comprehensive analysis of usefulness of different visual representations like 2D/3D poses, bounding boxes for prediction.
- State-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets - JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, ETH-UCY.
- Model is adaptable even with imperfect/incomplete input data.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative trajectory prediction model that embraces the multi-modal nature of human behavior by prompting with diverse visual cues for enhanced accuracy and social awareness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Social-Transmotion, a generic and adaptable transformer-based model for human trajectory prediction that can flexibly utilize various visual cues like poses and bounding boxes to capture the multi-modal nature of human behavior and enhance prediction accuracy, even when certain cues are absent.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are twofold:

1. It presents Social-Transmotion, the first generic Transformer-based model for promptable human trajectory prediction, designed to flexibly utilize various visual cues for improved accuracy, even in the absence of certain cues.

2. It provides an in-depth analysis of the usefulness of different visual representations for trajectory prediction, including 2D and 3D poses and bounding boxes. The analysis shows that 3D poses are most effective for capturing social interactions, while 2D poses can be a good alternative when 3D information is not available.

In summary, the paper introduces a flexible trajectory prediction model that can leverage visual cues like human poses to achieve state-of-the-art performance, and it analyzes the value of different types of visual information for this task.

The paper introduces a new model called "Social-Transmotion" for human trajectory prediction. The key ideas are using visual cues like body poses and bounding boxes as "prompts" to augment the trajectory data, employing transformers to effectively encode this multi-modal input, and designing the model to be adaptable and robust to variations in the type and amount of visual cues available. Concepts like the Cross-Modality Transformer and Social Transformer are presented as key components of the overall architecture. The paper analyzes the impact of different cues like 2D vs 3D poses and conducts experiments demonstrating the model's effectiveness even with imperfect inputs. Overall, the notions of a generic, adaptable model that can utilize diverse visual prompts for enhanced human trajectory prediction seem central.
