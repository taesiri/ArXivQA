# [Social-Transmotion: Promptable Human Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16168)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Social-Transmotion: Promptable Human Trajectory Prediction":

Problem:
- Accurately predicting human trajectories is critical for autonomous vehicles, robotics, etc. to avoid accidents. 
- Existing models often fail to fully leverage non-verbal social cues that humans communicate when navigating spaces.
- They typically only use a sequence of x-y coordinates for each person, neglecting additional signals like body language, social interactions, gaze directions that convey intended trajectories.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce the concept of "promptable human trajectory prediction" - predict trajectories given any available "prompt" such as past trajectories, body poses, etc.
- Propose Social-Transmotion, a generic dual-transformer model to handle diverse/numerous visual cues, capturing multi-modal nature of human behavior.
- Translate idea of "prompts" from NLP to trajectory prediction. A prompt can be a sequence of coordinates, bounding boxes, or body poses that augments trajectory data.
- Model comprises Cross-Modality Transformer (CMT) to encode agent behavior from visual cues, and Social Transformer (ST) to capture interactions between CMT outputs.
- Employ training strategy with selective masking of cue types/quantities for generality and robustness.

Main Contributions:
- First generic Transformer model for promptable trajectory prediction that flexibly utilizes various visual cues for improved accuracy.
- Comprehensive analysis of usefulness of different visual representations like 2D/3D poses, bounding boxes for prediction.
- State-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets - JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, ETH-UCY.
- Model is adaptable even with imperfect/incomplete input data.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative trajectory prediction model that embraces the multi-modal nature of human behavior by prompting with diverse visual cues for enhanced accuracy and social awareness.
