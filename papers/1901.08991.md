# [Diffusion Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08991)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can variational autoencoders (VAEs) be adapted to use arbitrary manifolds as a latent space, and does this allow VAEs to better capture the topological structure of datasets?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Using standard Euclidean spaces as the latent space in VAEs can prevent them from accurately capturing the topological properties of certain datasets. For example, a dataset of images obtained by rotating an object has an inherently non-Euclidean topology.2) Implementing arbitrary manifolds as the VAE latent space can remove these topological obstructions and allow VAEs to better capture topological properties.3) Even for datasets without clearly defined topological structure, using a manifold latent space may still highlight topological and geometrical properties of the data.To test these hypotheses, the researchers introduce Diffusion Variational Autoencoders (Delta-VAEs) which allow arbitrary manifolds as a latent space. They implement versions with sphere, torus, and projective space latent spaces. Experiments on synthetic and MNIST datasets provide evidence supporting the hypotheses.In summary, the central research question is whether using manifold latent spaces allows VAEs to capture topological structure, which standard Euclidean latent spaces may fail to represent. The Delta-VAE framework introduced here provides a way to test this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Introducing Diffusion Variational Autoencoders (DeltaVAEs) with arbitrary manifolds as the latent space. This allows capturing topological properties of datasets that standard VAEs with Euclidean latent spaces cannot.- Implementing the reparametrization trick and approximating the KL divergence term for DeltaVAEs using properties of Brownian motion on manifolds. This enables training them effectively.- Demonstrating that DeltaVAEs can capture the topological structure of synthetic datasets consisting of translations of images on a torus manifold. The encoder map from data to latent space can be shown to be surjective in this case.- Training DeltaVAEs on MNIST using different manifolds like spheres, tori, SO(3), projective spaces etc. as the latent space. Although MNIST doesn't have clear topological structure, using manifolds highlights interesting geometrical properties.- Providing an analysis of when the DeltaVAE succeeds or fails to capture the topological structure of datasets based on the complexity and weight of higher Fourier components.So in summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing DeltaVAEs to handle manifold-structured latent spaces, implementing them, and demonstrating their ability to capture topological properties on synthetic and real-world datasets.
