# [Texts as Images in Prompt Tuning for Multi-Label Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12739)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively adapt vision-language pre-trained models like CLIP to multi-label image recognition tasks in low data regimes. Specifically, the key ideas and hypotheses are:- Existing methods rely on labeled image data to learn prompts, which can be limiting when sufficient annotated images are not available. - Text descriptions contain rich semantic information and can serve as alternatives to images for learning effective prompts, owing to the joint image-text space learned by vision-language pre-training.- By treating texts as images, prompts can be learned from only descriptive sentences and derived class labels, without needing any labeled images.- Learning prompts from texts is especially useful for multi-label recognition where sufficient text descriptions mentioning multiple object names can be obtained. - Double prompt tuning can be used to extract both coarse and fine-grained embeddings from global and local features to enhance multi-label classification performance.- The prompts learned from only text descriptions can surpass standard zero-shot CLIP and be complementary to existing methods that use images, leading to further improvements when combined.In summary, the core hypothesis is that text descriptions can act as images for vision-language prompt tuning, providing an effective way to adapt these models for multi-label classification in low data regimes, without needing labeled images. The results verify the efficacy of this text-as-image prompting approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method for prompt tuning of vision-language models called "Texts as Images" (TaI) prompting. The key ideas are:- Instead of using labeled images to learn prompts like previous methods, they propose to use easy-to-obtain text descriptions and their derived pseudo labels for prompt tuning. This avoids the need for labeled image data.- They introduce double-grained prompt tuning (TaI-DPT) which learns a global prompt and a local prompt to extract both coarse and fine-grained embeddings for enhancing multi-label image recognition performance. - The prompts learned by TaI-DPT significantly outperform zero-shot CLIP and are comparable or better than few-shot learning methods that use some labeled images.- TaI-DPT prompts can be readily combined with existing prompting methods that use images to further improve performance.In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective way to learn prompts for vision-language models using just text data, without needing labeled images. This provides a complementary method to existing prompting techniques that rely on some labeled visual data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes a novel method for multi-label image recognition using vision-language models like CLIP. The key idea is to treat text descriptions as images during prompt tuning, obviating the need for labeled image data. The method trains prompts using only text data, then applies them to classify images, outperforming zero-shot CLIP substantially. Overall, it shows text data can effectively replace images for vision-language prompt tuning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a novel approach for adapting vision-language pre-trained models to multi-label image recognition tasks using only text data. The key contributions compared to prior work are:- Proposes "Text-as-Image" (TaI) prompting to train prompts using only easily accessible text descriptions instead of labeled images. This avoids the need for annotated visual data.- Introduces double-grained prompt tuning (TaI-DPT) to extract both coarse and fine-grained embeddings using global and local prompts. This better handles multi-label classification compared to methods using only global image features.- Achieves strong performance surpassing prior prompt tuning methods (e.g. CoOp, DualCoOp) that require some labeled visual data. TaI-DPT gets comparable results to these approaches using only text.- Shows TaI-DPT prompts can be combined with other prompt tuning methods in an ensemble, leading to further improved accuracy. Demonstrates text and images provide complementary information.Compared to existing prompt tuning research, a key novelty is demonstrating the feasibility of learning effective prompts from textual data alone, without any labeled images. This is an interesting finding given most prior work relies on some visual supervision. The idea of extracting both global and local features using dual prompts is also novel for handling multi-label tasks. Overall, it proposes a simple but effective approach that advances the state-of-the-art for low resource prompt tuning.
