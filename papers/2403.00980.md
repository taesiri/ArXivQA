# [Even-Ifs From If-Onlys: Are the Best Semi-Factual Explanations Found   Using Counterfactuals As Guides?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00980)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Semi-factual explanations in XAI tell users how decision outcomes stay the same even when key inputs change. They are less studied than counterfactual explanations.
- Some semi-factual methods use counterfactuals to guide the search for good semi-factuals (counterfactual-guided), while others do not (counterfactual-free). 
- It is unclear whether using counterfactual guidance produces the best semi-factual explanations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors comprehensively evaluate and compare 8 semi-factual methods (4 counterfactual-guided, 4 counterfactual-free) on 7 datasets using 5 key metrics.

Methods Tested:
- Counterfactual-Free: Local-Region, DSER, MDN, S-GEN
- Counterfactual-Guided: KLEOR, PIECE, C2C-VAE, DiCE

Metrics Used:  
- Distance, Plausibility, Confusability, Robustness, Sparsity

Key Findings:
- Counterfactual guidance does NOT determine success in finding good semi-factuals. 
- No single method dominates across all metrics. Tradeoffs exist.
- Relying more on known data points (MDN, KLEOR) or exploring difference spaces (C2C-VAE) seem more promising directions.

Main Contributions:
- Most comprehensive analysis to date of semi-factual methods using multiple datasets and metrics
- Demonstrates counterfactual guidance is NOT necessary or sufficient for good semi-factuals
- Provides performance baselines and targets to guide future semi-factual method development

Limitations and Future Work:
- Focus only on tabular data, could extend to images/time-series
- Need user studies to validate desired explanation properties  
- More work needed to combine the best aspects of existing methods
