# [Even-Ifs From If-Onlys: Are the Best Semi-Factual Explanations Found   Using Counterfactuals As Guides?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00980)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Semi-factual explanations in XAI tell users how decision outcomes stay the same even when key inputs change. They are less studied than counterfactual explanations.
- Some semi-factual methods use counterfactuals to guide the search for good semi-factuals (counterfactual-guided), while others do not (counterfactual-free). 
- It is unclear whether using counterfactual guidance produces the best semi-factual explanations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors comprehensively evaluate and compare 8 semi-factual methods (4 counterfactual-guided, 4 counterfactual-free) on 7 datasets using 5 key metrics.

Methods Tested:
- Counterfactual-Free: Local-Region, DSER, MDN, S-GEN
- Counterfactual-Guided: KLEOR, PIECE, C2C-VAE, DiCE

Metrics Used:  
- Distance, Plausibility, Confusability, Robustness, Sparsity

Key Findings:
- Counterfactual guidance does NOT determine success in finding good semi-factuals. 
- No single method dominates across all metrics. Tradeoffs exist.
- Relying more on known data points (MDN, KLEOR) or exploring difference spaces (C2C-VAE) seem more promising directions.

Main Contributions:
- Most comprehensive analysis to date of semi-factual methods using multiple datasets and metrics
- Demonstrates counterfactual guidance is NOT necessary or sufficient for good semi-factuals
- Provides performance baselines and targets to guide future semi-factual method development

Limitations and Future Work:
- Focus only on tabular data, could extend to images/time-series
- Need user studies to validate desired explanation properties  
- More work needed to combine the best aspects of existing methods


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper comprehensively tests 8 semi-factual explanation methods on 7 datasets using 5 evaluation metrics and finds that using counterfactuals to guide semi-factual generation does not necessarily result in superior performance, suggesting that other factors like relying on known data points or exploring difference spaces may be more important.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A comprehensive analysis and comparison of different semi-factual explanation methods, divided into counterfactual-free and counterfactual-guided groups. 

2) The most comprehensive set of evaluations in the literature for determining the best semi-factual explanations, using 5 key metrics (distance, plausibility, confusability, robustness, sparsity) across 7 datasets.

3) The discovery that using counterfactuals to guide semi-factual generation does not necessarily lead to better semi-factuals. Rather, other factors like relying on known data points or exploring the difference space appear more important.

4) Establishing baselines and targets for future research aimed at developing improved semi-factual explanation methods, by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches.

In summary, the paper provides the most in-depth examination of semi-factual methods to date, highlights that counterfactual guidance is not crucial, and sets the stage for advancing this important but understudied area of explainable AI.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- XAI (eXplainable AI)
- Semi-factual explanations
- Counterfactual explanations
- Counterfactual-free methods (e.g. Local-Region, DSER, MDN, S-GEN)  
- Counterfactual-guided methods (e.g. KLEOR, PIECE, C2C-VAE, DiCE)
- Evaluation metrics (distance, plausibility, confusability, robustness, sparsity)  
- Query and query class
- Nearest unlike neighbor (NUN)
- Tabular datasets (Adult Income, Blood Alcohol, etc.)
- Desiderata for good semi-factuals

The paper compares counterfactual-free and counterfactual-guided semi-factual explanation methods on various tabular datasets using several evaluation metrics. The key research question is whether using counterfactuals as guides produces the best semi-factual explanations. The results suggest that counterfactual guidance is not necessary to find the best semi-factuals, and that other factors like relying on known data points or exploring difference spaces are more important.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper divides semi-factual methods into counterfactual-free and counterfactual-guided approaches. What are the key differences in how these two types of methods generate semi-factual explanations? What are some examples of methods in each category?

2. The paper tests 8 different semi-factual explanation methods across 7 datasets on 5 evaluation metrics. What are these metrics and why were they chosen as appropriate ways to evaluate the quality of semi-factual explanations? 

3. The Most Distant Neighbor (MDN) method had the best overall performance based on mean ranks across metrics and datasets. What is the key idea behind MDN? How does it differ from other counterfactual-free methods like Local-Region and DSER?

4. The Class-to-Class Variational Autoencoder (C2C-VAE) method performed best on the robustness metric. How does C2C-VAE leverage variational autoencoders to generate semi-factuals? Why might this approach lead to more robust explanations?  

5. No single semi-factual method dominated across all metrics. What does this suggest about the tradeoffs involved in generating "good" semi-factual explanations? What might a combined approach that draws on the strengths of different methods look like?

6. The results showed that counterfactual-guided methods did not necessarily outperform counterfactual-free methods. What implications does this have for whether counterfactuals should be used to guide semi-factual generation? What other factors might matter more?

7. The paper mentions that further user studies are needed to determine whether the semi-factuals produced have appropriate properties for human-optimal explanations. What are some ways a user study could be designed to evaluate semi-factual methods from an end-user perspective? 

8. The unitary measure that combines all metrics into a single score was discussed but not reported. What are some pros and cons of using such a unitary versus analyzing metrics separately? When might a unitary score be most/least appropriate?

9. What limitations does the current study have in terms of the data types tested, lack of user studies, etc? What are some ways future work could address these limitations?

10. The paper concludes that combining the best aspects of different methods may produce better semi-factual explanations. What are some ways a combined approach could work? What challenges might be involved in integrating diverse methods into a single unified approach?
