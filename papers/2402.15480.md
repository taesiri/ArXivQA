# [Retinotopic Mapping Enhances the Robustness of Convolutional Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15480)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, even from simple image rotations. The paper shows that networks like VGG16 and ResNet101 have classification accuracy drop sharply when test images are rotated, demonstrating a lack of rotational invariance. 

- This brittleness to geometric perturbations presents a challenge for deploying CNNs in real-world applications like medical imaging or autonomous vehicles where reliability and safety are critical.  

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose adding a biologically-inspired retinotopic mapping to the inputs of CNNs. This log-polar mapping gives higher resolution at the fovea/center and lower resolution in the periphery, mimicking primate vision. 

- They hypothesize that the spatial translation invariance of CNN convolutions will confer rotational/scale invariance in this log-polar transformed space.

Main Contributions:
- Retinotopically-mapped CNNs achieve comparable accuracy to baseline CNNs on ImageNet classification despite the distorted inputs.

- Mapping induces notably improved robustness to rotations and zooms compared to baseline models, confirming translations in the transformed space provide the expected geometric invariance.

- Retinotopic mapping also enables better spatial localization - shifted centers induce higher classification confidence focused around objects of interest rather than uniform across images.

- This demonstrates potential benefits of incorporating retinotopic mappings to improve model robustness. The spatial attention effects provide opportunities for studying biological vision and eye movement control using such networks.
