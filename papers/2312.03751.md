# [Which linguistic cues make people fall for fake news? A comparison of   cognitive and affective processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03751)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Fake news spreading on social media is a major societal issue. However, there is limited understanding of why users fall for fake news. Specifically, it remains unclear what role linguistic cues (e.g. adverbs, pronouns, emotion words) play in influencing users' cognitive processing (careful thinking) and affective processing (automatic evaluation) of fake news. Identifying what triggers these two types of processing could provide insights into why users believe fake news.

Methodology:
The authors conducted a within-subject experiment with 42 subjects who read a mix of 20 real and 20 fake news articles. During the experiment, cognitive processing was measured through eye tracking (number of eye fixations), while affective processing was measured through heart rate variability (HRV). The influence of 33 different linguistic cues on cognitive/affective processing was analyzed using regression models.

Key Findings:
- Longer fake news articles with lower complexity triggered more cognitive processing 
- Fake news with more "analytic thinking" words (e.g. think, know) increased affective processing and feelings of discomfort
- Certain cues like adverbs reduced cognitive processing of fake news

Main Contributions:
1) First study analyzing the role of linguistic cues in fake news processing using neurophysiological measurements 
2) Experiment providing insights into how linguistic aspects trigger cognitive vs affective processing
3) Discussion of implications for designing online platforms to encourage careful thinking and reduce fake news spread

In summary, this paper advances understanding of why users fall for fake news by highlighting the differential effects of linguistic cues on cognitive vs affective processing. The neurophysiological experiment provides novel evidence that certain language aspects either promote or discourage careful thinking about fake news.
