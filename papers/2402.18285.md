# [PiShield: A NeSy Framework for Learning with Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18285)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) often fail to comply with given requirements that define the safe output space of a model. 
- Existing methods either penalize violations of requirements in the loss function but cannot guarantee satisfaction, or incorporate requirements into the model topology but have limitations in scalability and ease of use.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes PiShield, a PyTorch framework that allows easily integrating requirements into DNNs using Shield Layers. 
- Shield Layers guarantee compliance with propositional logic or linear inequality requirements regardless of input. 
- PiShield can be used at inference time to correct outputs or during training to guide learning. It has an easy interface requiring only the output dimensions and path to requirements file.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to enable injecting requirements into neural network topology through dedicated Shield Layers that provably satisfy constraints.
- Applicable during inference to post-process outputs or training to improve learning.
- Easy-to-use with simple interface for building Shield Layers based on output dimensions and constraints file.
- Evaluated on three real-world applications: functional genomics, autonomous driving, tabular data generation. Shows improved satisfaction of constraints and model performance when used during training.

In summary, PiShield allows easily enforcing compliance with requirements in DNNs through Shield Layers, either at inference or training time, with applications in safety-critical scenarios across domains. Key innovations are the ease of use, provable guarantee of constraints satisfaction, and integration with deep learning workflows.
