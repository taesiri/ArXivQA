# [Design and Control of Delta: Deformable Multilinked Multirotor with   Rolling Locomotion Ability in Terrestrial Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06636)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Aerial robots have the advantage of 3D mobility and can extend robots' maneuvering space, but energy consumption for flight is large. Ground mobility is needed for long-term tasks.
- Prior air-ground robots sacrifice manipulation ability, have complex mechanisms, or lack terrain adaptability.  

Proposed Solution:  
- A multilinked multirotor robot called "Delta" with rolling locomotion ability. It has 3 links connected by joints, each equipped with a rotor, frame, and thrust vectoring mechanism.

- Optimize rotor tilt angle to maximize feasible control torque for stable rolling.

- An integrated control framework consisting of:
  1) Flight control - attitude and position control 
  2) Ground control - consider contact forces, solve optimization for rolling

- Achieve flying, standing up, disturbance rejection, and rolling motions. Deformation helps adapt to terrain.

Main Contributions:
1) Design methodology and optimization for a multilinked rolling multirotor 
2) Integrated thrust control framework for aerial and ground locomotion
3) Demonstrated hybrid flying and rolling mobility with a prototype

Future Work: 
- Investigate aerial and ground manipulation
- Adapt to more complex environments using planning and deformations
- Run over uneven terrain utilizing multi-point contacts


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a deformable multilinked multirotor robot capable of aerial transformation and rolling locomotion on the ground by distributing rotors and contact frames to each link and optimizing their configuration, and presents an integrated control framework to achieve flight, standing up and rolling stabilization through thrust force and vectoring control.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a design methodology, mechanical design, and rotor configuration method for a multilinked multirotor with rolling locomotion ability.

2. Presenting an integrated thrust control framework for air and ground locomotion. 

3. Achieving multiple types of locomotion (aerial transformation and ground locomotion) with the proposed multirotor platform.

So in summary, the main contribution is developing a novel deformable multilinked multirotor robot that can achieve both aerial and ground locomotion, through its mechanical design, rotor configuration method, and integrated control framework. The feasibility is demonstrated by implementing a prototype and showing experimental results of aerial transformation and rolling ground locomotion.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a design methodology for a deformable multilinked multirotor with rolling locomotion ability. Can you elaborate on the key considerations and tradeoffs when determining the number of links and control DOF configuration? 

2. The paper describes an optimization method to determine the optimal propeller tilt angles to maximize the minimum feasible control torque. Can you explain this optimization problem formulation in more detail? How sensitive is the performance to changes in the tilt angles?

3. The integrated control framework includes separate flight and ground controls. What are the key differences in modeling and control strategies between these two modes? How is the transition between modes handled?

4. During ground control, contact forces with the environment are considered. How are these contact forces modeled and handled in the control formulation? What assumptions are made?

5. For the standing up behavior, control is done in the contact point frame rather than the center of mass frame. What is the motivation for this strategy and how does it simplify the control problem?

6. In the rolling control section, additional constraints on the thrust vectoring angles are imposed. Why are these constraints needed and how do they affect the final control inputs? 

7. The paper uses a quadratic programming formulation to determine the rotor thrusts during ground locomotion. What objective function and constraints are used? How is this solved onboard?

8. What are the potential failure modes or instability issues during the aerial-to-ground transitions? How does the control framework aim to handle these issues?

9. The experiments show successful aerial transformation and ground rolling locomotion. What other types of tasks do you think this platform design is well suited for? What are its key limitations?

10. The paper mentions future work on uneven terrain locomotion and environmental adaptation. What control or planning strategies do you think would be needed to achieve robust locomotion in more unstructured environments?
