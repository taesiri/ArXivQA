# [PizzaCommonSense: Learning to Model Commonsense Reasoning about   Intermediate Steps in Cooking Recipes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06930)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Decoding and understanding the intermediate steps in cooking recipes requires commonsense reasoning about how ingredients transform through cooking actions. 
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown ability to perform reasoning when presented examples, but need more targeted evaluation.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors create a new dataset called PizzaCommonSense containing 1087 cooking recipes with intermediate input and output explicitly annotated for each step. 
- The recipes describe the input ingredients/preparation, the cooking action taken, and output ingredients/preparation after that step.
- This frames the task as predicting input and output pairs for each instruction step.

Models:
- Baselines using T5, Flan-T5, and GPT-3.5 are developed through fine-tuning and prompting.
- Performance is benchmarked on ability to correctly predict input and output sequences.

Key Contributions:
- New annotated dataset for intermediate reasoning in cooking recipes 
- Formalized task definition for predicting input/output pairs per step
- Analysis of strengths and weaknesses of LLMs on this task
- Demonstrates remaining challenges in procedural text comprehension & commonsense reasoning

The paper introduces an important new task and dataset to assess reasoning abilities of language models for procedural texts. By focusing evaluation on intermediate steps rather than just end outcomes, the work encourages more careful assessment of the decision processes LLMs use. The analysis also highlights areas for continued progress in developing robust commonsense capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents PizzaCommonSense, a new dataset for learning to model commonsense reasoning about the input and output of intermediate steps in cooking recipes, along with baseline methods and results using T5, Flan-T5, and GPT-3.5 models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a new task for procedural text comprehension - specifically predicting the input and output of each instruction step in a cooking recipe. This requires understanding the effects of each step on the ingredients.

2) Constructing an annotated dataset (PizzaCommonSense) to facilitate research on commonsense reasoning for procedural texts. The dataset contains cooking recipes where each step is annotated with descriptions of the input and output ingredients/preparations.

3) Providing baseline methods and results using state-of-the-art language models like T5, Flan-T5, and GPT-3.5. The results demonstrate the difficulty of the task and that current models struggle with some aspects like resolving anaphoras/omissions and providing descriptive (rather than generic) input/output descriptions.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and formalizing a new challenging task situated at the intersection of question answering and natural language inference, along with a dataset and baseline results to motivate further research. The aim is to promote better commonsense reasoning capabilities for procedural text understanding.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new dataset called PizzaCommonSense for commonsense reasoning about intermediate steps in cooking recipes. What is the key motivation behind creating this dataset and what gap does it aim to fill compared to existing procedural text datasets?

2. The paper describes representing recipes in a tabular format with columns for instructions, input, action, and output. What are the benefits of using this structured representation compared to just having the recipe text? How does it facilitate collecting annotations and training/evaluating models?

3. The paper defines the problem of predicting input and output descriptions for each step in a recipe. What makes this problem challenging compared to simply extracting ingredients from the recipe text? What types of reasoning and commonsense knowledge does a model need to do well on this task?  

4. The authors collect annotations for the dataset using crowdworkers. What guidelines and constraints did they impose on the workers to ensure high-quality annotations? How did they structure the annotation collection process?

5. The paper experiments with several baseline models including T5, Flan-T5, and GPT-3.5. What serialization approaches did they use to adapt these models to handle the tabular recipe data? What prompted fine-tuning did they employ?

6. How did the authors evaluate model performance quantitatively? What metrics did they use and why? What are the limitations of relying solely on these automatic evaluation metrics for this task?  

7. What were some of the characteristic errors made by the models according to the analysis? What do these errors reveal about the current reasoning limitations of large language models on procedural text understanding?

8. The paper argues that explicitly modeling intermediate steps is important for faithful recipe generation and adaptation. Do you agree? What other applications might benefit from better comprehension of input-output transformations in procedural text?

9. Could the proposed dataset annotation scheme be applied to other types of procedural text such as science protocols, manufacturing instructions, etc.? What domain differences would need to be accounted for?

10. The paper identifies several limitations of the current work. What avenues for future work do the authors suggest to expand the dataset, incorporate multiple ground truth interpretations, and address model biases? What other future directions seem promising?
