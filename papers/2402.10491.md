# [Make a Cheap Scaling: A Self-Cascade Diffusion Model for   Higher-Resolution Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10491)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing stable diffusion (SD) models are trained on fixed-size images and lack generalization ability for generating images of varying resolutions. Directly applying an SD model trained on low resolution images to generate higher resolution images results in issues like repetitive patterns, unreasonable object structures, and diminished composition ability. Fine-tuning the model on high-resolution images is very compute-intensive and time-consuming, while also tending to degrade the original model's capabilities. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a self-cascade diffusion model for rapid adaptation of a pretrained low-resolution SD model to higher resolution image generation. The key ideas are:

1) Pivot-guided noise rescheduling: Cyclically reuse the low-resolution model to progressively generate higher resolution images by using an upsampled output from the previous stage as the pivot guidance. This enables tuning-free adaptation.

2) Time-aware feature upsampler modules: Lightweight neural network modules that get plugged into the model and learn to incorporate guidance from high-resolution images during fine-tuning. This further refines the model's high-resolution detail generation while preserving composition abilities.

Together, these facilitate cheap and fast scale adaptation while maximally reusing capabilities of the original low-resolution model.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the first self-cascade diffusion approach to efficiently adapt an SD model to higher resolutions

- Achieves over 5x speedup for adaptation compared to full fine-tuning

- Requires only 0.002M extra trainable parameters 

- Enables rapid adaptation with just 10k fine-tuning steps while preserving model capabilities

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for image and video generation across different scale adaptation settings
