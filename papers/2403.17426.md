# [Knowledge-Powered Recommendation for an Improved Diet Water Footprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17426)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Water scarcity is a critical global issue, especially exacerbated by the water-intensive food industry. There is a need for sustainable and healthy eating habits to reduce the water footprint of food consumption. However, many people struggle to eat healthily due to busy lifestyles and lack of meal planning motivation.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a recommendation engine powered by knowledge graphs that suggests ingredient substitutions in user recipes. The substitutions aim to improve nutritional value and reduce the water footprint of recipes. The system architecture comprises:

1) Identifying data sources like recipes, ingredients, nutrients, food ontology, and water footprint academic papers. 

2) Extracting and transforming the data into a common format.

3) Aligning the schema of the different data sources using ingredient name analysis and sentence embeddings. 

4) Constructing a knowledge graph with 20,778 nodes and 13 relationship types to unify the data. A neural network makes predictions for missing entity values.

5) Developing a user interface with Django where users enter recipes and get alternative ingredients recommended based on lower water footprint.

Main Contributions:
- A tool to directly influence individual food choices towards sustainability and water conservation by recommending substitutions in recipes to reduce water footprint and improve nutrition.

- A knowledge graph-centered architecture that integrates heterogeneous data sources to enable context-aware and informed recommendations.

- A user interface that visualizes impact of recommendations on sustainability via comparing water footprints.

The system aims to promote healthier and more sustainable eating habits while contributing to global water conservation efforts. Future work involves expanding the database, conducting user studies and improving the recommendation algorithm.
