# [Towards Optimizing the Costs of LLM Usage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 for document processing tasks is getting popular but incurs high costs. 
- Different LLMs have varied capabilities and costs, and there is no clear hierarchy in terms of their performance quality. 
- Estimating an LLM's output quality for a given task and input context is challenging.
- Even with quality estimates, selecting the optimal LLM to route queries to under budget or latency constraints is a hard problem.

Proposed Solution - QC-Opt Framework
- Quality Predictor: Predicts LLM performance quality scores for a task using BERTscore, without needing to query LLMs.
- Budget-Aware Optimizer: Formulates and solves optimization problem to select best LLM routing under budget constraints. Proves problem NP-hard; Gives approximation algorithm.
- Token Optimization: Reduces input token length via sentence simplification model and rule-based heuristics to further reduce cost.

Key Contributions:
- Theoretically studied budget-constrained LLM selection and cost minimization problems, including hardness results and algorithms.
- Proposed model to estimate LLM output quality for summarization without querying LLMs.
- Built token-optimized paraphrasing model for input text simplification.
- Devised rule-based heuristics for token reduction and formulated optimization problem for their application.  
- Showed framework reduces costs by 40-90% and improves quality by 4-7% on enterprise documents.
- Released annotated datasets generated from open source data.

The paper makes significant contributions around optimizing LLM usage costs in a quality-aware manner, through both model selection as well as input optimization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an optimization framework called QC-Opt for intelligently selecting and routing queries to different large language models to optimize usage costs and latency while maintaining output quality, using a quality prediction model, budget-aware optimization, and token length reduction techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing QC-Opt, a quality aware cost optimized LLM routing engine and framework that optimizes both the choice of LLM and the input token count at run time to reduce costs while maintaining output quality.

2) Theoretically studying the cost, latency and quality constrained optimization problems for LLM selection, including analyzing their hardness and proposing polynomial time algorithms for some special cases. 

3) Proposing a model to predict the output quality of LLMs for document summarization without needing to invoke the LLMs at runtime.

4) Building upon existing sentence simplification models to generate token optimized, quality controlled simplified sentences to reduce token counts.

5) Proposing several generalized token reduction heuristics and an optimized way to apply them to control quality loss.

6) Extensive empirical evaluation on enterprise and open source datasets showing significant cost reductions of 40-90% while improving or maintaining quality, compared to baselines.

In summary, the main contribution is the overall quality and cost optimized LLM usage framework QC-Opt and its components.

To summarize, this paper proposes an end-to-end framework called QC-Opt for optimizing the usage costs of LLMs in document processing tasks like summarization. It consists of components for estimating LLM quality, selecting optimal LLMs based on constraints, and reducing input token length to further lower costs. Key methods include a BERTScore predictor, budget-aware LLM selector, token-optimized text simplification using seq2seq models, and rule-based heuristics. The solutions are evaluated on enterprise and public datasets, outperforming baselines in cost reduction while maintaining or even improving quality in some cases. A user study also validates the LLM choices.

7. What datasets has the paper used for evaluating the overall pipeline on summarization task? How much cost savings and change in quality have they demonstrated?

8. How have they estimated the latency savings obtained by their optimized selection of cheaper LLMs for certain sections?

9. What method have they used to validate correlation of their quality predictor with human judgment and preferences? What results do they show?

10. How can the overall framework be extended for a fully online setting where LLM selection is done dynamically? What changes would be required?
