# [On Safety and Liveness Filtering Using Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability   Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15347)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenge of designing controllers for autonomous systems that balance both performance and safety/liveness guarantees. Typical controller design methods optimize for performance but may fail to provide formal safety/liveness guarantees. On the other hand, methods like Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis can provide safety/liveness controllers but may disregard performance. The paper aims to develop a unified framework to design controllers that integrate both performance and safety/liveness for general nonlinear systems with disturbances and control bounds.

Proposed Solution:
The key insight is to use HJ reachability to explicitly characterize the maximal set of control inputs at a state that preserve safety or ensure liveness despite disturbances. The paper shows this set can be explicitly computed from the value function. Any subset of this maximal control set guarantees safety/liveness. The paper proposes a general filtering framework with two components: (1) Projection set: a subset of maximal control set, and (2) Projection operator: modifies the nominal input to align with projection set. 

Using this framework, the paper develops three safety filters and three liveness filters, each making different tradeoffs. The key filters are:
1. Least restrictive filter: Follows nominal controller until system reaches boundary of safe/live set from HJ reachability. 
2. Smooth least restrictive filter: Projects nominal controller onto convex subset of safe/live controls closest to nominal input.
3. Smooth blending filter: Blends reachability controller with nominal controller, avoiding sudden switching.

Contributions:
1. Provides general, unifying framework to develop safety/liveness filters using novel reachability-based control set characterization. Enables designing custom filters.  
2. Develops and compares six instantiations making different tradeoffs. 
3. Showcases approach on rocket landing, autonomous blimp navigation and physical robot scenarios. Demonstrates versatility.
4. Discusses practical aspects like non-differentiable value functions and discretized implementation.

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions towards integrating performance and safety/liveness for autonomous systems by developing a customizable, reachability-based filtering framework with several promising instantiations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a unifying framework to design safety and liveness filters for autonomous systems using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis to explicitly characterize the maximal set of control inputs that ensures system safety or liveness at a given state.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the design of safety and liveness filters for autonomous systems using reachability analysis:

1. It provides a unifying framework to characterize the maximal set of control inputs that ensure safety or liveness at a given state. This set can then be used to construct different filters using different subsets and projection operators.

2. It proposes three specific safety and liveness filters - a least restrictive filter, a smooth least restrictive filter, and a smooth blending filter - each making different tradeoffs between performance, computation time, smoothness, etc.

3. It compares these filters systematically through case studies and hardware experiments, highlighting their relative strengths and weaknesses to guide practical implementation. 

4. It discusses several practical considerations for real-world deployment like handling non-differentiable value functions and discrete time effects.

In summary, the key contribution is a general reachability-based framework for designing safety and liveness filters that is systematically validated on simulations and hardware. The proposed filters and their thorough evaluation advance the state-of-the-art and understanding of these methods for real autonomous systems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis: A formal verification technique to characterize system safety and liveness properties. Used to compute backward reachable tubes (BRTs).

- Backward reachable tube (BRT): The set of states from which the system is guaranteed to reach a target set (for liveness) or avoid a target set (for safety), despite worst-case disturbances. 

- Safety filtering: Modifying a nominal controller to ensure system safety constraints are satisfied. Involves projecting the nominal control input to a set of safe controls.

- Liveness filtering: Modifying a nominal controller to ensure the system reaches a target set of states within a time bound.

- Least restrictive filter: A safety/liveness filter that follows the nominal controller unless the system is at the boundary of the BRT, in which case a default safety/liveness controller from reachability is used.

- Smooth least restrictive filter: Projects the nominal controller to the set of all safe/live controls to avoid bang-bang behavior of default safety/liveness controller.

- Smooth blending filter: Blends nominal and default safety/liveness controller based on a barrier-like constraint on how fast the system value function can change. Ensures smooth transition between controllers.

- Projection operator: Determines how to project nominal control input to a set of safe/live controls in a filter. Common choice is $\ell_2$ distance.  

- Projection set: The set of safe/live control inputs that the nominal controller gets projected to in a filter. A subset of all safe/live controls.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a general framework for safety and liveness filtering using reachability analysis. Can you elaborate more on the key ideas behind this framework? What are the two main components and how do they lead to different filtering schemes?

2. The paper characterizes the maximal set of control inputs that ensure safety or liveness at a given state. Can you walk through the details behind the mathematical characterization of these sets? What assumptions are needed? 

3. The paper proposes three different safety filters - least restrictive, smooth least restrictive, and smooth blending. Can you explain the key differences between these filters and highlight their relative strengths and weaknesses? 

4. For the smooth blending safety filter, the paper introduces a CBF-like constraint to blend performance and safety objectives. What is the intuition behind this constraint? How does it relate to control barrier functions?

5. The paper demonstrates the proposed methods on a rocket landing example for liveness and a blimp navigation example for safety. Can you summarize the key results from these case studies? What insights do they provide about the different filters?  

6. The paper discusses several practical aspects when implementing the proposed filters on real systems, such as effect of finite time step. Can you expand more on this issue? What are some potential remedies?

7. How does the paper address potential non-differentiability of the value function when constructing the proposed filters? What solutions are suggested to handle this? What are their limitations?

8. The paper leverages recent advances in learning-based reachability analysis. How does this impact the scalability of the proposed approach to higher dimensional systems? What are the trade-offs?

9. The proposed framework relies on explicit computation of the backward reachable tube. How can we design safety or liveness filters that bypass this potentially expensive computation?  

10. The paper does not learn the safety and liveness filters directly from data. What are some ways the key ideas from this paper can be combined with learning-based approaches to further improve performance or generalizability?
