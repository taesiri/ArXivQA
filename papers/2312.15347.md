# [On Safety and Liveness Filtering Using Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability   Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15347)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenge of designing controllers for autonomous systems that balance both performance and safety/liveness guarantees. Typical controller design methods optimize for performance but may fail to provide formal safety/liveness guarantees. On the other hand, methods like Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis can provide safety/liveness controllers but may disregard performance. The paper aims to develop a unified framework to design controllers that integrate both performance and safety/liveness for general nonlinear systems with disturbances and control bounds.

Proposed Solution:
The key insight is to use HJ reachability to explicitly characterize the maximal set of control inputs at a state that preserve safety or ensure liveness despite disturbances. The paper shows this set can be explicitly computed from the value function. Any subset of this maximal control set guarantees safety/liveness. The paper proposes a general filtering framework with two components: (1) Projection set: a subset of maximal control set, and (2) Projection operator: modifies the nominal input to align with projection set. 

Using this framework, the paper develops three safety filters and three liveness filters, each making different tradeoffs. The key filters are:
1. Least restrictive filter: Follows nominal controller until system reaches boundary of safe/live set from HJ reachability. 
2. Smooth least restrictive filter: Projects nominal controller onto convex subset of safe/live controls closest to nominal input.
3. Smooth blending filter: Blends reachability controller with nominal controller, avoiding sudden switching.

Contributions:
1. Provides general, unifying framework to develop safety/liveness filters using novel reachability-based control set characterization. Enables designing custom filters.  
2. Develops and compares six instantiations making different tradeoffs. 
3. Showcases approach on rocket landing, autonomous blimp navigation and physical robot scenarios. Demonstrates versatility.
4. Discusses practical aspects like non-differentiable value functions and discretized implementation.

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions towards integrating performance and safety/liveness for autonomous systems by developing a customizable, reachability-based filtering framework with several promising instantiations.
