# [MLCA-AVSR: Multi-Layer Cross Attention Fusion based Audio-Visual Speech   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03424)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems degrade significantly in noisy environments. Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) aims to improve robustness by complementing audio with noise-invariant visual speech cues.
- Current AVSR studies mainly fuse well-learned modality features without considering contextual relationships during feature learning.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a multi-layer cross attention fusion based AVSR (MLCA-AVSR) approach to promote representation learning of each modality. 
- Integrate cross-attention fusion modules into multiple intermediate layers of audio/visual encoders rather than just fusing final encoder outputs.
- Allows each modality to learn complementary information from the other modality, ranging from low-level to high-level features. Enables more exhaustive representation learning and fusion.

Main Contributions:
- First work to integrate cross-attention module into intermediate layers of modality encoders and conduct fusion during representation learning phase.
- MLCA fusion enables better utilization of multi-level modal features compared to simple concatenation or output fusion.
- Experiments on MISP2022-AVSR dataset show proposed method improves over second-ranked previous system, surpassing first-place system and achieving new state-of-the-art performance.
- Ablations validate benefits of multi-layer cross-attention fusion over single-layer, and advantage of retaining shallower fusion module.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel multi-layer cross-modal fusion approach for AVSR that promotes joint representation learning. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art AVSR performance, outperforming prior challenge winners.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multi-layer cross-attention fusion based audio-visual speech recognition system that integrates cross-attention modules into intermediate layers of audio and visual encoders to promote representation learning and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MISP2022-AVSR dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a multi-layer cross-attention fusion based audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) system, called MLCA-AVSR. Specifically:

- It improves upon their previous single-layer cross-attention (SLCA) fusion AVSR system by incorporating two additional cross-attention modules within the audio and visual encoders, distributed across multiple layers. This allows for fusing the modalities at different levels of representations.

- The multi-layer cross-attention fusion enables more exhaustive representation learning and fusion by leveraging hidden representations in the encoders ranging from low-level to high-level features. 

- It outperforms their previous best system, the systems ranked 1st and 3rd in the MISP2022 challenge, and establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the MISP2022-AVSR dataset after multi-system fusion using ROVER.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the multi-layer cross-attention fusion mechanism for AVSR to promote representation learning of each modality by fusing them at different levels of the audio/visual encoders.
