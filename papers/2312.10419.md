## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances, remaining challenges, and future directions in robotic manipulation of deformable objects (DOs). Manipulation of DOs has many important applications but is very challenging due to the complexity of accurately perceiving, modeling, and controlling such objects. 

The paper first reviews perception methods for DOs. For visual perception, key techniques like segmentation, detection and tracking of DOs are discussed along with latest research. The review then covers tactile perception devices and techniques tailored for DO manipulation tasks. The authors argue that multimodal perception combining vision and touch will be crucial going forward. Two key needs are multimodal manipulation datasets and tactile simulators.

Next, analytical and data-driven modeling approaches are reviewed. Analytical approaches like mass-spring-damper systems, position-based dynamics and continuum mechanics are intuitive and fast but lack accuracy. In contrast, data-driven methods like those based on Jacobian matrices and graph neural networks can learn accurate models from data but require substantial high-quality data. The authors note predictive limitations of both types of models, suggesting the need for model reliability assessment and replanning capabilities. 

For manipulation, the review covers analytical motion planning and control methods as well as learning-based approaches like reinforcement learning and imitation learning. While progress has been made in short-horizon tasks, complex long-horizon tasks manipulating DOs remain an open challenge. Three key future directions highlighted are the use of dexterous robot hands, diverse tools, and compositional generalization of skills.

Finally, the role of large language models (LLMs) is discussed. Initial progress using LLMs has been made in task definition, planning, reward specification, and managing uncertainty for manipulation. However, effectively utilizing LLMs for DO manipulation requires much more investigation.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of DO manipulation research, especially data-driven approaches, analyzes key open problems, and points out promising future directions including leveraging progress in LLMs.
