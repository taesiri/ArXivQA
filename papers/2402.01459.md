# [GaMeS: Mesh-Based Adapting and Modification of Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01459)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) enable high-quality 3D scene rendering but have long training and inference times. 
- Gaussian Splatting (GS) allows fast training and real-time rendering but lacks easy ways to condition/modify the Gaussian components.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Gaussian Mesh Splatting (GaMeS), a hybrid model combining GS and meshes. 
- GaMeS places Gaussian components on the faces of a mesh. The mean and covariance matrix of each Gaussian is parameterized by the vertices of the corresponding mesh face.
- This allows easy modification of the Gaussians by transforming the underlying mesh. As the mesh changes, the attached Gaussians automatically adapt their parameters.

Key Contributions:
- GaMeS allows GS to be conditioned similarly to meshes, enabling real-time animation and modification.
- The model works with an existing mesh or can estimate a "pseudo-mesh" from GS during training to make GS editable. 
- Gaussians are positioned directly on the mesh and fully parameterized by mesh vertices, ensuring proper alignment to mesh surfaces.
- Requires only simple vector operations for rendering, allowing dynamic scenes to be rendered efficiently.
- Achieves rendering quality comparable to state-of-the-art GS and NeRF on complex static scenes. Enables easy animation of these scenes.

In summary, GaMeS makes GS editable by integrating it with meshes, leading to an animatable GS model that retains the fast training and rendering capabilities of vanilla GS.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a hybrid 3D representation called Gaussian Mesh Splatting (GaMeS) that seamlessly integrates mesh and Gaussian splatting by parameterizing Gaussian components using mesh vertices, allowing for real-time rendering of editable Gaussian splatting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It introduces a hybrid representation for 3D objects, seamlessly integrating mesh and Gaussian Splatting (GS). 

2. The proposed "Gaussian Mesh Splatting" (\our{}) model works on a simple "pseudo-mesh" that can be estimated directly from the Gaussian components obtained in a single training stage without needing an expensive preprocessing strategy.

3. The method relies only on essential vector operations. As a result, it can render dynamic scenes at a pace similar to static scenes.

In summary, the key innovation is the \our{} model which combines meshes and GS in a way that allows for real-time modification and adaptation of the GS representation by manipulating the mesh. This enables applications like animation while retaining the high rendering quality and efficiency of vanilla GS.

- Real-time rendering - Fast inference for view synthesis, allowing dynamic scenes to be rendered smoothly. 

- Editable rendering - Modifying the underlying GS or mesh representation to enable real-time editing of rendered scenes (scaling, transformations, animations etc.)

- Hybrid representation - Seamlessly integrating mesh structure with Gaussian splatting to get benefits of both for fast, high-quality and editable rendering.
