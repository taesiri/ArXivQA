# On the Adversarial Robustness of Multi-Modal Foundation Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How susceptible are recent multi-modal foundation models, which combine vision and language capabilities, to adversarial attacks via imperceptible image perturbations?Specifically, the paper investigates whether an adversary could manipulate the output of the OpenFlamingo multi-modal model by adding small perturbations to the input images that are hardly noticeable to humans. The goal is to understand if such attacks could be used to generate fake or harmful information from the model, which honest users would unknowingly trust.The main hypothesis appears to be that even minimal perturbations on the image inputs could significantly degrade the model's performance and be exploited to produce malicious outputs. The experiments test this hypothesis by evaluating targeted and untargeted adversarial attacks within small threat models on the OpenFlamingo model.In summary, the central research question focuses on assessing the adversarial robustness of multi-modal foundation models to imperceptible manipulation of visual inputs. The key hypothesis is that small perturbations are sufficient to manipulate and control the model's outputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Introducing a novel framework for evaluating the susceptibility of multi-modal models (specifically OpenFlamingo) to adversarial visual attacks. The paper shows that imperceptible perturbations to input images can significantly manipulate the model's output.2. Exploring two types of attacks - targeted and untargeted. The targeted attack allows manipulating the model to produce a specific desired output, while the untargeted attack aims to degrade output quality. 3. Showcasing potential real-world implications of this vulnerability, such as spreading misinformation or manipulating user behavior through fake captions or answers.4. Underscoring the need for developing robustness-enhancing strategies in multi-modal models against such adversarial attacks before deployment in critical applications.In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating the vulnerability of multi-modal models like OpenFlamingo to adversarial manipulations and highlighting the security concerns this poses for real-world usage, especially in sensitive applications like news generation. The paper stresses the importance of developing mitigation strategies against such attacks.
