# [Are you talking to ['xem'] or ['x', 'em']? On Tokenization and   Addressing Misgendering in LLMs with Pronoun Tokenization Parity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11779)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle to correctly refer to people who use neopronouns (like xe/xem), possibly due to the scarcity of neopronouns in the training data. However, the specific mechanisms by which data scarcity impacts neopronoun misgendering remain underexplored. 

- The paper investigates the role of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization, used in most LLMs, in contributing to neopronoun misgendering. BPE relies on frequency in text corpus to construct tokens. Due to scarcity, neopronouns get split into subword units while binary pronouns are single tokens. This token fragmentation introduces syntactic challenges for LLMs to handle neopronouns properly.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces "pronoun tokenization parity" (PTP) to preserve neopronouns' functional structure by representing them as single tokens like binary pronouns. This is done by allocating special tokens to neopronouns.

- PTP is evaluated by finetuning LLMs on augmented pronoun data and testing for pronoun consistency, case agreement and a new metric called "syntactic perturbation error". Lexical finetuning, which only updates token embeddings, is also explored as a efficient alternative.

Main Contributions:
- Uncovers how BPE tokenization contributes to neopronoun misgendering in LLMs due to data scarcity, offering new perspective on this issue.

- Introduces PTP method to mitigate impact of tokenization by treating neopronouns similarly to binary pronouns. Shows consistent improvements in neopronoun consistency across models.

- Lexical finetuning with PTP found to match or exceed standard finetuning while reducing training costs, highlighting it as a viable alternative.

- Proposes new syntax-based evaluation metric associates strongly with pronoun consistency, complementing existing metrics.

Overall the paper provides novel insights into role of scarce data on LLM capabilities, and demonstrates effectiveness of simple but principled token-level intervention for improving neopronoun usage.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel approach called pronoun tokenization parity (PTP) to mitigate large language model misgendering of non-binary pronouns by preserving their functional structure during tokenization, and shows PTP significantly improves neopronoun consistency while reducing training costs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is introducing a novel approach called "pronoun tokenization parity" (PTP) to reduce neopronoun misgendering in large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- The paper uncovers how the Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer used in many popular LLMs contributes to neopronoun misgendering due to out-of-vocabulary behavior caused by the scarcity of neopronouns in training data. 

- PTP is proposed as a way to align neopronoun tokenization with binary pronoun tokenization in order to preserve the functional structure of neopronouns. This involves representing neopronouns as single tokens using special tokens.

- Experiments show that finetuning LLMs with PTP data improves neopronoun consistency substantially compared to traditional finetuning, highlighting the significant role tokenization plays. For example, consistency improves from 14.5% to 58.4% in one experiment.

- The paper also shows that exploiting an LLM's existing syntactic knowledge by only finetuning the lexical layer with PTP can improve consistency while reducing training costs, making it a more eco-friendly approach.

So in summary, the main contribution is introducing and evaluating PTP as a novel, effective way to address neopronoun misgendering in LLMs resulting from problematic tokenization. The paper provides both empirical evidence and analysis to demonstrate this.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Lexical finetuning
- Pronoun case agreement
- Syntactic perturbation error

The paper explores misgendering of neopronouns in large language models, focusing specifically on the role of Byte-Pair Encoding tokenization and how out-of-vocabulary behavior for rare neopronouns can contribute to inconsistencies. The main contribution is a novel method called "pronoun tokenization parity" which represents neopronouns as single, cohesive tokens using special tokens to try to improve consistency. Experiments compare variants finetuned with and without this parity on metrics like pronoun consistency, case agreement, and a new syntactic error metric. Key findings show improvements to neopronoun consistency with the parity method, especially when only finetuning the lexical layer, highlighting the impact tokenization plays.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel concept called "pronoun tokenization parity" (PTP). Can you explain in more detail what this concept entails and how it aims to address neopronoun misgendering in language models? 

2. One key component of PTP seems to be the use of special tokens to represent neopronouns as single, cohesive units during tokenization. What is the motivation behind preserving neopronouns as single tokens rather than sequences of subwords? How does this differ from the common tokenization approach?

3. The paper argues that preserving the "functional structure" of neopronouns can help language models better capture their usage as pronouns. Can you elaborate on what the functional structure of pronouns refers to and why it is important for proper pronoun usage?

4. How exactly does PTP align the tokenization of neopronouns with that of binary pronouns? What specific techniques are used during tokenization and vocabulary extension to achieve parity between pronoun types?

5. Why do you think the authors chose to focus specifically on the xe/xem/xir pronoun family in their experiments instead of evaluating on multiple or all neopronouns? What are the potential benefits and limitations of this choice?

6. The paper introduces a novel metric called "syntactic perturbation error" to evaluate language models' grammatical understanding of neopronouns. Can you explain how this metric works, why it was created, and how it complements existing metrics?

7. Lexical fine-tuning is proposed as a more efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. Why would updating only the lexical embeddings lead to gains in pronoun consistency? What underlying assumptions enable this transfer of knowledge?

8. The results show that PTP with lexical fine-tuning performs better than standard fine-tuning for smaller model sizes. What factors might explain why this advantage diminishes for larger model sizes?

9. Could the PTP approach be extended to improve consistency for other types of rare or unknown words besides neopronouns? What challenges might arise when generalizing this method?

10. The paper focuses on the role of tokenization in neopronoun misgendering. Based on the results and analysis, what other potential factors could contribute to inconsistent neopronoun usage in language models?
