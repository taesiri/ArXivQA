# [Inappropriate Pause Detection In Dysarthric Speech Using Large-Scale   Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18923)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Dysarthria is a common speech disorder among stroke patients that severely impacts speech intelligibility. Inappropriate pauses are crucial indicators for assessing severity and guiding speech therapy. Currently, assessment relies on time-consuming manual evaluation by healthcare professionals. There is a need for automatic methods to detect inappropriate pauses to support personalized patient feedback and therapy.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes extending a large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for inappropriate pause detection in dysarthric speech. The key ideas are:

1) Treat pause detection as a speech recognition task - use an ASR model to generate text with pause tags from speech. This simplifies pause labeling at the text level. 

2) Establish criteria for inappropriate pauses through collaboration with speech therapists, focusing on within-word insertions.

3) Extend the ASR model with an "inappropriate pause prediction" layer for end-to-end detection. Jointly train for ASR and pause prediction.

4) Introduce a tailored metric (Inappropriate Pause Error Rate) to evaluate performance independent of ASR accuracy.

Main Contributions:

- Novel formulation of inappropriate pause detection as an ASR problem for end-to-end detection
- Text-level labeling strategy to simplify annotation 
- Criteria for inappropriate pauses tailored to dysarthric speech 
- Joint ASR and pause prediction model with improved ASR performance
- New evaluation metric for independent assessment of pause detection

Experiments show the method detects inappropriate pauses better than baselines, with consistent performance across dysarthria severity levels. This could effectively support diagnosis and feedback for personalized therapy.
