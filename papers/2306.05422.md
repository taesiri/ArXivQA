## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to estimate long-range, dense motion trajectories for all pixels in a video that are globally consistent and can track points through occlusions. The key hypothesis is that representing a video using a quasi-3D canonical volume mapped to per-frame local volumes through neural network parameterized bijections can capture complex scene and camera motions while ensuring cycle consistency. This representation allows tracking all pixels through occlusions and consolidation of noisy, incomplete input correspondence into complete, accurate motion trajectories spanning entire videos.In summary, the core research question is how to produce dense, long-range, and globally consistent motion trajectories for videos. The key hypothesis is that a quasi-3D canonical representation with learned neural bijective mappings can achieve this goal.
