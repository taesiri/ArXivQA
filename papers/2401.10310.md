# [Mathematical Algorithm Design for Deep Learning under Societal and   Judicial Constraints: The Algorithmic Transparency Requirement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10310)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models lack trustworthiness (privacy, security, reliability, etc.), which is concerning given their increasing real-world impact. Regulations like the EU's AI Act propose requirements around algorithmic transparency and accountability to mitigate risks. 
- It is unclear if deep learning methods can actually achieve trustworthiness. The black-box nature of neural networks makes factors influencing outcomes unclear. Can adaptions lead to more trustworthy deep learning?

Proposed Solution: 
- Formalize trustworthiness notions like transparency into a mathematical framework based on computability theory. This allows assessing if transparent, and thereby trustworthy, algorithms can exist for a problem in a given computing model.
- Apply this framework to deep learning for inverse problems on digital (Turing machines) and analog (BSS machines) computing models. Inverse problems aim to reconstruct data from limited measurements, important for medical imaging etc.

Main Contributions:
- Mathematical definition connecting transparency of an algorithm to computability of the problem function, enabling analysis of existence of trustworthy algorithms.
- Proof that general transparent algorithms solving inverse problems do not exist on digital devices, but can be achieved under certain assumptions in analog computing. 
- Demonstration that analog computing better facilitates trustworthy algorithmic solutions. Suggests benefits beyond efficiency, provides formal arguments to shift from purely digital approaches.
- Framework to guide design and analysis towards transparent deep learning implementations. Can identify problematic areas lacking trustworthiness guarantees.

In summary, the paper develops a mathematical basis to assess trustworthiness expressed via transparency in deep learning algorithms. Application to inverse problems indicates inherent obstacles in digital computing, while analog computing shows greater promise. This suggests combinational analog-digital systems may enable more trustworthy future deep learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The paper analyzes the potential to establish trustworthy deep learning systems for solving inverse problems under different computing models, finding that analog computing modeled by Blum-Shub-Smale machines can guarantee transparency and algorithmic solvability to a greater degree than digital computing modeled by Turing machines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a mathematical framework to analyze whether deep learning algorithms can achieve "trustworthiness", meaning transparency, accountability, fairness, safety, etc. Specifically:

- The paper formalizes the notion of "algorithmic transparency" for digital (Turing machine) and analog (BSS machine) models of computation. It shows that algorithmic transparency, which is key for trustworthiness, requires the algorithm to be computable/realizable in the respective model. 

- It applies this framework to study deep learning for solving linear inverse problems. It shows that for certain problem formulations and parameters, inverse problems are not algorithmically solvable on Turing machines, meaning no transparent/trustworthy algorithm exists. However, with modifications, algorithmic solvability can be attained in the BSS model.

- This indicates a potential capability gap between digital and analog computing regarding trustworthy deep learning. The exact analog model studied (BSS machines) is idealized, but the results suggest analog computing could offer benefits for achieving trustworthy deep learning algorithms.

In summary, the main contribution is a mathematical computability-based technique to assess the trustworthiness capacity of algorithmic solutions, applied here to analyze deep learning for inverse problems. The framework and its application reveal insights into the effect of the underlying computing model on the achievability of trustworthy deep learning.

The paper discusses establishing trustworthiness, specifically algorithmic transparency, in deep learning systems. It introduces a mathematical framework based on computability theory to analyze whether a transparent algorithmic implementation is feasible for a given computing model. This framework is then applied to analyze deep learning approaches for solving inverse problems on Turing machines (modeling digital computing) and Blum-Shub-Smale machines (modeling analog computing). The notions of algorithmic solvability and algorithmic transparency are formalized and compared between the two computing models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a framework to assess algorithmic transparency based on computability theory. What are the key advantages and limitations of using computability theory compared to other approaches for evaluating algorithmic transparency?

2. The notion of "algorithmic solvability" is proposed to convert the problem of evaluating multi-valued mappings into assessing single-valued functions. What are other potential ways to approach the analysis of multi-valued mappings from a computability perspective? What are the trade-offs?  

3. The paper analyzes two computing models - the Turing machine and the Blum-Shub-Smale machine. What other computing models could be relevant to consider for algorithmic transparency? What new insights might they provide?

4. Theorem 3 establishes algorithmic non-solvability of certain inverse problems in the Turing model. Does the proof technique extend to other problem settings beyond inverse problems? What modifications would be necessary?

5. Remark 5 indicates that the limitations in the Turing model are connected to intrinsic properties of the solution set. Can you give specific examples of solution set constructions that lead to non-computability?

6. The approximations proposed in Theorem 4 to enable algorithmic solvability in the BSS model come with certain limitations, e.g., the need to abort computations. Can you propose alternative approximation schemes without these drawbacks? 

7. The comparison of Turing and BSS machines indicates a potential trade-off between generality and transparency. Can you quantify this trade-off or give formal arguments supporting or contradicting this claim?

8. The paper focuses on linear inverse problems. How would the analysis change for non-linear inverse problems? What new challenges arise?

9. The notion of algorithmic transparency is tied to identifiability of factors influencing the outcome. Does this cover all relevant aspects of transparency in AI systems? What's missing and how to address it?

10. The paper indicates that incorporating analog computing may be necessary to obtain algorithmic transparency. Do you think this conclusion will hold more broadly when analyzing other AI methods and applications? What evidence supports or contradicts this?
