# [Scalable and Efficient MoE Training for Multitask Multilingual Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10465)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we efficiently scale up MoE (Mixture of Experts) models to trillions of parameters while also improving their training and inference efficiency?

Specifically, the authors aim to tackle three main challenges:

1) System challenges in scaling up MoE models due to their unique architecture requiring orchestration of multiple types of parallelism. 

2) Training and inference challenges like expert capacity limits, regularization, and runtime efficiency for large MoE models.

3) Challenges in leveraging MoE models for complex multitask multilingual training.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes:

1) DeepSpeed MoE, a system that combines various parallelism techniques to scale MoE models to trillions of parameters.

2) New training methods like random token selection and aggregation of experts to improve sample efficiency. And expert pruning for inference efficiency.

3) Training recipes to effectively pre-train large multitask multilingual MoE models.

The central hypothesis is that by combining efficient systems, training methods, and recipes, MoE models can be scaled up to much larger sizes leading to significant accuracy gains in multitask multilingual training. The paper aims to demonstrate this hypothesis experimentally.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. DeepSpeed MoE, a system that can efficiently scale MoE models to trillions of parameters by orchestrating multiple dimensions of parallelism. It overcomes limitations of existing systems by combining expert, data, model, and ZeRO parallelism. It also uses ZeRO-Offload to leverage both GPU and CPU memory to train larger models.

2. Effective training methods like Random Token Selection to handle token selection bias, Aggregation of Experts to accelerate training convergence, and Expert Pruning to improve inference efficiency.

3. Scaling of multitask multilingual models with MoE architecture by pretraining a 10B parameter Z-code M3 model on 50 languages with multiple objectives. This model achieves SOTA results on tasks like machine translation and cross-lingual summarization.

4. The system support for efficient large-scale MoE training has been implemented and open-sourced in DeepSpeed.

In summary, the main contribution is advancing the state-of-the-art in scaling and training large MoE models through a combination of system optimizations, efficient training methods, and model architecture innovations, enabling new SOTA multilingual multitask models. The opensourced system also makes large MoE models more accessible.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a scalable system called DeepSpeed MoE to efficiently train large multitask multilingual mixture-of-experts models, enabling improved translation and language generation through increased model scale while reducing training costs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in training large-scale multilingual language models:

- It introduces a new distributed training system, DeepSpeed MoE, for efficiently scaling Mixture of Experts (MoE) models to trillions of parameters. This builds on prior work like GShard and Switch Transformer but introduces new techniques like combining ZeRO and model parallelism to remove redundancy across data parallel devices. The scale achieved is significantly larger than prior MoE training systems.

- The paper explores multitask training of an encoder-decoder model on translation and denoising objectives across 50 languages. This continues a trend in multilingual modeling of training on diverse tasks and languages to improve generalization, building on works like mT5, M2M-100, XGLM, etc. The key difference is the use of MoE to scale up model capacity for this multitask training.

- New training techniques like Random Token Selection and aggregation of experts are introduced to improve MoE model convergence and sample efficiency. The modular nature of MoE models is also exploited for model compression via expert pruning. These aim to address some intrinsic challenges with MoE training compared to dense models.

- The trained multilingual model achieves state-of-the-art results on machine translation even compared to much larger dense models like M2M-100. The generative capabilities are further demonstrated via strong performance on cross-lingual summarization and multiple language generation tasks. This highlights the capabilities unlocked by scaled up multitask MoE models.

Overall, the key innovations are in the training system and techniques to unlock unprecedented scale and efficiency for multilingual MoE models. The demonstrated accuracy and generalizability highlight the potential of this approach compared to dense model scaling. The code and implementations are also open-sourced to enable further research in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring the limits and returns of scaling MoE models while efficiently utilizing compute resources. The authors mention wanting to examine how large they can scale MoE models on current hardware while maximizing efficiency.

- More efficient integration of ZeRO-Offload with Z-code M3 models to allow very large base model sizes. The authors want to research enabling even larger base models in the MoE architecture.

- Additional comprehensive experiments on optimizing encoder-only tasks like masked language modeling and ELECTRA in the multitask training setup. The authors did preliminary experiments but want to further explore this direction.

- Studying the modular expert components more, including their ability to specialize and composability. The authors suggest the expert modules exhibit properties like autonomy and specialization that could be further leveraged.

- Continued scaling of the model size, tasks, and languages to further improve accuracy and capabilities. The authors emphasize continued scaling is an important research direction.

In summary, the main future directions are focused on scaling the models more efficiently, improving expert utilization and routing, enhancing multitask training, and better understanding and exploiting the composable nature of the expert modules.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces DeepSpeed MoE, a scalable system for training large sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. MoE models have sublinear compute costs with respect to parameters, allowing larger models at constant cost. However, scaling MoE models presents system challenges due to the sparse architecture.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces DeepSpeed MoE, a scalable system for training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. MoE models activate only parts of the model for each input, allowing very large models with lower compute costs. However, scaling MoE models has challenges like memory constraints and imbalanced expert usage. 

DeepSpeed MoE combines multiple forms of parallelism to scale MoE model size and training efficiently. It uses expert, data, model, and ZeRO parallelism together with offloading to CPU memory. This allows multi-trillion parameter MoE models to be trained. The paper also proposes techniques like Random Token Selection to improve MoE training convergence and aggregation of experts to improve model initialization. These methods are used to train a large multitask multilingual model called Z-code M3. Experiments show Z-code M3 significantly improves translation and language generation compared to baseline models. The efficient system and training methods enable much larger and more accurate MoE models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes DeepSpeed MoE, a system for efficiently training large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. DeepSpeed MoE combines multiple dimensions of parallelism (expert, data, model, and ZeRO parallelism) along with heterogeneous memory technologies (GPU and CPU memory) to support training of MoE models with trillions of parameters.
