# [Scalable and Efficient MoE Training for Multitask Multilingual Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10465)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we efficiently scale up MoE (Mixture of Experts) models to trillions of parameters while also improving their training and inference efficiency?

Specifically, the authors aim to tackle three main challenges:

1) System challenges in scaling up MoE models due to their unique architecture requiring orchestration of multiple types of parallelism. 

2) Training and inference challenges like expert capacity limits, regularization, and runtime efficiency for large MoE models.

3) Challenges in leveraging MoE models for complex multitask multilingual training.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes:

1) DeepSpeed MoE, a system that combines various parallelism techniques to scale MoE models to trillions of parameters.

2) New training methods like random token selection and aggregation of experts to improve sample efficiency. And expert pruning for inference efficiency.

3) Training recipes to effectively pre-train large multitask multilingual MoE models.

The central hypothesis is that by combining efficient systems, training methods, and recipes, MoE models can be scaled up to much larger sizes leading to significant accuracy gains in multitask multilingual training. The paper aims to demonstrate this hypothesis experimentally.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in training large-scale multilingual language models:

- It introduces a new distributed training system, DeepSpeed MoE, for efficiently scaling Mixture of Experts (MoE) models to trillions of parameters.

The paper introduces DeepSpeed MoE, a scalable system for training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. MoE models activate only parts of the model for each input, allowing very large models with lower compute costs. However, scaling MoE models has challenges like memory constraints and imbalanced expert usage. 

DeepSpeed MoE combines multiple forms of parallelism to scale MoE model size and training efficiently. It uses expert, data, model, and ZeRO parallelism together with offloading to CPU memory.
