# [SVFormer: Semi-supervised Video Transformer for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13222)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively utilize Transformer models for semi-supervised video action recognition. Specifically, the paper investigates:

- How to adapt semi-supervised learning methods like FixMatch to be suitable for video transformers instead of CNNs. 

- How to design effective data augmentation strategies tailored for video transformers in the semi-supervised setting, rather than using standard image augmentations.

The key hypotheses are:

- Video transformers can achieve strong semi-supervised action recognition performance despite lacking inductive biases like CNNs, if properly adapted.

- Novel token-level mixing like Tube TokenMix and temporal warping augmentations can better leverage the capabilities of transformers for semi-supervised video tasks compared to pixel-level mixing or spatial-only augmentations.

In summary, the paper explores how to unlock the potential of transformers for semi-supervised video action recognition via adapted training frameworks and customized video-specific data augmentations. The central goal is pushing the state-of-the-art in this domain by effectively leveraging transformers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes SVFormer, a transformer-based method for semi-supervised video action recognition. This is the first work to explore transformers for SSL in video action recognition.

- It introduces Tube TokenMix (TTMix), a novel data augmentation strategy tailored for video transformers. TTMix mixes tokens from two video clips using a tube-style mask with consistent masked regions across frames. This better models spatio-temporal correlations compared to pixel-level augmentations like Mixup/CutMix.

- It also proposes Temporal Warping Augmentation (TWAug) which distorts the temporal duration of frames to cover complex temporal variations in videos. TWAug combined with TTMix leads to significant performance gains. 

- Extensive experiments show SVFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins on Kinetics-400, UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, especially under the low labeled data regime.

- The work establishes strong baselines and provides useful insights on designing semi-supervised learning methods for video transformers, which can encourage future research in this direction.

In summary, the key novelty is the design of token-level augmentations like TTMix and TWAug tailored for semi-supervised video transformers, which lead to new state-of-the-art results. The work is the first to show the great potential of transformers for semi-supervised video action recognition.
