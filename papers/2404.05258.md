# [Unsupervised Band Selection Using Fused HSI and LiDAR Attention   Integrating With Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05258)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Hyperspectral images contain a large number of spectral bands leading to high dimensionality and redundancy. This poses challenges such as the Hughes phenomenon, computational burden, and storage/transmission inefficiencies. Band selection is thus critical to extract the most informative bands, removing redundant bands. However, traditional band selection methods analyze spectral/spatial characteristics within bands independently and don't utilize auxiliary data like LiDAR. They also face limitations in the availability of labeled data. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an unsupervised band selection framework integrating hyperspectral imaging (HSI) with LiDAR using attention mechanisms and an Autoencoder. Key aspects include:

1) A dual attention module that generates attention masks - one focusing on spectral correlations among HSI bands and another utilizing spatial correlations from LiDAR. 

2) The attention masks are merged into a fused mask and multiplied with the combined HSI+LiDAR input. This masked input is fed to a convolutional Autoencoder.

3) A custom distance metric combining attention scores and inter-band dissimilarity is used to guide hierarchical clustering for selecting the top informative and dissimilar bands.

Main Contributions:

1) Innovative framework leveraging LiDAR for enhanced HSI band selection through a dual attention mechanism and fusion mask.

2) Integration of attention mechanisms with Autoencoder compacts informative representation of merged HSI+LiDAR data. Sparsity-inducing loss retains critical features.

3) Custom distance metric for superior band selection based on attention scores and dissimilarity. Prioritizes highly informative and distinct bands.  

4) Targeted band subset selection using hierarchical clustering for maximal discrimination.

The method is evaluated on Houston 2013, Trento and MUUFL datasets and shows higher classification accuracy over state-of-the-art unsupervised band selection techniques, demonstrating the advantages of HSI+LiDAR fusion for band selection.
