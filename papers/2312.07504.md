# [COLMAP-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07504)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most neural rendering methods like NeRF require accurate camera poses obtained from structure-from-motion (SfM) algorithms like COLMAP as input. However, running SfM is time-consuming and can fail due to issues with feature extraction, textureless regions, etc. Recent works have tried to eliminate this SfM preprocessing step by jointly optimizing NeRF and camera poses. But NeRF's implicit representation makes this challenging. These methods also struggle with large camera motions.

Method: 
This paper proposes COLMAP-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting (CF-3DGS) to perform novel view synthesis without needing SfM-computed camera poses. It leverages two key aspects:
1) Temporal continuity from video: Processes frames sequentially, estimating incremental camera motion between frames.
2) Explicit point cloud representation of 3D Gaussians: Allows directly applying affine transformations unlike NeRF raycasting.

It has two main components:
1) Local 3DGS: Estimates relative camera pose between pairs of frames by fitting 3D Gaussians from frame 1 to frame 2. Leverages continuity for small inter-frame motions.
2) Global 3DGS: Aggregates information across all frames into a global 3D Gaussian set. Grows this set progressively as new frames arrive to reconstruct full scene.

Contributions:
- Proposes first method to combine explicit scene representation of 3DGS with simultaneous pose estimation 
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches like Nope-NeRF on view synthesis
- More robust camera pose estimation, especially for large motions 
- Faster training than alternatives (1.5 hours vs 30 hours for Nope-NeRF)

Experiments show superior performance on Tanks & Temples and complex 360 degree videos from CO3D dataset.
