# [COLMAP-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07504)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes COLMAP-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting (CF-3DGS), a method to perform novel view synthesis from videos without needing any camera pose estimation preprocessing. Current state-of-the-art neural rendering techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) rely heavily on accurate pre-computed camera poses from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques. To eliminate this constraint, the authors leverage the explicit 3D point cloud representation and differentiable rendering process of recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Their key insight is that the continuity in video frames and the deformability of the explicit point representation make it feasible to simultaneously estimate cameras and optimize the point cloud scene representation. Specifically, they process the frames sequentially, using each frame to estimate the incremental camera motion and deform the point cloud to match the next frame. The accumulated camera motions allow aggregating information into a global point cloud that covers the whole scene. This avoids having to jointly optimize all frames and poses together. Experiments demonstrate superior novel view synthesis and camera pose estimation compared to previous approaches, especially on challenging videos with large camera motions. A key advantage is the extremely fast training time enabled by the explicit scene representation.
