# [TriviaHG: A Dataset for Automatic Hint Generation from Factoid Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18426)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Answering questions using AI systems like large language models (LLMs) reduces human thinking and reasoning skills. Providing hints instead of direct answers can help maintain these skills.
- There is limited research on automatic hint generation for factoid questions (AHGQ) and no datasets exist for this task. Evaluating hint quality automatically is also difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduced a framework to generate the TriviaHG dataset containing over 160k hints for 16k factoid questions from TriviaQA. 
- Hints are generated using Bing Chat AI based on online sources to ensure accuracy and relevance.
- Proposed an automatic evaluation method to assess hint quality in terms of convergence (eliminating incorrect answers) and familiarity (recognizability of entities).

Key Contributions:
- Release of TriviaHG - a large-scale dataset for AHGQ with over 160k hints.
- A novel automatic evaluation method for hint quality focused on convergence and familiarity.
- Analysis demonstrates the dataset's quality and the effectiveness of the evaluation method.
- Showed the utility of TriviaHG for finetuning models to improve hint generation.
- Validated that hints can help humans answer questions, especially for medium/easy answers (96%/78% success).

The paper introduces both data and methods to advance research on hint generation for factoid QA, with analyses confirming their quality and real-world utility.
