# [Emotional Tandem Robots: How Different Robot Behaviors Affect Human   Perception While Controlling a Mobile Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03746)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
As robots become more prevalent, understanding how a robot's behavior and motion patterns influence human perception and emotional state in human-robot interactions is important. Prior work has shown robots can express emotions through motion, but the effect on humans actively collaborating with emotionally expressive robots is underexplored. 

Proposed Solution:  
The paper examines how different emotional behaviors (angry, happy, sad, neutral) of an autonomous following robot affect the perception, attention, and emotions of a human controlling a leading robot in a leader-follower scenario. The behaviors are implemented through distinct motion patterns.

Methodology:  
15 participants manually control the leader robot along a set path, with the follower robot exhibiting one of the four behaviors in random order in each trial. Participants complete questionnaires after each trial covering perception, emotion, time perception, and classify the behavior. Semi-structured interviews are also conducted.

Key Results:
- Emotionally expressive behaviors draw more user attention to the follower robot over neutral behavior 
- Angry behavior increases user stress; happy behavior increases excitement
- Angry behavior correctly identified by 93% of participants
- Happy behavior most preferred; neutral behavior most boring

Main Contributions:
- Shows robot motion and behavior influences human collaborator's perception and emotional state
- Provides insights into effects of different emotional expressions in leader-follower scenario
- Groundwork for designing robots that interact more naturally and intuitively with humans in multi-robot systems

The work demonstrates the feasibility of using a robot's motion to express emotions and influence human collaborators. It lays groundwork for designing more natural interactions in human-robot collaboration and swarm/multi-robot systems.
