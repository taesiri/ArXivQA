# [Sampling with Mirrored Stein Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12506)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we develop particle evolution sampling algorithms that are suitable for target distributions with constrained domains and non-Euclidean geometries?

The key points are:

- Standard particle evolution methods like Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) can fail or be inefficient for constrained distributions or when the geometry is non-Euclidean. 

- The authors propose new sampling algorithms based on "mirrored Stein operators" that map particles to a dual space, evolve them there, and then map back while preserving constraints and encoding geometry.

- Specifically, they introduce Mirrored SVGD, Stein Variational Mirror Descent, and Stein Variational Natural Gradient algorithms. The first handles constraints, the second also reduces to mirror descent with one particle, and the third exploits non-Euclidean geometry.

- They analyze the convergence properties of these methods and demonstrate their effectiveness on problems like sampling from simplex-constrained distributions, constructing confidence intervals under post-selection inference, and large-scale Bayesian logistic regression.

So in summary, the main research question is how to develop particle-based sampling algorithms suitable for constrained and non-Euclidean settings where standard methods fail or are inefficient. The core innovation is the introduction and application of mirrored Stein operators.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces a new family of particle evolution samplers suitable for constrained domains and non-Euclidean geometries. The main contributions are:

1. It develops two new algorithms called Mirrored Stein Variational Gradient Descent (MSVGD) and Stein Variational Mirror Descent (SVMD) for sampling from constrained distributions. These algorithms perform updates in a "mirrored" dual space defined by a mirror map, which ensures the samples always satisfy the constraints after mapping back. 

2. It introduces a new class of mirrored Stein operators that underlie the updates in the dual space. These operators satisfy a generalized Stein identity that enables decreasing the KL divergence to constrained target distributions.

3. It proposes Stein Variational Natural Gradient (SVNG) which exploits non-Euclidean geometry through the use of adaptive kernels incorporating metric tensors like the Fisher information matrix. This allows more efficient sampling from unconstrained targets.

4. It provides convergence guarantees for the new samplers, relating the decrease in KL divergence to the novel mirrored Stein discrepancies.

5. It demonstrates the benefits of the new methods over standard SVGD on benchmark problems involving sampling from distributions on the simplex, performing valid post-selection inference, and large-scale Bayesian logistic regression.

In summary, the key innovation is the development of mirrored Stein operators and associated sampling algorithms that can handle constraints and non-Euclidean geometry, overcoming limitations of previous methods like standard SVGD. The theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate the advantages of the new techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of sampling methods:

- The key novelty is the development of "mirrored" Stein operators and their application to derive new sampling algorithms suitable for constrained domains (like the simplex) or problems with non-Euclidean geometry. This differs from most prior work on Stein variational methods which focus on unconstrained domains.

- The algorithms SVMD and MSVGD extend SVGD to handle constraints by performing updates in a "dual space" defined by a mirror map. This is related to recent work marrying mirror descent ideas with MCMC, but novel in the context of particle-based sampling.

- SVNG exploits connections between mirror descent and natural gradients to better handle unconstrained problems with non-Euclidean geometry. This is related in spirit to Riemannian SVGD and matrix SVGD, but the kernel construction seems simpler and more principled, leading to better empirical performance.

- The paper provides theoretical convergence guarantees for the new methods under verifiable conditions. This kind of analysis is still rare for particle-based samplers, with most work focusing on asymptotic analyses.

- The experiments comprehensively evaluate performance on constrained sampling tasks, selective inference, and large-scale Bayesian inference. This demonstrates the wide applicability of the methods.

Overall, I would say the key innovations are in the design and analysis of the new mirrored Stein operators and kernels, and their application to develop samplers that expand the scope of problems addressable by particle-based methods. The connections made to mirror descent and natural gradients are also novel and insightful. The empirical results convincingly demonstrate the advantages over prior particle-based and MCMC sampling approaches on key tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing modified or alternative mirrored Stein operators that have better theoretical convergence properties or are more amenable to stochastic gradient estimation. The authors mention trying to weaken the conditions required for Stein's identity to hold with the mirrored operator. 

- Applying mirrored Stein operators and the proposed samplers (MSVGD, SVMD, SVNG) to other statistical inference tasks involving constrained domains or non-Euclidean geometry. Examples mentioned include goodness-of-fit testing, graphical model inference, MCMC diagnostics, parameter estimation, and more.

- Analyzing the theoretical convergence properties of the proposed methods in more depth, such as providing non-asymptotic rates or analyzing the stochastic gradient case. The authors proved some basic convergence results under verifiable conditions on the target distribution.

- Extending the methodology to handle dynamics on more complex geometries beyond Euclidean spaces, such as Riemannian manifolds. The authors currently handle constraints via transformations to a dual space.

- Developing more scalable implementations of SVMD and SVNG using low-rank approximations to the sequence of adaptive kernels or other techniques. The eigendecomposition limits the scalability of these methods.

- Deploying the samplers for challenging real-world tasks in probabilistic machine learning and Bayesian inference. The authors demonstrated promising performance on some simple benchmarks.

- Comparing to a wider range of prior sampling methods on constrained domains, such as stochastic Riemannian Langevin dynamics. Only a limited number of baselines were evaluated.

In summary, the main suggestions are to further develop the theoretical underpinnings, apply the methods to broader statistical tasks, scale up the implementations, benchmark on real-world problems, and compare to a larger set of prior methods.

This paper introduces a new family of particle evolution samplers suitable for constrained domains and non-Euclidean geometries. The authors derive three new algorithms called Mirrored Stein Variational Gradient Descent (MSVGD), Stein Variational Mirror Descent (SVMD), and Stein Variational Natural Gradient (SVNG).

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new family of particle evolution samplers suitable for constrained domains and non-Euclidean geometries. The authors derive three new algorithms - Stein Variational Mirror Descent (SVMD), Mirrored Stein Variational Gradient Descent (MSVGD), and Stein Variational Natural Gradient (SVNG) - by minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence to constrained target distributions using mirrored Stein operators and adaptive kernels developed in this work.

Convergence guarantees are provided for the continuous-time dynamics underlying the discrete updates. Overall, this work introduces a principled way to develop particle evolution samplers for distributions on constrained domains or with non-Euclidean geometry.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new family of particle evolution samplers suitable for constrained domains and non-Euclidean geometries. The key idea is to update particles in a dual space defined by a mirror map, which automatically satisfies constraints on the domain when mapped back. In particular, the paper proposes two algorithms that minimize KL divergence to constrained targets - Mirrored Stein Variational Gradient Descent (MSVGD) operates in the dual of a standard kernel space while Stein Variational Mirror Descent (SVMD) uses an adaptive kernel incorporating the mirror map. For unconstrained targets, Stein Variational Natural Gradient (SVNG) exploits non-Euclidean geometry by replacing the mirror map with a general metric tensor. All methods derive from new mirrored Stein operators introduced in the paper. Experiments demonstrate advantages over prior methods in sampling simplex-constrained distributions, delivering valid confidence intervals for post-selection inference, and more rapid convergence in unconstrained Bayesian logistic regression.
