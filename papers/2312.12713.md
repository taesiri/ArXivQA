# [Response Enhanced Semi-Supervised Dialogue Query Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12713)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Dialogue query generation aims to generate search queries from dialogue histories to retrieve relevant information from search engines. This is challenging as it requires understanding complex dialogues.  
- Previous supervised learning approaches face issues like data scarcity and poor domain adaptation. Semi-supervised learning can help address these issues by utilizing abundant unlabeled dialogues. However, generating high-quality pseudo queries from unlabeled data is difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose SemiDQG, a semi-supervised learning framework to improve the query producer (QP) using the guidance of a response-augmented query producer (RA).
- RA takes dialogue response as additional input compared to QP. RA can provide better training signals but has input discrepancy from QP.
- Apply similarity-based selection to identify high-quality RA-generated pseudo queries. Construct pseudo training instances to enhance both QP and RA.
- Further improve QP using RA-guided reinforcement learning. RA provides fine-grained rewards for QP's candidate queries.

Main Contributions:
- Novel semi-supervised learning framework that utilizes output features from both QP and RA at different granularities to provide training signals, alleviating negative impact of input discrepancy.
- Query selection strategy to construct high-quality pseudo instances.
- Reinforcement learning approach for QP enhancement using RA's rewards.
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance over baselines like ChatGPT in cross-domain and low-resource scenarios. Significantly higher data efficiency.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective semi-supervised approach to improve dialogue query generation by exploiting useful signals from a response-augmented model, which sets a strong baseline for future research.
