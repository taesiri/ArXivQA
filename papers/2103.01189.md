# [Learners' Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01189)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is:

How can the category theory concepts of polynomials, polynomial coalgebras, and polynomial-coalgebra toposes be used to provide a unified conceptual framework for dynamical systems, generalized Moore machines, and deep learning?

In particular, the paper aims to show:

- Polynomial coalgebras can be understood as dynamical systems or generalized Moore machines, with the polynomial representing the interface. 

- The category of polynomial coalgebras forms a topos, which provides an internal language to express logical propositions about these dynamical systems.

- Deep learning architectures, conceptualized as learners in the category Learn, can be reconstructed in terms of coalgebras on internal hom objects in the category Poly of polynomials. This allows dynamical systems intuition to be applied to deep learning.

- More generally, the paper introduces the operad OOrg of learners, which subsumes Learn and allows dynamical systems to be combined in flexible ways. The components of OOrg are also toposes of coalgebras.

So in summary, the central research goal is to develop a unified categorical framework, based on polynomials and coalgebras, that encompasses dynamical systems, deep learning, and their combinations, and enables logical reasoning about their behavior using topos theory.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

- It shows that the category of learners $\textit{Learn}$ introduced in "Backprop as functor" is isomorphic to $\textit{Para}(\textit{SLens})$, where $\textit{SLens}$ is the category of simple lenses used in functional programming. 

- It conceptualizes morphisms in $\textit{Para}(\textit{SLens})$ in terms of coalgebras on internal hom objects in the category $\textit{Poly}$ of polynomial functors. This provides a generalized dynamical systems perspective on learners.

- It shows that for any polynomial $p$, the category $p\text{-}\textit{Coalg}$ of $p$-coalgebras forms a topos. This allows interpreting dynamical systems and learners in terms of logical propositions internal to these toposes.

- It discusses how notions like gradient descent and backpropagation can be expressed as internal logical propositions in the topos of learners.

- It suggests directions for future work, including developing richer languages for specifying behaviors internal to these toposes, understanding modalities between these toposes, and using connected limits to relate the logics of different toposes of learners.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a dynamical systems and topos-theoretic perspective on learners that allows interpreting and specifying their behavior logically. This provides a new conceptual and technical framework for studying learners and related dynamical systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper conceptualizes gradient descent and backpropagation in deep learning as a strong monoidal functor mapping parameterized Euclidean spaces to learners, where learners form a category that captures parameter update and backpropagation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- The main contribution of this paper is conceptualizing gradient descent and backpropagation in deep learning as a functor from parameterized Euclidean spaces to learners. This builds on prior work like "Backprop as Functor" which first introduced the category of learners to capture backpropagation. However, this paper goes further by relating learners to polynomial functors and dynamical systems. 

- Relating learners to polynomial functors and symmetric lenses is novel compared to prior work. This provides a new perspective and mathematical grounding for the category of learners. It allows learners to be viewed as dynamical systems or generalized Moore machines.

- Showing that the category of p-coalgebras forms a topos for any polynomial p is a theoretical contribution. It allows utilizing the internal language and logic of these topos categories to reason about and specify learners and dynamical systems. Expressing learning algorithms like gradient descent in this internal logic is new.

- Overall, this paper takes conceptualizations of deep learning as a functor further by relating it to broader concepts like dynamical systems, polynomial functors, and topos theory. The mathematical abstractions are more general and comprehensive compared to prior work focused solely on categorical learning theory.

- However, the practical implications are still limited at this stage since the ideas have not been connected to real deep learning systems and experiments. The abstraction level is high, so further research is needed to bridge the theory to practice.

In summary, the paper introduces novel mathematical perspectives on deep learning compared to prior work, but remains quite theoretical. The practical impact is currently limited but it lays groundwork for further research to bridge theory and practice. Expanding the conceptualizations to handle probabilistic/stochastic aspects common in deep learning also seems important for future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several directions for future work:

1. Developing a richer language beyond the standard logical symbols (true, false, ∧, ∨, ⇒, ¬, ∀, ∃) that exist in any topos, in order to build more expressive logical propositions in the specific pCoalg toposes. 

2. Understanding various modalities in these toposes, such as temporal logic operators like "always" and "eventually".

3. Considering adjoint functors between toposes that preserve connected limits, rather than the usual geometric morphisms that preserve finite limits. This allows relating toposes connected in a weaker sense. 

4. Using the internal logic of pCoalg to constrain and specify behaviors of learners and game players modeled as morphisms in these toposes. For example, expressing properties like "gradient descent" as logical propositions.

5. Exploring logical and type-theoretic principles for relating and translating statements between toposes connected by these "connected" adjoint functors.

The key ideas are enriching the internal logic, understanding modalities, relating toposes in a weaker sense, and using the logic to specify/constrain behaviors of interest like learning algorithms. Overall, it seems the authors want to further develop the logical tools for reasoning about and relating categories of dynamical systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper shows that the key elements of deep learning - gradient descent and backpropagation - can be conceptualized as a strong monoidal functor from the category of parameterized Euclidean spaces to the category of learners. The category of learners was developed to capture parameter update and backpropagation. The authors then realize that the category of learners is isomorphic to the Para construction applied to the category of simple lenses used in functional programming. By viewing simple lenses as a full subcategory of polynomial functors, the authors are able to interpret maps in the category of learners in terms of dynamical systems or generalized Moore machines whose interface is the internal hom type. Finally, the authors leverage the fact that the category of dynamical systems on any polynomial functor interface forms a topos, with a simple internal language, to express properties like gradient descent. Future work is discussed around developing richer languages for these topos logics.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper discusses how gradient descent and backpropagation in deep learning can be conceptualized as a functor from the category of parameterized Euclidean spaces to the category of learners. The category of learners was developed to capture parameter update and backpropagation. It was then realized that the category of learners is isomorphic to the Para construction applied to the category of simple lenses used in functional programming. 

The paper goes on to observe that simple lenses form a full subcategory of the category of polynomial functors via the functor sending A to A^A. Using the fact that polynomial functors are monoidal closed, the paper shows morphisms in the category of learners can be interpreted as dynamical systems whose interface is given by an internal hom object. Finally, the paper discusses how the category of coalgebras on any polynomial functor forms a topos, so logical propositions can be stated in its internal language. Gradient descent is given as an example proposition. Future directions, including developing a richer language for these toposes, are discussed.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper shows that the category of learners $\learn$, developed in previous work to capture the compositional structure of deep learning algorithms, is isomorphic to the category $\para(\slens)$ where $\slens$ is the category of simple lenses. The paper then observes that $\slens$ embeds fully into the category $\poly$ of polynomial functors, which has a symmetric monoidal closed structure. Using this structure, the paper shows that a morphism in $\para(\slens)$, and hence a learner, can be understood as a coalgebra for the endofunctor $p\in\poly$ given by the internal hom $[A\yon^A,B\yon^B]$. This allows learners to be interpreted as dynamical systems with interface $p$. Finally, the paper notes that for any $p$, the category $p\coalg$ of such coalgebras forms a topos, so learners have an internal language that can be used to express properties like the gradient descent algorithm. The main method is utilizing the symmetric monoidal closed structure on polynomial functors to reinterpret learners coalgebraically.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "Learners' Languages" is addressing how to conceptualize and generalize the notions of gradient descent and backpropagation in deep learning using category theory. Some key points:

- The authors observed that the category of "learners" (which captures backpropagation) introduced in previous work is isomorphic to the category of coalgebras on certain polynomial endofunctors. 

- This allows them to generalize learners to coalgebras on arbitrary polynomial endofunctors, which can be interpreted as dynamical systems or generalized Moore machines.

- The category of coalgebras on a polynomial endofunctor p forms a topos, which has an internal logic that can be used to express properties and constraints on these dynamical systems. 

- As an example, they show that gradient descent and backpropagation for a neural network can be formulated as a "logical proposition" in the topos of learners for that network.

- The internal logic of these topos provides a formal language for specifying learning algorithms and interaction patterns for dynamical systems more generally. 

So in summary, the main problem being addressed is how to mathematically generalize and expand the notions of gradient descent and backpropagation from deep learning, in order to apply category-theoretic tools to the study of dynamical systems and learning algorithms. The topos-theoretic perspective allows these algorithms to be characterized logically.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Polynomials: The paper focuses on polynomial functors, which are a certain type of endofunctor on the category of sets. Polynomials are built up from representable functors using products and coproducts.

- Coalgebras: Coalgebras for endofunctors, specifically polynomial endofunctors, are a major topic. Coalgebras generalize state machines/Moore machines and capture the notion of dynamical systems.

- Symmetric monoidal closed categories: The category of polynomials Poly forms a symmetric monoidal closed category. This structure allows the construction of internal hom objects, which are crucial.

- Para construction: The Para construction creates categories of "parameterized" objects from symmetric monoidal categories. The category Learn of learners is equivalent to Para(SLens) where SLens is the category of simple lenses.

- Operad OOrg: An operad generalizing the category of learners is defined, allowing dynamical systems to be combined in various ways.

- Topos: For any polynomial p, the category p-Coalg of p-coalgebras forms a topos. This allows an internal language to be defined to characterize coalgebra behaviors.

- Logical propositions: Since p-Coalg is a topos, logical propositions about coalgebras can be defined. These constrain the possible behaviors of dynamical systems and learners.

In summary, the key themes are using polynomials and their coalgebras to generalize state machines and learners, leveraging symmetric monoidal structure and topoi to study their behaviors logically.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper shows that the fundamental elements of deep learning—gradient descent and backpropagation—can be conceptualized categorically as a strong monoidal functor from the category of parameterized Euclidean spaces to the category of learners. The category of learners was developed explicitly to capture parameter update and backpropagation. It was then realized that the category of learners is isomorphic to the Para construction applied to the category of simple lenses used in functional programming. Simple lenses are shown to be a full subcategory of polynomial functors, allowing learners to be recast as coalgebras on internal hom objects. This perspective generalizes the construction in the category of learners, and allows dynamical systems to be expressed in terms of generalized Moore machines with interfaces given by internal hom polynomials. Finally, since the category of coalgebras on any polynomial forms a topos, logical propositions constraining learner behavior can be expressed in the internal language. Overall, the paper provides an elegant categorical framework for specifying, composing, and constraining learning algorithms and dynamical systems more broadly.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper "Learners' Languages":

The paper observes that the category of learners developed in "Backprop as functor" to conceptualize deep learning is isomorphic to the Para construction applied to the category of symmetric lenses. Using the fact that the category of polynomial functors is symmetric monoidal closed, the paper shows that morphisms in the category of learners can be interpreted as coalgebras on internal hom objects, which have a natural dynamical systems interpretation. The paper then leverages the fact that the category of coalgebras for any polynomial functor forms a topos, whose internal language allows expressing logical propositions about dynamical systems and learning algorithms. As an example, the proposition "I will follow the gradient descent algorithm" can be formulated in this internal language. The paper concludes by outlining future research directions, including developing richer languages tailored to these topos logics and understanding modalities between them.
