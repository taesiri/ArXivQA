# [Is Disentanglement all you need? Comparing Concept-based &amp;   Disentanglement Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06917)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question seems to be:How do concept-based explanation methods compare to disentanglement learning approaches in terms of their ability to extract human-interpretable representations from models?The authors aim to provide a systematic comparison between these two types of methods - concept-based explanations and disentanglement learning - in terms of their limitations and trade-offs. The central hypothesis appears to be that both of these approaches have important shortcomings in terms of data efficiency, sensitivity to the task, and sensitivity to concept representations. The experiments seem designed to highlight and test these potential limitations across different datasets and tasks.In summary, the key research question is about directly comparing concept-based vs disentanglement methods for extracting interpretable representations, in order to understand their relative strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs. The central hypothesis is that both exhibit important limitations that should be considered when applying and improving such techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Presenting a comprehensive library implementing a range of state-of-the-art concept-based explanation and disentanglement learning approaches. This provides a unified codebase for researchers to compare and evaluate different methods.- Systematically comparing concept-based and disentanglement approaches across a variety of tasks and datasets. This highlights the limitations and trade-offs of these methods with regards to properties like data efficiency, concept-task dependence, and concept variance. - Demonstrating that state-of-the-art approaches from both concept-based and disentanglement learning can exhibit issues like data inefficiency, sensitivity to the task, or sensitivity to concept representations. The results show the underlying assumptions and potential causes of failure.- Arguing that concepts are a type of interpretable factor of variation and that disentanglement learning is trying to find similar representations, though the two fields have rarely been considered together. The work aims to bridge these areas.- Providing experimental setups and benchmarks focused on limitations of current methods as a foundation to drive future research on improving concept-based explanations and disentanglement learning.In summary, the key contribution appears to be systematically comparing leading concept-based and disentanglement approaches, highlighting their limitations, arguing for synergies between the fields, and laying groundwork to address the shortcomings. The library and experiments support this goal and aim to advance research in interpretable and explainable AI.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents an interesting comparison between concept-based explanations and disentanglement learning approaches for extracting interpretable representations from neural networks. Here are some key ways it relates to other work in this field:- It provides one of the first direct comparisons between these two types of methods, which have largely been studied separately before. Concept-based explanations focus on identifying human-interpretable features that are relevant for a model's predictions, while disentanglement aims to find latent factors of variation that generated the data. The paper highlights their overlapping goals.- Most prior work on concept-based explanations relies on having ground truth human annotations of concepts during training. This paper analyzes the data efficiency and sensitivity to annotations of these methods compared to weakly supervised disentanglement learning approaches.- It implements several state-of-the-art techniques from each category and benchmarks them across tasks and datasets to compare their limitations. The library of implementations will be a useful resource for future research. - The analysis of how concept predictive performance changes over training provides new insights into the tendency of current disentanglement methods to focus on "louder" concepts. - The results demonstrate some key challenges faced by both types of methods, like data inefficiency for supervised methods and sensitivity to the chosen end task. This points to areas for improvement in future work.Overall, by systematically comparing two previously disparate lines of research on interpretable representations, this paper makes an important contribution to understanding their relative merits and limitations. The analysis and benchmark library will likely catalyze more work combining these approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more data-efficient concept learning methods that require less labeled concept data during training. The authors point out that current concept-based models like CBMs require a large amount of labeled concept data which may be expensive or infeasible to obtain in many real-world settings. - Exploring ways to make concept-based approaches less sensitive to the specific task being solved. The authors show that methods like CME rely heavily on the hidden space learned for a particular task, making the extracted concepts dependent on that task. More task-agnostic concept learning is needed.- Addressing concept imbalance issues in disentanglement learning. The authors demonstrate that the standard VAE objective has an implicit bias towards high-variance "loud" concepts like color. Methods that can balance learning of both high and low-variance concepts are important.- Developing unsupervised or self-supervised concept learning methods that do not rely on explicit concept annotations. The authors note that labeling concepts for supervision can be challenging and limiting in practice.- Exploring completeness issues in concept learning - ensuring models utilize all relevant concepts rather than just a subset. The authors suggest future work should move beyond qualitative evaluation to quantify concept completeness.- Combining the strengths of concept-based and disentanglement learning in a hybrid approach. The authors argue these two areas have significant overlap in goals and methodology that could be leveraged.- Creating better benchmark tasks and standardized evaluation protocols for concept learning. The authors provide a library and set of experiments as a starting point for reproducible benchmarking.In summary, the key suggestions are developing more data-efficient, task-agnostic, and unsupervised concept learning methods, addressing concept imbalance issues, evaluating concept completeness, and combining disentanglement with concept-based learning. More rigorous benchmarking is also needed.
