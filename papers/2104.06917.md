# [Is Disentanglement all you need? Comparing Concept-based &amp;   Disentanglement Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06917)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question seems to be:How do concept-based explanation methods compare to disentanglement learning approaches in terms of their ability to extract human-interpretable representations from models?The authors aim to provide a systematic comparison between these two types of methods - concept-based explanations and disentanglement learning - in terms of their limitations and trade-offs. The central hypothesis appears to be that both of these approaches have important shortcomings in terms of data efficiency, sensitivity to the task, and sensitivity to concept representations. The experiments seem designed to highlight and test these potential limitations across different datasets and tasks.In summary, the key research question is about directly comparing concept-based vs disentanglement methods for extracting interpretable representations, in order to understand their relative strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs. The central hypothesis is that both exhibit important limitations that should be considered when applying and improving such techniques.
