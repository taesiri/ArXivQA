# [Visual Recognition by Request](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14227)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is how to push visual recognition towards unlimited granularity. The key ideas proposed are:

- Decomposing visual recognition into atomic tasks called "requests" to allow variable recognition granularity. There are two types of requests: whole-to-part semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

- Using a hierarchical, text-based knowledge base to define the visual concepts and their relationships. This allows for open-domain recognition. 

- Learning from highly incomplete annotations by only requiring annotations when requested. This alleviates the conflict between annotation granularity and certainty.

- Allowing easy insertion of new concepts into the knowledge base with minimal annotation effort, thanks to the text-based knowledge representation and data versioning.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that the proposed "visual recognition by request" paradigm along with the knowledge base representation and incomplete annotation learning can push visual recognition closer to unlimited granularity like humans. The experiments on CPP and ADE20K datasets aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the novel paradigm of "visual recognition by request" (ViRReq). It aims to address the issue of unlimited granularity in visual recognition, which refers to humans' ability to recognize visual contents at arbitrarily fine levels of detail. 

The key ideas of ViRReq are:

- Decomposing visual recognition into atomic tasks called "requests". There are two types of requests: whole-to-part semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

- Using a hierarchical, text-based "knowledge base" to guide the definition of requests and assist recognition. 

- Allowing flexible control over recognition granularity by making annotations and predictions only when requested. This helps deal with the tradeoff between granularity and annotation certainty.

The paper establishes a baseline by integrating language-driven recognition into semantic/instance segmentation methods. It demonstrates ViRReq's abilities on two datasets with hierarchical part annotations:

- Learning complex whole-part hierarchies from highly incomplete annotations.

- Inserting new concepts with minimal labeling efforts, thanks to the text-based knowledge base.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the ViRReq paradigm to make progress towards unlimited visual recognition granularity. The paper provides both methodology and baseline experiments around this idea.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this CVPR 2023 paper on Visual Recognition by Request (ViRReq) compares to other research in visual recognition:

- The key novelty is the idea of breaking down visual recognition into atomic "requests" rather than tackling the full task at once. This allows more flexible control over the recognition granularity. Other research typically frames recognition as an end-to-end task.

- ViRReq relies on a text-based knowledge graph to define concepts and relationships. Using language embeddings brings more flexibility for open-domain recognition. Other works like CLIP have shown benefits of vision-language models, but not for detailed segmentation.

- The method is designed to handle recognition of complex hierarchical relationships and incremental addition of new concepts. This could be advantageous compared to models that rely on a fixed ontology. However, it's not directly compared to other few-shot learning methods.

- The core technical approach builds on existing segmentation models like SegFormer and CondInst. So the advances are more in the problem formulation and overall framework design rather than radical changes to the underlying vision techniques.

- Quantitative results on CPP and ADE20K datasets demonstrate ViRReq can perform part-aware segmentation, which other methods have struggled with. But the focus seems to be more on enabling capabilities than pushing state-of-the-art on fully annotated datasets.

- For high-level scene understanding, ViRReq may lack global context compared to methods that take a more holistic view of the image. The atomic requests could become limiting in complex cases.

Overall, I would say ViRReq introduces some interesting ideas for flexible and granular recognition. The results look promising but further comparisons to existing few-shot and incremental learning techniques could better highlight the advantages. The big picture impact likely depends on uptake of the new problem formulation and dataset annotation paradigms.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new visual recognition paradigm called Visual Recognition by Request (ViRReq) that decomposes visual recognition into atomic tasks called requests, guided by a hierarchical knowledge base, to enable learning from incomplete annotations and flexible insertion of new concepts.
