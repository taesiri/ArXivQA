# [Visual Recognition by Request](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14227)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is how to push visual recognition towards unlimited granularity. The key ideas proposed are:

- Decomposing visual recognition into atomic tasks called "requests" to allow variable recognition granularity. There are two types of requests: whole-to-part semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

- Using a hierarchical, text-based knowledge base to define the visual concepts and their relationships. This allows for open-domain recognition. 

- Learning from highly incomplete annotations by only requiring annotations when requested. This alleviates the conflict between annotation granularity and certainty.

- Allowing easy insertion of new concepts into the knowledge base with minimal annotation effort, thanks to the text-based knowledge representation and data versioning.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that the proposed "visual recognition by request" paradigm along with the knowledge base representation and incomplete annotation learning can push visual recognition closer to unlimited granularity like humans. The experiments on CPP and ADE20K datasets aim to validate this hypothesis.
