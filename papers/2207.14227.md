# [Visual Recognition by Request](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14227)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is how to push visual recognition towards unlimited granularity. The key ideas proposed are:

- Decomposing visual recognition into atomic tasks called "requests" to allow variable recognition granularity. There are two types of requests: whole-to-part semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

- Using a hierarchical, text-based knowledge base to define the visual concepts and their relationships. This allows for open-domain recognition. 

- Learning from highly incomplete annotations by only requiring annotations when requested. This alleviates the conflict between annotation granularity and certainty.

- Allowing easy insertion of new concepts into the knowledge base with minimal annotation effort, thanks to the text-based knowledge representation and data versioning.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that the proposed "visual recognition by request" paradigm along with the knowledge base representation and incomplete annotation learning can push visual recognition closer to unlimited granularity like humans. The experiments on CPP and ADE20K datasets aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the novel paradigm of "visual recognition by request" (ViRReq). It aims to address the issue of unlimited granularity in visual recognition, which refers to humans' ability to recognize visual contents at arbitrarily fine levels of detail. 

The key ideas of ViRReq are:

- Decomposing visual recognition into atomic tasks called "requests". There are two types of requests: whole-to-part semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

- Using a hierarchical, text-based "knowledge base" to guide the definition of requests and assist recognition. 

- Allowing flexible control over recognition granularity by making annotations and predictions only when requested. This helps deal with the tradeoff between granularity and annotation certainty.

The paper establishes a baseline by integrating language-driven recognition into semantic/instance segmentation methods. It demonstrates ViRReq's abilities on two datasets with hierarchical part annotations:

- Learning complex whole-part hierarchies from highly incomplete annotations.

- Inserting new concepts with minimal labeling efforts, thanks to the text-based knowledge base.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the ViRReq paradigm to make progress towards unlimited visual recognition granularity. The paper provides both methodology and baseline experiments around this idea.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this CVPR 2023 paper on Visual Recognition by Request (ViRReq) compares to other research in visual recognition:

- The key novelty is the idea of breaking down visual recognition into atomic "requests" rather than tackling the full task at once. This allows more flexible control over the recognition granularity. Other research typically frames recognition as an end-to-end task.

- ViRReq relies on a text-based knowledge graph to define concepts and relationships. Using language embeddings brings more flexibility for open-domain recognition. Other works like CLIP have shown benefits of vision-language models, but not for detailed segmentation.

- The method is designed to handle recognition of complex hierarchical relationships and incremental addition of new concepts. This could be advantageous compared to models that rely on a fixed ontology. However, it's not directly compared to other few-shot learning methods.

- The core technical approach builds on existing segmentation models like SegFormer and CondInst. So the advances are more in the problem formulation and overall framework design rather than radical changes to the underlying vision techniques.

- Quantitative results on CPP and ADE20K datasets demonstrate ViRReq can perform part-aware segmentation, which other methods have struggled with. But the focus seems to be more on enabling capabilities than pushing state-of-the-art on fully annotated datasets.

- For high-level scene understanding, ViRReq may lack global context compared to methods that take a more holistic view of the image. The atomic requests could become limiting in complex cases.

Overall, I would say ViRReq introduces some interesting ideas for flexible and granular recognition. The results look promising but further comparisons to existing few-shot and incremental learning techniques could better highlight the advantages. The big picture impact likely depends on uptake of the new problem formulation and dataset annotation paradigms.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new visual recognition paradigm called Visual Recognition by Request (ViRReq) that decomposes visual recognition into atomic tasks called requests, guided by a hierarchical knowledge base, to enable learning from incomplete annotations and flexible insertion of new concepts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Designing an automatic method for learning and updating the knowledge base from training data. The current approach relies on a predefined hierarchical knowledge base, but the authors suggest exploring ways to automatically build and update this knowledge from the visual data.

- Closing the gap between upstream pre-training and downstream fine-tuning with better prompts. The current approach uses simple class name prompts, but more sophisticated prompt design could help align the pre-trained model better to downstream tasks. 

- Unifying various visual recognition tasks using the recognition by request paradigm. The current work focuses on segmentation, but the authors suggest this paradigm could be helpful for other recognition tasks like detection, keypoint estimation, etc.

- Exploring the possibility of unlimited granularity for other modalities beyond vision, such as audio recognition. 

- Developing interactive annotation interfaces based on the request-based recognition framework. This could improve annotation efficiency.

- Studying social impacts and ethical issues related to fine-grained visual recognition abilities. As recognition becomes more detailed, privacy concerns may arise.

In summary, the key future directions are developing automated knowledge base learning, improved prompt design, unifying diverse recognition tasks, extending to other modalities, building interactive interfaces, and investigating social/ethical impacts. The overall goal is pushing visual recognition to unlimited granularity.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new paradigm called visual recognition by request (ViRReq) to enable more flexible and granular visual recognition compared to existing methods. The key idea is to decompose visual recognition into atomic tasks called requests, and use a knowledge base to define the requests and assist recognition. There are two types of requests: whole-to-part semantic segmentation to decompose an instance into semantic parts, and instance segmentation to segment an instance from a semantic region. ViRReq allows learning complex whole-part hierarchies from incomplete annotations, and easily inserting new concepts by updating the knowledge base. The authors present a baseline method that performs language-driven recognition by extracting visual features, generating text embeddings for the requests, and interacting the two representations. Experiments on the CPP and ADE20K datasets demonstrate ViRReq's abilities in part-aware segmentation, learning from incomplete data, and adapting to new concepts with few examples. The work establishes a new direction of vision systems that understand visual semantics in an unlimited granularity.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper "Visual Recognition by Request":

The paper introduces a new paradigm called "visual recognition by request" (ViRReq) to push visual recognition towards unlimited granularity. The key idea is to decompose visual recognition into atomic tasks called "requests" that are guided by a hierarchical, text-based knowledge base. There are two types of requests: 1) whole-to-part semantic segmentation, which decomposes an instance into semantic parts using the knowledge base, and 2) instance segmentation, which segments an instance from a semantic region given a probe pixel. ViRReq allows for learning complex whole-part hierarchies from highly incomplete annotations, and easily inserting new concepts by updating the knowledge base. 

The authors build a baseline by integrating language-driven recognition into recent segmentation models. They evaluate ViRReq on the CPP dataset, which extends Cityscapes with part annotations, and the ADE20K dataset with hierarchical whole-part labels. Results show ViRReq can handle incomplete part annotations in ADE20K, achieving part-aware segmentation for the first time. It also shows promising open-domain recognition, including few-shot learning of new concepts and understanding anomalous/compositional concepts without training data. Overall, ViRReq offers a new direction to advance visual recognition towards unlimited granularity.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new visual recognition paradigm called Visual Recognition by Request (ViRReq). The key idea is to break down the complex visual recognition task into atomic units called requests. There are two types of requests:

1. Whole-to-part semantic segmentation: Given an instance, segment it into semantic parts based on the part-of hierarchy defined in a knowledge base. 

2. Instance segmentation: Given a probing pixel in a semantic region, segment out the instance containing that pixel.

The method leverages a knowledge base, which is a hierarchical text-based dictionary, to guide the decomposition into requests and assist in task definition. The recognition algorithm extracts visual features, constructs textual queries from requests and knowledge base, and performs vision-language interaction to fulfill the requests. 

The approach allows learning complex whole-part hierarchies from highly incomplete annotations and easily inserting new concepts by updating the knowledge base. Experiments on CPP and ADE20K datasets demonstrate flexible recognition of objects, parts, and compositional concepts. Key advantages are learning from incomplete supervision and adapting to new visual concepts.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of limited granularity in current visual recognition systems. The key issues raised are:

- Existing systems have limited ability to recognize fine-grained visual contents compared to humans, who can recognize arbitrary details in an image. Current systems are constrained by the fixed vocabularies and annotation granularities of datasets. 

- There is a conflict between annotation granularity and certainty. As annotation granularity becomes finer, there is greater uncertainty in labeling object boundaries and semantic classes accurately.

- Current systems lack the flexibility to recognize visual concepts at variable levels of granularity depending on factors like object size, resolution, importance, etc.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a new "visual recognition by request" paradigm where recognition is performed in a step-wise manner by decomposing into atomic "requests". This allows controlling the recognition granularity and learning from incomplete annotations. The key ideas are:

- Using a hierarchical, text-based knowledge base to define concepts and part-whole relationships. This enables open-domain recognition.

- Decomposing recognition into sequential Type-I (whole-to-part segmentation) and Type-II (instance segmentation) requests guided by the knowledge base.

- Learning from incomplete annotations by ignoring uncertain segments and handling each request independently.

- Adding new concepts by simply updating the knowledge base with minimal new training data.

So in summary, the paper aims to push visual recognition to unlimited granularity by making it more flexible, learnable from incomplete data, and extensible to new concepts. The core proposal is the "recognition by request" paradigm.
