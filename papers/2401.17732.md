# [High-performance Racing on Unmapped Tracks using Local Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17732)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Map-based methods for autonomous racing require pre-built maps of the environment and localization, limiting them to mapped contexts. 
- Mapless methods like end-to-end learning and reactive algorithms achieve poor performance without optimization.
- The problem is enabling high-performance autonomous racing in unmapped environments without access to global maps.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a local map framework that uses the LiDAR scan to build a map of the visible region around the vehicle. 
- Extract the left and right track boundaries from the LiDAR points. Connect corresponding boundary points to generate line segments indicating the local track edges and direction. 
- Use the segments to calculate a centerline and track width representation that serves as the local map.
- Optimize trajectories over this local map using model predictive control or a two-stage optimizer with a lower-level tracking controller.

Main Contributions:
- Method to extract a local map of the visible track boundaries from a LiDAR scan
- Integration of the local map into optimization-based planners like MPC and two-stage optimization
- Demonstrated local map lengths of around 11m are reliably extracted on different tracks 
- Local map optimizer achieves 8.8% faster laps than mapless Follow-The-Gap method and 3.22% faster than end-to-end learning
- Local method is only 3.28% slower than global optimization with full track access, enabling high performance without global maps

Key outcome is enabling high-speed optimized racing on unknown tracks by building local maps, removing the need for global mappings or localization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a local map framework that uses low-level features extracted from sensor data to build representations of the visible environment that enable optimization-based planning and control for high-performance autonomous racing in unmapped contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the local map framework that uses easily extractable, low-level features from sensor data (like LiDAR scans) to build local maps of the visible region. These local maps are then used as input to optimization-based controllers for high-performance autonomous racing on unmapped tracks. Specifically:

- They present a method to extract a local map (visible track boundaries, centerline, track widths) from a LiDAR scan that can robustly represent the visible track over a whole lap.

- They show this local map can be used as input to trajectory optimization planners like a two-stage method and Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC) to achieve fast lap times. 

- Their local map planner outperforms prior mapless methods like end-to-end learning and Follow-The-Gap by 3-9% in lap times, reaching performance close to global methods that require a full track map.

- This enables high-speed racing performance in unmapped environments where global maps and localization are not available, removing this key limitation of prior work.

In summary, the local map framework contributes a way to use low-level spatial representations to achieve optimization-based control for high-speed racing without needing global maps, representing the key novelty.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the local map racing method proposed in the paper:

1. The local map extraction algorithm assumes the track boundaries are parallel in the sections where only one boundary is visible. How could this assumption be relaxed to handle tracks with more variability in width?

2. The paper mentions using local map fusion after completing a lap to build a global map. What SLAM techniques could be used to fuse the local maps and estimate the vehicle pose difference between them?

3. The local maps are generated from LiDAR scans. How could the method be adapted to use camera images, such as by detecting edges? What challenges would image-based local map generation introduce?

4. The paper compares the local map method against end-to-end learning methods which had jerky trajectories. Could the local maps be used along with end-to-end learning to encourage smoother actions? 

5. What explanations are there for the local map planner achieving similar performance to global methods besides the mentioned conservative trajectory around corners?

6. How was the maximum track width hyperparameter tuned? Could an adaptive method adjust this over time?

7. The local map length plot showed downward slopes when turning corners. What causes this effect and how could map extraction be improved to avoid it?

8. For safe reinforcement learning, how should the kernel of safe states be defined online using local maps compared to global map methods?

9. The paper suggests local map fusion for SLAM after completing a lap. How could the pose graph SLAM problem be solved online during the lap?

10. Model predictive control exceeded real-time computational constraints. What code optimisations or model simplifications could enable real-time performance?
