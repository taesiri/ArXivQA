# [A Type Theory for Probabilistic and Bayesian Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09230)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How to develop a type theory and associated logic that can serve as a foundation for probabilistic and Bayesian reasoning?The key components of the proposed approach include:- A quantitative logic with fuzzy predicates that take values in the interval [0,1] instead of just {0,1}. This allows predicates to represent probabilities.- The logic forms an "effect module" which has some similarities with Boolean algebras but also key differences like a partial sum operation.- The type theory includes operations for normalization and conditioning of probability distributions, which is crucial for Bayesian inference. - There is a close connection between predicates and "instrument" maps, which allows conditioning to be defined via assert maps and normalization. This is a key property that distinguishes the probabilistic setting from the quantum setting.- The computation rules of the type theory are designed to allow calculations like conditioning and marginalization to be carried out, as demonstrated on some examples.So in summary, the main research goal is to develop a type theory tailored for probabilistic reasoning that supports operations and a logic needed for applications like Bayesian inference, while keeping connections to the underlying mathematical models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces a new type theory and logic for probabilistic reasoning, called COMET (COMmutative Effectus Theory). The key features of COMET include:- It has a quantitative logic, with fuzzy predicates that take values in the interval [0,1] instead of just {0,1}. - It includes normalisation and conditioning operations, allowing probabilities to be normalised and conditional probabilities to be calculated.- It has a key distinction from quantum type theory in that there is a bijective correspondence between predicates and side-effect free "instrument" operations. This allows suitable computation rules for conditional probability to be derived.2. It shows how probabilistic graphical models and Bayesian inference computations can be formalized directly in the type theory syntax, and computations carried out using the deduction rules. This is illustrated via two examples.3. It provides a semantics for the type theory using both discrete and continuous probability distributions. Thus the type theory can serve as a internal language for reasoning about both discrete and continuous probabilistic computation.4. It sketches how the type theory can be interpreted in categorical models called "commutative effectuses", providing a solid mathematical foundation.In summary, the paper introduces a principled type-theoretic foundation for probabilistic computation and reasoning, which can support mechanized probabilistic inference. The examples show how it enables Bayesian computations to be carried out formally within the deductive system.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper introduces a novel type theory and logic for probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian inference that includes quantitative fuzzy predicates, normalization and conditioning of states via assertion maps, and allows conditional probabilities to be calculated through derived computation rules.
