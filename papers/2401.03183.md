# [δ-CAUSAL: Exploring Defeasibility in Causal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03183)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Causal reasoning is important for decision-making, but often involves uncertainty and defeasibility where supplementary information can strengthen or weaken causal relationships. 
- Existing benchmarks and metrics fail to address causal defeasibility, lacking supporters/defeaters and unable to quantify causal strength changes from them.
- Large language models also struggle in generating accurate supporters/defeaters.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce δ-Causal, the first benchmark for defeasible causal reasoning, with 11K events across 10 domains. Each instance has a cause-effect pair and accompanying supporter (strengthens causality) and defeater (weakens causality).

- Propose CESAR causal strength metric that uses causal embeddings and attention to quantify token-level causal associations. Outperforms metrics like ROCK and CEQ in capturing impacts of supporters/defeaters on causal strength.

Main Contributions:
- δ-Causal benchmark to enable advancing causal reasoning research into defeasible settings with supporters and defeaters
- Demonstrate limitations of current metrics and models on δ-Causal through new task formulations 
- CESAR metric that greatly improves evaluating causal strength changes from supplementary information
- Analysis showing even large models like GPT-3.5 underperform humans on δ-Causal by 4.5 and 10.7 points for supporters and defeaters

The paper makes defeasible causal reasoning accessible, provides the means to develop more robust systems through the benchmark and metric, and sets the stage to further explore uncertainty in causal relationships.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset for studying defeasibility in causal reasoning, shows limitations of current causal strength metrics, proposes a new robust causal strength metric called CESAR, and demonstrates that even large language models like GPT-3.5 still lag behind humans in generating accurate supporters and defeaters for causal relationships.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors contribute \shorttitle, the first benchmark dataset that emphasizes the often overlooked aspect of causal reasoning: defeasibility. This dataset paves the road to systematically exploring defeasibility in causal reasoning.

2. \shorttitle serves as a valuable yardstick for evaluating existing metrics on causal strength in defeasible settings. The paper highlights the limitations of current causal strength metrics in capturing the changes in causal strength resulting from supporters and defeaters.

3. The authors propose CESAR, a robust and versatile metric for measuring causal strength. CESAR outperforms existing metrics significantly, exhibiting a remarkable 69.7% improvement in capturing the changes of causal strength brought by supporters and defeaters. 

4. Using \shorttitle, the authors assess the ability of existing large language models (LLMs) to comprehend defeasibility in causal reasoning. The results show that even advanced models like GPT-3.5 still fall behind humans significantly in tasks like generating accurate supporters and defeaters. This underscores the significant challenges posed by \shorttitle.

In summary, the main contribution is the creation of a new benchmark dataset, metric, and experiments that systematically analyze the important but understudied aspect of defeasibility in causal reasoning. The paper makes both dataset and algorithmic contributions to advancing research in this area.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Defeasible causal reasoning - The paper introduces the concept of defeasibility in causal reasoning, referring to situations where the causal relationship between cause and effect can be strengthened or weakened by additional information.

- Supporters and defeaters - The paper discusses supporters, which are arguments that reinforce the causal relationship, and defeaters, which are arguments that undermine the causal relationship.

- Causal strength - A key focus of the paper is quantifying and evaluating causal strength between events and how it changes with supporters and defeaters. 

- Benchmark dataset - The paper introduces \shorttitle, a new benchmark dataset for studying defeasibility in causal reasoning, containing around 11K annotated event pairs.

- Evaluation metrics - The paper assesses limitations of existing causal strength metrics like CEQ and ROCK in capturing changes from supporters/defeaters, and proposes a new metric called CESAR.

- Language model evaluation - Experiments are conducted evaluating how well current language models like GPT-3.5 perform at generating accurate supporters and defeaters compared to humans.

Some other notable concepts are the concatenation operation for combining arguments, ablation studies of the CESAR metric, analysis of attention mechanisms and token embeddings, etc. But the terms above seem to be the most central to the key focus and contributions of this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new metric called CESAR for measuring causal strength. How does CESAR compute attention scores for token pairs in the cause and effect events? What is the motivation behind using attention for this task?

2. The paper shows that existing metrics like CEQ and ROCK perform poorly on the proposed \shorttitle benchmark dataset in terms of capturing changes in causal strength from supporters/defeaters. What are some reasons why these metrics fail on this dataset? 

3. The training procedure for CESAR uses augmented data from the e-CARE dataset. What types of augmented data samples are created and what causal strength labels are assigned to them? How does this augmented data help CESAR better model defeasible causal reasoning?

4. What is the formulation used in CESAR to compute the final causal strength score between a cause event C and effect event E? Explain the intuition behind averaging the normalized causal associations between token pairs weighted by attention scores.  

5. The ablation study in Table 5 shows that removing causal-aware attention significantly hurts defeater accuracy. Why does the attention mechanism play an important role specifically for modeling the impact of defeaters?

6. One limitation mentioned is that \shorttitle currently does not quantify the magnitude of causal strength changes from supporters/defeaters. What are some ideas proposed to address this limitation in future work?

7. The CTCW metric leverages the probability predictions of temporal and causal terms from language models like ChatGPT. What are some challenges and limitations faced when using CTCW for evaluating causal strength?

8. How does the paper formulate the concatenation operation between the cause C and supporter/defeater A/D when evaluating causal strength changes? Why is the formulation important?

9. The expert evaluation results in Table 3 show significant gaps between human performance and GPT-3.5 on generating supporters/defeaters. What aspects of the task make it difficult even for large language models? 

10. CESAR and CTCW take quite different approaches to modeling causal strength - one based on fine-tuned neural representations and attention, while the other based on contrastive language model predictions. What are the tradeoffs between these two types of approaches? When might one be preferred over the other?
