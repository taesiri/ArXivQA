## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "UniCode: Learning a Unified Codebook for Multimodal Large Language Models":

Problem:
Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely on a text-only codebook, which limits their ability to generate images and other non-linguistic content. Expanding the codebook is challenging as it increases model size and risks "codebook collapse". 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes UniCode, the first MLLM with a unified codebook capable of tokenizing text, images, and other modalities. Key aspects:

1) Language-driven iterative training paradigm that aligns a visual tokenizer's codebook with the LLM's codebook without needing extra parameters. This uses exponential moving average to smoothly update the visual codebook.

2) In-context image decompression pre-training task that takes compressed image data as input and transforms it into discrete visual tokens, improving image generation.

3) Compatibility with stacked quantization methods like hierarchical quantization to efficiently compress images into compact token representations.

Main Contributions:

- First unified codebook for an MLLM that can tokenize and generate text, images and other modalities without requiring extra parameters or modules.

- Language-driven iterative training approach to synchronize textual and visual codebooks.

- Novel image decompression pre-training task to enhance visual generation capabilities.

- Demonstrated strong performance on understanding (VQA) and generation benchmarks, using far fewer parameters and less data than comparable MLLMs.

In summary, UniCode pioneers a unified codebook approach for multimodal generation in large language models, enabled by specialized training techniques. Experiments validate effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art.
