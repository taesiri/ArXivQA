# [Low-Rank Gradient Compression with Error Feedback for MIMO Wireless   Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07496)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper addresses the high communication overhead challenge in federated learning (FL), especially for wireless systems with multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) communications. In FL, edge devices collaboratively train a global model by exchanging model updates with an edge server. However, transmitting high-dimensional model updates introduces significant communication overhead. This problem becomes more critical in wireless MIMO networks with limited shared radio resources. Existing gradient compression methods like quantization, sparsification and low-rank approximation help reduce the overhead, but have limitations when applied to wireless MIMO FL systems.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new method called over-the-air low-rank compression (Ota-LC) to enhance communication efficiency of MIMO wireless FL systems. The key ideas are:
1) Use low-rank matrix factorization to compress local gradients at each device. This is done via decentralized alternating least squares.
2) Exploit temporal correlation in gradients across iterations to improve factorization.
3) Adopt analog transmission and over-the-air computation at the edge server to combine compressed factors from devices.
4) Introduce error feedback to reduce impact of compression errors on model convergence.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes Ota-LC method that integrates low-rank factorization, over-the-air computation and error feedback for efficient wireless MIMO FL.
2) Analyzes communication cost: Ota-LC reduces overhead from O(nm) to O(nr+mr) where r is low rank. 
3) Analyzes computation cost: Ota-LC reduces complexity order by a factor equal to sum of gradient dimensions.
4) Empirically demonstrates Ota-LC has lower communication overhead and faster convergence than benchmarks in wireless MIMO FL experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in developing communication-efficient and fast-converging solutions tailored to wireless MIMO FL systems. The integration of low-rank factorization, over-the-air computation and error feedback differentiates Ota-LC from prior arts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a low-rank gradient compression and transmission method called Ota-LC that reduces communication overhead for MIMO wireless federated learning by factorizing local gradients using decentralized alternating least squares with error feedback and exploiting over-the-air computation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel gradient compression and transmission method called Ota-LC (over-the-air low-rank compression) to reduce the communication overhead for MIMO wireless federated learning systems. Specifically, Ota-LC has the following key properties:

1) It applies a low-rank matrix factorization strategy to compress the high-dimensional local gradients at each device. This is done via a decentralized alternating least squares approach that exploits temporal correlation and uses error feedback. 

2) It leverages analog over-the-air computation at the edge server to efficiently aggregate the compressed local gradients. 

3) Experiments demonstrate that Ota-LC converges faster and achieves better accuracy than existing gradient compression methods for wireless federated learning, while having lower communication and computational overhead.

In summary, Ota-LC is a communication-efficient framework for wireless federated learning that jointly optimizes gradient compression and over-the-air transmission. The core ideas are low-rank factorization for compression and analog aggregation for efficient wireless transmission.
