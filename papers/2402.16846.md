# [GROUNDHOG: Grounding Large Language Models to Holistic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16846)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically ground language tokens by appending sequences of location tokens through casual language modeling. However, this approach is insufficient for achieving pixel-level visual comprehension required in various grounding scenarios. It also lacks the ability to diagnose failure cases when the model incorrectly grounds phrases.  

Proposed Solution:  
This paper proposes Groundhog, an MLLM developed by grounding language models to holistic segmentation. It incorporates a pre-trained mask proposal network to provide pixel-level entity features to the language model. Groundhog connects groundable phrases to unified grounding masks by retrieving and merging mask proposals from the vision module. This allows superior vision-language alignment at the pixel level.

The system has a decoupled design with separate visual entity proposal and language grounding components. This brings interpretability regarding which component caused the failure and supports spatial prompts as inputs. The mask proposal network is enhanced to detect multi-granularity segments, including instances, stuff, object parts, and text.

To train Groundhog, the authors introduce a large-scale dataset called M3G2, consisting of 2.5M grounded vision-language pairs derived from 27 existing datasets. The data encompasses diverse tasks like grounded captioning, segmentation, VQA and dialogue.


Main Contributions:
- Groundhog model that enables pixel-level grounding of language in large LMs through holistic segmentation
- Decoupled framework supporting spatial prompts and providing interpretability  
- Upgraded mask proposal network for multi-granularity segment coverage
- M3G2 dataset with 2.5M grounded vision-language pairs for model pre-training

Experiments show Groundhog achieves strong performance on various grounding tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. It also reduces object hallucination and provides transparency about failures. The model handles complex visual inputs better than box-based grounding approaches.
