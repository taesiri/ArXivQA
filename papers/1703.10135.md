# [Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis system that can be trained completely from scratch on text-audio pairs with minimal feature engineering. Specifically, the authors propose Tacotron, an end-to-end generative model for text-to-speech that takes characters as input and outputs raw spectrogram. The key hypothesis is that an integrated end-to-end model can synthesize natural sounding speech directly from characters without the need for the complex components in traditional TTS pipelines.
