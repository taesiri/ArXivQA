# [Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis system that can be trained completely from scratch on text-audio pairs with minimal feature engineering. Specifically, the authors propose Tacotron, an end-to-end generative model for text-to-speech that takes characters as input and outputs raw spectrogram. The key hypothesis is that an integrated end-to-end model can synthesize natural sounding speech directly from characters without the need for the complex components in traditional TTS pipelines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model. Key points:

- Tacotron is an integrated end-to-end model that takes characters as input and outputs spectrograms, which are synthesized into speech. This eliminates the need for traditional complex TTS pipelines.

- The model is based on the sequence-to-sequence paradigm with attention, but makes several modifications like using a CBHG encoder and predicting multiple output frames per step. These allow it to work well with character inputs.

- Tacotron achieves a 3.82 MOS naturalness score on an English dataset, outperforming a production parametric system. This shows end-to-end TTS can match or surpass traditional systems. 

- The model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization, without the need for hand-engineered features or alignments. This makes it easy to train on large, found data.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an end-to-end sequence-to-sequence model for text-to-speech that matches traditional systems in quality while being much simpler. This could enable new applications and data sources for TTS.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

Tacotron is an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that takes characters as input and outputs spectrograms, then uses Griffin-Lim for waveform synthesis to achieve state-of-the-art speech naturalness.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this Tacotron paper compares to other TTS research:

- It proposes an end-to-end TTS system that goes directly from characters to spectrogram. This is a major advantage over traditional TTS systems and some other end-to-end works like DeepVoice that still have separate components.

- It does not require any hand-engineered features or alignments, unlike many other TTS systems. This makes it very data-driven.

- It significantly outperforms a production parametric TTS system in naturalness based on MOS evaluation. This shows its practical potential.

- It uses an attention-based seq2seq model. Attention had been used for TTS before, but Tacotron makes important modifications like predicting multiple frames to help attention learn alignment.

- It is not autoregressive like sample-level models such as WaveNet. This makes it much faster at inference time.

- It still requires a vocoder-like post-processing step to convert spectrogram to waveform, rather than directly outputting waveform samples like WaveNet. Later work has improved on this.

- It uses a simple Griffin-Lim reconstruction for waveform synthesis. This causes some artifacts. Later end-to-end models have focussed more on neural vocoders.

Overall, this paper moved the state-of-the-art forward significantly in end-to-end TTS with minimal hand-engineering. Subsequent work has built on Tacotron's seq2seq approach while improving waveform generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the output layer, attention module, loss function, and waveform synthesis module of Tacotron. The authors mention these aspects of their model are ripe for improvement.

- Developing a fast and high-quality neural network based spectrogram inversion method to replace Griffin-Lim. The authors mention Griffin-Lim can introduce audible artifacts.

- Investigating many other unexplored aspects of Tacotron, as many early design decisions have gone unchanged. This suggests room for optimization of the model architecture.

- Removing the need for simple text normalization by using recent advances in learned text normalization.

- Exploring conditioning the model on various attributes like speaker, language, sentiment etc. to make the model more versatile.

- Adapting the model to new data more easily since it is end-to-end.

- Training the model on more noisy and expressive real-world data since it is more robust as an end-to-end model.

- Replacing components like the post-processing network with alternatives like vocoders or WaveNet to improve synthesis.

So in summary, the main directions are improving the model components, making the model more versatile, training on more real-world data, and replacing modules with more advanced alternatives. The end-to-end nature provides many possibilities for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper "Tacotron: Towards End-To-End Speech Synthesis" presents Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model based on the sequence-to-sequence framework with attention. The model takes characters as input and outputs raw spectrogram frames, which are then synthesized into audio using the Griffin-Lim reconstruction algorithm. The encoder uses a CBHG module to extract robust sequential representations from text. The decoder uses attention to align the input and output sequences. Several techniques are introduced to make the vanilla sequence-to-sequence framework perform well for speech synthesis, such as predicting multiple output frames per decoder step, and using a post-processing network to improve the predicted spectrogram before waveform synthesis. Evaluations show Tacotron can be trained from scratch and achieves a 3.82 MOS score on an English dataset, outperforming a production parametric system. The model does not require hand-engineered features or components like an HMM aligner. The paper demonstrates promising results towards fully end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that can synthesize speech directly from characters. The model is based on the sequence-to-sequence framework with attention. It takes characters as input and outputs raw spectrogram frames, which are then fed to the Griffin-Lim algorithm to reconstruct the speech waveform. A key contribution of the paper is the use of several techniques to make the basic sequence-to-sequence model work well for text-to-speech synthesis. These include using a CBHG module to encode the character sequence into a robust representation, predicting multiple output frames at each decoder step, and adding a post-processing network to convert the target spectrogram from the decoder into a representation better suited for waveform synthesis. 

The authors trained and evaluated Tacotron on an English speech dataset. Without any hand-engineered features or complex pipeline components, it achieves a mean opinion score of 3.82 in terms of speech naturalness, surpassing a production parametric system. Tacotron represents an promising step towards fully end-to-end text-to-speech - it requires only character input and audio output pairs, and can be trained from scratch to synthesize natural sounding speech. The simple and integrated nature of the model could enable easier adaptation to new data and avoid compounding errors across multiple pipeline stages.
