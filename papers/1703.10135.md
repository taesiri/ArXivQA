# [Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis system that can be trained completely from scratch on text-audio pairs with minimal feature engineering. Specifically, the authors propose Tacotron, an end-to-end generative model for text-to-speech that takes characters as input and outputs raw spectrogram. The key hypothesis is that an integrated end-to-end model can synthesize natural sounding speech directly from characters without the need for the complex components in traditional TTS pipelines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model. Key points:

- Tacotron is an integrated end-to-end model that takes characters as input and outputs spectrograms, which are synthesized into speech. This eliminates the need for traditional complex TTS pipelines.

- The model is based on the sequence-to-sequence paradigm with attention, but makes several modifications like using a CBHG encoder and predicting multiple output frames per step. These allow it to work well with character inputs.

- Tacotron achieves a 3.82 MOS naturalness score on an English dataset, outperforming a production parametric system. This shows end-to-end TTS can match or surpass traditional systems. 

- The model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization, without the need for hand-engineered features or alignments. This makes it easy to train on large, found data.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an end-to-end sequence-to-sequence model for text-to-speech that matches traditional systems in quality while being much simpler. This could enable new applications and data sources for TTS.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

Tacotron is an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that takes characters as input and outputs spectrograms, then uses Griffin-Lim for waveform synthesis to achieve state-of-the-art speech naturalness.
