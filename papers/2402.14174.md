# [Blending Data-Driven Priors in Dynamic Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14174)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Integrating data-driven priors from human behavior models with game-theoretic planning for safe and interactive autonomous systems is an open challenge. Existing game-theoretic planners assume all agents behave optimally, but humans often deviate from such rational decisions. On the other hand, behavior cloning methods fail to ensure safety and optimality. There is a need for a principled approach to blend data-driven guidance with task-driven planning.

Proposed Solution: The paper introduces "KLGame", a new dynamic game formulation regularized by a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term that incentivizes players' strategies to stay close to a reference policy derived from data. The reference policy can capture common driving styles and interactive scenarios. A tuning parameter allows modulating between task-driven and data-driven behaviors. For linear systems, KLGame permits an analytical global feedback Nash equilibrium solution that generalizes prior game formulations. For nonlinear systems, an approximate equilibrium solving algorithm is proposed using Laplace approximations and scenario optimization.

Main Contributions:
1) KLGame provides a novel game-theoretic planning framework to incorporate multi-modal, stochastic reference policies from data-driven models like motion forecasting systems. This permits blending interactive, human-like priors for exploration.
2) An efficient algorithm is proposed to compute approximate feedback Nash equilibria for KLGame that scales to complex, nonlinear systems with non-convex costs.
3) Simulations and real self-driving datasets demonstrate KLGame's ability to leverage data-driven guidance for improved coordination and safety versus baselines in autonomous driving scenarios.

In summary, the paper makes a significant contribution towards integrating data-driven priors with formal game-theoretic planning, advancing technology for safe and interactive autonomous systems coexisting with humans. The proposed KLGame framework and algorithm provide a principled approach for policy blending in this context.
