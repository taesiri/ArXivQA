# [Rethinking Model Evaluation as Narrowing the Socio-Technical Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03100)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be: 

How can model evaluation practices be improved to better assess whether large language models (LLMs) can satisfy human needs in downstream applications?

The authors argue that the rise of large, versatile models like LLMs has created an "evaluation crisis", rendering traditional evaluation metrics inadequate. The paper proposes reframing model evaluation with the goal of narrowing the "socio-technical gap" between what models can do and what people need them to do when deployed in real-world contexts. 

Specifically, the authors draw lessons from human-computer interaction (HCI) and explainable AI (XAI) to argue for developing evaluation methods that:

1) Are grounded in studying real-world use cases and human requirements ("socio-requirements") in them 

2) Aim to be valid proxies for downstream socio-requirements while acknowledging tradeoffs with evaluation costs

The paper maps current NLG and HCI evaluation methods along dimensions of "context realism" and "human requirement realism" to identify opportunities for better LLM evaluation.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that model evaluation practices need to be rethought to assess how well LLMs can satisfy human needs in downstream applications, which requires evaluating them in light of real-world use cases and socio-requirements.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper argues that model evaluation practices should aim to narrow the socio-technical gap between what AI models can currently do and what people need them to do in real-world contexts, by developing methods grounded in studying downstream use cases and reflecting diverse aspects of socio-requirements while balancing pragmatic costs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of model evaluation:

- It takes a more human-centered perspective compared to much prior work on model evaluation that has focused on computational metrics like accuracy. The paper argues for evaluating models based on how well they satisfy human needs and values in real-world applications. This aligns with growing trends in human-AI interaction research.

- The concept of evaluating models by their ability to narrow the "socio-technical gap" seems novel. I'm not aware of other papers that have explicitly framed model evaluation this way. It connects well to ideas from social sciences and HCI.

- The analysis exploring different evaluation methods along the dimensions of context realism and human requirements realism provides a useful framework for thinking about tradeoffs in evaluation approaches. This kind of structured analysis and mapping of different methods is less common in the model evaluation literature.

- The paper covers a breadth of evaluation methods from human evaluation to benchmarks to simulated evaluation. It attempts to integrate perspectives from across HCI, XAI, and NLP evaluation. This scope stands out compared to prior work that has tended to focus on a narrower set of methods.

- The discussion of open questions and recommendations reflects a more holistic outlook than most model evaluation papers that just introduce a new technique. The emphasis on connecting methods, formalizing human-centered metrics, and defining use cases points toward important areas for future research.

Overall, I would say this paper provides a fairly unique perspective on model evaluation compared to related literature, especially with its human-centered framing, analysis of evaluation methods along key dimensions, and effort to synthesize diverse approaches. The open questions suggest it is intended to spur further research and discussion in this space.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions:

- Develop evaluation metrics and benchmarks focused on human-desirable constructs rather than just accuracy. This includes studying people's needs in downstream use cases to inform the development of metrics and benchmarks tailored to those needs.

- Validate lower-cost evaluation methods against more realistic methods. For example, insights from application-grounded studies could inform simplified human ratings or automatic metrics, which can then be validated against data from the real-world studies. 

- Investigate what makes for a useful representation of "downstream use cases" for large language models. Considerations include coverage of known use cases, ability to generate new use cases, discriminative power between use case requirements, and practical utility for benchmarking.

- Define and justify when lower-cost evaluation methods are appropriate. This may involve unpacking the types of costs, articulating the costs and benefits of different methods, and relating evaluation methods to the development stage and claims about the technology being evaluated.

- Explore opportunities for diverse and complementary evaluation methods, such as contextualized human ratings, simulated evaluations, and expert qualitative assessments.

- Develop the interdisciplinary integration with fields like HCI and social sciences to inform human-centered, context-aware evaluation grounded in real-world needs and values.

In summary, the authors advocate rethinking evaluation to better account for downstream socio-technical gaps, embrace methodological diversity, and take a more human-centered, context-aware, and use case driven approach.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes that model evaluation practices should aim to narrow the "socio-technical gap" between what technologies can do and what people need in real-world contexts. It argues that with the rise of large language models being deployed across diverse applications, evaluation methods should provide valid assessments of whether human needs in downstream use cases are satisfied. The paper draws lessons from human-computer interaction and explainable AI research advocating for human-centered and context-grounded evaluation. It suggests evaluating models based on studying real socio-requirements, using diverse methods balancing context realism, human requirement realism, and pragmatic costs. As an example, it maps current NLG and HCI evaluation methods along the two realism dimensions, identifying gaps in LLM evaluation today and opportunities for new methods like contextualized benchmarks and ratings, application studies, and simulated evaluation.

In summary, the paper argues for rethinking LLM evaluation as proxies aimed at narrowing the inevitable socio-technical gap, by embracing diverse methods grounded in downstream use cases and socio-requirements while acknowledging their limitations and tradeoffs. This positions evaluation as serving the practical needs of application builders in assessing models for adoption.

 Based on my reading, the key points of the paper are:

- It discusses the challenges and issues arising from evaluating large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems. 

- It argues current evaluation practices are inadequate for assessing how well these models will perform when deployed in real-world applications.

- It proposes evaluation should aim to assess the "socio-technical gap" - whether the models can satisfy human needs and requirements in downstream use cases. 

- It draws lessons from human-computer interaction (HCI) and explainable AI (XAI) on conducting evaluations grounded in real-world contexts and user needs.

- It suggests evaluating LLMs along two dimensions: context realism (proxy for real usage) and human requirement realism (proxy for user needs).

- It maps current LLM and HCI evaluation methods on these dimensions to identify gaps and opportunities.

- It recommends developing metrics based on human-desirable constructs, using higher-realism studies to inform lower-realism ones, representing downstream use cases, and justifying lower-cost evaluations.
