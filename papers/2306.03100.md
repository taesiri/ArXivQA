# [Rethinking Model Evaluation as Narrowing the Socio-Technical Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03100)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be: 

How can model evaluation practices be improved to better assess whether large language models (LLMs) can satisfy human needs in downstream applications?

The authors argue that the rise of large, versatile models like LLMs has created an "evaluation crisis", rendering traditional evaluation metrics inadequate. The paper proposes reframing model evaluation with the goal of narrowing the "socio-technical gap" between what models can do and what people need them to do when deployed in real-world contexts. 

Specifically, the authors draw lessons from human-computer interaction (HCI) and explainable AI (XAI) to argue for developing evaluation methods that:

1) Are grounded in studying real-world use cases and human requirements ("socio-requirements") in them 

2) Aim to be valid proxies for downstream socio-requirements while acknowledging tradeoffs with evaluation costs

The paper maps current NLG and HCI evaluation methods along dimensions of "context realism" and "human requirement realism" to identify opportunities for better LLM evaluation.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that model evaluation practices need to be rethought to assess how well LLMs can satisfy human needs in downstream applications, which requires evaluating them in light of real-world use cases and socio-requirements.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper argues that model evaluation practices should aim to narrow the socio-technical gap between what AI models can currently do and what people need them to do in real-world contexts, by developing methods grounded in studying downstream use cases and reflecting diverse aspects of socio-requirements while balancing pragmatic costs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of model evaluation:

- It takes a more human-centered perspective compared to much prior work on model evaluation that has focused on computational metrics like accuracy. The paper argues for evaluating models based on how well they satisfy human needs and values in real-world applications. This aligns with growing trends in human-AI interaction research.

- The concept of evaluating models by their ability to narrow the "socio-technical gap" seems novel. I'm not aware of other papers that have explicitly framed model evaluation this way. It connects well to ideas from social sciences and HCI.

- The analysis exploring different evaluation methods along the dimensions of context realism and human requirements realism provides a useful framework for thinking about tradeoffs in evaluation approaches. This kind of structured analysis and mapping of different methods is less common in the model evaluation literature.

- The paper covers a breadth of evaluation methods from human evaluation to benchmarks to simulated evaluation. It attempts to integrate perspectives from across HCI, XAI, and NLP evaluation. This scope stands out compared to prior work that has tended to focus on a narrower set of methods.

- The discussion of open questions and recommendations reflects a more holistic outlook than most model evaluation papers that just introduce a new technique. The emphasis on connecting methods, formalizing human-centered metrics, and defining use cases points toward important areas for future research.

Overall, I would say this paper provides a fairly unique perspective on model evaluation compared to related literature, especially with its human-centered framing, analysis of evaluation methods along key dimensions, and effort to synthesize diverse approaches. The open questions suggest it is intended to spur further research and discussion in this space.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions:

- Develop evaluation metrics and benchmarks focused on human-desirable constructs rather than just accuracy. This includes studying people's needs in downstream use cases to inform the development of metrics and benchmarks tailored to those needs.

- Validate lower-cost evaluation methods against more realistic methods. For example, insights from application-grounded studies could inform simplified human ratings or automatic metrics, which can then be validated against data from the real-world studies. 

- Investigate what makes for a useful representation of "downstream use cases" for large language models. Considerations include coverage of known use cases, ability to generate new use cases, discriminative power between use case requirements, and practical utility for benchmarking.

- Define and justify when lower-cost evaluation methods are appropriate. This may involve unpacking the types of costs, articulating the costs and benefits of different methods, and relating evaluation methods to the development stage and claims about the technology being evaluated.

- Explore opportunities for diverse and complementary evaluation methods, such as contextualized human ratings, simulated evaluations, and expert qualitative assessments.

- Develop the interdisciplinary integration with fields like HCI and social sciences to inform human-centered, context-aware evaluation grounded in real-world needs and values.

In summary, the authors advocate rethinking evaluation to better account for downstream socio-technical gaps, embrace methodological diversity, and take a more human-centered, context-aware, and use case driven approach.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper argues for rethinking model evaluation practices, especially for large language models (LLMs), in order to narrow the gap between what the models can do and people's needs in real-world deployment contexts (the socio-technical gap). The authors draw lessons from human-computer interaction (HCI) and explainable AI (XAI) fields that advocate for human-centered evaluation grounded in downstream use cases. They propose evaluating models along two dimensions: context realism (proxies for realistic usage contexts) and human requirement realism (proxies for people's actual requirements). After mapping current LLM evaluation methods along these dimensions, they identify opportunities such as developing evaluation metrics for human-desirable constructs rather than just accuracy, validating automatic metrics with human studies, characterizing downstream use cases at an appropriate level of abstraction, and justifying when lower-cost evaluations are acceptable. Overall, the paper calls for embracing diverse evaluation methods that make tradeoffs between reflecting realistic human needs versus pragmatic costs, in order to responsibly develop technologies that can satisfy human requirements when deployed.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points made in the paper:

This paper argues that the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) should aim to assess how well these models can satisfy human needs and values when deployed in real-world applications. It introduces the concept of a "socio-technical gap" between what technologies can do versus what people actually need. The authors suggest evaluating LLMs along two dimensions - context realism (how realistic the evaluation setting is compared to real deployment) and human requirement realism (how well the evaluation captures people's actual requirements). They review evaluation practices in human-computer interaction and explainable AI for lessons on developing evaluation methods that serve as useful proxies for downstream socio-requirements while balancing pragmatic costs. Based on analyzing current LLM evaluations, they identify opportunities such as developing metrics for human-desirable constructs informed by studying actual user needs, using higher-realism evaluations to validate lower-cost ones, and exploring creative middle grounds like simulated evaluations. The authors encourage embracing diverse evaluation methods while explicitly articulating their limitations and suitable situations.
