# Do LLMs Possess a Personality? Making the MBTI Test an Amazing   Evaluation for Large Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:Do large language models (LLMs) with human-like abilities possess human-like personalities? More specifically, the authors investigate whether the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a common human personality assessment tool, can serve as a reasonable evaluation metric for assessing the "personality" of LLMs. The key hypotheses explored in the paper are:1) Different LLMs will exhibit different "personality" types based on their training data and methods.2) The "personality" of LLMs can be influenced by techniques like prompt engineering. 3) The training dataset will impact the resulting "personality" of the LLM.4) While not scientifically rigorous, the MBTI may still serve as a rough indicator of model "personality" and provide insights.In summary, this paper centers around using the MBTI assessment as a lens to analyze whether advanced LLMs demonstrate human-like personalities, what factors impact their "personality", and whether the MBTI can provide a useful, if rough, evaluation approach for large language models. The authors aim to explore these hypotheses through extensive experiments on major LLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Investigating whether large language models (LLMs) with human-like abilities exhibit human-like personalities, by using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test as an evaluation metric. 2. Conducting extensive experiments to explore:- The personality types of different LLMs, and finding they possess diverse "personality" types similar to humans.- The possibility of changing LLM personality types via prompt engineering. Finding that models without sufficient instruction-tuning are resistant to change, but can be influenced after proper tuning.- How training datasets affect LLM personality types. Observing the type of training data impacts personality, especially the T/F and J/P dimensions of MBTI.- Evaluating whether MBTI can reasonably assess LLMs. Concluding that while not rigorously scientific, MBTI may serve as a rough indicator for LLMs.3. Providing observations that while not definitive, using MBTI as an evaluation metric can offer insights into LLMs in terms of their training data, ability to follow instructions, reasoning capabilities, and more.In summary, the main contribution is using MBTI personality types as a novel way to evaluate and understand the capabilities of LLMs, through comprehensive experiments exploring if and how LLMs exhibit human-like personalities. While not rigorous, MBTI offers a creative angle to assess LLMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper investigates whether large language models exhibit human-like personalities by using the MBTI personality assessment, finding that different models do have distinct personality types similar to humans, these types are difficult to change without proper instruction tuning, training corpora impacts personality especially on thinking/feeling and judging/perceiving dimensions, and while not scientifically rigorous, MBTI can serve as a rough indicator of model personality.
