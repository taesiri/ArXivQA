# [Retrieval is Accurate Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17532)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Standard language models generate text by predicting tokens from a fixed vocabulary in a sequential manner. This approach has limitations in interpretability, factuality and efficiency. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new paradigm that generates text by retrieving context-aware phrases from a collection of documents, instead of predicting tokens. This enhances interpretability as each phrase can be traced back to its source. It also improves factuality as phrases encode richer semantic meanings from their surrounding contexts.

Key Contributions:
1) Introduces a novel text generation approach based on context-aware phrase retrieval, completely removing dependence on document retrieval.

2) Proposes a method to construct training oracles by initializing with linguistics-driven heuristics and refining via self-reinforced bootstrapping.

3) Demonstrates superior performance over standard LMs and retrieval-augmented methods on various tasks:
- Knowledge-intensive QA datasets: Improves accuracy substantially, highlighting the benefit of incorporating external knowledge. Also shows plug-and-play capabilities with domain-specific indexes.
- Open-ended text generation: Achieves much higher quality scores and lower latency compared to baselines. Iterative self-reinforcement is shown to enhance quality.

4) Validates a paradigm shift towards more accurate text generation powered by retrieval, while identifying limitations to guide future research.

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions in presenting and validating a new direction for language modeling based on context-aware phrase retrieval. The proposed solutions and extensive experiments reveal strong potential to transition from standard token-by-token generation to direct phrase retrieval.
