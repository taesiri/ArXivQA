# [PeLK: Parameter-efficient Large Kernel ConvNets with Peripheral   Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07589)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent works have shown that equipping CNNs with large kernels can achieve strong performance on vision tasks. However, directly scaling up kernel size leads to an explosion in parameters due to the square complexity of convolution, causing optimization difficulties. Existing methods compromise to use sparse or stripe convolution forms, but start saturating when kernel sizes become very large (e.g. beyond 51x51). 

Solution:
This paper proposes a peripheral convolution that is inspired by human vision's central-peripheral mechanism. It reduces parameters by having fine-grained computation in a small central region while widely sharing parameters in the peripheral regions. This reduces complexity from O(K^2) to O(logK) and enables scaling to much larger kernels.

Based on peripheral convolution, the paper develops PeLK, a pure ConvNet architecture with exponentially growing Effective Receptive Field and minor parameter overhead when scaling kernels. PeLK uses additional techniques like dynamic sparsity and kernel-wise positional embeddings to further enhance performance.

Contributions:
- Proposes peripheral convolution to enable scaling CNNs to very large kernels (e.g 101x101) with minor overhead
- Develops PeLK architecture that outperforms ConvNeXT, SLaK and other competitors on image classification, segmentation and detection
- Demonstrates PeLK variants achieve new state-of-the-art results on ImageNet, ADE20K and COCO datasets
- Analysis shows optimal peripheral convolution design aligns with human visual system, suggesting bio-inspired mechanisms can benefit model designs

In summary, the paper makes CNNs parameter-efficient for scaling to much larger kernels than prior arts, achieving strong empirical performance via a human vision inspired peripheral convolution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 PeLK proposes a peripheral convolution inspired by human vision to enable parameter-efficient scaling of convolutional neural networks to extremely large kernels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel peripheral convolution to enable scaling up CNN kernels to extremely large sizes (e.g. 101x101) efficiently. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes a peripheral convolution that reduces the parameter complexity from O(K^2) to O(log K) for dense convolutions. This is achieved through focus and blur mechanisms and an exponentially increasing sharing grid inspired by human peripheral vision.

2) Based on the peripheral convolution, the paper develops Parameter-efficient Large Kernel Networks (PeLKs) that can scale up kernels to unprecedented sizes like 101x101 while having minor overhead in parameters and computations.

3) Experiments show state-of-the-art performance of PeLKs over modern CNNs and Transformers on image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The large kernels and peripheral convolution demonstrably enlarge the effective receptive field.

In summary, the core contribution is an efficient peripheral convolution that enables scaling dense CNN kernels to extremely large sizes for improved performance, while keeping parameter and computation costs tractable. The bio-inspired design also offers insights into developing performant vision models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Peripheral convolution: The proposed convolution operator that reduces parameters through parameter sharing while preserving dense computational form. It consists of focus and blur mechanism, exponentially-increasing sharing granularity, and kernel-wise positional embedding.

- Parameter-efficient Large Kernel Network (PeLK): The proposed CNN architecture built using peripheral convolutions, which enables scaling up to extremely large kernel sizes like 101x101. 

- Effective receptive field (ERF): The region of the input image that contributes most to activating output neurons. PeLK is shown to have much larger ERFs than prior works.

- Focus and blur mechanism: Keeping fine-grained parameters in the central region while using wide parameter sharing in peripheral regions, inspired by human peripheral vision. 

- Exponentially-increasing sharing granularity: Sharing grid grows exponentially from center to periphery, reducing complexity from O(K^2) to O(logK).

- Kernel-wise positional embedding: Introduced to distinguish locations in the shared peripheral regions, maintaining detail perception ability.

- Parameter efficiency: Ability to scale up kernel size with minor parameter overhead, enabled by the peripheral convolution. 

- Biological inspiration: Ideas drawn from human peripheral vision mechanisms and findings from vision science.
