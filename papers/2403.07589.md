# [PeLK: Parameter-efficient Large Kernel ConvNets with Peripheral   Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07589)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent works have shown that equipping CNNs with large kernels can achieve strong performance on vision tasks. However, directly scaling up kernel size leads to an explosion in parameters due to the square complexity of convolution, causing optimization difficulties. Existing methods compromise to use sparse or stripe convolution forms, but start saturating when kernel sizes become very large (e.g. beyond 51x51). 

Solution:
This paper proposes a peripheral convolution that is inspired by human vision's central-peripheral mechanism. It reduces parameters by having fine-grained computation in a small central region while widely sharing parameters in the peripheral regions. This reduces complexity from O(K^2) to O(logK) and enables scaling to much larger kernels.

Based on peripheral convolution, the paper develops PeLK, a pure ConvNet architecture with exponentially growing Effective Receptive Field and minor parameter overhead when scaling kernels. PeLK uses additional techniques like dynamic sparsity and kernel-wise positional embeddings to further enhance performance.

Contributions:
- Proposes peripheral convolution to enable scaling CNNs to very large kernels (e.g 101x101) with minor overhead
- Develops PeLK architecture that outperforms ConvNeXT, SLaK and other competitors on image classification, segmentation and detection
- Demonstrates PeLK variants achieve new state-of-the-art results on ImageNet, ADE20K and COCO datasets
- Analysis shows optimal peripheral convolution design aligns with human visual system, suggesting bio-inspired mechanisms can benefit model designs

In summary, the paper makes CNNs parameter-efficient for scaling to much larger kernels than prior arts, achieving strong empirical performance via a human vision inspired peripheral convolution.
