# [Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14139)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Manifold learning techniques are very useful for transforming high-dimensional data into reduced embedding spaces, revealing the intrinsic structure and topology. However, many existing manifold learning methods lack explainability due to their uninterpretable models and complex data transformations. This hinders their usage in domains where understanding the decision making process is crucial, such as healthcare.

Solution:  
The paper proposes a novel approach called Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning (GP-EMaL). It leverages genetic programming to evolve symbolic tree-based models that reduce dimensionality while preserving structural integrity. The key novelty is the introduction of a new complexity metric that directly penalizes tree size, asymmetry, and usage of complex functions. This guides evolution towards simpler and more interpretable tree structures.

The approach also allows customization of complexity measures to suit domain needs, prioritizing interpretability over performance. Multi-objective optimization balances model interpretability with quality of the learned manifold embedding. Comparisons show GP-EMaL matches performance of existing methods while using substantially simpler tree structures.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of GP-EMaL, a new GP approach for enhancing explainability in manifold learning
- Novel complexity metric incorporating size limits, asymmetry penalties and configurable operator costs  
- Customization of operator complexity to improve domain-specific interpretability
- Experimental analysis demonstrating maintained performance coupled with significant gains in interpretability
- Open-source implementation to enable further research and applications

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions regarding the explainability-performance tradeoff in manifold learning. GP-EMaL enhances interpretability while retaining the utility of dimensionality reduction, suiting domains where model transparency is vital.
