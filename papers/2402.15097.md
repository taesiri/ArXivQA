# [Learning solution operators of PDEs defined on varying domains via   MIONet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15097)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing neural operators like DeepONet and FNO can learn solution operators of PDEs defined on fixed domains. However, many practical PDE problems involve varying geometric domains, which current neural operators cannot handle. The key challenge is that the space of functions defined on varying domains does not form a Banach space, so the approximation theory of existing neural operators does not apply.

Proposed Solution:
1) Extend the approximation theory of MIONet to metric spaces, showing that MIONet can approximate mappings between metric spaces and Banach spaces under certain conditions. 

2) Construct a metric space U consisting of "polar regions", provide a well-defined metric on it, and prove U satisfies the conditions for MIONet's approximation theory.

3) Transform the original solution mapping between function spaces on varying domains into an equivalent mapping between U and a Banach space of functions on the unit ball. This transformed mapping can now be learned by MIONet.

4) Design a MIONet architecture and training process to learn the solution operator of Poisson equations with varying domains and parameters.


Main Contributions:

1) Extended approximation theory of MIONet to metric spaces, enabling application to problems with varying domains.

2) Constructed a metric space of regions and proved it satisfies conditions for MIONet approximation.  

3) Proposed an algorithm to learn solution operators of PDEs on varying domains, allowing all parameters (domain, PDE coefficients, BC, source term) to vary.

4) Demonstrated effectiveness on 2D Poisson equations over convex polygons and smooth polar regions. Showed robustness to different domain discretizations.

The method serves as a general, meshless solver for parametric PDEs involving diverse geometric domains. It has potential to be used as a tool to correct errors from traditional numerical solvers.
