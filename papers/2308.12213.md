# [CLIPN for Zero-Shot OOD Detection: Teaching CLIP to Say No](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12213)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we empower CLIP with the capability to distinguish in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples for more effective zero-shot OOD detection? The key hypothesis is that equipping CLIP with the logic to say "no" via learnable "no" prompts and a "no" text encoder can allow it to identify unknown/OOD samples more accurately. Specifically, the paper proposes that using positive-semantic prompts for ID classes and negation-semantic prompts for unknown classes can teach CLIP to associate images with "no" prompts, thereby enabling it to detect OOD samples even if they have high ID-ness scores.In summary, the main research question is how to upgrade CLIP's architecture and training to confer it with improved zero-shot OOD detection abilities, with the central hypothesis being that adding "no" logic is an effective way to achieve this. The paper introduces methods to implement and test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a new CLIP architecture called CLIPN that equips CLIP with "no" logic for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. This is done by adding new "no" prompts and a "no" text encoder to capture negation semantics.2. Introducing two new losses - image-text binary-opposite loss and text semantic-opposite loss - to teach CLIPN to match images with "no" prompts and understand the meaning of "no". 3. Designing two new threshold-free inference algorithms called competing-to-win and agreeing-to-differ to perform OOD detection using the negation semantics from "no" prompts and text encoder.4. Demonstrating through experiments on 9 datasets that CLIPN outperforms existing methods on both large-scale and small-scale OOD detection tasks. On ImageNet, it improves over prior arts by at least 2.34% in AUROC and 11.64% in FPR95.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new CLIP-based architecture and training approach called CLIPN that leverages "no" logic and negation semantics to enable superior OOD detection compared to existing methods. The introduction of "no" prompts, losses, and inference algorithms are key innovations that empower the OOD detection capability.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method called CLIPN that teaches CLIP to distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution images by adding learnable "no" prompts and text encoders, along with training losses and inference algorithms that leverage negation semantics.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of out-of-distribution detection:- This paper focuses specifically on zero-shot OOD detection using CLIP models, which has received less attention compared to OOD detection methods based on convolutional neural networks or standard transformers. Many existing works rely on designing scoring functions or classifiers tailored to the in-distribution data, while this paper aims to leverage the open-world knowledge learned by CLIP.- The proposed CLIPN architecture is novel in equipping CLIP with explicit "no" logic via new learnable prompts and text encoders. This allows directly identifying OOD samples using negation semantics rather than only measuring their distance/mismatch from the in-distribution. - The training losses and inference algorithms are also unique contributions for teaching CLIP the "no" logic and utilizing it for OOD detection in a threshold-free manner.- The extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods like MSP, ODIN, and recent CLIP-based approaches like MCM. The ablation studies also validate the efficacy of the different components of CLIPN.- One limitation compared to some works is the lack of evaluation on more specialized datasets like medical/satellite images. But the consistently strong results on diverse standard vision datasets suggest good generalizability.Overall, I would summarize that this paper makes several novel contributions in adapting CLIP for zero-shot OOD detection. The core idea of augmenting CLIP with explicit "no" logic and negation semantics is a unique angle compared to prior arts and shows promise for improving OOD detection performance. More studies on specialized datasets would further strengthen the approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring the extension of their CLIPN method to OOD segmentation or detection tasks. The current work focuses on OOD image classification, so applying CLIPN to dense prediction tasks like segmentation could be an interesting direction.- Evaluating the effectiveness of CLIPN for OOD detection on more specialized datasets such as medical images or satellite imagery. The authors note this is an open question since CLIP's capabilities on such datasets are still being explored. - Investigating different inference strategies beyond the competing-to-win and agreeing-to-differ algorithms proposed in this work. The authors developed these heuristic threshold-free inference approaches for CLIPN, but more principled decision schemes may further improve performance.- Studying how to enhance the open-world knowledge captured in vision-language models like CLIP to improve OOD detection. The authors highlight the benefits of CLIP's open-world pre-training, so building on this for OOD is promising.- Comparing CLIPN to other emerging vision-language models and zero-shot learning techniques as they continue to evolve. The authors focus their comparisons on existing CLIP methods, so benchmarking against future models would be interesting.In summary, the main directions are applying CLIPN to new tasks and data domains, improving the inference approach, better utilizing open-world knowledge, and continuing to benchmark against evolving zero-shot learning methods. Advancing in these areas could further enhance the capabilities and robustness of vision-language models for OOD detection.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new method called CLIP saying "no" (CLIPN) for zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection using CLIP. The key idea is to equip CLIP with the capability to distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples by using positive and negation semantic prompts. The authors design novel learnable "no" prompts and a "no" text encoder to capture negation semantics within images. They introduce two training losses - an image-text binary-opposite loss and a text semantic-opposite loss - to teach CLIPN to associate images with "no" prompts to enable identifying unknown samples. They also propose two threshold-free inference algorithms called competing-to-win and agreeing-to-differ that perform OOD detection using negation semantics. Experiments on 3 ID and 6 OOD datasets show CLIPN outperforms prior algorithms, improving AUROC and FPR95 on ImageNet-1K zero-shot OOD detection by at least 2.34% and 11.64% using ViT-B-16. Overall, the proposed CLIPN framework effectively leverages CLIP for OOD detection.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a new method called CLIP saying "no" (CLIPN) for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection using the CLIP language-vision model. The key idea is to equip CLIP with the ability to distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples by using positive-semantic prompts for ID classes and negation-semantic prompts like "a photo without a dog" for OOD. The authors propose a new architecture for CLIPN with additional "no" prompts and text encoders to capture negation semantics. They also introduce two new losses - an image-text binary-opposite loss to match images with correct "no" prompts, and a text semantic-opposite loss to separate the embeddings for standard and "no" prompts. After training CLIPN, two threshold-free inference algorithms are proposed - competing-to-win compares standard and "no" text encoder predictions, while agreeing-to-differ generates a new OOD probability. Experiments were conducted on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-100, and other datasets. Results show that CLIPN outperforms previous methods like MSP, MaxLogit, and MCM on zero-shot OOD detection. On ImageNet-1K it achieves over 2.34% and 11.64% higher AUROC and FPR95 compared to prior state-of-the-art. The improved performance is attributed to CLIPN's ability to directly identify some hard-to-distinguish OOD samples using negation semantics, unlike previous approaches relying only on ID-ness. Overall, this work presents a solid foundation for effectively leveraging CLIP for OOD detection.
