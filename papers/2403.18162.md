# [Optimizing Cyber Response Time on Temporal Active Directory Networks   Using Decoys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18162)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of defending temporal Active Directory (AD) networks using decoys/honeypots. Unlike previous works that assume static AD graphs, this paper considers temporal AD graphs that capture the dynamic nature of AD infrastructure, especially due to user activities over time. The problem is modeled as a Stackelberg security game between a defender (allocates decoys) and an attacker (finds attack paths). The defender aims to maximize the response time - the duration between an attacker triggering the first decoy to reaching the Domain Admin (DA). Longer response times allow IT admins more time to respond. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper first proves the NP-hardness of the defender's optimization problem. It then proposes using Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) algorithms to find diverse, high-quality solutions. However, direct application of vanilla EDO struggles to find feasible solutions and scale. To address this, the paper makes several key contributions:

(1) It proposes a faster Dijkstra-based algorithm for computing earliest-arrival paths in temporal graphs by exploiting the static AD infrastructure. This significantly speeds up fitness evaluation. 

(2) It introduces two constraint-handling techniques - an Integer Linear Program (ILP) based repair operator, and a surrogate-assisted approach with penalty fitness. The ILP repairs infeasible solutions directly, while the surrogate fitness replaces expensive evaluation over the whole graph with a subset of "important" paths, guiding search and improving scalability.

(3) It provides theoretical analysis - proving the polynomial-time nature of computing attacker response, the complexity benefits of the proposed earliest-arrival path algorithm, and the convergence of the surrogate-assisted approach.

(4) It conducts extensive experiments on synthetic AD graphs, demonstrating the ability of the proposed techniques to find good quality solutions much faster than vanilla EDO and ILP approaches alone.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in constraints handling and scalability enhancement for EDO algorithms when applied to the novel problem of temporal AD security. The integration of surrogate functions and tailored repair operators allow efficient guidance of the search process.
