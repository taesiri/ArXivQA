# [Causality from Bottom to Top: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11219)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Causality is fundamental for explaining phenomena, but there is a gap between human and AI/ML understanding of causality. AI/ML relies on statistical correlations to infer causation, whereas humans use intuitive theories, mechanisms, context, and common sense. 

- Current AI/ML takes a limited, static view of causation directly from observational data. It does not account for uncertainties, hidden variables, or dynamically updating beliefs.

Solution:
- The paper surveys the development of causality over the past 50 years and how it has invaded various applications. It covers the uniqueness, taxonomy, applications, evaluation, and connections to XAI, ML, DL, RL, etc.

- Key aspects that set causality apart include directionality, necessity, manipulability, asymmetry, transitivity, invariance, explicitness, explanation, counterfactuals, and transportability.

- Causality plays a crucial role in areas like healthcare, economics, education, fraud detection, recommender systems, robotics, and more. It brings interpretability, generalization, and robustness.

- The paper discusses metrics, assumptions, and architecture for applying causality to datasets. It also covers trustworthiness, explainability, differences from ML, and connections to big data, RL, GA, and fuzzy logic.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a broad overview of causality, including the development, uniqueness, taxonomy, applications, evaluation metrics, architecture requirements, etc.

- Highlights the gap between human and AI/ML understanding of causality and discusses potential research directions for narrowing this gap.

- Surveys connections of causality to various interrelated fields like XAI, ML, DL, RL, GA, big data, and fuzzy logic.

- Discusses trustworthiness, explainability, transportability, and other beneficial characteristics of causality models.

The paper delivers a holistic view of causality to highlight its growing significance across domains and the need to advance AI/ML causality towards more human-like reasoning abilities.
