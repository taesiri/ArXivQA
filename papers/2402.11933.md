# [SLADE: Detecting Dynamic Anomalies in Edge Streams without Labels via   Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11933)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper aims to tackle three key challenges in dynamic anomaly detection on continuous-time dynamic graphs (edge streams):
(1) Quickly detecting anomalies in real-time as edges arrive to minimize harm. Most methods designed for static graphs have delays. 
(2) Adapting to dynamically changing node states over time.
(3) Lack of anomaly labels for training, especially for dynamic anomalies.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes SLADE, a self-supervised method to incrementally identify dynamic anomalies in edge streams without relying on labels. SLADE learns dynamic node representations that capture long-term interaction patterns. It does this by training a neural network to perform two self-supervised tasks:

(1) Minimizing drift in node representations over time. This assumes normal nodes have stable interaction patterns.
(2) Accurately generating long-term patterns from recent interactions. This assumes feasibility of restoring patterns of normal nodes. 

Poor performance on these tasks indicates deviation from normal patterns. 

The neural network architecture and tasks are designed for constant time complexity per edge. Key components are:
- Memory modules to represent long-term interaction patterns
- Memory updater to update memories upon new edges
- Memory generator to reconstruct memories from recent interactions

Losses encourage agreement between current/previous memories (task 1) and current/generated memories (task 2). The model learns normal patterns. At inference, nodes with poor performance on these tasks get high anomaly scores.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes SLADE, an unsupervised method to detect complex dynamic anomalies in edge streams in real-time.
- Carefully designs neural network components and self-supervised tasks to enable constant time complexity per edge.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even supervised ones, with 12.8% and 4.23% higher AUC on average. Handles various anomaly types.
- Empirically shows constant runtime per edge, providing the best trade-off between speed and accuracy.

The key idea is to learn normal interaction patterns in a self-supervised manner and identify anomalies as deviations from them. The method is responsive, effective and robust.
