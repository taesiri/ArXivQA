# [Lost-customers approximation of semi-open queueing networks with   backordering -- An application to minimise the number of robots in robotic   mobile fulfilment systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01782)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers semi-open queueing networks (SOQNs) which model systems like manufacturing, logistics, and warehousing. SOQNs have an external queue for customer arrivals and a resource network consisting of a pool of resources and an inner network.
- Computing performance metrics for SOQNs with backordering (customers wait in external queue if no resources available) is challenging when the inner network has multiple nodes. Closed-form solutions are not available. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a new approximation method to analyze SOQNs with backordering. 
- The resource network is approximated by modifying the system - newly arriving customers are lost if no resources are available. This allows closed-form product-form solution. The arrival rate is adjusted so throughputs match the original system. 
- The external queue is approximated in two steps - first reducing the complexity of the modified system using Norton's theorem, then converting back to backordering from lost customers.

Key Contributions:
- Proves adjusted arrival rate in modified loss system ensures matching throughputs. Also matches idle node probabilities for constant service rates.
- Closed-form expressions provided for throughputs and idle probabilities.
- Demonstrates approximating external queue by indirect two-step method involving simplified lost customer system.
- Applies proposed approximation method to optimize number of robots in Robotic Mobile Fulfilment System warehouse modeled as SOQN.
- Simulation results validate quality of approximation for test warehouse system.

In summary, the paper makes both theoretical contributions in analyzing SOQNs as well as a practical contribution in optimizing robot resources for warehouse systems. The approximation technique is shown to be accurate and efficient.
