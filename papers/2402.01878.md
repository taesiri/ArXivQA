# [LiPO: Listwise Preference Optimization through Learning-to-Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01878)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent work on aligning language models (LMs) with human preferences has focused on pairwise optimization methods like DPO and SLiC. 
- However, human preference data often comes as ranked lists, not just pairs. 
- There is a lack of study on directly optimizing LMs using listwise preference data.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate LM alignment as a listwise ranking problem, drawing connections to learning-to-rank (LTR) literature.  
- Propose the Listwise Preference Optimization (LiPO) framework to optimize various listwise and pairwise ranking objectives.
- Highlight a new method called LiPO-Lambda that uses state-of-the-art listwise LambdaLoss objective to assign advanced weights to pairs based on listwise information.

Main Contributions:
- Provide first comprehensive study of ranking objectives for LM preference alignment, including less explored listwise objectives.
- Show both theoretically and empirically that existing methods like DPO and SLiC correspond to specific pairwise ranking objectives.
- Demonstrate LiPO-Lambda outperforms baselines on Reddit TL;DR and AnthropicHH tasks, benefiting more from listwise data.

In summary, the paper introduces a general listwise preference optimization framework for LM alignment, allowing principled incorporation of listwise preference data. A highlights a new method LiPO-Lambda that leverages an advanced listwise ranking objective to achieve strong empirical performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.
