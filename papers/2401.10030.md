# [Framing Analysis of Health-Related Narratives: Conspiracy versus   Mainstream Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10030)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing computational framing research has focused on narrow topics and often overlooks the narrative content embedded within the frames. However, understanding the narrative content is essential for transmitting the underlying information. 
- Framing analysis needs to go beyond just identifying frames themselves and interpret why frames were used, such as supporting a particular narrative. This is especially important for domains like conspiracy theories where the language used has similarities but the narratives differ.

Proposed Solution:
- Incorporate narrative information into framing analysis using semantic graphs extracted from text via Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR).
- AMR transforms text into graph-based representations capturing concepts and relations. This allows flexible extraction of frames along with associated narrative elements like characters, plot, setting and moral.

- Use AMR graphs to analyze and contrast health-related narratives in mainstream and conspiracy media on COVID-19, diseases in general and pharmacology.

Main Contributions:

- C1: Present a novel AMR-based approach to extract frames imbued with narrative information. The approach is flexible and conceptually simple to employ.

- C2: Demonstrate through analysis that health narratives in conspiracy media are predominantly framed in terms of beliefs, while mainstream media tend to frame them in terms of science.

The proposed approach advances narrative understanding by providing a comprehensive view of embedded narrations. This enables more nuanced frame extraction and analysis which can facilitate future works in framing applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for extracting narrative frames from text using abstract meaning representations to analyze how health-related topics are differently framed in conspiracy versus mainstream media, finding that conspiracy media tends to focus on belief-based arguments while mainstream media employs more science-based reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

C1) Presenting a novel approach based on abstract meaning representations (AMR) and using it to extract frames imbued with narrative information. The approach is flexible while also being conceptually simple to employ.

C2) Demonstrating that within the LOCO dataset, the framing of health-related narratives (i.e. on COVID-19, diseases in general, and pharmacology) in conspiracy media focuses on beliefs compared to mainstream media, which focuses more on science.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing a new AMR-based method for narrative frame extraction, and applying it to analyze differences in framing between conspiracy and mainstream media health narratives. The analysis shows conspiracy media tends to frame its narratives in terms of beliefs, while mainstream media frames them more in terms of science.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Framing analysis
- Narrative elements (characters, plot, setting, moral) 
- Abstract meaning representations (AMR)
- Semantic graphs
- Health narratives
- COVID-19
- Conspiracy theories
- Mainstream media
- Belief-based framing
- Science-based framing

The paper introduces a novel approach for framing analysis that incorporates narrative information extracted from semantic graphs called abstract meaning representations (AMR). This AMR-based method is applied to analyze and contrast health narratives from conspiracy media and mainstream media. The key finding is that conspiracy media tends to use more belief-based framing while mainstream media uses more science-based framing in their health narratives. The analysis covers narratives about COVID-19 as well as other diseases and pharmacology topics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using abstract meaning representations (AMR) for framing analysis. What are the key benefits of using AMR over other semantic representations like semantic role labeling? How does AMR help in capturing narrative information?

2. The paper extracts 4 key narrative elements from AMR graphs - characters, plot, setting, and moral of the story. What graph traversal strategies are used to identify these elements? How are concepts, relations and attributes mapped to these narrative elements? 

3. The paper analyzes framing differences between mainstream and conspiracy media on health topics. What datasets were used in the analysis? Why were diseases, pharmacology and COVID-19 chosen as topics of investigation? 

4. What preprocessing steps were taken before AMR parsing? How were the mainstream and conspiracy documents separated in the dataset? What statistics are provided about the dataset?

5. The overrepresentation analysis uses smoothed log-odds ratios. How is this formulation different from using informative Dirichlet priors? What does the sign and magnitude of the scores indicate?

6. How are the overrepresented words visualized for analysis? Why is UMAP used for dimensionality reduction compared to other techniques like PCA? How is positioning improved for interpretability?  

7. Can you analyze one of the key narratives highlighted in the results section? What are the differences in framing between mainstream and conspiracy media? How do the roles and predicates differ?

8. What extensions are discussed to inject additional information like sentiment into the graphs? How could this enable better characterization of heroes and villains? What other analyses could be enabled?

9. What are some limitations of using AMR discussed? How could the approach be evaluated more rigorously in future works? What are some challenges for generalizability?

10. What ethical considerations does the paper discuss regarding conspiracy theories? How could the analysis results be used positively and negatively?
