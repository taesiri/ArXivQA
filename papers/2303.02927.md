# [LIDA: A Tool for Automatic Generation of Grammar-Agnostic Visualizations   and Infographics using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02927)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can large language models (LLMs) and image generation models (IGMs) be leveraged in a modular, multi-stage pipeline to automatically generate data visualizations and infographics?

The key hypothesis appears to be that well-orchestrated pipelines composed of LLMs and IGMs are well suited for addressing the various subtasks involved in creating visualizations and infographics, including:

- Understanding semantics of data 
- Enumerating relevant visualization goals
- Generating visualization specifications that meet syntax, design, and perceptual requirements
- Creating stylized and memorable infographics

The paper proposes that by breaking down visualization/infographic generation into discrete steps and applying LLMs and IGMs to each, it is possible to develop a system that is simplified, general, flexible, and scalable compared to prior automatic visualization approaches. 

Specifically, the paper introduces LIDA, a system with four main modules (summarizer, goal explorer, visGenerator, and infographer) powered by LLMs and IGMs. It hypothesizes this modular approach can overcome limitations of existing systems in factors like maintenance, user control, multilingual interaction, infographic generation, etc.

The central research question therefore seems to focus on demonstrating how this multi-stage LLM/IGM pipeline can effectively automate key aspects of the visualization process in a more extensible and scalable way compared to previous systems. The paper aims to validate this through the introduction and evaluation of the LIDA system.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A novel multi-stage, modular approach for automatically generating data visualizations and infographics using large language models (LLMs). The key components are:

- A summarizer module that converts a dataset into a compact natural language summary to provide useful context for the LLMs.

- A goal module that generates visualization goals and hypotheses to explore, given the dataset summary.

- A visGenerator module that generates grammar-agnostic visualization code and specifications based on the goals.

- An infographics module that generates stylized data-faithful graphics using image generation models.

2. New metrics for evaluating LLM-enabled visualization tools - visualization error rate (VER) for assessing reliability, and self-evaluated visualization quality (SEVQ) for assessing visualization quality.

3. An open source library called LIDA that implements the approach and provides APIs and interfaces for generating visualizations, infographics and data stories.

4. A simplified, generalizable and scalable approach compared to prior automated visualization systems, by framing it as a text and code generation problem solved by LLMs/IGMs. Eliminates need for specialized models per subtask/grammar.

5. Support for multilingual natural language interaction, direct manipulation controls, and operations like visualization refinement, explanation, evaluation and recommendation.

So in summary, the key contribution is a new modular architecture and implementation for automated visualization and infographic generation using large language models, with innovations in the technical approach, evaluation metrics, and interface capabilities. The system simplifies and advances the state of the art in this problem domain.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel approach for automatic visualization and infographic generation using large language models (LLMs). Here is a comparison to other related research:

- Compared to heuristic-based systems like Voyager, DeepEye, etc., this approach leverages the knowledge and patterns learned by LLMs from large datasets to implicitly solve visualization subtasks like understanding data semantics, generating goals, and producing code/specs. It does not require manually crafted heuristics.

- Compared to task decomposition systems like NL4DV, this presents an end-to-end pipeline using a single LLM, avoiding bottlenecks from specialized models for each subtask. It supports multimodal interaction and controllable generation.

- Compared to learning-based systems like Data2Vis, this approach is grammar-agnostic, does not need custom training data/objectives for each grammar, and provides mechanisms for error detection and recovery. It also generates infographics.

- The modular pipeline is flexible and generalizable. Performance will improve with advances in underlying LLMs. It simplifies system design compared to specialized models.

- The interface supports both direct manipulation and conversational multilingual NL interaction. This facilitates use by novices and experts. Explanations aid sensemaking.

- It introduces new metrics like Visualization Error Rate and Self-Evaluated Visualization Quality to evaluate reliability and quality of LLM-based visualization systems.

In summary, this paper presents a novel formulation of visualization as a multistage generative task using LLMs and IGMs. The approach is more simplified, flexible, and scalable compared to existing systems. The interface provides rich affordances for control and explanation. This moves the state-of-the-art forward in automated visualization and infographics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:

- Studying the impact of task complexity and choice of programming language/grammar on the performance of the LIDA system. The current formulation depends on the language model having knowledge of visualization grammars, but performance may be limited for complex tasks or grammars with limited textual examples.

- Training smaller but capable language models finetuned specifically on programming languages and visualization grammars. This could help address deployment and latency challenges with large models like GPT-3.5.

- Developing better approaches for explaining the behavior of the system and providing actionable feedback to users, given the interpretability challenges of large language models.

- More comprehensive evaluation of the system including: studying LLMs' capabilities to encode visualization best practices, mapping out failure cases through user studies, and assessing impact on user creativity.

- Considering alternative modes of interaction beyond natural language, such as demonstrations, examples or direct manipulation.

- Exploring how the system could support collaboration, allowing multiple users to interact with the same visualization session and integrate their diverse perspectives.

- Investigating how to adapt the system to new domains beyond standard data visualization, such as graphic design, dashboard creation, slide presentation, etc.

In summary, key directions are improving deployability, explainability and evaluation rigor, testing the approach on more complex use cases, exploring alternative modes of interaction, and extending the capabilities to support collaboration and new applications.
