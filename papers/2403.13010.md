# [A Dual-Tier Adaptive One-Class Classification IDS for Emerging   Cyberthreats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13010)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Intrusion detection systems (IDS) struggle to detect new, unknown cyber threats (zero-day attacks). They rely on known attack signatures and fail to adapt as threats evolve.
- Supervised IDS models require balanced datasets with attack samples, which are difficult to obtain. One-class classifiers only need normal data for training. 
- Existing IDS solutions lack capabilities to detect, categorize, and incorporate unknown attacks into retraining.

Proposed Solution:
- A hierarchical, adaptive IDS framework with two levels. 
- First level: One-class classifier (OCC) separates normal and attack traffic using only normal instances.
- Second level: Another OCC detects if attacks are known or unknown. 
- Known attacks classified into specific families by a supervised model.
- Unknown attacks clustered and added to retrain OCC and supervised model.  

Key Contributions:
- Novel hierarchical design to distinguish normal, known attacks, and unknown attacks.
- Leverages recent semi-supervised method usfAD which outperforms others.  
- Automated process to cluster, label and retrain models on unknown attacks.
- Evaluated extensively on 10 IDS datasets using stratified cross-validation.
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods like DOC++.
- Establishes new benchmark for building practical, resilient IDS systems.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative hierarchical intrusion detection framework centered around the usfAD algorithm. It can automatically adapt in the face of new threats by clustering and retraining on novel attacks. Extensive experiments prove its effectiveness over existing methods.
