# Stylized Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation via Disentangled   Template Rewriting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we generate stylized knowledge-grounded dialogue responses without any labeled paired data? The key points are:- Current knowledge-grounded dialogue models produce factual but pedantic responses. The authors aim to incorporate stylized text generation to make the responses more engaging.- This presents two challenges: 1) Lack of labeled stylized knowledge-grounded response triples for training. 2) Difficulty in ensuring coherence, knowledge preservation, and target style consistency without supervision. - The authors propose a novel "generate-disentangle-rewrite" framework to tackle these challenges. It utilizes disentangled template rewriting to isolate knowledge generation from stylized rewriting.- A novel weakly supervised learning method is proposed to guide the learning of the disentangler and rewriter modules.- Experiments on two datasets with three styles/sentiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in generating stylized knowledge-grounded responses without any labeled training data.In summary, the key hypothesis is that disentangled template rewriting and weak supervision signals can enable effective training of stylized knowledge-grounded dialogue models without paired training data. The results validate this hypothesis and show significant improvements over previous stylized dialogue methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new task called Stylized Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation (SKDG), which aims to generate responses that are coherent with dialogue context, consistent with given knowledge, and exhibit a designated style. 2. It presents a novel approach called Disentangled Template Rewriting (DTR) to address the SKDG task. DTR consists of three main components:- A knowledge-grounded response generator to produce an initial factual response. - A sequential style disentangler to identify and remove style-related fragments from the initial response to form a style-agnostic template.- A style rewriter to rewrite the entire template in the target style by injecting appropriate style-related words/phrases.3. It introduces a reinforcement learning framework along with a novel weakly supervised learning method to train the style disentangler and rewriter without any labeled data.4. Extensive experiments show DTR significantly outperforms previous stylized dialogue generation methods in generating informative, knowledge-grounded responses with desired style. DTR also achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art knowledge-grounded dialogue models.In summary, the key innovation is the proposed disentangled template rewriting approach to decouple style transfer from knowledge-grounded response generation. This allows properly injecting style while retaining knowledgeaccuracy, which previous stylized dialogue generation methods struggled with. The overall framework is end-to-end trainable without style-specific labeled data.
