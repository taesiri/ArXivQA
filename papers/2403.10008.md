# [Language to Map: Topological map generation from natural language path   instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In vision-and-language navigation (VLN), users need to provide detailed path instructions to robots for each navigation task, which is burdensome. 
- Existing methods rely on pre-created maps or camera images in addition to natural language descriptions.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a method to create a topological map solely from natural language path descriptions using large language models (LLMs). 
- Map contains nodes (waypoints) and edges (paths between waypoints), along with actions (e.g. turn left/right) associated with each node.
- Given new start/end points, system can generate a path on the map between them.

Key Contributions:
- First method to create maps purely from natural language without any vision input.
- Propose two approaches - implicit maps stored in LLM memory, and explicit topological maps.
- Explicit map method shows significantly higher accuracy (92%) compared to implicit method (44%) in generating new paths.
- Develop intermediate canonical representation and algorithms to translate natural language to this representation.  
- Demonstrate LLMs lack understanding of spatial structure which is addressed via explicit maps.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel approach using LLMs to construct topological maps solely from natural language descriptions and use these maps to infer new paths based on language queries. Key novelty is creating maps without any vision data. Explicit map representation is shown to be far more effective than implicit maps within LLMs.
