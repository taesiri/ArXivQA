# [Large Language Models for Intent-Driven Session Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07552)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Large Language Models for Intent-Driven Session Recommendations":

Problem:
- Session-based recommendation aims to predict a user's next interaction based on their current session of anonymous behaviors. Capturing the user's intent within sessions can improve recommendations. 
- Existing methods make simplistic assumptions about intent and operate in latent spaces, overlooking dynamic user intents and hindering model transparency.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes PO4ISR, a new paradigm to leverage large language models (LLMs) for intent-aware session recommendation through prompt optimization.

Key Components:
- Prompt Initialization: Generates an initial prompt to guide the LLM in uncovering varying semantic intents within sessions to predict the next item.

- Prompt Optimization: Iteratively optimizes the initial prompt via self-reflection - it collects error cases, asks the LLM to provide reasons for the errors to refine the prompt, augments the refined prompt, and evaluates prompt candidates efficiently to enable iterative improvements.

- Prompt Selection: Selects the top-performing cross-domain prompt by exploiting LLM generalization ability to maximize accuracy gains.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a simple yet powerful PO4ISR paradigm that utilizes LLMs for enhanced intent-aware session recommendation through prompt optimization.

- PO4ISR allows LLMs to uncover varying user intents at a semantic level within sessions, enabling more accurate and interpretable recommendations.

- Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, with average gains of 57.37% in HR and 61.03% in NDCG.

- Provides several useful findings - PO4ISR shows strength on sparser datasets and shorter sessions, optimized lower-quality prompts yield higher improvements, simplified task description and division improve initial prompt quality.
