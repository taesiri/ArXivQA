# [A Survey on Long Video Generation: Challenges, Methods, and Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Long video generation presents unique challenges compared to short video generation due to extended durations and complex, multidimensional content. However, there is no standard definition of what constitutes a "long" video. 

- Based on a review of past works, the authors propose defining long videos as those over 10 seconds in length or 100 frames, providing a clear benchmark.

Solution Approaches
- Two main paradigms have emerged to tackle long video generation within computational constraints: 
   1) Divide and Conquer: Hierarchically generate keyframes and fill in gaps 
   2) Temporal Autoregressive: Iteratively generate short clips conditioned on prior frames

- Various techniques are employed under these paradigms, including diffusion models, GANs, transformers and mask modeling. Innovations enhance consistency, continuity and diversity.

Main Contributions
- Provides the first comprehensive survey of long video generation research.

- Categorizes existing approaches into two simplified paradigms: Divide & Conquer and Temporal Autoregressive.

- Delivers an extensive overview of datasets, evaluation metrics, model architectures and methodologies.

- Discusses advancements as well as open challenges and future directions to drive progress in this nascent field.

In summary, this paper offers a structured analysis of the state-of-the-art in long video generation through extensive technical and empirical synthesis. It establishes standards, maps key innovations and outlines promising research pathways towards elevated video quality, duration and controllability.
