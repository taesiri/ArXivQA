## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Imitation Learning (IL) is a promising approach for teaching robots to perform manipulation tasks by having them mimic human demonstrations. However, current methods have two key limitations: 1) they require users to be familiar with operating robot arm controllers to provide demonstrations, and 2) they need access to real robot arms, which can be expensive and require specialized knowledge. These issues limit the scalability and accessibility of robot IL.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents an Augmented Reality (AR) based framework that enables non-expert users to easily collect robot demonstrations using AR devices like the HoloLens 2. The key ideas are:

1) Users wear AR glasses that overlay a virtual robot arm on their own arm. As they perform tasks with their hands, the robot arm mirrors their motions, providing real-time visual feedback. The joint angles and end-effector poses are recorded as demonstrations. This allows collecting demos without needing to operate a real robot.

2) A key data point detection algorithm is used to identify critical poses in the raw trajectories, which may be jerky due to hand tremors or tracking inaccuracies. These points are retained when smoothing the demos to ensure critical task-related information is not lost.

Main Contributions:

1) A framework that allows non-roboticists to collect robot demonstrations by performing tasks with their own hands, overcoming the need for specialized robot operation skills or access to real robots.

2) Demonstration of the framework's validity by using demos collected via AR with a HoloLens 2 to successfully control a real Fetch robot to complete reaching, pushing and pick-and-place tasks.

The proposed solution facilitates scalable and diverse demo collection from non-experts to train imitation learning algorithms, helping overcome key bottlenecks in deploying IL on real-world robot platforms.
