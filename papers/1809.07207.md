# [Learning Long-Range Perception Using Self-Supervision from Short-Range   Sensors and Odometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07207)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether a self-supervised learning approach can be used to predict the future outputs of a short-range sensor (like a proximity sensor) by interpreting the current outputs of a long-range sensor (like a camera). Specifically, the authors aim to develop and experimentally validate a general framework for this type of self-supervised learning of long-range perception tasks. The key hypothesis appears to be that by using future short-range sensor outputs as labels for current long-range sensor data, a model can learn to interpret the long-range data in a way that is useful for perception tasks like obstacle detection. The experiments then evaluate whether this approach is effective in practice.
