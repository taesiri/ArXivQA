# [Meta4XNLI: A Crosslingual Parallel Corpus for Metaphor Detection and   Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07053)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Metaphors are ubiquitous in language but complex for language models to process. Most metaphor resources and research focus on English only. 
- Existing metaphor detection datasets have limitations like small size, annotations only at sentence-level, or texts from a single domain. 
- Metaphor interpretation datasets have biases - entailment pairs are often generated just by replacing metaphors with literal paraphrases. Such artifacts may lead to misleading results about models' metaphor understanding abilities.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce Meta4XNLI (M4X), the first parallel corpus with metaphor annotations for detection and interpretation in Spanish and English.
- For detection, metaphors are annotated at token level in 13320 sentences from XNLI and esXNLI spansh-english dataset. 
- For interpretation, premise-hypothesis pairs are labeled based on whether understanding the metaphors is essential to determine the inference relationship.

Contributions:
- M4X enables both monolingual and cross-lingual analysis of metaphor processing.  
- It contains natural language sentences translated between English and Spanish in both directions.
- The authors experiment with fine-tuning mDeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa for metaphor detection and interpretation using M4X.
- Results show better performance when models leverage the parallel multilingual data. The annotations also reveal differences in metaphor convention across languages.
- M4X helps analyze the impact of translation on metaphor annotation and transferability across languages.

In summary, this paper introduces a valuable metaphor resource covering multiple languages and tasks. The experiments demonstrate its usefulness in analyzing metaphoric language and evaluating model generalization. The parallel data allows unique cross-lingual study to improve metaphor understanding in NLP models.
