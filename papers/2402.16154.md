# [IKLink: End-Effector Trajectory Tracking with Minimal Reconfigurations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16154)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Generating smooth robot motions by linking together Inverse Kinematics (IK) solutions along a desired end-effector trajectory is challenging. Using greedy propagation to find successive IK solutions tends to yield converging motions over the course of the trajectory, thus lacking diversity.

Proposed Solution - IKLink:
- Constructs a table of IK solution candidates for each waypoint along the desired trajectory using 3 methods: 
  1) Random sampling 
  2) Greedy propagation
  3) Clustering to merge similar solutions and maintain diversity
- Links IK solutions across waypoints optimally using a dynamic programming approach to minimize the number of discontinuities (reconfigurations)

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a dynamic programming based approach to establish optimal connections between IK solutions across waypoints along an end-effector trajectory
- Maintains diversity of IK solutions using random sampling and clustering before greedy propagation
- Handles cases where greedy propagation fails by falling back to pre-computed random IK solutions 
- Demonstrates empirically that the approach generates smoother motions with fewer reconfigurations compared to prior Stampede algorithm

In summary, the key innovation is the dynamic programming scheme that globally optimizes connections of diverse IK solutions across waypoints to achieve superior motion quality with fewer discontinuities. The method is general and can be integrated with other motion planners.
