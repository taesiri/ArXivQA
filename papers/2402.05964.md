# [A Survey on Transformer Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05964)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of transformer model compression methods. Transformers have emerged as the predominant architecture for large language and vision models. However, due to their massive size, it is essential to compress them for efficient deployment. 

The paper first introduces the transformer architecture, consisting of multi-head attention (MHA) and feedforward network (FFN) modules. It then categorizes compression methods into architecture preserving (quantization, knowledge distillation) and architecture adaptive (pruning, efficient architecture).

For quantization, the paper reviews methods like post-training quantization and quantization-aware training that convert models to lower precision while preserving accuracy. Key highlights in vision include preserving attention rank, rectifying extreme distributions, and addressing weight oscillation. In language models, quantizing outliers and activations is critical. 

Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a large teacher to smaller student model by distilling logits, features, or instructions from teacher generations. For vision, employing CNN teachers, encoding data augmentations, and multi-scale distillation are promising directions. For language, black-box distillation using only teacher model outputs poses new challenges.

Pruning removes redundant components like heads or tokens. For vision, token pruning and network pruning are combined for acceleration. For language, context pruning dynamically selects tokens and caching further boosts speedups. Importance estimation and task preservation are key considerations.  

To enhance efficiency, novel architectures optimize attention mechanisms or replace them with convolutions/recurrences. Techniques like linear attention, local attention windows, and non-parametric mixing help vision models capture details and context. In language, modeling long sequences efficiently using linear complexities remains an open challenge.

Finally, the paper relates different compression methods and discusses key future directions like joint compression, efficient fine-tuning, and exploration of non-transformer architectures.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords related to this survey paper on transformer model compression are:

- Quantization - Converting model weights and activations to lower precision representations to reduce memory and computation costs. Includes post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT).

- Knowledge Distillation - Transferring knowledge from a large "teacher" model to a smaller "student" model, including logits-based and hint-based methods. Helps compress models while preserving performance. 

- Pruning - Removing redundant or less important parts of the model like attention heads, layers, or individual weights. Includes structured and unstructured pruning. Reduces model size and computations.

- Efficient Architecture Design - Modifying model architecture itself to reduce computational complexity, such as with efficient attention mechanisms, non-transformer architectures, enhancements to feedforward networks.

- Post-training Compression - Compression techniques applied after model training, important for large models where full retraining is expensive. Includes many PTQ and pruning methods.

- Training Efficiency - Considering computational and memory costs of compression methods themselves, not just the final compressed model. Crucial for large transformer models.

The paper discusses these methods for both natural language processing and computer vision transformer models. Key goals are reducing model size, computations, and parameters while preserving model accuracy.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this survey paper on transformer model compression:

1. The paper discusses both post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) for compressing transformers.

What are some challenges and open problems with this black-box distillation approach? How can the student model effectively learn from limited teacher model information?

3. Structured pruning is highlighted in the paper as being more hardware-friendly compared to unstructured pruning. However, defining the right structured pruning granularity is a challenge. What factors should be considered when determining the pruning granularity? How can we balance compression rate, speedup, and performance?

5. For vision transformers, the paper explores enhancements like shifted window partitioning to improve locality. What are some other ways spatial biases can be effectively incorporated into self-attention for computer vision tasks? What architectural innovations might be promising?  

6. The paper introduces some emerging architectures like RetNet that generate outputs recursively like RNNs. What are some challenges and open problems with using RNN-style architectures compared to the standard Transformer?

7. How suitable are pure MLP architectures without attention for natural language processing compared to computer vision? What modifications might be required to make such models work effectively for NLP?

8. What are some ways multiple compression techniques like quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation can be combined effectively for large transformers? What is a good methodology to explore the joint search space?

9. For extremely long input sequences beyond the capability of standard Transformers, what types of architectural innovations show promise in terms of efficiency and performance?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on transformer model compression. What compression methods for other large neural network architectures like LSTMs or CNNs might also be applicable to Transformers? What adaptations would be required?
