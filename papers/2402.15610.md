# [Selective "Selective Prediction": Reducing Unnecessary Abstention in   Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15610)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision-language models (VLMs) can make incorrect predictions when answering questions about images. Using vanilla selective prediction to minimize errors by allowing models to abstain often leads to over-abstention, even on many correct predictions.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces ReCoVERR, an algorithm to reduce unnecessary abstentions at inference time without decreasing accuracy. 
- When the VLM makes a low-confidence prediction, instead of abstaining, ReCoVERR generates follow-up questions to collect additional visual evidence from the image that could verify the prediction.
- The additional questions are generated by a language model and answered by the VLM. The resulting QA pairs are added as evidence if they are reliable (high VLM confidence) and relevant (affects confidence in original prediction).
- If enough reliable and relevant evidence is collected, ReCoVERR makes a prediction instead of abstaining.

Main Contributions:
- ReCoVERR increases the coverage of two VLMs on the A-OKVQA task by up to 20% compared to vanilla selective prediction, while keeping the risk under specified tolerance.
- Analysis shows that ReCoVERR performs best when the VLM produces high-confidence estimates on its correct predictions. 
- Ablations demonstrate the importance of ensuring reliability and relevance of collected evidences.
- Experiments show ReCoVERR can generalize to new tasks without additional tuning.
- Overall, ReCoVERR is a promising approach to build more reliable multimodal reasoning systems by reducing unnecessary abstentions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key ideas from the paper:

The paper introduces ReCoVERR, an algorithm that increases the coverage of a selective vision-language model system by reducing unnecessary abstentions, through iterative question asking to collect reliable and relevant visual evidence confirming low-confidence predictions, while respecting a specified risk tolerance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is an algorithm called ReCoVERR that aims to increase the coverage (percentage of questions answered) of a selective vision-language system while adhering to a specified risk tolerance level. 

Specifically, ReCoVERR tries to verify low-confidence predictions made by a vision-language model (VLM) by using a language model to generate follow-up questions about the image, getting additional visual evidence from the VLM's answers to those questions, and deciding whether there is enough reliable and relevant evidence to make a prediction instead of abstaining.

The paper shows experimentally that using ReCoVERR enables two VLMs (BLIP2 and InstructBLIP) to answer up to 20% more questions on the A-OKVQA visual reasoning task compared to vanilla selective prediction, without decreasing overall system accuracy. So the main contribution is this novel ReCoVERR algorithm for reducing unnecessary abstentions in selective prediction for vision-language reasoning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and contents, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Selective prediction - Allowing models to abstain from answering when uncertain to balance coverage and risk
- Vision-language reasoning - Answering questions about images by drawing multimodal inferences
- Risk tolerance - Specifying an acceptable risk level for incorrect predictions 
- Coverage - The percentage of questions where the system chooses to predict
- Reliable evidence - Evidence where the VLM is highly confident in its answer
- Relevant evidence - Evidence that affects confidence in the original VLM prediction
- ReCoVERR - The proposed algorithm to reduce over-abstention by collecting reliable and relevant visual evidences

In summary, the key ideas have to do with selective prediction for vision-language models, balancing coverage and risk via abstention thresholds, and the ReCoVERR algorithm that aims to increase coverage by verifying low-confidence predictions using iterative evidence collection.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does ReCoVERR leverage the ability of VLMs to produce well-calibrated confidence estimates? Why is this an important capability that enables ReCoVERR to work effectively?

2. When generating follow-up questions about the image, what mechanisms does ReCoVERR use to ensure the additional visual evidence collected is both reliable and relevant? 

3. What is the motivation behind using a defeasible reasoning approach to determine the relevance of a visual evidence? How does this allow flexibility in the evidence collection process?

4. Explain the process that ReCoVERR uses at inference time to decide whether to answer a question or abstain. What are the key decision points and how do they balance coverage and risk?

5. How does the design of ReCoVERR enable it to improve coverage of selective VLM systems without additional training? What aspects make it well suited for inference-time application?

6. What findings from the experiments provide insights into when ReCoVERR is most effective at recovering visual evidence reliably? When does it tend to overestimate reliability?

7. How sensitive is ReCoVERR to the choice of underlying vision-language model? What characteristics make a VLM well suited to be combined with ReCoVERR?

8. What do the experiments transferring ReCoVERR to new datasets indicate about its generalizability? What types of tuning may be needed to maintain effectiveness across diverse tasks?

9. How do the qualitative examples illustrate cases where ReCoVERR is able to successfully verify an initial low-confidence prediction using subsequently collected visual evidence?

10. What opportunities exist for extending ReCoVERR to new settings, such as safety-critical applications where models should abstain from dangerous responses? How might the approach need to evolve?
