# [On the Role of the Action Space in Robot Manipulation Learning and   Sim-to-Real Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03673)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a large-scale study on the role of action spaces in learning robotic arm manipulation skills and sim-to-real transfer. The authors evaluated 13 different action spaces, including novel combinations, spanning from raw torque control to Cartesian impedance policies, on reaching and pushing tasks. They introduced metrics to assess exploration behavior, emerging properties, sim-to-real gap, and real-world performance. Key findings indicate that Cartesian and higher-order derivative action spaces have better exploration, while velocity-based spaces transfer best to the real world. Multi-step delta spaces yielded lower tracking errors. Furthermore, the order of derivative and the tracking error were found to be the most influential factors on sim-to-real transfer. The best overall performance was achieved using joint velocity action spaces. The study provides unique insights into favorable action space properties and design guidelines for learning manipulations skills that transfer from simulation to the real world.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper studies how different choices for the action space, such as controlling positions versus velocities or Cartesian versus joint spaces, impact the exploration behavior, emerging properties, and sim-to-real transfer of policies trained with reinforcement learning on robotic arm manipulation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to understand the role of action spaces in learning robotic arm manipulation skills. The key contributions are:

1) Comparing 13 different action spaces spanning popular options as well as novel combinations, evaluating their properties such as exploration behavior, emerging constraints violations, tracking error, and sim-to-real transfer capabilities.

2) Identifying key characteristics of action spaces that influence sim-to-real transfer, namely the order of derivative of control variables and the tracking error. Spaces with higher-order derivative control and lower tracking error transfer better.  

3) Showing that joint velocity action spaces overall have the best performance - good exploration, least constraints violations, lowest tracking error, and best real-world transfer across reaching and pushing tasks.

4) Providing recommendations and design guidelines for selecting/developing suitable action spaces for robot manipulation learning based on the desirable characteristics identified through this empirical analysis.

In summary, this is the first large-scale study focused specifically on systematically understanding the role of action spaces in manipulation learning and sim-to-real transfer through rigorous experimentation. The key takeaway is that the choice of action space plays a central role and needs careful consideration when training policies, especially for real-world deployment.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Here are some of the key terms and main takeaways from this paper:

- Action spaces - The paper studies different action space representations for reinforcement learning policies, including joint torques, positions, velocities, and Cartesian spaces. 

- Sim-to-real transfer - A major focus is understanding how different action spaces affect the ability to transfer policies from simulation to the real world.

- Sample efficiency - The exploration behavior and training sample efficiency is analyzed for different action spaces. Cartesian and higher derivative spaces have advantages.  

- Emergent properties - Different action spaces lead to policies with different emergent properties like safety, constraint violations, etc.

- Tracking error - The tracking error between the control targets and actual system state is identified as a key property affecting sim-to-real transfer. Lower tracking error leads to better transfer.

- Order of derivative - Controlling higher order derivatives of motion (e.g. velocity vs position) with the policy leads to better sim-to-real transfer.  

- Joint velocity action spaces - These tended to perform the best overall in terms of training efficiency, safety, and sim-to-real transfer capability.

The main takeaways are around carefully considering the choice of action space and its characteristics when learning robot manipulation policies, especially for sim-to-real transfer. The action space plays a central role that is often overlooked.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper studies 13 different action spaces for reinforcement learning of robotic manipulation skills. What were the key differences between these action spaces and what design considerations went into selecting them?

2. The paper proposes several metrics for evaluating action spaces, including episodic rewards, expected constraints violations, normalized tracking error, etc. Why were these specific metrics chosen and what insights do they provide about the properties of different action spaces? 

3. Delta action spaces that integrate control targets over time seem to perform well. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of these spaces compared to direct output spaces? How sensitive are they to hyperparameters?

4. The paper finds that velocity-based action spaces tend to transfer better from simulation to the real world compared to position-based spaces. What explanations are provided for this result and what are other potential factors that could underlie it?  

5. What role does the normalized tracking error (NTE) play in determining the sim-to-real transfer capability of an action space? How does the NTE interact with other action space properties?

6. Joint velocity action spaces perform the best overall. What combination of favorable characteristics do they have that makes them well-suited for real-world robotic manipulation learning?

7. The paper mentions that the choice of action space contributes to the sim-to-real gap. What evidence supports this claim? What gaps are introduced and how? 

8. Safety is a concern, especially for torque-based action spaces. What approaches were taken to try to obtain safely deployable policies? What difficulties were encountered?

9. How sensitive are the results to hyperparameters settings for the different action spaces? What attempts were made to properly tune and provide apples-to-apples comparisons?

10. The study focuses on reaching and pushing tasks. How might the relative strengths/weaknesses of these action spaces change for other, more dynamic manipulation skills?
