## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a large-scale study on the role of action spaces in learning robotic arm manipulation skills and sim-to-real transfer. The authors evaluated 13 different action spaces, including novel combinations, spanning from raw torque control to Cartesian impedance policies, on reaching and pushing tasks. They introduced metrics to assess exploration behavior, emerging properties, sim-to-real gap, and real-world performance. Key findings indicate that Cartesian and higher-order derivative action spaces have better exploration, while velocity-based spaces transfer best to the real world. Multi-step delta spaces yielded lower tracking errors. Furthermore, the order of derivative and the tracking error were found to be the most influential factors on sim-to-real transfer. The best overall performance was achieved using joint velocity action spaces. The study provides unique insights into favorable action space properties and design guidelines for learning manipulations skills that transfer from simulation to the real world.
