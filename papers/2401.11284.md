## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions utilising a rating method by two human evaluators to generate ground truth labels for driver readiness. What are the potential limitations of using only two evaluators? How could the quality and robustness of the ground truth labels be improved?

2. The protocol outlined for collecting human ratings of driver readiness uses 2-second video segments. How might using shorter or longer intervals impact the accuracy of assigned ratings? What implications could this have on training machine learning models?

3. The paper employs cubic interpolation to convert the discrete human ratings into a continuous representation of driver readiness. What alternatives to cubic interpolation were considered and what were the reasons for final selection? 

4. The facial landmark extraction relies on the SPIGA model. How does the performance of SPIGA compare to other state-of-the-art facial landmark extraction models? What unique capabilities does it offer for this application?

5. The horizontal and vertical gaze ratios are used as indicators of driver attentiveness. What other gaze-related metrics could provide further insights into driver focus and readiness? How might factors like gaze velocity and acceleration contribute?

6. What other non-gaze related facial metrics, like facial expressions, could complement the model's capability to evaluate driver readiness more holistically? What additional data would need to be captured?

7. The LSTM model architecture combines CNN-extracted frame features and introduces LSTM layers to model temporal relationships. What alternative approaches could also capture time-series dependencies for this application? 

8. Time-series cross-validation is employed to account for temporal ordering in the data. How does this approach differ from regular k-fold cross-validation? What problems may arise if temporal dependencies are not considered?

9. The paper explores unidirectional and bidirectional LSTM models. What are the key differences in how these models comprehend temporal context? Why does bidirectional performance exceed unidirectional? 

10. What steps could be taken to further improve the model's robustness and generalizability across diverse drivers, vehicles, and operational conditions? How important is gathering more varied and extensive training data?
