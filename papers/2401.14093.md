# [McUDI: Model-Centric Unsupervised Degradation Indicator for Failure   Prediction AIOps Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14093)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- AIOps solutions for failure prediction suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept drift in operational data. 
- Periodic retraining is the current solution but requires large amounts of labeled data which is expensive to obtain.
- Unsupervised data distribution monitoring techniques raise many false alarms about drifts that don't affect model performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose McUDI, a model-centric unsupervised degradation indicator. 
- It works by extracting the most important features from a trained AIOps model and checks if the data distribution changes over time only on those features.
- This makes it sensitive only to drifts that affect model performance.

Contributions:
1. Proposal of McUDI and evaluation on two AIOps datasets showing ability to detect real model degrading drifts.
2. Demonstration that McUDI reduces false alarms compared to traditional data monitoring techniques.
3. Proposition of a model maintenance pipeline with McUDI that reduces labeled data needs and model re-deployment costs while maintaining performance.
4. Empirical evidence that monitoring number of feature changes is a poor indicator of model degradation.
5. Publicly available reproduction package.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel unsupervised and model-centric concept drift detection technique tailored for AIOps solutions. It demonstrates its abilities to detect real model degrading drifts and enable a cost-efficient model maintenance pipeline.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes McUDI, a model-centric unsupervised performance degradation indicator for failure prediction AIOps models that reduces retraining costs while preserving model performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing McUDI, a novel model-centric unsupervised performance degradation indicator for failure prediction AIOps models. Specifically:

1. McUDI is able to detect when AIOps failure prediction models require retraining due to concept drift, without needing true labels. This makes it suitable for real-world scenarios where labels are expensive. 

2. McUDI only checks for distribution changes in the features most relevant to the model, making it more accurate and raising fewer false alarms compared to traditional methods like KS test.

3. The paper proposes a maintenance pipeline incorporating McUDI which reduces the need for labeled data and model re-deployments while preserving performance.

4. The paper evaluates McUDI on two real-world AIOps datasets for job and disk failure prediction, showing it can reduce labeled samples needed by 30k and 260k respectively compared to periodic retraining, with similar model performance.

In summary, McUDI contributes an unsupervised, model-centric way to detect degradation in AIOps models, enabling more efficient model maintenance. The key benefit is reducing the need for expensive labeled data while still detecting concept drift.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) - The research field focused on applying machine learning to operational data to identify or predict failures or anomalies.

- Concept drift - Changes in operational data over time that can negatively impact the performance of AIOps models. Periodic retraining is used to address this.  

- Model degradation indicators - Tools to detect when an AIOps model requires retraining due to concept drift.

- McUDI (Model-centric Unsupervised Degradation Indicator) - The proposed unsupervised, model-centric degradation indicator to detect when retraining is needed. 

- Feature importance - A technique to rank features by their contribution to a model's predictive capability. Used within McUDI.

- Maintenance pipeline - The proposed pipeline incorporating McUDI to reduce retraining cost/frequency while preserving performance.

- Label costs - The expense of obtaining labeled data from domain experts to retrain models. McUDI helps reduce this.

- Job failure prediction - One of the AIOps tasks, using operational data to predict job failures.

- Disk failure prediction - Another AIOps task, using HDD stats to predict disk failures.
