# [VL-Mamba: Exploring State Space Models for Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13600)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great promise in tasks involving both vision and language. However, they rely on Transformers which have quadratic complexity during inference, making them computationally expensive. 

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes VL-Mamba, the first work exploring state space models for multimodal learning. VL-Mamba consists of - 

1) A pre-trained Mamba language model as the backbone instead of Transformer LMs. Mamba has been shown to have efficient long sequence modeling and linear complexity.

2) A Vision Encoder using ViT to extract image features. 

3) A novel MultiModal Connector with a Vision Selective Scan module to capture 2D visual context and two linear layers. The paper explores two scan mechanisms - Bidirectional-Scan across rows and columns, and Cross-Scan across diagonals.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes VL-Mamba as the first work utilizing state space models for multimodal learning rather than the standard Transformer architectures.

2) Empirically studies different components like language model variants, vision encoders and MultiModal Connector architectures. Introduces a MultiModal Connector with Vision Selective Scan module and two scan mechanisms to model 2D visual data.

3) Achieves competitive performance to Transformer-based MLLMs on 8 multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating efficiency of modeling long multimodal sequences using state space models.

In summary, the paper explores state space models for multimodal learning to overcome quadratic complexity limitations of Transformer-based MLLMs. It proposes VL-Mamba and empirically studies its different components to effectively model vision and language modalities. Experiments show promising results, proving the potential of applying state space models to multimodal domains.
