# [Learning Traveling Solitary Waves Using Separable Gaussian Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04883)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This LaTeX source code does not contain a full paper. Rather, it defines a set of journal options that can be passed to the \DeclareOption command.

Specifically, for each MDPI journal, it defines the journal name (\@journalfull), short name (\@journalshort), DOI abbreviation (\@doiabbr), ISSN number (\@ISSN), and some other metadata. 

So in summary, this code allows an MDPI LaTeX template to be customized for different MDPI journals by passing the journal option. It does not contain a research paper or make a scientific contribution on its own. It is just code to facilitate typesetting papers for submission to the various MDPI journals.
