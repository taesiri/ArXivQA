# [Compacting Binary Neural Networks by Sparse Kernel Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14470)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we further compress binary neural networks (BNNs) beyond the standard 1-bit per weight representation to achieve more efficient models?The key hypothesis is that the binary kernels learned in successful BNNs tend to be sparsely distributed, with most values clustered into a small number of frequently reused "codewords". By exploiting this to only use a subset of possible binary codewords, the authors propose they can represent weights with less than 1 bit on average. Their method, called Sparks, aims to show this can further reduce model size and computational costs of BNNs without sacrificing accuracy.In summary, the paper focuses on investigating how to compact BNN models by learning to select a sparse subset of binary codewords for representing weights, based on the observation that BNN kernels are naturally clustered. This allows further compression beyond standard 1-bit BNNs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a method called Sparks (Sparse Kernel Selection) to further compress binary neural networks (BNNs) by selecting a subset of codewords from the full binary codebook to represent the weights. - Formulating the codeword selection as a permutation learning problem and using the Gumbel-Sinkhorn technique to approximate and optimize the permutation matrix in an end-to-end manner.- Developing a novel Permutation Straight-Through Estimator (PSTE) to enable optimizing the codeword selection while maintaining the binary values.- Demonstrating that Sparks can effectively reduce both model size and computational costs of BNNs. Experiments on image classification and detection tasks show Sparks achieves competitive accuracy under comparable or even lower complexity budgets compared to state-of-the-art BNN methods.In summary, the key contribution is proposing Sparks, a codeword selection method to learn more compact BNNs via end-to-end permutation learning and PSTE, while maintaining or even improving accuracy over other BNN compression techniques. The paper shows empirically that Sparks can further compress BNNs and accelerate them with minimal performance degradation.
