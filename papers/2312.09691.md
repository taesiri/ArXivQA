# [Quilt: Robust Data Segment Selection against Concept Drifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09691)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper tackles the problem of concept drift in continuous machine learning pipelines, where the joint distribution of data and labels changes over time. This causes model accuracy to degrade. Existing methods take a model-centric approach where drifted historical data is discarded and the model is adapted to new data. However, discarding previous data is often unacceptable due to investments in labeling. 

This paper proposes a data-centric framework called Quilt that selects and retains useful historical data segments to maximize accuracy on new data. The key challenges are: (1) identifying and discarding drifted data segments that negatively impact accuracy, and (2) selecting minimal subsets of useful historical segments for efficient training without compromising accuracy.

Quilt solves the first challenge by defining a disparity score that uses gradient differences to measure drift severity between data segments. It discards segments exceeding a threshold. For the second challenge, Quilt builds on gradient-based data subset selection methods, but handles concept drifts. It defines a gain score to select historical segments that positively impact the validation loss.  

Quilt's segment selection algorithm discards drifted segments using the disparity score, then selects useful segments having positive gain. This holistic selection maximizes accuracy while minimizing training time. The scores have low overhead as they use gradient values.

Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate Quilt's superior accuracy over state-of-the-art concept drift adaptation and data selection methods. The gains are attributed to Quilt's explicit utilization of useful historical data. Ablations show worse accuracy and efficiency when removing either score, proving need for holistic selection.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) A data-centric framework for handling concept drift; (2) Novel disparity and gain scores for identifying drifts and usefulness using gradients; (3) An efficient algorithm for holistic selection of useful historical data; (4) Extensive evaluation demonstrating accuracy and efficiency gains.
