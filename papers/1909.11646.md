# [High Fidelity Speech Synthesis with Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11646)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is:Can generative adversarial networks (GANs) be effectively applied to high-fidelity text-to-speech synthesis, achieving performance comparable to current state-of-the-art autoregressive models like WaveNet?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Feed-forward convolutional GAN generators can produce high-fidelity raw audio speech signals.2) Using an ensemble of multiple random window discriminators operating on different frequency scales is an effective GAN architecture for this task.3) Novel quantitative evaluation metrics based on DeepSpeech features can reliably measure the performance of text-to-speech models. 4) Their proposed model, GAN-TTS, can achieve naturalness and audio fidelity comparable to WaveNet while being highly parallelizable thanks to the feed-forward generator.In summary, the paper aims to demonstrate that GANs are a viable alternative to autoregressive models for text-to-speech by proposing a novel GAN architecture and evaluation metrics tailored to this task. The key hypothesis is that their GAN-TTS model can match the state-of-the-art performance of WaveNet.
