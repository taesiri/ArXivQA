# [High Fidelity Speech Synthesis with Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11646)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is:

Can generative adversarial networks (GANs) be effectively applied to high-fidelity text-to-speech synthesis, achieving performance comparable to current state-of-the-art autoregressive models like WaveNet?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Feed-forward convolutional GAN generators can produce high-fidelity raw audio speech signals.

2) Using an ensemble of multiple random window discriminators operating on different frequency scales is an effective GAN architecture for this task.

3) Novel quantitative evaluation metrics based on DeepSpeech features can reliably measure the performance of text-to-speech models. 

4) Their proposed model, GAN-TTS, can achieve naturalness and audio fidelity comparable to WaveNet while being highly parallelizable thanks to the feed-forward generator.

In summary, the paper aims to demonstrate that GANs are a viable alternative to autoregressive models for text-to-speech by proposing a novel GAN architecture and evaluation metrics tailored to this task. The key hypothesis is that their GAN-TTS model can match the state-of-the-art performance of WaveNet.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introduction of GAN-TTS, a generative adversarial network for text-to-speech synthesis. This is the first successful application of GANs to generating high-fidelity speech audio.

2. Proposal of new quantitative evaluation metrics for speech synthesis models based on the DeepSpeech speech recognition network. These include Fréchet DeepSpeech Distance (FDSD), Kernel DeepSpeech Distance (KDSD), and their conditional variants cFDSD and cKDSD.

3. Experimental results demonstrating that GAN-TTS can generate speech with naturalness comparable to state-of-the-art autoregressive models like WaveNet, while being highly parallelizable thanks to the feedforward generator.

4. An ablation study validating the importance of key architectural choices like the ensemble of random window discriminators and use of multiple window sizes.

5. Overall, the paper shows GANs are a viable and efficient alternative to autoregressive models for text-to-speech, achieving similar fidelity but with faster sampling. The new evaluation metrics are also an important contribution for benchmarking future speech synthesis models.

In summary, the main innovation is the successful application of GANs to generate high-quality raw speech audio, enabled by architectural designs like the ensemble of random window discriminators. The proposed evaluation metrics are also a key contribution for quantitatively assessing speech generation models going forward.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces GAN-TTS, a generative adversarial network for high-fidelity text-to-speech synthesis, which uses a feed-forward convolutional generator and an ensemble of multi-frequency random window discriminators to evaluate generated audio realism and correspondence to input text.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) for speech synthesis:

- This paper introduces TTS-GAN, one of the first GAN models to generate high-fidelity speech audio. Most prior GAN research for audio focused on simpler datasets like spoken digit datasets or musical notes, rather than full speech.

- The generator is feedforward, unlike the autoregressive models like WaveNet that were previously state-of-the-art for raw audio generation. This makes TTS-GAN highly parallelizable.

- The use of an ensemble of conditional and unconditional random window discriminators is novel compared to prior GAN work. This design choice is critical to achieving good performance.

- The quantitative evaluation metrics proposed, Fréchet DeepSpeech Distance and Kernel DeepSpeech Distance, provide useful automatic ways to evaluate speech synthesis models by leveraging a pretrained speech recognition model.

- TTS-GAN achieves results competitive with WaveNet in terms of mean opinion score, while being more parallelizable and showing the potential of GANs for high-fidelity speech synthesis. Most prior GAN speech work did not match the fidelity of likelihood-based models.

- The scale of the model and dataset, with raw audio at 24kHz sampling, is larger than most prior work applying GANs to audio generation and closer to the scale of recent image GAN research.

Overall, this paper pushes GAN-based speech synthesis to a new level of fidelity and scalability. The architectural innovations and quantitative metrics are valuable contributions applicable to other speech generation models as well. It demonstrates GANs as a compelling alternative to likelihood-based models for speech.
