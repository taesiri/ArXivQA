# [A Challenge Dataset and Effective Models for Conversational Stance   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11145)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Existing stance detection research focuses on detecting stance towards targets within individual comments or posts. However, in real-world social media conversations, the stance is often expressed implicitly across multiple turns in a conversation thread. There lack high-quality multi-turn conversational stance detection (CSD) datasets to facilitate research in this area. 

- As such, the paper introduces a new challenging multi-turn CSD dataset (MT-CSD) comprising 15,876 annotated instances sourced from Reddit. MT-CSD poses the following challenges: (i) Implicit target references and coreference relations. (ii) Stances are expressed more implicitly through local sub-discussions instead of single posts. (iii) State-of-the-art stance detection methods exhibit only 50.47% accuracy on MT-CSD.

Proposed Solution:
- A global-local attention network (GLAN) is proposed specifically for conversational stance detection. 

- GLAN has three key modules - Text Representation Layer (based on BERT), Global-Local Attention Layers (Global: captures long-range dependencies; Local: focuses on local conversational nuances; Structural: captures nuances using graph convolutions), and Target-Attention Layer.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of new and challenging MT-CSD dataset for CSD. MT-CSD contains 15,876 annotated Reddit instances and poses new complexities.

- Proposal of a novel GLAN model for conversational stance detection. GLAN specifically tackles the long and short-range dependencies in conversations.

- Comprehensive evaluations and experiments on MT-CSD with several state-of-the-art baselines. Experimental findings demonstrate that MT-CSD poses significant challenges with the best model GLAN achieving only 50.47% accuracy. The dataset can catalyze future advancements in stance detection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces MT-CSD, a large and challenging multi-turn conversational stance detection dataset, and proposes GLAN, a novel model with global-local attention to address both long and short-range dependencies in conversations for stance detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces MT-CSD, a new multi-turn conversation stance detection dataset tailored for conversational stance detection. At 15,876 instances, MT-CSD is the largest human-labeled English conversational stance dataset to date. Its release is expected to advance research in conversational stance detection.

2) It proposes a novel global-local attention network (GLAN) architecture to address both long and short-range dependencies in conversations for stance detection. GLAN has three key components - a global module to capture long-range dependencies, a local module to focus on local nuances, and a structural module to leverage comment relations.

3) It conducts comprehensive experiments evaluating state-of-the-art stance detection methods on the MT-CSD dataset using multiple methodologies - fine-tuning deep neural networks, prompt-tuning pre-trained language models, and in-context learning with large language models. The results highlight remaining challenges in conversational stance detection, as even GLAN only achieves 50.47% accuracy.

In summary, the key contributions are the new MT-CSD dataset, the proposed GLAN model, and experimental analysis benchmarking state-of-the-art techniques and underscoring opportunities for future advancements in conversational stance detection.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The global-local attention network (GLAN) adopts a three-branch structure. What is the motivation behind using three branches rather than a single branch? How do the global, local, and structural branches complement each other?

2. The global branch aims to capture long-range dependencies in the conversation. How exactly does the global attention mechanism work here? Walk through the mathematical formulation step-by-step. 

3. The local branch uses convolutional neural networks to focus on local nuances. Explain the intuitions behind using CNN rather than RNN/LSTM for modeling local contexts. Also explain the configurations of the CNN layers.  

4. The structural branch leverages graph convolutional networks to model relations between comments. Elaborate on how the comment graph is constructed and how GCN is applied on top of it. What kind of relational information does GCN help capture?

5. The multi-hop attention (MHA) module is shared across the three branches. What is the motivation for using a multi-hop architecture? How does MHA work differently from standard attention? Explain the formulations.  

6. The target-attention layer performs attention between the aggregated branch vectors and the target vector. What is the intuition behind having a separate target-specific attention? Would it be possible to just use the output from the three branches directly?

7. Ablation studies show that removing any of the four components hurts performance. Analyze the performance drop when removing each component and explain what unique roles they play.

8. The method does not perform as well on large language models like LLMs and GPT. What could be the reasons? How can the method be adapted to better leverage the power of LLMs? 

9. One motivation of the work is to handle implicit target references in conversations. Does the current method explicitly model coreferences and topic shifts? If not, how can it be improved to handle them better?

10. The problem remains challenging even for GLAN, indicating room for improvement. What other network architectures or techniques not explored can further advance the state-of-the-art in conversational stance detection?
