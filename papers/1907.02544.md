# [Large Scale Adversarial Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02544)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether progress in image generation quality translates to improved representation learning performance. Specifically, the authors investigate whether extending the BigGAN model for image generation to learn an encoder as well (creating BigBiGAN) results in state-of-the-art unsupervised representation learning on ImageNet.The key hypothesis is that powerful generative models like BigGAN capture useful semantic information about complex image distributions like ImageNet, and that learning an encoder within this BigBiGAN framework will allow extracting these semantics in the form of useful representations for downstream tasks.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by extending BigGAN to BigBiGAN, the resulting model will achieve state-of-the-art unsupervised representation learning by leveraging the semantic information learned by BigGAN during generative modeling of images.
