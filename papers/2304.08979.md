## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper presents the first large-scale measurement of ChatGPT's reliability in generic question-answering scenarios. The authors evaluate ChatGPT's performance on over 5,000 questions across 10 datasets spanning 8 domains. They find that ChatGPT exhibits varying reliability across domains - it shows high correctness on recreation and technology questions but underperforms on law and science. The authors also reveal ChatGPT's deficiency in identifying unanswerable questions, with only a 27.8% detection rate. Qualitative analysis identifies four common failure reasons: hallucinatory facts, casual answers, lack of knowledge, and referential confusion. 

Paragraph 2: The paper then investigates how different system roles impact ChatGPT's reliability. Benign roles like "assistant" improve correctness while bad/jailbreak roles reduce correctness and force meaningless guesses for unanswerable questions. Surprisingly, the impact of roles is not evident from their descriptions alone. The authors also assess ChatGPT's resilience to adversarial attacks, finding it vulnerable to sentence and character-level perturbations. For example, changing one character can alter ChatGPT's response in certain cases. Overall, this comprehensive evaluation underscores the need to improve ChatGPT's reliability across domains, enhance unanswerable question detection, and strengthen security against adversarial inputs. The results provide valuable insights into ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations.
