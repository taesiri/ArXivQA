# [MIKE: A New Benchmark for Fine-grained Multimodal Entity Knowledge   Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14835)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal knowledge editing (MKE) is important for improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs), but current benchmarks focus on coarse-grained knowledge and do not address editing of fine-grained (FG) multimodal entity knowledge. This is a major gap since FG entity recognition is critical for practical applications of MLLMs.  

- Editing FG multimodal entity knowledge into MLLMs is challenging as it requires models to not only recognize visual entities but also map them to corresponding textual descriptions. Despite some initial capabilities, MLLM performance on FG entities lags compared to coarse-grained entities.

Proposed Solution - MIKE Benchmark:

- The paper introduces MIKE, a comprehensive benchmark to assess MLLM fine-grained multimodal entity knowledge editing from different perspectives.

- MIKE contains over 1000 fine-grained entities spanning 9 categories, with 5+ images per entity. Three challenging tasks are designed:
   - Vanilla Name Answering: Identify entity's name given another image of that entity
   - Entity-Level Caption: Caption image and specify entities present   
   - Complex Scenario Recognition: Recognize a particular edited entity among other entities

- A new Multi-Step Editing form is introduced where models are edited with 2-4 images of an entity before evaluation on the above tasks.

Main Contributions:

- First benchmark focused specifically on editing fine-grained multimodal entity knowledge in MLLMs. Carefully collected high-quality dataset of 1000+ fine-grained entities.

- Suite of challenging tasks (VNA, ELC, CSR) evaluating different aspects of fine-grained entity recognition capabilities.

- New Multi-Step Editing protocol that edits models with multiple images per entity to test efficiency.

- Extensive analysis showing current editing methods face significant challenges on the benchmark, underscoring the complexity of fine-grained knowledge editing.
