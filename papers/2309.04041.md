# Evaluation and Mitigation of Agnosia in Multimodal Large Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we systematically evaluate and mitigate the phenomenon of "agnosia" (inability to correctly process multimodal inputs) in multimodal large language models (MLLMs)? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) The concept of agnosia from neuropsychology is analogous to certain deficiencies observed in MLLMs, where they sometimes fail to correctly interpret multimodal inputs.2) Diagnosis and treatment methods used for agnosia in humans could inspire techniques to evaluate and reduce agnosia in MLLMs. Specifically, the authors propose conversational evaluations and instructional tuning as ways to assess and mitigate agnosia in MLLMs.3) By comprehensively evaluating and mitigating agnosia, the accuracy and reliability of MLLMs on multimodal tasks can be improved.The proposed EMMA framework aims to test these hypotheses by developing modules for evaluating and reducing agnosia in MLLMs using analysis and instructional tuning techniques inspired by human agnosia diagnosis and treatment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1) Proposing a novel framework called EMMA (Evaluation and Mitigation of Multimodal Agnosia) for evaluating and mitigating "agnosia" in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). 2) Developing an evaluation module within the EMMA framework that automatically generates fine-grained and diverse multimodal question-answering examples to assess MLLMs' abilities across different aspects like objects, attributes, and relations.3) Developing a mitigation module within EMMA that reduces agnosia in MLLMs through multimodal instruction tuning using fine-grained conversations about multimodal inputs.4) Conducting comprehensive experiments to evaluate agnosia in 8 state-of-the-art MLLMs using over 9K test samples generated by the evaluation module, revealing varying degrees of agnosia. 5) Demonstrating consistent accuracy improvements in the tested MLLMs after multimodal instruction tuning using the conversations generated by the mitigation module.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the novel EMMA framework encompassing systematic evaluation and mitigation modules to diagnose and treat "agnosia" in MLLMs using automatically generated fine-grained multimodal QA examples and conversations.
