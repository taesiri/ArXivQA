## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several potential future research directions for pre-trained models (PTMs) in natural language processing:1. Increasing the capacity and scale of PTMs by using deeper architectures, larger datasets, and more expensive training. However, more efficient model architectures, self-supervised pre-training tasks, optimizers, and training skills are needed to overcome hardware and software limitations.2. Improving the architecture of PTMs like Transformer to handle longer input sequences beyond 512 tokens, possibly using non-Transformer architectures found through neural architecture search.3. Designing task-specific PTMs and pre-training objectives for better transferability to downstream tasks. Also, extracting partial knowledge from large PTMs using techniques like model compression.4. Developing more parameter-efficient tuning approaches beyond fine-tuning, such as adapters or distillation, to share PTMs across tasks. More flexible knowledge transfer methods beyond fine-tuning could help as well.5. Improving interpretability and reliability of PTMs using methods from explainable AI. Adversarial evaluation is also important for understanding capabilities and vulnerabilities of PTMs. Overall, the inner workings and trustworthiness of PTMs need more exploration.In summary, the main future directions are increasing scale, finding better architectures, task-specific customization, more efficient tuning, and improving interpretability and robustness of PTMs. The goal is to develop more powerful yet practical PTMs that work well on diverse downstream tasks.
