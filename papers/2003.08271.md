## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a pre-trained model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for natural language processing. BERT is trained on two novel unsupervised prediction tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. In masked language modeling, some percentage of input tokens are randomly masked, and the model tries to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. In next sentence prediction, the model receives pairs of sentences as input and learns to predict if the second sentence is the subsequent sentence in the original document. BERT uses a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder architecture, which allows it to learn deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context. Pre-training on large plain text corpora allows BERT to learn a deep representation of language that can then be fine-tuned for a wide range of NLP tasks. Experiments show superior performance on a variety of NLP tasks with minimal task-specific architecture modifications.

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords are:

- Pre-trained models (PTMs): The paper provides a comprehensive review of pre-trained models for natural language processing. PTMs are neural models that are first pre-trained on large text corpora and then fine-tuned for downstream NLP tasks.

- Self-supervised learning: Most PTMs use self-supervised learning objectives like masked language modeling or next sentence prediction during pre-training. These allow the model to learn useful representations from unlabeled text.  

- Language representation learning: PTMs learn universal language representations from large amounts of text. The pre-trained representations encode linguistic knowledge and help improve performance on downstream tasks.

- Contextual word embeddings: PTMs like BERT produce contextual embeddings for each token based on the full input text. This captures polysemy and distinguishes word meanings based on context.

- Fine-tuning: After pre-training, PTMs are adapted to downstream tasks via fine-tuning, which slightly updates the pre-trained parameters for the target task. This is more effective than training from scratch.

- Transformer: Most recent PTMs use the Transformer architecture. Self-attention in Transformers can effectively model long-range dependencies in text.

- Taxonomy: The paper categorizes PTMs based on architecture, pre-training task, representation type, and other extensions like multi-lingual or knowledge-enriched models.
