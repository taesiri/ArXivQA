 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents MM-Navigator, an agent system built on GPT-4V for smartphone graphical user interface (GUI) navigation. The agent takes as input a screen image and natural language instruction, and outputs executable actions to complete the instruction through interacting with the GUI. The authors collect an analytic iOS dataset and test GPT-4V on intended action description and localized action execution. GPT-4V achieves 90.9% and 74.5% accuracy on generating reasonable action descriptions and executing correct actions, respectively.

This paper presents MM-Navigator, a GPT-4V-based agent system for smartphone graphical user interface (GUI) navigation. The key idea is to leverage the advanced multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs), specifically GPT-4V, to enable an agent to interact with smartphone screens in a human-like manner. The authors identify two key challenges: generating natural language descriptions of intended actions, and executing localized actions on the screen. To address these, they use set-of-marks tagging to ground screen elements and enable precise action execution. The system is benchmarked on an iOS dataset collected by the authors, and a subset of the Android AITW dataset, significantly outperforming previous methods in zero-shot settings. Detailed analyses reveal GPT-4V's strong screen understanding and reasoning, but also limitations to be addressed in future work.

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How effective are large multimodal models (LMMs), specifically GPT-4, for zero-shot smartphone graphical user interface (GUI) navigation?

The authors investigate using GPT-4 for the task of following natural language instructions to navigate through smartphone GUIs. Their goal is to benchmark GPT-4's capabilities for screen understanding, action reasoning, and precise action localization in a zero-shot setting, without any task-specific training. 

The key hypotheses tested are:

1) LMMs like GPT-4 can achieve strong zero-shot performance on smartphone GUI navigation due to their advanced reasoning and multimodal understanding abilities. 

2) Their proposed system, MM-Navigator, can effectively leverage GPT-4 for this task by incorporating action histories and set-of-mark tags for precise screen grounding.

3) GPT-4-based zero-shot GUI navigation will outperform previous methods that rely on supervised training or converting screens to text descriptions.

In summary, the central research question is evaluating how suitable large multimodal models are for generalizable, zero-shot smartphone GUI control when prompted in an appropriate way. The key hypothesis is that the reasoning capacity of models like GPT-4 makes them uniquely suited for this challenging task.
