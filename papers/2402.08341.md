# [Eliciting Personality Traits in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08341)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT are being used by job candidates to generate responses to anticipated interview questions. This could impact how candidates are evaluated if the LLMs' personality traits are inferred from the generated text.  

- LLMs are "black boxes" so their personality traits are unknown. Understanding the personality profiles of LLMs used for interview prep is important for fair and accurate evaluation of candidates.

Methodology:
- Prompted 27 LLMs with 50 question stems (25 common interview questions, 25 questions to elicit Big 5 personality traits) to generate text completions. 

- Analyzed text outputs using fine-tuned personality classifiers to quantify Big 5 traits - openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability.

- Compared trait levels between standard interview vs trait-activating questions to see if models exhibit trait activation like humans. 

- Evaluated small vs large models and impact of fine-tuning on personality profiles.

Key Findings:
- All models showed high openness, low extraversion, medium other traits. Not affected by trait-activating questions.

- Larger models displayed broader trait ranges but still no trait activation. More parameters associated with higher openness, conscientiousness.  

- Fine-tuning causes minor personality modulations depending on dataset.

Implications: 
- Reliance on LLMs for interview prep could skew applicant evaluations if model personality affects text generation.

- Lack of trait activation highlights divergence from human responses. Affects utility if true applicant personality not reflected.

- Consistency of LLM text could help detect use of generative AI in interviews.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the personality traits of various large language models by providing them with interview-style prompts and analyzing their responses using text classifiers to measure levels of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is using a novel elicitation approach to measure the personality traits of large language models (LLMs) based on their responses to interview questions. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Prompting multiple LLMs with different parameter sizes (including Llama-2, Falcon, Mistral, Bloom, GPT, OPT, XLNet) with interview questions designed to reflect common prompts (tell me about yourself, strengths, etc.) as well as questions intended to elicit particular Big Five personality traits.

2) Analyzing the textual responses from the LLMs using fine-tuned classifiers trained on the myPersonality dataset to measure their Big Five personality traits. 

3) Finding that generally all LLMs demonstrate high openness and low extraversion, but models with more parameters exhibit a broader range of personality traits that can be modulated based on fine-tuning datasets.

4) Observing that unlike humans, the LLMs are unaffected by trait-activating questions intended to elicit higher levels of particular traits.

5) Discussing implications around use of generative AI by job applicants to prepare for interviews, where reliance on LLMs could influence perceptions of applicants' personalities.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel elicitation and analysis approach to investigate and compare the personality traits of LLMs based on their interview question responses.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Personality traits 
- Big Five personality model (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability/neuroticism)  
- Text generation
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Neural networks
- Trait activation theory
- Job interviews
- Recruitment 
- Algorithmic hiring 
- Model transparency and interpretability
- Fine-tuning language models
- Comparative analysis of different LLMs (GPT, OPT, XLNet, Llama 2, Falcon, etc.)

The paper examines the personality traits of various LLMs by providing them with interview-style prompts to complete and then analyzing the generated text using classifiers to measure Big Five traits. It compares these traits across models and parameter sizes, and in response to standard interview vs trait-activating questions. The goal is to increase model transparency and understand implications for use of generative AI in recruitment contexts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using prompt statements for the language models to complete rather than having them directly answer questions. Can you explain in more detail why this approach was chosen over having the models directly respond to interview questions? What are the limitations of the models in terms of question answering capabilities?

2. Five prompts were created for each trait/theme, resulting in 25 prompts per category. Can you explain the rationale behind choosing 5 prompts per category? Were any statistical methods or power analyses done to determine this number or was it more of an arbitrary choice? 

3. For the trait-activating prompts, you mention adapting some questions from previous research and creating others based on the IPIP scales. Can you expand more on the process of adapting these questions and ensuring they adequately captured the traits you were trying to elicit? 

4. 1000 responses were generated per prompt. Walk me through how you determined this number was sufficient to conduct the analysis and determine the personality traits of the models based on the text outputs.

5. The maximum sentence length was set at 128 words. How was this limit determined and what impact could longer or shorter maximum sentence lengths have had on the language used in the model outputs?

6. In the post-processing of the text, non-ASCII characters, repeated words, and nonsense words were removed. What proportion of the total text required this type of editing and could this cleaning process impact the personality traits reflected in the texts? 

7. For the classifier model used, only the BERT-based models are discussed. Were any other classifier models tested that did not make it into the final paper? If so, how did they compare in terms of performance?

8. Beyond performance metrics, what other factors led you to select the BERT-based classifier models over other options you may have explored?

9. The process of normalizing the classifier scores relative to the prompt is touched on very briefly. Can you walk through this process in greater depth and the rationale behind it?

10. In analyzing the results, you differentiate between small and large language models. What informed the threshold chosen to make this distinction and would you consider any alternative delineations between model sizes?
