# [Incremental Quasi-Newton Methods with Faster Superlinear Convergence   Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02359)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the finite-sum optimization problem where the objective function is a sum of many component functions. Each component function is assumed to be strongly convex and have Lipschitz continuous gradients and Hessians. Such problems arise frequently in machine learning, for example in empirical risk minimization. When the number of components is large, it is expensive to compute the full gradient or Hessian at each iteration. 

The paper focuses on developing efficient second-order incremental methods that have low per-iteration complexity while still achieving fast (superlinear) convergence rates. Recently proposed incremental quasi-Newton methods like IQN achieve asymptotic superlinear convergence but do not have an explicit rate. Other methods like IGS and SLIQN achieve local superlinear rates that depend on the condition number, which can be large.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes two incremental quasi-Newton methods called LISR-1 and LISR-k:

1. LISR-1 employs a greedy symmetric rank-1 update to construct the Hessian approximations. It updates only one Hessian approximation per iteration in a cyclic order.  

2. LISR-k uses greedy symmetric rank-k updates to construct more accurate Hessian approximations at the cost of higher per-iteration complexity.

Both methods scale the Hessian approximations periodically to ensure positive definiteness. A key technique called "lazy scaling" is used to keep per-iteration costs low.

Main Results:
- LISR-1 achieves a superlinear rate of (1−1/d)^(t/n) that is independent of the condition number, unlike prior methods.

- LISR-k achieves an even faster superlinear rate of (1−k/d)^(t/n) by using more accurate block updates.

- Both methods match the low per-iteration complexity of Õ(d^2) flops for LISR-1 and Õ(kd^2) flops for LISR-k.

- Experiments on quadratic and logistic regression problems validate the faster convergence of the proposed methods over state-of-the-art.

In summary, the paper proposes efficient incremental quasi-Newton methods that enjoy provably faster convergence guarantees than existing methods. The combination of superlinear convergence and low iteration cost makes these methods attractive for large-scale optimization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes efficient incremental quasi-Newton methods named LISR-1 and LISR-k for finite-sum convex optimization, and shows they achieve condition number-free local superlinear convergence rates faster than existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes two main contributions:

1. It proposes a new incremental quasi-Newton method called Lazy Incremental Symmetric Rank-1 (LISR-1) for solving finite-sum minimization problems. LISR-1 uses a symmetric rank-1 update to construct the Hessian approximation and enjoys a condition number-free local superlinear convergence rate of O((1-d^{-1})^{t/n}). 

2. The paper extends LISR-1 to a block quasi-Newton method called Lazy Incremental Symmetric Rank-k (LISR-k) by incorporating a symmetric rank-k update. LISR-k achieves an even faster local superlinear convergence rate of O((1-kd^{-1})^{t/n}), where k is the rank of the update.

In summary, the key contributions are two new incremental quasi-Newton methods with proven faster superlinear convergence guarantees compared to prior methods. The efficiency of LISR-1 and LISR-k is also demonstrated through numerical experiments.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Finite-sum optimization
- Incremental quasi-Newton methods
- Superlinear convergence 
- Hessian approximation
- Broyden family updates
- Symmetric rank-1 (SR1) update
- Lazy propagation
- Condition number
- Explicit convergence rates
- Block quasi-Newton methods

The paper proposes efficient incremental quasi-Newton methods called LISR-1 and LISR-k for solving finite-sum convex optimization problems. It incorporates ideas like the SR1 update, lazy propagation strategy, and block updates to achieve faster superlinear convergence rates that do not depend on the condition number. The analysis provides explicit convergence rates for the proposed methods. So keywords like "finite-sum optimization", "incremental quasi-Newton methods", "superlinear convergence", "Hessian approximation", "symmetric rank-1 update", "condition number", and "explicit convergence rates" seem highly relevant to this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two algorithms: LISR-1 and LISR-k. What is the key difference between these two algorithms and why does LISR-k converge faster theoretically?

2. The paper argues that the proposed methods have faster convergence rates than prior incremental quasi-Newton methods like SLIQN. What specifically about the symmetric rank-1/rank-k update framework allows it to shave off the dependency on the condition number in the convergence rate?

3. When initializing the Hessian approximations, the paper chooses $B_i^0 = (1 + M\sqrt{L}r_0)^2 E_i^0$. What is the motivation behind this particular scaling strategy and how does it impact the convergence guarantees? 

4. The paper utilizes a cyclic update rule to lazily update the Hessian approximations. What is the intuition behind only updating one Hessian approximation per iteration and how does this lazy strategy interact with the convergence analysis?

5. The greedy update direction $\bar{u}(G,A)$ used in LISR-1 depends only on the diagonals of the matrix $G-A$. Why is this specific direction enough to guarantee improved Hessian approximations after rank-1 updates?

6. For LISR-k, how was the block size $k$ chosen? Is there an optimal $k$ that balances convergence rate with computational complexity? What factors determine this?

7. The convergence rates proven in the paper are for non-convex objectives, assuming only smoothness and strong convexity. Can these rates be improved for convex or quadratic objectives? What additional assumptions would be needed?

8. The paper focuses on an incremental first-order oracle model. Could the proposed method be extended to a stochastic gradient setting? What modifications would be required?

9. A key quantity in the analysis is the measure $\nu(G,A) = \frac{d\kappa \text{tr}(G-A)}{\text{tr}(A)}$. Why is this a more suitable measure than the trace difference $\text{tr}(G-A)$ for bounding approximation errors?

10. The experiments showcase significant gains over baselines. Is the improvement consistent across problem conditioning and dimensions? When do the gains start diminishing?
