# [Uncertainty-Aware Deployment of Pre-trained Language-Conditioned   Imitation Learning Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18222)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large-scale robotic policies trained on diverse datasets have potential to enable general-purpose robots, but reliable generalization to new environments remains challenging.
- Lack of well-calibrated, task-specific uncertainty estimates hinders generalization capabilities and understanding of them.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a calibration method tailored to the task of interest to refine model outputs and generate confidence scores approximating likelihood of imitating expert.  
- Propose an uncertainty-aware action selection technique that aggregates local information of candidate actions based on calibrated model (See Algorithm 1).
- Apply approach on top of three pre-trained language-conditioned imitation learning models (Perceiver-Actor, RVT, CLIPort) without additional training.

Key Contributions:
- Novel calibration step to align model uncertainties with likelihood of matching expert demonstration on specific task.
- Novel uncertainty-aware action selection that leverages calibrated uncertainties. 
- Show that proposed approach boosts task completion rates across the three models, especially helping conservative grasping and avoiding isolated high-confidence predictions.
- Demonstrate importance of calibration for simpler models, but less need for elaborate CLIPort model.
- Show potential for uncertainty-aware decisions to improve generalization with distractor objects.

In summary, the key idea is to use calibration and uncertainty-aware decisions to improve performance of pre-trained imitation learning models on robotic manipulation tasks without further training. The method is broadly applicable and offers notable gains on seen tasks as well as potential improvements in generalizability.
