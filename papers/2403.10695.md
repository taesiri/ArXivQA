# [EAGLE: An Edge-Aware Gradient Localization Enhanced Loss for CT Image   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10695)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate CT image reconstruction is important for diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Traditional analytical reconstruction methods can be slow or produce low quality images.  Deep learning approaches have shown promise to improve reconstruction quality.
- However, the choice of loss function profoundly impacts reconstructed image quality. MSE loss often causes blurry images lacking details. Alternative loss functions designed to improve quality can introduce artifacts or other problems.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Eagle-Loss, a new loss function to improve visual quality of reconstructed CT images by enhancing sharpness of edges and details.
- Eagle-Loss analyzes localized features within gradient map patches. It computes variance within patches to form a variance map. Frequency analysis is then applied on the variance map.  
- This allows joint optimization of both magnitude and phase information crucial for clear edges and image sharpness.

Key Contributions:
- Novel concept of applying frequency analysis on localized variance features from gradient maps. This has not been explored before for CT reconstruction.
- Eagle-Loss consistently improves visual quality and sharpness of reconstructed images across multiple network architectures and tasks:
  - Low-dose CT reconstruction
  - CT field-of-view extension
- Eagle-Loss also shows promise as a regularizer in algebraic reconstruction technique (ART)
- The approach is model-independent and addresses limitations of current loss functions like blurring, artifacts or bias
- A modified public dataset for CT field-of-view extension is openly shared

In summary, Eagle-Loss is an innovative loss function using localized gradient analysis and frequency domain techniques to improve sharpness and edge quality in CT image reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate its versatility across tasks and network architectures.
