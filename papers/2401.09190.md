Problem:
- Dental image analysis plays a vital role in healthcare, but manual analysis is time-consuming and subjective. Deep learning methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show promise for automating tasks like dental image segmentation.
- However, there is a need to systematically review the state-of-the-art in CNN-based approaches for dental image segmentation to identify trends, datasets, frameworks, research gaps and future directions. 

Methodology:
- The paper conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 45 relevant studies on CNN-based dental image segmentation published over 2014-2023. 
- The SLR methodology involved a structured search process, screening based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, data extraction and analysis to address 7 defined research questions on topics like status of research, key motivations, algorithms used, evaluation metrics, limitations and potential future work.

Key Findings:
- CNNs are applied in dental image analysis for tasks like tooth detection, periapical lesion segmentation, dental condition diagnosis and age/sex determination.
- Popular frameworks used include Keras, PyTorch and TensorFlow. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, AUC, Dice coefficient and IoU.  
- Key gaps exist around dataset size and diversity, model interpretability, standardized metrics and model validation across sites.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a systematic review of 45 recent studies, analyzing research trends on CNN use in dental image segmentation
- Outlines common objectives, frameworks, algorithms, datasets and evaluation metrics  
- Identifies limitations around datasets, model validation, explainability and standardized measures
- Highlights research gaps and suggests focus areas for advancing the state-of-the-art going forward through larger diverse datasets, model optimizations and clinical validations

The summary covers the key details around the problem being addressed, methodology used, significant results obtained, open challenges highlighted and future work suggested to advance CNN-based approaches for dental image segmentation.
