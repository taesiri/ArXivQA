# [Learning Dynamical Systems Encoding Non-Linearity within Space Curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11948)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Learning nonlinear dynamical systems (DS) from demonstrations for robotic control is challenging. Current methods struggle to achieve a good trade-off between stability guarantees, accuracy in reproducing demonstrations, computational efficiency, and adaptability to changes in the environment. 

- Specifically, ensuring stability often overly constrains the complexity of learnable behaviors. Approaches based on learning latent spaces struggle with computational efficiency. Obstacle avoidance is typically handled separately in an ad-hoc manner, compromising stability.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a geometrical framework for learning nonlinear DS that encodes the nonlinearity within the curvature of a higher dimensional latent manifold. 

- The DS is modeled as a harmonic oscillator on this Riemannian manifold. By learning the Euclidean embedding of this manifold, the nonlinearity of the DS in the chart space representation arises from the manifold's curvature.

- This framework extends naturally to second-order damped DS. The explicit embedding representation also allows direct adaptation to obstacles by locally deforming the space.

Main Contributions:
- A geometrical approach to learn complex nonlinear DS that ensures global asymptotic stability irrespective of the manifold's curvature.

- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reproducing demonstrations while being up to 5 times more efficient computationally compared to baselines.

- Naturally extends to second-order DS with techniques to handle velocity differences from demonstrations. Enables concave obstacle avoidance without compromising stability.

- Provides interpretable visualization of how manifold's curvature induces apparent nonlinearity in the chart space DS. Allows direct control over this curvature for online adaptation.

- Developed differentiable PyTorch library for learning policies and high-performance C++ library for DS control on robots. Demonstrated on controlling a 7-DOF real robot.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel geometrical learning framework for nonlinear DS that unifies stability, accuracy, efficiency and adaptability within a simple and interpretable approach applicable to real robotic platforms.
