# [Fuzzy Rank-based Late Fusion Technique for Cytology image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10884)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Cytology image segmentation is challenging due to complex cell structures and overlapping regions. 
- Supervised learning requires large annotated datasets which are costly. 
- Existing fusion techniques have shown promise for classification but not extensively explored for segmentation.

Proposed Solution:
- Use late fusion to combine multiple base segmentation models - UNet, SegNet and PSPNet
- Apply fuzzy rank-based voting as the fusion rule to leverage probability outputs from each base model
- Evaluate on two cytology image datasets - cervical (Herlev) and breast cytology (JUCYT-v1)

Main Contributions:
- Propose a fuzzy logic based late fusion technique for cytology image segmentation
- Show improved performance over individual base models and traditional fusion rules
- Achieve maximum MeanIoU scores of 84.27% on Herlev dataset and 83.79% on JUCYT-v1 dataset
- First application of fuzzy rank-based voting for fusing segmentation models in digital pathology/cytology

In summary, the key idea is to use a fuzzy rank-based voting late fusion approach to combine multiple semantic segmentation models in order to improve cytology image segmentation performance over single models, addressing the problem of limited annotated data. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two cytology image datasets.
