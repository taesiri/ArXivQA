# [Class Probability Matching Using Kernel Methods for Label Shift   Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07282)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces a new method called class probability matching using kernel methods (CPMKM) to address the problem of label shift adaptation in domain adaptation. Label shift adaptation refers to the scenario where the distribution differences between the source and target domains arise solely from variations in class probability rather than feature distribution. While existing methods typically employ feature probability matching (FPM) in the multi-dimensional feature space to estimate the one-dimensional class probability ratio, CPMKM proposes directly matching the class probability functions on the label space. Specifically, the authors first establish a new representation of the source domain's class probability using the feature probability ratio. Then by incorporating kernel logistic regression for conditional probability estimation, they propose the CPMKM algorithm that estimates the class probability ratio by minimizing the distance between the source and target domain's class probability estimators on the label space. Theoretically, the authors prove that CPMKM achieves the optimal convergence rates for label shift adaptation under mild assumptions. Empirically, CPMKM demonstrates superior performance over FPM-based and maximum-likelihood methods on real datasets, especially for problems with a large number of classes. Overall, by avoiding potential issues of FPM in high-dimensional spaces, CPMKM provides an effective algorithm tailored to label shift adaptation.
