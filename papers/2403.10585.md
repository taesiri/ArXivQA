# [Solving General Noisy Inverse Problem via Posterior Sampling: A Policy   Gradient Viewpoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10585)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of solving general noisy image inverse problems such as super-resolution, inpainting, and deblurring using diffusion generative models without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. The key challenges are that the input image guidance signal can be inaccurate due to noise, and existing methods either rely on linearity assumptions of the inverse problem or do not estimate the guidance score accurately.

Proposed Method: 
The paper proposes Diffusion Policy Gradient (DPG), a method to accurately estimate the guidance score function for a diffusion generative model using a policy gradient perspective. Specifically, it views the intermediate noisy images as policies and the final reconstructed image as the state selected by the policy. Using this viewpoint combined with approximations and techniques from policy gradient methods, DPG provides a more accurate estimate of the guidance score compared to prior works, especially in early diffusion steps.

Key Contributions:
- Formulates image inversion as posterior sampling and estimates the guidance score using policy gradient and Monte Carlo sampling for tractability.
- Score function estimated by DPG is more accurate than prior methods like Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), leading to better detail recovery.
- Eliminates need for SVD-based decomposition or invertibility assumptions, enabling a range of nonlinear inverse tasks.
- Experiments on image datasets (FFHQ, ImageNet, LSUN) and tasks like super-resolution, inpainting, deblurring demonstrate DPG's improved image quality over alternatives.

In summary, the key novelty is in accurately estimating the guidance score for diffusion inversion using ideas from policy gradient, which translates to state-of-the-art results on multiple nonlinear inverse problems without task-specific finetuning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Diffusion Policy Gradient (DPG) to estimate the guidance score for solving general noisy image inverse problems using pretrained diffusion models, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or decomposition of the distortion operator.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Diffusion Policy Gradient (DPG) to estimate the guidance score function for solving noisy image inverse problems using pretrained diffusion generative models. Specifically:

- DPG views the intermediate noisy images as policies and the predicted clean images as states selected by the policies. It then estimates the guidance score function from a policy gradient perspective. 

- DPG eliminates the need to compute pseudoinverses or perform SVD decomposition. So it can solve a wide range of linear and non-linear inverse problems without task-specific model finetuning.

- The estimated guidance score function by DPG is more accurate than prior methods like Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), especially in early stages of the diffusion process. This allows recovering image structure earlier and thus generating higher quality results.

- Experiments show DPG achieves better image restoration quality and consistency compared to DPS and other baselines on tasks like super-resolution, inpainting, and deblurring. It also works well under Gaussian and Poisson noise.

In summary, the key contribution is the DPG method for accurately estimating guidance scores to solve general noisy image inverse problems using pretrained diffusion models. DPG outperforms prior work in image quality and robustness.

The paper proposes a new method called "Diffusion Policy Gradient (DPG)" to estimate the guidance score function for solving noisy image inverse problems using diffusion models, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Key ideas include formulating image generation as posterior sampling, viewing noisy images as policies, computing guidance scores via policy gradient, and comparing with prior diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) methods. The approach is applied to tasks like super-resolution, inpainting, deblurring etc. on datasets like FFHQ, ImageNet and LSUN. So the key terms reflect this focus on diffusion models, noisy image inversion, policy gradients, guidance scores, and comparisons to related DPS methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes Diffusion Policy Gradient (DPG) to estimate the guidance score function for solving noisy image inverse problems. How does DPG connect the policy gradient method in reinforcement learning to the computation of the guidance score? What is the intuition behind this connection?

2. DPG redefines each noisy image as a policy and the predicted clean image as the state selected by the policy. What is the benefit of formulating the problem in this way compared to prior work like Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS)?

3. The paper leverages reward shaping to reduce the variance when estimating the policy gradient. Why is high variance a problem when directly applying Monte Carlo estimation? How does deducting a leave-one-out bias term help?

4. The paper mentions that DPG eliminates the need for computing a closed-form pseudo-inverse or performing SVD decomposition. Why do methods like SDEdit and DDNM rely on these decompositions? What makes DPG more flexible?

5. Under what conditions does the score function estimated by DPG become equivalent to the one estimated by DPS? What causes the discrepancy between the two methods' score functions?  

6. How does Figure 3 demonstrate that DPG can recover the sketch and shape of the image earlier in the diffusion process compared to DPS? What does this suggest about the accuracy of DPG's score estimation?

7. The experiments show DPG achieves better quantitative metrics like lower LPIPS and FID score. Qualitatively, what kind of details do the DPG results restore better than DPS?

8. The method works well for linear inverse problems like super-resolution and deblurring. How might DPG be extended to solve nonlinear inverse problems where computing the SVD is impossible?

9. What are some limitations of DPG compared to methods like Î GDM that directly utilize a differentiable loss function? In what cases might DPG struggle?

10. The runtime of DPG with DDPM sampling is longer than DPS due to MC sampling. How does using the DDIM sampler help accelerate runtime while maintaining result quality?
