# [Hardwiring ViT Patch Selectivity into CNNs using Patch Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17848)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) Do ViTs have better "patch selectivity" than CNNs, meaning they are better able to ignore out-of-context image patches? 

2) Can training CNNs with the proposed Patch Mixing data augmentation method improve their patch selectivity, making them more robust to occlusion?

3) Is there a correlation between patch selectivity and robustness to natural occlusion? 

Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:

- ViTs can more easily discount signal from out-of-context patches due to their self-attention mechanisms, allowing them to handle occlusion better than CNNs (Hypothesis 1). 

- Models with better patch selectivity will tend to perform better under natural occlusion (Hypothesis 2).

- Training models with Patch Mixing will improve their ability to ignore out-of-context information (Hypothesis 3).

The experiments then aim to test these hypotheses by comparing ViTs and CNNs on patch replacement attacks, training networks with Patch Mixing, evaluating performance on occlusion datasets, and using the proposed c-RISE method to measure patch selectivity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

- Identifying an important difference between CNNs and ViTs in terms of their ability to handle occlusion and ignore out-of-context image patches. The paper shows that ViTs are naturally better at this "patch selectivity", while CNNs struggle more.

- Proposing Patch Mixing, a data augmentation method that inserts patches from other images into training images to simulate occlusion. The paper shows this improves CNNs' ability to ignore out-of-context patches, making them more like ViTs. 

- Introducing two new challenging occlusion datasets (SMD and ROD) to evaluate model performance under occlusion.

- Developing a new explainability method called contrastive RISE (c-RISE) to visualize and quantify patch selectivity in both CNNs and ViTs.

- Demonstrating through experiments that CNNs trained with Patch Mixing have improved robustness to occlusion on several benchmarks, while ViTs do not improve much since they already have good patch selectivity.

In summary, the main contribution is identifying the "patch selectivity" difference between CNNs and ViTs, and developing the Patch Mixing technique to reduce this gap by improving CNNs' ability to ignore out-of-context image patches and handle occlusion. The paper provides empirical evidence and analysis to support these findings.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Patch Mixing data augmentation to train CNNs to acquire ViT-like capabilities to ignore out-of-context image patches, making CNNs more robust to occlusion and bridging the gap between CNNs and ViTs in handling out-of-context information.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on Vision Transformers and convolutional neural networks:

- The main contribution of this paper is using Patch Mixing augmentation to train CNNs to have more ViT-like "patch selectivity" and be more robust to occlusion. This is a novel idea not explored in other works. Previous papers like Vaswani et al. 2021 and Naseer et al. 2021 studied differences between ViTs and CNNs but did not propose methods to make CNNs more ViT-like.

- This paper thoroughly evaluates patch selectivity and occlusion robustness using several datasets. Other papers like Pinto et al. 2022 and Ruiz et al. 2022 studied robustness but were not focused specifically on occlusion. The new proposed datasets SMD and ROD seem uniquely challenging for studying occlusion.

- The paper compares modern vision architectures like ConvNeXt and Swin Transformers. Many prior works studied older CNNs like ResNet, so the comparison to newer models is more relevant. The findings align with some prior works showing ViTs handle occlusion better, but offer new insights with modern architectures.

- The c-RISE method for model explanation is a nice contribution for analyzing vision models in a modality-agnostic way. Other papers have used input modification like RISE for explanations, but c-RISE's contrastive approach is better suited for studying patch selectivity.

Overall, I think this paper provides valuable new insights on training occlusion-robust CNNs by making them more ViT-like. The experiments are comprehensive and the ideas are well-motivated. It moves beyond just analyzing differences between CNNs and ViTs to actually improving CNNs. The results seem promising and impactful for the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several potential future research directions:

- Investigate Patch Mixing with other architectures like ConvMixer and MobileNets. The authors focused on ConvNeXt and Swin Transformers in this work, but patch selectivity could be studied in other CNN and Transformer models.

- Try different mixing strategies beyond random uniform patching. The authors use a simple random patch replacement strategy, but more intelligent approaches could be explored.

- Develop new occlusion datasets and benchmarks. The authors propose SMD and ROD in this work, but additional datasets modeling real-world occlusion would enable more thorough evaluation.

- Study the effect of Patch Mixing on other tasks like object detection and segmentation. This work focuses on image classification, but Patch Mixing could potentially improve robustness in other vision tasks. 

- Analyze how patch selectivity develops during training. The authors demonstrate improved patch selectivity after training with Patch Mixing, but the dynamics of how it evolves could be an interesting direction.

- Investigate connections between patch selectivity and attention. The self-attention mechanism in Transformers may relate to their inherent patch selectivity.

- Develop better quantitative metrics of patch selectivity. The authors propose using contrastive saliency maps, but more refined metrics could better capture this characteristic.

- Explore how insights from Patch Mixing could transfer to other modalities like video, point clouds, etc. The concept of patch selectivity is not limited to images.

In summary, the authors suggest further work on studying patch selectivity in other models and tasks, developing better datasets and metrics, and analyzing the underlying mechanisms that allow networks to ignore out-of-context signals. Advancing research in these areas could lead to more reliable computer vision systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores differences between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) in their ability to handle occlusion and ignore out-of-context image patches. The authors introduce the concept of "patch selectivity" to measure this capability and find ViTs have higher inherent patch selectivity than CNNs. They propose Patch Mixing data augmentation to simulate ViT patch selectivity in CNNs by inserting patches from other images into training data. Experiments show Patch Mixing improves CNN robustness on occlusion benchmarks without benefiting ViTs much, indicating it instills an ability CNNs lack but ViTs possess naturally. The authors also develop a modified RISE explainability method called c-RISE to visualize patch selectivity, and use it to confirm Patch Mixing CNNs gain ViT-like patch selectivity. Overall, the work demonstrates Patch Mixing helps CNNs handle occlusion by acquiring patch selectivity, an inductive bias ViTs intrinsically have.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores differences between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) in terms of their ability to handle occlusion and ignore out-of-context image patches. The authors introduce the concept of "patch selectivity" to measure how well a model can discount signal from irrelevant image patches. Experiments show ViTs naturally have better patch selectivity than CNNs when tested by inserting out-of-context patches into images. 

To improve CNN patch selectivity, the authors propose training CNNs using a technique called Patch Mixing, which involves mixing patches from different training images. Models trained with Patch Mixing proved more robust to occlusion on datasets with simulated and real-world occlusions. The paper also introduces contrastive-RISE, an explainability method to visualize patch selectivity. Overall, the work demonstrates Patch Mixing is an effective technique to provide CNNs the patch selectivity that ViTs inherently possess, making them more robust to occlusion.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is Patch Mixing, a data augmentation technique for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to be more robust to occlusion. Patch Mixing involves inserting patches from other images into a training image and interpolating the ground truth labels between the two images. Specifically, the authors generate a binary patch mask indicating which patches will be replaced. These patches are replaced with patches from a second image, and the labels from the two images are mixed proportionally based on the number of replaced patches. 

The key ideas are:

- Divide the image into non-overlapping patches 

- Randomly sample a subset of patches to be replaced

- Replace those patches with patches from a second image

- Mix the labels from the two images based on the proportion of replaced patches

- Use this augmented data to train the model

The main motivation is that Patch Mixing teaches the CNN to ignore out-of-context patches that do not belong to the main object in the image, simulating real-world occlusion. This improves the model's ability to handle occlusion compared to a CNN trained without Patch Mixing. The authors show Patch Mixing helps CNNs achieve occlusion robustness comparable to Vision Transformers, which inherently have this capability.
