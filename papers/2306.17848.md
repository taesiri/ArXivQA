# [Hardwiring ViT Patch Selectivity into CNNs using Patch Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17848)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) Do ViTs have better "patch selectivity" than CNNs, meaning they are better able to ignore out-of-context image patches? 2) Can training CNNs with the proposed Patch Mixing data augmentation method improve their patch selectivity, making them more robust to occlusion?3) Is there a correlation between patch selectivity and robustness to natural occlusion? Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:- ViTs can more easily discount signal from out-of-context patches due to their self-attention mechanisms, allowing them to handle occlusion better than CNNs (Hypothesis 1). - Models with better patch selectivity will tend to perform better under natural occlusion (Hypothesis 2).- Training models with Patch Mixing will improve their ability to ignore out-of-context information (Hypothesis 3).The experiments then aim to test these hypotheses by comparing ViTs and CNNs on patch replacement attacks, training networks with Patch Mixing, evaluating performance on occlusion datasets, and using the proposed c-RISE method to measure patch selectivity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:- Identifying an important difference between CNNs and ViTs in terms of their ability to handle occlusion and ignore out-of-context image patches. The paper shows that ViTs are naturally better at this "patch selectivity", while CNNs struggle more.- Proposing Patch Mixing, a data augmentation method that inserts patches from other images into training images to simulate occlusion. The paper shows this improves CNNs' ability to ignore out-of-context patches, making them more like ViTs. - Introducing two new challenging occlusion datasets (SMD and ROD) to evaluate model performance under occlusion.- Developing a new explainability method called contrastive RISE (c-RISE) to visualize and quantify patch selectivity in both CNNs and ViTs.- Demonstrating through experiments that CNNs trained with Patch Mixing have improved robustness to occlusion on several benchmarks, while ViTs do not improve much since they already have good patch selectivity.In summary, the main contribution is identifying the "patch selectivity" difference between CNNs and ViTs, and developing the Patch Mixing technique to reduce this gap by improving CNNs' ability to ignore out-of-context image patches and handle occlusion. The paper provides empirical evidence and analysis to support these findings.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Patch Mixing data augmentation to train CNNs to acquire ViT-like capabilities to ignore out-of-context image patches, making CNNs more robust to occlusion and bridging the gap between CNNs and ViTs in handling out-of-context information.
