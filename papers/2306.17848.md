# [Hardwiring ViT Patch Selectivity into CNNs using Patch Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17848)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) Do ViTs have better "patch selectivity" than CNNs, meaning they are better able to ignore out-of-context image patches? 2) Can training CNNs with the proposed Patch Mixing data augmentation method improve their patch selectivity, making them more robust to occlusion?3) Is there a correlation between patch selectivity and robustness to natural occlusion? Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:- ViTs can more easily discount signal from out-of-context patches due to their self-attention mechanisms, allowing them to handle occlusion better than CNNs (Hypothesis 1). - Models with better patch selectivity will tend to perform better under natural occlusion (Hypothesis 2).- Training models with Patch Mixing will improve their ability to ignore out-of-context information (Hypothesis 3).The experiments then aim to test these hypotheses by comparing ViTs and CNNs on patch replacement attacks, training networks with Patch Mixing, evaluating performance on occlusion datasets, and using the proposed c-RISE method to measure patch selectivity.
