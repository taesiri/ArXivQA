# [Efficient Integrators for Diffusion Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper focuses on developing efficient sampling schemes for generative diffusion models. While diffusion models have shown impressive results in tasks like image synthesis, high-quality sample generation requires a large number of expensive score function evaluations (typically thousands). Therefore, the authors aim to develop deterministic and stochastic integrators that enable fast high-fidelity sampling from a broader class of diffusion models, even when using only 50-100 score evaluations.

Proposed Methods
The paper proposes two complementary frameworks:

1. Conjugate Integrators: These map the reverse diffusion dynamics into a more amenable space to enable larger step sizes during numerical integration. The mapping is designed to be invertible. The resulting dynamics in the transformed space are then numerically integrated. Finally, the solution is mapped back to the original space. The paper shows connections between conjugate integrators and prior methods like DDIM and exponential integrators. It also proposes a new method called λ-DDIM that extends these approaches.

2. Splitting Integrators: Inspired by integrators in molecular dynamics, these alternate between numerically solving for different components (like position and momentum) of the dynamics. The paper proposes naive splitting schemes and several adjustments like reusing score evaluations across components to reduce errors.

The two frameworks are also combined into Conjugate Splitting Integrators. The integrators are analyzed through stability analysis and local error bounds.

Experiments and Results
The proposed integrators are evaluated on CIFAR-10 and CelebA-64 datasets using the Phase Space Langevin Diffusion (PSLD) model. The key findings are:

- Conjugate integrators significantly accelerate PSLD sampling over baseline methods. λ-DDIM outperforms prior deterministic samplers.

- Adjusted splitting integrators outperform naive versions, especially with low compute budgets. The reduced stochastic integrator ROBA performs the best. 

- Conjugate splitting integrators achieve state-of-the-art sampling efficiency. For example, the deterministic sampler achieves an FID of 2.11 using only 100 score evaluations on CIFAR-10.

To summarize, the paper presents efficient sampling schemes that can generate high fidelity samples from generative diffusions with 10x fewer score evaluations than prior methods. The integrators apply broadly across diffusion models like PSLD and connect to prior techniques under special cases.
