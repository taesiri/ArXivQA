# [ExpeL: LLM Agents Are Experiential Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10144)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can an agent learn autonomously and improve its performance by accumulating and utilizing experiences across different tasks, without requiring access to model parameters or gradient updates?The authors propose an "Experiential Learning (ExpeL) agent" framework that allows an agent to:1) Autonomously gather experiences from a collection of training tasks through trial and error using a self-reflection technique. 2) Extract insights and memorable trajectories from these gathered experiences.3) Apply the extracted insights and recall past successful trajectories as examples during evaluation on unseen test tasks.The key hypothesis seems to be that by accumulating experiences across tasks and extracting reusable knowledge in the form of insights and example trajectories, the agent can improve its test-time performance on new tasks compared to baseline planning agents like ReAct. The agent is able to learn without updating model parameters, making the approach compatible with large proprietary language models.So in summary, the central research question is whether an agent can learn and improve solely from its own accumulated experiences, without gradient updates, by extracting and applying knowledge - which is what the proposed ExpeL agent aims to demonstrate.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a novel learning agent called ExpeL (Experiential Learning) that can autonomously gather experiences from training tasks and learn from them to improve performance on evaluation tasks, without requiring gradient updates to the model parameters. Some key aspects of the ExpeL agent:- It gathers diverse experiences (both successes and failures) on training tasks using an algorithm like Reflexion that allows retrying and reflecting on failures. - It extracts high-level insights from these experiences by comparing successes and failures on the same tasks, as well as identifying common patterns across different successful tasks.- At evaluation time, it augments the task prompt with relevant extracted insights and retrieves the most similar successful trajectories from training as examples. - This approach allows the agent to learn and improve without modifying model parameters, making it model-agnostic and able to leverage even proprietary models like GPT-4.- The agent is evaluated on question answering, household tasks, and shopping tasks, consistently outperforming baseline planning agents like ReAct that don't learn from experiences.- Emergent abilities like constraint awareness, belief updating, and self-correction are observed from the agent's learned insights.- A method of transferring insights between source and target tasks is also introduced, showing positive transfer learning.In summary, the key contribution is an agent that can autonomously gather and learn from diverse experiences to improve at tasks, without model parameter updates, showcasing the promise of learning from experience for building more capable LLM agents.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces an experiential learning agent named ExpeL that autonomously gathers experiences from training tasks, extracts natural language insights from them, and leverages these insights along with memories of past successes to enhance its performance on new evaluation tasks, all without any parameter updates.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in natural language processing and large language models:- This paper introduces a novel framework called ExpeL that enables large language models (LLMs) to learn autonomously from experience without requiring gradient updates. Most prior work on improving LLMs focuses on techniques like prompting or fine-tuning that do require updating model parameters. The experiential learning approach is quite innovative in allowing the agent to accumulate knowledge over time from its own experiences.- The idea of having the agent learn from both successful and failed trajectories is reminiscent of approaches in reinforcement learning and self-supervised learning. However, applying these concepts to instruct LLMs without environment rewards or losses is novel. The insights extraction process is also unique.- ExpeL demonstrates strong performance on a diverse set of decision-making environments like HotpotQA, ALFWorld, and WebShop. Many recent works focus evaluation on a single domain, so testing across multiple complex tasks is notable. The results clearly show benefits over planning-only agents.- The transfer learning experiments are interesting in showing how insights from one set of source tasks can improve performance on target tasks with minimal further training. Transfer learning for LLMs is still an open research problem, so this provides a promising new technique.- Overall, ExpeL seems very distinguished from prior work by its experiential learning approach that accumulation knowledge over time to improve an LLM's decision-making skills. The interpretability and lack of dependence on model parameters are also nice properties. The results demonstrate ExpeL's capabilities across diverse tasks and the potential for emergent behaviors. This is an intriguing direction for lifting some limitations of current LLM agents.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Incorporating image observations in addition to text observations to make the method more generally applicable. The authors mention using vision-language models or captioning models to enable handling of visual inputs.- Exploring the use of open-source language models rather than just proprietary/closed-source API models like GPT-3/GPT-4. This would increase accessibility of the approach.- Developing mechanisms to keep the extracted insights within a manageable context window size for lifelong learning agents that accumulate more and more experiences over time. The authors note their current insights fit within the context limits but more retrieval steps may be needed in the future.- Applying the approach to a wider range of domains and tasks beyond the text-based environments explored in the paper.- Combining the approach with other methods like iterative refinement (e.g. Reflexion) that could provide complementary benefits.- Evaluating whether the approach can enhance already fine-tuned agents when used in conjunction with finetuning.- Leveraging improvements in base foundation models like GPT-4 to benefit the ExpeL agent without needing architectural changes.In summary, the main directions are around expanding the inputs, tasks, language models, and complementary techniques that could be integrated with the ExpeL framework to make it more general, scalable and state-of-the-art over time.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces ExpeL, a novel learning agent that uses large language models (LLMs) for decision-making tasks. ExpeL operates in three main stages: (1) It gathers experiences by autonomously attempting training tasks multiple times using reflection. These experiences, both successes and failures, are stored in a pool. (2) It extracts insights by comparing successful and failed trajectories for the same task, and identifying patterns across different successful trajectories. These natural language insights are meant to encapsulate common pitfalls or best practices. (3) At test time, ExpeL is given one attempt at new tasks. It leverages the extracted insights and retrieves the most similar successful trajectories from its experience pool to augment its context. Experiments across diverse domains show ExpeL consistently outperforms baseline planning methods like ReAct. ExpeL also exhibits emergent abilities like correcting mistakes and adapting beliefs. Additionally, a transfer learning experiment highlights how insights from source tasks can aid solving target tasks. A key advantage of ExpeL is the lack of parameter updates, allowing compatibility with proprietary LLMs. Overall, ExpeL demonstrates how autonomous experience gathering and insight extraction can enable LLM agents to continuously learn and improve.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces ExpeL, a novel learning agent based on large language models (LLMs) that can autonomously gather experiences from a set of training tasks and use those experiences to improve its performance on evaluation tasks, all without needing to update the model parameters. The key idea is that during a training phase, ExpeL leverages an approach called Reflexion to repeatedly attempt tasks and gather both successful and failed trajectories into an experience pool. It then extracts natural language insights by comparing failures to successes on the same tasks, and by finding commonalities across different successful trajectories. At evaluation time, ExpeL utilizes these extracted insights along with retrieving the most similar past successful trajectories as examples to inform its decision making when presented with new tasks. Experiments across three different domains showed consistent improvements over baseline planning agents. The paper also demonstrated emergent abilities like self-correcting errors and adapting beliefs, as well as the potential for cross-domain transfer learning by finetuning insights on a small number of target domain examples. Overall, ExpeL offers an interpretable and accessible way for LLM agents to learn from experience without parameter updates.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces ExpeL, an experiential learning agent that can autonomously improve its decision-making abilities by learning from experience across tasks. The key steps are: (1) The agent gathers diverse experiences of both successes and failures on training tasks using the Reflexion method. These experiences are stored in a pool. (2) The agent extracts abstract insights by examining successful trajectories and comparing successful vs failed trajectories for the same task using a large language model. This results in a set of insights. (3) At test time on new tasks, the agent retrieves the most similar successful trajectories from its experience pool to use as examples. It also utilizes the extracted insights to augment its context. In this way, the agent benefits from both specific recalled experiences and general insights when attempting the new tasks. The main strengths of this method are that it allows task improvement without further environment interaction at test time and without needing access to model parameters.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "ExpeL: LLM Agents Are Experiential Learners" addresses the problem of how to enable large language model (LLM) agents to learn and improve their sequential decision-making abilities through experience, without requiring access to the model's parameters or large amounts of training data. Specifically, the authors aim to develop an agent that can autonomously gather experiences from attempting tasks, extract useful insights/patterns from those experiences, and then leverage those learned insights along with memories of past successes to make better decisions when faced with new tasks. This is motivated by the limitations of current methods like fine-tuning LLMs (which requires lots of data,compute, and model access) or prompting (which relies heavily on manual engineering and lacks memory).The key research question is: how can we design an LLM agent that can learn in an autonomous,interpretable way from its own experience across multiple tasks, to enhance its planning and decision-making abilities on new tasks? The proposed "Experiential Learning (ExpeL) agent" is their solution for enabling this type of lifelong, self-supervised learning in LLM agents.
