# [RocketQAv2: A Joint Training Method for Dense Passage Retrieval and   Passage Re-ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07367)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we jointly train the passage retriever and passage re-ranker in a dense passage retrieval pipeline to achieve mutual improvement between the two components?

The key hypothesis is that by unifying the training approach into a joint listwise optimization and enabling adaptive mutual distillation between the retriever and re-ranker, the two components can complement each other during training to improve overall retrieval performance. 

Specifically, the paper proposes:

1) A dynamic listwise distillation approach to enable adaptive transfer of relevance information between the retriever and re-ranker during joint training. 

2) A hybrid data augmentation strategy to generate diverse and high-quality training instances to support effective listwise training.

By addressing the inconsistent optimization objectives and lack of suitable training data, the proposed techniques aim to facilitate end-to-end joint training of the dense retriever and re-ranker to boost their mutual improvement. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed joint training approach.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that by designing appropriate training techniques to unify and correlate the optimization of the retriever and re-ranker, we can improve the overall retrieval performance in an end-to-end manner. The proposed dynamic distillation and data augmentation techniques are key to enabling effective joint training.

 Based on my reading, this paper proposes a novel joint training approach for dense passage retrieval and passage re-ranking. The central hypothesis is that jointly training the retriever and re-ranker in a unified architecture can achieve mutual improvement between the two modules, leading to better overall retrieval performance. 

Specifically, the key research questions addressed are:

1) How to design an effective joint training approach to enable information interaction between the retriever and re-ranker? The paper proposes "dynamic listwise distillation" to unify the training objective and allow relevance knowledge transfer.

2) How to generate high-quality and diverse training instances to support the proposed listwise joint training? The paper develops a "hybrid data augmentation" strategy to construct the candidate passage lists.

3) Whether the proposed joint training approach can outperform previous pipelines that train the retriever and re-ranker separately or iteratively? Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the unified architecture.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that retriever and re-ranker can mutually improve each other through a jointly trained architecture, and the paper makes technical contributions on the training approach and data augmentation to realize this idea. The superiority of the proposed joint training is demonstrated empirically.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on jointly training the passage retriever and passage re-ranker components for dense passage retrieval. Most prior work has focused on training these components separately or in a pipeline approach. This is the first work I'm aware of that proposes a joint training method.

- The key novelty is using a dynamic listwise distillation approach to enable information transfer between the retriever and re-ranker during training. This allows the two components to mutually improve each other, rather than just distilling in one direction.

- They design a unified listwise training objective for both components to enable this joint training. Prior work has used different objectives (e.g. pointwise for re-rankers) which makes joint training difficult.

- The hybrid data augmentation method generates more diverse, hard training examples to better support listwise training. This is different from prior work like RocketQA that relied more on in-batch negatives.

- Experiments show sizable improvements in both retrieval and re-ranking performance on MSMARCO and Natural Questions datasets. The gains are much bigger than prior work on improving these components individually.

Overall, this paper makes a significant advance by proposing an effective way to jointly train the retriever and re-ranker, leveraging techniques like dynamic distillation and tailored data augmentation. The joint training provides better performance than prior pipeline or iterative training approaches. This could be an important step towards end-to-end neural retrieval systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- It focuses on jointly training a dense passage retriever and a passage re-ranker, which is novel. Most prior work has focused on training these components separately or in an iterative way. 

- It introduces a dynamic listwise distillation method to enable information transfer between the retriever and re-ranker during training. This allows for mutual improvement, unlike static distillation techniques used in previous work.

- It achieves state-of-the-art results on MSMARCO and Natural Questions passage ranking datasets, outperforming previous best methods like RocketQA, PAIR, etc. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed joint training approach.

- Compared to some related works that aim to jointly train a retriever and reader end-to-end, this method focuses specifically on tying together the retriever and re-ranker components. The retriever-reader joint training has been explored in other papers.

- The idea of unifying the training objective for the retriever and re-ranker has some similarity to previous learning-to-rank techniques, but it is adapted here specifically for dense retrieval with neural models.

Overall, the key novelties are in proposing an effective way to jointly optimize the retriever and reranker, rather than treating them separately. The dynamic distillation technique and hybrid data augmentation provide the technical contributions to enable this joint training.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more advanced joint training methods for dense passage retrieval and re-ranking. The authors propose a novel dynamic listwise distillation method in this work, but suggest there is room for further improvements by designing more effective joint training approaches.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel joint training approach for dense passage retrieval and passage re-ranking. The key idea is to utilize dynamic listwise distillation to couple the retriever and re-ranker, where both modules are trained with a unified listwise objective and can adaptively transfer relevance information during training. This allows the retriever to capture knowledge from the more powerful re-ranker, while the re-ranker learns to fit the distribution of the retriever. To support the listwise training, the authors also propose a hybrid data augmentation strategy to generate diverse and hard training instances. Experiments on MSMARCO and Natural Questions datasets demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines, including the state-of-the-art RocketQA. The joint training approach is able to simplify the training pipeline and achieve better performance compared to alternative training. This is the first work that enables end-to-end joint training of the retriever and re-ranker.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel joint training approach for dense passage retrieval and passage re-ranking. The key idea is to utilize dynamic listwise distillation to couple the retriever and re-ranker modules for mutual improvement. Specifically, a unified listwise training approach is designed where both modules produce relevance scores over a shared list of candidate passages. The scores are normalized as probability distributions and the KL divergence between distributions is minimized to enable knowledge transfer. Unlike previous distillation methods that freeze one module, this approach allows parameters of both modules to be updated dynamically during training. A hybrid data augmentation strategy is also introduced to generate diverse candidate passage lists containing both undenoised and denoised hard negatives at multiple relevance levels. 

Experiments are conducted on MSMARCO and Natural Questions datasets. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance surpassing previous methods on passage retrieval and re-ranking tasks. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of dynamic distillation over static distillation and listwise training over pointwise training. Detailed analysis also shows performance gains from incorporating more hard negatives and denoised instances. Overall, this novel joint training architecture is able to simplify optimization and achieve better mutual improvement between the retriever and re-ranker. The introduced techniques help advance state-of-the-art in dense passage retrieval.

The paper proposes a novel joint training approach for dense passage retrieval and passage re-ranking. The key idea is to use a unified listwise training objective and dynamic distillation to couple the retriever and re-ranker models.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel joint training approach for dense passage retrieval and passage re-ranking. The key idea is to use a dynamic listwise distillation mechanism to adaptively improve both the retriever and re-ranker in a unified training process. Specifically, the retriever and re-ranker are trained with a shared listwise optimization objective, where relevance scores are computed based on a list of candidate passages. The re-ranker produces soft relevance distributions to train the retriever via KL divergence minimization. Meanwhile, the re-ranker is also dynamically updated to fit the retriever's relevance distributions. This allows relevance information to be mutually transferred and fused between the retriever and re-ranker. The paper also introduces a hybrid data augmentation strategy to generate diverse candidate lists to support the listwise training. Overall, the proposed approach enables joint training of the retriever and re-ranker in a unified architecture for the first time.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the main focus of this paper is on jointly training the passage retriever and passage re-ranker in a dense retrieval pipeline. 

Specifically, it addresses two key issues:

1. The retriever and re-ranker are usually optimized separately with different objectives, which makes it difficult to share information between them. The paper proposes using a unified listwise training approach for both modules to enable relevance transfer.

2. Effective listwise training requires high-quality and diverse training instances, but traditional sampling methods may not work well. The paper introduces a hybrid data augmentation strategy to generate better training data.

The main goal is to develop an effective joint training approach to mutually improve the retriever and re-ranker, rather than training them separately. This is achieved via two key technical contributions - dynamic listwise distillation to couple the two modules, and hybrid data augmentation to support the listwise training.

In summary, the core focus is on exploring joint training for the passage retriever and re-ranker, by addressing the challenges of information transfer across different architectures, and generating suitable training data. The proposed techniques aim to improve both modules simultaneously through dynamic mutual interaction.
