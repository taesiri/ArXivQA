# [RocketQAv2: A Joint Training Method for Dense Passage Retrieval and   Passage Re-ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07367)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we jointly train the passage retriever and passage re-ranker in a dense passage retrieval pipeline to achieve mutual improvement between the two components?The key hypothesis is that by unifying the training approach into a joint listwise optimization and enabling adaptive mutual distillation between the retriever and re-ranker, the two components can complement each other during training to improve overall retrieval performance. Specifically, the paper proposes:1) A dynamic listwise distillation approach to enable adaptive transfer of relevance information between the retriever and re-ranker during joint training. 2) A hybrid data augmentation strategy to generate diverse and high-quality training instances to support effective listwise training.By addressing the inconsistent optimization objectives and lack of suitable training data, the proposed techniques aim to facilitate end-to-end joint training of the dense retriever and re-ranker to boost their mutual improvement. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed joint training approach.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by designing appropriate training techniques to unify and correlate the optimization of the retriever and re-ranker, we can improve the overall retrieval performance in an end-to-end manner. The proposed dynamic distillation and data augmentation techniques are key to enabling effective joint training.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, this paper proposes a novel joint training approach for dense passage retrieval and passage re-ranking. The central hypothesis is that jointly training the retriever and re-ranker in a unified architecture can achieve mutual improvement between the two modules, leading to better overall retrieval performance. Specifically, the key research questions addressed are:1) How to design an effective joint training approach to enable information interaction between the retriever and re-ranker? The paper proposes "dynamic listwise distillation" to unify the training objective and allow relevance knowledge transfer.2) How to generate high-quality and diverse training instances to support the proposed listwise joint training? The paper develops a "hybrid data augmentation" strategy to construct the candidate passage lists.3) Whether the proposed joint training approach can outperform previous pipelines that train the retriever and re-ranker separately or iteratively? Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the unified architecture.In summary, the central hypothesis is that retriever and re-ranker can mutually improve each other through a jointly trained architecture, and the paper makes technical contributions on the training approach and data augmentation to realize this idea. The superiority of the proposed joint training is demonstrated empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the main contribution of this paper appears to be proposing a novel joint training approach for dense passage retrieval and passage re-ranking.Specifically, the key contributions seem to be:- Introducing a dynamic listwise distillation mechanism to jointly train the retriever and re-ranker. This enables adaptive transfer of relevance information between the two modules during training.- Designing a hybrid data augmentation strategy to generate diverse training instances to support the proposed listwise training approach.- Demonstrating through experiments that their proposed joint training approach is effective, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on MSMARCO and Natural Questions datasets.Overall, this appears to be the first work to propose a joint training framework that mutually improves a dense passage retriever and a passage re-ranker in a unified architecture. The core ideas are using dynamic listwise distillation to couple the two modules during training, and leveraging effective data augmentation to provide high-quality listwise training instances. The results validate that their method can boost performance on passage retrieval and ranking compared to prior individual or pipeline-based training paradigms.

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a novel joint training approach for dense passage retrieval and passage re-ranking. Specifically, the key ideas include:1. Introducing a dynamic listwise distillation mechanism to jointly train the retriever and re-ranker.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper focuses on jointly training the passage retriever and passage re-ranker components for dense passage retrieval. Most prior work has focused on training these components separately or in a pipeline approach. This is the first work I'm aware of that proposes a joint training method.- The key novelty is using a dynamic listwise distillation approach to enable information transfer between the retriever and re-ranker during training. This allows the two components to mutually improve each other, rather than just distilling in one direction.- They design a unified listwise training objective for both components to enable this joint training. Prior work has used different objectives (e.g. pointwise for re-rankers) which makes joint training difficult.- The hybrid data augmentation method generates more diverse, hard training examples to better support listwise training. This is different from prior work like RocketQA that relied more on in-batch negatives.- Experiments show sizable improvements in both retrieval and re-ranking performance on MSMARCO and Natural Questions datasets. The gains are much bigger than prior work on improving these components individually.Overall, this paper makes a significant advance by proposing an effective way to jointly train the retriever and re-ranker, leveraging techniques like dynamic distillation and tailored data augmentation. The joint training provides better performance than prior pipeline or iterative training approaches. This could be an important step towards end-to-end neural retrieval systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:- It focuses on jointly training a dense passage retriever and a passage re-ranker, which is novel. Most prior work has focused on training these components separately or in an iterative way. - It introduces a dynamic listwise distillation method to enable information transfer between the retriever and re-ranker during training. This allows for mutual improvement, unlike static distillation techniques used in previous work.- It proposes a hybrid data augmentation strategy to generate more diverse and high-quality training instances to support the listwise training approach. Other methods often rely solely on in-batch negatives.- It achieves state-of-the-art results on MSMARCO and Natural Questions passage ranking datasets, outperforming previous best methods like RocketQA, PAIR, etc. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed joint training approach.- Compared to some related works that aim to jointly train a retriever and reader end-to-end, this method focuses specifically on tying together the retriever and re-ranker components. The retriever-reader joint training has been explored in other papers.- The idea of unifying the training objective for the retriever and re-ranker has some similarity to previous learning-to-rank techniques, but it is adapted here specifically for dense retrieval with neural models.Overall, the key novelties are in proposing an effective way to jointly optimize the retriever and reranker, rather than treating them separately. The dynamic distillation technique and hybrid data augmentation provide the technical contributions to enable this joint training.
