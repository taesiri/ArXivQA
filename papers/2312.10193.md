# [Adaptive Computation Modules: Granular Conditional Computation For   Efficient Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10193)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Adaptive Computation Modules: Granular Conditional Computation For Efficient Inference":

Problem:
- State-of-the-art transformer models like BERT and ViT are very large and computationally expensive, limiting their use in latency-sensitive and energy-constrained applications. 
- Existing methods like quantization, knowledge distillation, and sparsification can reduce costs but often incur an accuracy drop. 
- Globally reducing computation for all inputs is suboptimal as different inputs and even different tokens within an input may need differing amounts of computation.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Adaptive Computation Modules (ACMs) - a modular unit that can adaptively determine the computational load per input token through a learned gating mechanism.
- An ACM consists of N parallel learners that progressively refine the representations, and a gating network that selects how many of these learners to execute per token.
- Convert any pre-trained model to use ACMs via a 3-stage process:
   1) Distill knowledge from original layers into ACM learners
   2) Train gating network with artificial supervision
   3) End-to-end fine-tune with auxiliary losses
- Achieves dynamism in computation across samples and spatial locations in the input.

Main Contributions:
- Propose concept of ACMs for spatially adaptive conditional computation in transformers
- Show that large static modules like MLPs are inefficient, and full capacity is needed only for a subset of tokens 
- Provide an efficient way to convert pre-trained models to use ACMs via distillation
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy vs efficiency tradeoffs on image classification and speech recognition tasks

In summary, the paper introduces a novel module called ACMs that can greatly reduce the inference cost of transformers without compromising accuracy. The key ideas are making computation adaptive across input tokens, and providing an easy way to convert pre-trained models via distillation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Adaptive Computation Modules, a generic neural network module that dynamically adjusts its computational load on a per-token basis to improve efficiency of transformers without sacrificing accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing ACM, an easy-to-train, modular, and general-purpose module that offers a granular approach for reducing the computational cost of transformers.

2. Proposing an efficient way for training ACMs that relies on module-wise knowledge distillation from pre-trained models. 

3. Showing that individual layers in transformer models can be computationally inefficient and that their entire expressiveness is often needed only for a small subset of the input tokens.

So in summary, the paper introduces a new module called the Adaptive Computation Module (ACM) that can reduce the computational cost of transformers in a granular, per-token manner. It also proposes an effective distillation-based training procedure for ACMs and analyzes the inefficiency of standard transformer modules.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Adaptive Computation Modules (ACMs): The core contribution of the paper, a modular and general-purpose neural network component that adapts its computational load on a per-token basis to match input difficulty.

- Conditional computation: ACMs implement a granular form of conditional computation, where the model dynamically decides how much computation to allocate to each part of the input.

- Knowledge distillation: The proposed training procedure involves first distilling knowledge from a pre-trained transformer model into the ACMs before end-to-end finetuning. 

- Representation distillation: The initial stage of training where the learners in each ACM module are trained to match the representations of the original pre-trained modules they replace.

- Gating network: The small network within each ACM that decides how many learners to execute for each input token.

- Dynamic models: Models like ACMs that can adapt their computational graph and allocate variable compute across samples or input regions.

- Performance-efficiency trade-off: A key consideration in model design that ACMs aim to improve compared to static models.

Some other potentially relevant terms based on a skim of the content are token dropping methods, mixture-of-experts, early exiting, computational budgets, and model efficiency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new module called the Adaptive Computation Module (ACM). What is the key idea behind the ACM and how does it work at a high level? What problem does it aim to solve?

2. The ACM module consists of multiple "learners" and a gating network. Explain the role of the learners and how their outputs are combined. What is the purpose of the gating network and how does it work? 

3. The authors propose a 3-stage training pipeline involving (i) module-wise representation distillation (ii) pre-training the gating networks and (iii) end-to-end finetuning. Walk through each of these stages in detail and explain their purpose. Why is this staged approach useful?

4. In the module-wise representation distillation stage, the learners are trained to mimic the computations of the original static module. What specific loss function is used here and why? How does this stage on its own justify the ACM design?

5. The end-to-end finetuning stage uses 3 auxiliary loss terms - explain each one, its mathematical formulation, and its intended effect on the model behavior. Why are all 3 needed to achieve the dynamic computation allocation?

6. The experiments compare ACMs to other conditional computation techniques from 3 categories - token dropping, mixture-of-experts, and early-exiting. Summarize the key difference in approach of ACMs versus methods in each of those categories.  

7. The qualitative analysis studies which regions of input images receive higher vs lower computation from ACM models. Summarize the key findings. How does this provide insight about the functioning of ACMs?

8. On the module distillation results in Figure 3 - explain the trends in the error plots. What do they tell us about efficiency of standard static modules like MLPs? How does this provide justification for using dynamic modules like ACMs?

9. The method makes the claim that full representational capacity of all layers is needed only for a small subset of tokens. Explain whether and how the experiments and analyses support or invalidate this claim. Provide examples.  

10. The paper identifies some limitations of the proposed approach such as higher memory costs. Can you think of other potential limitations or weaknesses of using ACMs? Identify 2-3 issues and explain what could be done to address them.
