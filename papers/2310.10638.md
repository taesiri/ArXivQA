# [In-Context Pretraining: Language Modeling Beyond Document Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10638)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve large language models' ability to understand and reason over long, coherent contexts that span document boundaries. 

The key hypothesis is that explicitly pretraining language models on sequences of related documents, rather than randomly concatenated documents, will enhance their ability to leverage contextual information across documents.

In particular, the paper introduces a new pretraining approach called "In-Context Pretraining" (ICLM) which connects related documents using a retriever and graph traversal algorithm. It hypothesizes that exposing language models to these coherent multi-document contexts during pretraining will improve performance on downstream tasks requiring cross-document reasoning and understanding.

The experiments aim to evaluate whether ICLM pretraining leads to better performance on tasks like reading comprehension, question answering, in-context learning, and long-context reasoning compared to standard pretraining or retrieval-augmented pretraining baselines. The results support the hypothesis, showing significant gains from ICLM pretraining on these types of contextual reasoning tasks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that creating multi-document contexts of related documents for pretraining will enhance language models' ability to leverage cross-document context, which is evaluated across a range of relevant downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new pretraining method called In-Context Pretraining (ICLMs) that trains language models on sequences of semantically related documents rather than randomly concatenated documents. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- Finding related documents at scale using a retriever model and approximate nearest neighbor search. This allows linking documents in a large pretraining corpus based on their semantic similarity.

- Creating coherent input contexts by traversing a document graph using an algorithm inspired by the traveling salesman problem. This ensures each document is included only once while maximizing similarity within each context. 

- Integrating ICLMs into existing pretraining pipelines by simply changing the document ordering during batching.

- Demonstrating significant gains over standard pretraining baselines on a variety of tasks requiring reasoning over context, including in-context learning, reading comprehension, retrieval augmentation, and faithfulness to prior contexts.

So in summary, the main contribution is presenting ICLMs as a simple but highly effective way to enhance language model understanding of contexts by pretraining on related documents rather than random concatenations of documents. The gains are shown across diverse tasks requiring reasoning over context.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents In-Context Pretraining (ICLM), a new pretraining approach that connects related documents to form coherent contexts and trains language models to read across document boundaries, improving performance on downstream tasks like in-context learning, reading comprehension, factuality, and retrieval augmentation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work in large language model pretraining:

- It focuses on pretraining language models to better understand long, related contexts that span document boundaries. Much prior work trains models on individual documents or randomly concatenated documents. This work pretrains on sequences of topically related documents to teach models to reason across documents.

- The proposed approach is designed to scale to very large web corpora like CommonCrawl. Many prior methods for incorporating topic coherence pretrained on smaller datasets like Wikipedia or summarization datasets. The methods introduced here like efficient nearest neighbor search and graph traversal algorithms aim to work on web-scale data.

- The model architecture and training process remains the same as standard language model pretraining, with the key change being the document ordering during data preprocessing. This makes the approach easy to integrate into existing pretraining pipelines. Other works have proposed more significant modifications to model architecture or training.

- The paper demonstrates strong gains on tasks requiring reasoning over contexts like reading comprehension, in-context learning, and fact checking. This provides evidence that their pretraining approach improves contextual reasoning skills, beyond just language modeling.

- Compared to concurrent work on extending model context length during pretraining or finetuning, this paper focuses more on creating meaningful long context data rather than just longer sequences.

Overall, a key contribution is presenting a simple but effective approach to pretrain on topically coherent long contexts in a scalable way. This is shown to improve reasoning without model architecture changes. The gains highlight the importance of pretraining data coherence, beyond just model scale or context length.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring how to combine In-Context Pretraining (ICLM) with multitask finetuning methods to further enhance language models' abilities for in-context learning and instruction following. The authors mention that multitask finetuning methods like DeFT are complementary to ICLM, since they focus on the finetuning stage while ICLM focuses on pretraining. Combining the two could lead to further improvements.

- Applying ICLM to even larger language models and datasets. The authors demonstrate ICLM's benefits on models up to 7B parameters trained on 235M documents. Scaling up further could produce even greater gains in understanding long, complex contexts.

- Adapting ICLM to other modalities beyond text, such as images or multimodal contexts. The key ideas of finding related contexts and training models to reason across context boundaries could generalize.

- Developing better relevance metrics beyond just semantic similarity for retrieving related documents. The authors use cosine similarity of document embeddings, but other relevance measures could retrieve better training contexts.

- Exploring different model architectures and pretraining objectives tailored for ICLM's goal of reasoning across documents. The authors use a standard autoregressive LM, but new architectures could help.

In summary, the key directions are scaling up in terms of model size, datasets, and modalities; combining ICLM with complementary methods like multitask finetuning; and developing better relevance metrics and model architectures specialized for cross-document reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes In-Context Pretraining (ICLM), a new pretraining method for language models that trains them to predict tokens conditioned on a sequence of related documents rather than randomly concatenated documents. This provides language models with more coherent input contexts for learning to reason across document boundaries. ICLM constructs these input contexts by first using a retriever model and approximate nearest neighbor search to identify related documents in the pretraining corpus. It then traverses this "document graph" to create input contexts where each document appears only once, maximizing document similarity within contexts while maintaining diversity across contexts. Experiments with models from 300M to 7B parameters show gains on tasks requiring contextual reasoning like in-context learning, reading comprehension, faithfulness, and retrieval augmentation. The results demonstrate ICLM's effectiveness in enhancing language models' ability to understand and reason over full input contexts through a simple change in document ordering during pretraining.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes In-Context Pretraining (ICLM), a new pretraining method for large language models (LLMs) that improves their ability to reason across document boundaries. The standard pretraining approach concatenates random documents to form the input context for the LLM. ICLM instead reorders the documents so that semantically related documents appear together in the input context. This exposes the LLM to more coherent, long contexts during training. To implement ICLM, the authors first use a dense retriever to find the nearest neighbor documents for each document in the corpus. They then formulate finding an optimal ordering of documents as a graph traversal problem and propose an approximate greedy algorithm that ensures each document appears exactly once. 

The authors pretrain LLMs with up to 7 billion parameters on 300 billion CommonCrawl tokens using ICLM and standard pretraining. Experiments demonstrate gains from ICLM on a diverse set of downstream tasks requiring reasoning over context, including in-context learning, reading comprehension, faithfulness to prior context, and retrieval augmentation. For example, ICLM improves in-context learning by 8% on average across 8 datasets compared to standard pretraining. The gains highlight ICLM's ability to enhance LLMs' contextual reasoning while maintaining simplicity and scalability.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new pretraining approach called In-Context Pretraining (ICLM) where language models are pretrained on sequences of related documents rather than randomly concatenated documents. This encourages models to read and reason across document boundaries. To implement this, the authors first construct a document graph by using a retriever model and approximate nearest neighbor search to link each document to its most semantically similar documents. They then formulate pretraining batch creation as a graph traversal problem, where the goal is to visit each document node exactly once while maximizing similarity between documents in the same path. They propose an approximate algorithm that starts paths at minimum degree nodes and greedily expands paths by selecting the most similar unvisited neighbor at each step. This results in a set of paths covering all documents, which are then concatenated into contexts for pretraining. The key novelty is creating pretraining batches where all documents are related rather than random, in order to provide better training signal.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing a new pretraining method called In-Context Pretraining (ICLM) to improve language models' ability to understand and reason over longer, more complex contexts that span document boundaries. 

The key problem it is trying to address is that current pretraining methods only expose language models to contexts within a single document, which limits their ability to learn from cross-document reasoning. This leads to issues like failing to follow instructions, struggling with multi-document reasoning, and instability during in-context learning.

The key idea of ICLM is to pretrain language models on sequences of semantically related documents rather than randomly concatenated documents. This provides more informative contexts for the model to learn from during pretraining.

The main challenges it tackles are:

- Efficiently finding related documents across a very large pretraining corpus (billions of docs). They use a retriever model and nearest neighbor search.

- Constructing coherent input contexts from the related documents in a way that covers all documents without repetition. They formulate this as a graph traversal problem.

- Integrating their new pretraining approach into existing pipelines like LLMs. They show it's a simple change to doc ordering during batching.

Overall, the paper introduces a scalable way to provide better pretraining contexts to improve language models' understanding and cross-document reasoning abilities. This is done by pretraining on related rather than random documents.
