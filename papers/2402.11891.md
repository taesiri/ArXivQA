# [FeB4RAG: Evaluating Federated Search in the Context of Retrieval   Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11891)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Federated search systems aggregate results from multiple search engines to enhance result quality and align with user intent. With the rise of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, federated search can play an important role in sourcing relevant information to generate high-quality responses. 
- However, existing federated search datasets predate the RAG paradigm shift and lack representation of modern information retrieval challenges. There is a need for a new dataset tailored for evaluating federated search methods in RAG frameworks.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors present FeB4RAG, a novel federated search dataset designed for RAG systems. It contains 790 information requests derived from 16 sub-collections of the BEIR benchmark, tailored for conversational agents. 
- Each request is paired with top search results and LLM-derived relevance judgments. The search engines are simulated using state-of-the-art dense retrievers on BEIR datasets.

Main Contributions:
- FeB4RAG addresses limitations of previous federated search collections in the context of modern RAG pipelines. The information requests and search engines better represent real-world scenarios.
- LLM relevance judgments exhibit high agreement with human annotations, ensuring reliability. Analysis explores labelling statistics and resource importance.
- The collection supports evaluating resource selection and result merging techniques. Its expandable codebase allows integrating new requests, models and assessments.
- Comparisons showcase improved answer generation using high-quality federated search versus a naive approach, demonstrating the value of tailored methods and the need for FeB4RAG.

In summary, FeB4RAG bridges an important gap by providing a reliable and adaptable evaluation dataset tailored for modern federated search in RAG systems. Analyses and demonstrations highlight its usefulness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces FeB4RAG, a new test collection for evaluating federated search methods within Retrieval Augmented Generation pipelines, comprising 790 information requests over 16 search engines built from BEIR datasets with LLM-generated relevance judgments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of FeB4RAG, a new test collection designed specifically for evaluating federated search within Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. 

Key aspects of the FeB4RAG collection include:

- 790 information requests tailored for conversational agents/chatbots to simulate real user queries in RAG systems

- 16 search engines built on top of datasets from the BEIR benchmark using state-of-the-art dense retrievers to simulate modern search engines

- Comprehensive relevance judgments obtained from Large Language Models for search results and search engines 

- An expandable codebase to allow integrating new requests, search engines, and evaluations over time

The paper argues that existing federated search test collections have limitations when evaluating modern RAG pipelines, and FeB4RAG addresses these limitations through its design targeting RAG applications. The collection enables evaluating core federated search tasks like resource selection and result merging in the RAG context.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the process of generating user requests using GPT-4 help ensure diversity and applicability to real-world RAG systems? What strategies were used specifically to promote diversity?

2. Why was the BEIR benchmark chosen as the foundational basis for selecting datasets to serve as search engines? What characteristics of BEIR make it well-suited for this purpose? 

3. What were the key considerations and trade-offs in selecting the specific dense retriever models used for each dataset when creating the search engines?

4. How does the 4-level labeling scale used for relevance judgments compare to scales used in previous test collections? What impacts could this have on the evaluation of federated search methods?

5. What steps were taken during the fusion of labels from the two LLMs to produce the final relevance judgments? How does this process relate to typical human annotation processes?  

6. Why is the more balanced distribution of resource verticals in FeB4RAG significant? How does it differ from previous collections and what evaluation challenges does it help mitigate?

7. In what ways can FeB4RAG be expanded upon in terms of new user requests, retrieval models, relevance assessments, and integration into RAG pipelines?

8. How do the information requests in FeB4RAG better capture the contextually richer, more specific queries likely to emerge from conversational agents compared to previous collections?

9. What were the key differences observed between the naive and optimal federated search strategies in the RAG demonstration? How did this highlight the merits of FeB4RAG?

10. How do the relevance annotation statistics indicate the relative difficulty of extracting pertinent information from differently sized collections? What trends emerge in this regard?
