# [FeB4RAG: Evaluating Federated Search in the Context of Retrieval   Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11891)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Federated search systems aggregate results from multiple search engines to enhance result quality and align with user intent. With the rise of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, federated search can play an important role in sourcing relevant information to generate high-quality responses. 
- However, existing federated search datasets predate the RAG paradigm shift and lack representation of modern information retrieval challenges. There is a need for a new dataset tailored for evaluating federated search methods in RAG frameworks.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors present FeB4RAG, a novel federated search dataset designed for RAG systems. It contains 790 information requests derived from 16 sub-collections of the BEIR benchmark, tailored for conversational agents. 
- Each request is paired with top search results and LLM-derived relevance judgments. The search engines are simulated using state-of-the-art dense retrievers on BEIR datasets.

Main Contributions:
- FeB4RAG addresses limitations of previous federated search collections in the context of modern RAG pipelines. The information requests and search engines better represent real-world scenarios.
- LLM relevance judgments exhibit high agreement with human annotations, ensuring reliability. Analysis explores labelling statistics and resource importance.
- The collection supports evaluating resource selection and result merging techniques. Its expandable codebase allows integrating new requests, models and assessments.
- Comparisons showcase improved answer generation using high-quality federated search versus a naive approach, demonstrating the value of tailored methods and the need for FeB4RAG.

In summary, FeB4RAG bridges an important gap by providing a reliable and adaptable evaluation dataset tailored for modern federated search in RAG systems. Analyses and demonstrations highlight its usefulness.
