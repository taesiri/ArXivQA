# [Text-to-3D Generation with Bidirectional Diffusion using both 2D and 3D   priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing 3D generative models have limitations in either texture quality or geometric correctness due to relying solely on either 2D or 3D priors. Methods utilizing 2D priors (e.g. optimizing 2D model outputs) generate high-quality textures but inconsistent geometry. Methods using only 3D priors have better geometry but lower texture quality and diversity due to small datasets. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Bidirectional Diffusion (BiDiff), a unified framework incorporating both a 3D and a 2D diffusion process for high quality textured 3D generation.

- Uses a hybrid 2D-3D representation of multi-view images and an implicit 3D field to capture both texture and shape. 

- Pretrained 2D and 3D foundation models provide robust priors. The diffusion models are then jointly fine-tuned using novel bidirectional guidance to align generative directions.

- Allows independent texture and geometry control by separately adjusting the influence of 2D and 3D priors.

- Can serve as initialization for optimization methods for further refinement. Significantly reduces optimization time and avoids quality issues.


Main Contributions:

- First framework to seamlessly integrate both 2D and 3D diffusion models for textured 3D generation

- Novel bidirectional guidance through multi-view projection and back-projection to align generative processes  

- Enables separate manipulation of shape and texture

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art high quality 3D generations that are scalable and robust  

In summary, the proposed Bidirectional Diffusion elegantly marries 2D and 3D generative diffusion models through a unified framework and bidirectional guidance, achieving previously unmatched geometry correctness alongside high texture quality and diversity in 3D object generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Bidirectional Diffusion, a unified framework that incorporates both a 3D diffusion model and a 2D diffusion model with bidirectional guidance to generate high-quality, diverse, and scalable 3D objects with controllable geometry and texture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. Proposing Bidirectional Diffusion (BiDiff), a joint 2D-3D diffusion model that can generate high-quality, 3D-consistent, and diversified 3D objects. 

2. Proposing a novel training pipeline that utilizes both pretrained 2D and 3D generative foundation models.

3. Proposing the first diffusion-based 3D generation model that allows independent control of texture and geometry generation. 

4. Utilizing the outputs from BiDiff as a strong initialization for optimization-based methods like ProlificDreamer, generating high-quality geometries while ensuring quick feedback for prompt updates.

In summary, the key innovation is the bidirectional diffusion framework that marries a 3D diffusion process focusing on geometry with a 2D diffusion process focusing on texture, connected via novel bidirectional guidance. This allows leveraging the advantages of both 2D and 3D diffusion models to achieve scalable and controllable 3D generation with high visual quality.

The paper proposes a bidirectional diffusion framework called "BiDiff" that incorporates both a 2D and a 3D diffusion process to generate 3D objects from text descriptions. Key aspects include using a hybrid SDF and multi-view image representation, bidirectional guidance between the diffusion processes, separate control over geometry and texture generation, and using BiDiff to initialize optimization-based methods. The method is evaluated on the ShapeNet and Objaverse datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel bidirectional diffusion framework that incorporates both a 3D diffusion model and a 2D diffusion model. Can you explain in more detail how the bidirectional guidance works between the two diffusion models? What are the key components that enable them to evolve coherently?

2. One advantage mentioned is the ability to separately control geometry and texture generation. Can you expand more on how the separate control is achieved through the prior enhancement strategy? How exactly does adjusting the guidance scales allow independent control?

3. For the 3D diffusion model, pretrained radiance fields from Shap-E are utilized as the 3D prior. How is the model prevented from just memorizing or overfitting to the Shap-E prior during training? What is the purpose of adding noise to the latent code?

4. What are the key benefits of using a hybrid representation with both SDF and multi-view images? Why is this better than using only one type of representation? How are the two representations transformed between each other?

5. The paper mentions using the outputs of BiDiff as initialization for optimization-based methods. Why does this help improve quality and efficiency compared to pure optimization? What specific radiance field parameterization and distillation process is used?

6. What datasets were used to train the model? How were the datasets processed to obtain the SDF and multi-view images? Were additional steps like text labeling required?

7. Can you analyze the model architecture in more detail, especially the components of the 3D and 2D denoising networks? What types of networks are they built on top of? 

8. What is the training setup used for the experiments? What were the batch sizes, number of GPUs, optimizer settings, etc.? How long did training take to converge?

9. In the ablation studies, what impact was observed when removing the 3D priors or 2D priors? What kind of objects were generated without each type of prior?

10. The paper shows comparisons to optimization methods and other multi-view diffusion models. Can you summarize the key advantages BiDiff demonstrates over these other approaches in terms of quality, efficiency, and flexibility?
