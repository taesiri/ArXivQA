# [Animate-A-Story: Storytelling with Retrieval-Augmented Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06940)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we automatically generate high-quality and coherent storytelling videos from textual descriptions, while providing control over aspects like structure, style, and characters?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By utilizing existing videos for retrieving motion structures and rerendering character appearances, in combination with a controllable text-to-video generation model, it is possible to synthesize customized storytelling videos that align well with narrative plots.

In particular, the paper proposes and evaluates:

1) A retrieval-augmented video generation framework that leverages external videos to provide structural guidance and enhance the text-to-video synthesis process. 

2) A structure-guided text-to-video model with adjustable depth control that resolves conflicts between structural guidance and character generation.

3) A new concept personalization method called TimeInv that outperforms prior approaches in consistently rerendering character appearances across different video clips.

The overall goal is to develop an effective pipeline for generating storytelling videos tailored to textual scripts or user specifications, while ensuring visual coherence across scenes. The key innovations appear to be in incorporating retrieval-based enhancements and customization capabilities into the controllable video generation process.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework for automatically generating storytelling videos by retrieving and synthesizing existing video clips, enabling controllable video generation through adjustable structure guidance and consistent character rendering across clips via a new concept personalization method.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in text-to-video generation:

- The core idea of incorporating video retrieval into the text-to-video generation process is novel. Most prior works have focused purely on training generative models like diffusion models on text-video datasets. Utilizing existing videos as references is a creative way to enhance the layout, motion, and structure of the generated videos.

- Using retrieved video structures/motion as conditional inputs to guide the text-to-video generation model is an effective approach. Some recent works have explored similar ideas of using poses, sketches or depths as structural conditions, but this paper uniquely leverages real video data as the structural reference.

- The proposed character rerendering method addresses an important problem in video generation - maintaining visual consistency across generated clips. Their proposed TimeInv approach for learning timestep-dependent token embeddings outperforms standard personalization techniques as shown in the experiments.

- Overall, the paper demonstrates strong results on the challenging task of storytelling video synthesis. The modular pipeline combining retrieval, structure-guided synthesis and character rerendering leads to higher quality and more controllable video generation compared to previous text-to-video models.

- One limitation is that the storyboard analysis and splitting still relies largely on manual work or linguistic models. Automating the storyline understanding from scripts could be an area of future work.

In summary, this paper presents useful innovations in incorporating retrieval into generative models and controlling the structure, layout and characters of synthesized videos. The comprehensive pipeline demonstrates promising improvements for generating coherent storytelling videos.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Improving the concept personalization approach to allow for more fine-grained control and better fidelity of rendered characters. The authors mention the need for a more general character control mechanism that does not require model finetuning. Developing better ways to balance character control with structural guidance is also noted as an area for improvement.

- Enhancing the storytelling capabilities of the system, such as by incorporating models that can automatically analyze text to extract plots and compose coherent storylines. The current pipeline relies on manual storyboard splitting. Integrating natural language processing techniques could make the system more end-to-end.

- Exploring alternative retrieval mechanisms and structure representations beyond just depth maps. The authors suggest that utilizing different video retrieval engines and extracting alternative structure cues like segmentation masks could provide additional control modalities.

- Scaling up the framework with larger datasets and models. As noted, the current text-to-video and retrieval models are still limited in quality. Training them on larger corpora could enhance video generation fidelity and retrieval relevance.

- Evaluating the approach on more diverse storylines and user studies. More comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments could better characterize the strengths and weaknesses of the system.

- Investigating video editing applications, since the synthesized video clips could serve as assets for video editing tools. The authors propose the system could enable new video creation and editing workflows.

In summary, the main research directions focus on improving concept control, storytelling abilities, video retrieval/structure modalities, model scaling, and evaluation of the presented video synthesis pipeline. Advancing these aspects could lead to a more flexible and practical system for automated storytelling video creation.

The paper presents a framework for generating storytelling videos from text descriptions by leveraging existing video clips. It consists of two main modules - motion structure retrieval and structure-guided text-to-video synthesis. The first module retrieves videos from a database that match the query text, and extracts motion structures from them as guidance. The second module is a controllable video generation model that takes the retrieved motion structure and text prompt as input to synthesize a video clip. To ensure visual consistency of characters across generated clips, a novel concept personalization method called TimeInv is proposed to learn timestep-dependent token embeddings that represent character identities. Experiments demonstrate advantages over baselines in video synthesis quality and personalization performance. Overall, the paper introduces a novel retrieval-augmented paradigm for generating high-quality, coherent storytelling videos in a customizable way.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel framework for generating storytelling videos from text descriptions. The key idea is to utilize existing video clips to provide structural guidance and motion context for the text-to-video generation process. The framework consists of two main modules - motion structure retrieval and structure-guided text-to-video synthesis. 

The first module retrieves candidate videos based on text queries using an off-the-shelf retrieval engine. The motion structure, in the form of depth maps, is extracted from the retrieved videos to serve as guidance. The second module is a latent diffusion model conditioned on text prompts and frame-level depth maps. This allows synthesizing videos with customizable appearances while following the motion patterns in the retrieved clips. To enable consistent character rendering across video clips, the paper proposes a new concept personalization method called TimeInv. This learns timestep-dependent token embeddings to represent character identities. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall framework and the advantages of the proposed video synthesis and personalization techniques over existing methods.

In summary, this paper presents a novel retrieval-augmented approach for automated storytelling video generation. By utilizing retrieved video assets and proposed generation techniques, it provides an efficient way to produce high-quality, customized animated videos tailored for storytelling.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a framework for generating storyline videos through retrieval-augmented video synthesis. The key ideas are:

1) They retrieve existing videos based on text prompts to provide motion structure guidance for the text-to-video generation process. The retrieved videos are passed through a depth estimator to extract the motion structures, which helps guide the layout and composition of the generated videos. 

2) They propose a controllable text-to-video synthesis model that takes the text prompt and per-frame depth maps as input. The model is based on a latent diffusion model which allows sampling of videos through a recurrent denoising process conditioned on the inputs. 

3) To achieve consistent character appearances across generated video clips, they propose a video character rerendering method. Specifically, they optimize timestep-dependent token embeddings to represent character identities and insert trainable matrices to attention modules to capture appearance details. This personalization approach ensures the generated characters match user specifications.

4) By combining retrieval-based motion guidance and controllable video synthesis with character rerendering, their framework can generate high-quality, customized storyline videos from text in a more efficient manner compared to traditional video production.

In summary, the core innovation is the retrieval-augmented video generation paradigm coupled with controllable synthesis and video character rerendering to automate the creation of storyline videos.
