# [What Happened 3 Seconds Ago? Inferring the Past with Thermal Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13651)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can thermal imaging be used to infer past human poses and motions from a single RGB image, in order to reduce the inherent ambiguity in this task?

The key hypothesis is that thermal images can provide useful information about traces of past human-object interactions, which can help infer where people were and what actions they were performing in the recent past. 

The paper aims to show that by using thermal imaging, the uncertainty and ambiguity in inferring past human motions from a single RGB image can be significantly reduced.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It makes the first attempt at a novel past human motion estimation task by exploiting thermal footprints. 

2. It constructs the Thermal-IM dataset, which contains synchronized RGB-Thermal and RGB-Depth videos of indoor human motion.

3. It proposes an effective three-stage model to infer past human motion from thermal images. The model consists of:

- GoalNet: Predicts possible past locations of the person based on thermal cues. 

- TypeNet: Infers the action/pose type the person might have been doing.

- PoseNet: Synthesizes an exact pose of the inferred type and location.

In summary, this paper explores using thermal imaging to infer past human poses, collects a new dataset for this task, and develops an interpretable 3-stage model that leverages thermal cues to generate accurate estimates of poses from a few seconds ago. The key insight is that thermal images encode useful traces of past interactions that can help resolve ambiguities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using thermal imaging to infer past human poses by collecting a new RGB-Thermal dataset of indoor human motion and developing a three-stage neural network model that leverages thermal cues to reduce ambiguity and estimate plausible past poses.
