# [CODA-Prompt: COntinual Decomposed Attention-based Prompting for
  Rehearsal-Free Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13218)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective rehearsal-free continual learning approach for vision transformers that has high capacity to learn new tasks while avoiding catastrophic forgetting?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Decomposing prompts into learnable components that are combined with input-conditioned weights will allow for expanded capacity compared to prior prompting methods.

2) Using an attention-based weighting scheme to combine the prompt components will enable end-to-end optimization of the prompting mechanism. 

3) Expanding prompting capacity along the "component" dimension rather than the prompt length dimension will lead to better utilization of parameters and greater gains in accuracy.

4) Freezing past task components and using an orthogonality constraint will reduce interference and forgetting.

The overall goal is to develop a rehearsal-free continual learning method for vision transformers that sets a new state-of-the-art by improving plasticity via the decomposed prompting approach while controlling forgetting through the proposed techniques. The experiments aim to validate whether this approach outperforms prior methods empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel continual learning method called CODA-Prompt. The key ideas are:

- It uses a decomposed prompt consisting of a weighted sum of learnable prompt components. This allows expanding prompting capacity to capture complex task information. 

- It uses an attention-based component weighting scheme to form input-conditioned prompts in an end-to-end manner. This increases plasticity to learn future tasks better.

- The prompting mechanism is optimized end-to-end with the task, unlike prior works that use separate optimizations.

- It expands prompting capacity when learning new tasks while freezing old components to mitigate forgetting. Orthogonality regularization further reduces interference.

In summary, CODA-Prompt contributes a new rehearsal-free continual learning approach that forms flexible input-conditioned prompts in an end-to-end manner. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on established benchmarks as well as a new dual-shift benchmark. The end-to-end optimization and capacity expansion are notable differences from prior arts.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel attention-based prompting method called CODA-Prompt that achieves state-of-the-art results on continual learning benchmarks by using an end-to-end optimized set of prompt components that expand with new tasks, enabling higher capacity and less catastrophic forgetting.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading, this paper makes several notable contributions to the field of rehearsal-free continual learning:

- It proposes a new method called CODA-Prompt that sets new state-of-the-art results on established rehearsal-free continual learning benchmarks like ImageNet-R, CIFAR-100, and DomainNet. The key ideas are using a decomposed attention-based prompt with expandable capacity and end-to-end optimization.

- The results show clear improvements over prior prompting methods like DualPrompt and L2P, with gains of up to 4.5% in average accuracy on ImageNet-R. This suggests CODA-Prompt advances prompting techniques for continual learning.

- The paper demonstrates strong performance on a new challenging benchmark with both class-incremental and domain-incremental shifts. This tests model robustness to real-world distributional shifts. Again, CODA-Prompt sets the new state-of-the-art.

- Compared to other areas like regularization and replay-based methods, prompting techniques have recently gained traction as a highly effective strategy for rehearsal-free continual learning. This paper pushes the boundaries of prompting further.

- The end-to-end optimized attention-based prompt assembly is novel compared to prior prompting works. The expandable prompt components also contrast with fixed prompt pool strategies.

Overall, I would summarize that this paper sets a new state-of-the-art for prompting techniques in the important setting of rehearsal-free continual learning. The decomposed attention-based prompting and end-to-end optimization are novel ideas that seem to advance prompt-based continual learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more advanced prompt learning methods that can further optimize prompt selection and formation in an end-to-end manner. The authors suggest their decomposed attention-based prompting scheme could be further enhanced.

- Exploring rehearsal-free continual learning with other model architectures beyond Vision Transformers, such as ConvNets. The authors' method is designed for ViTs but may not directly transfer to other architectures.

- Evaluating rehearsal-free continual learning methods on more complex benchmarks that better simulate real-world distribution shifts. The authors propose a new dual-shift benchmark but suggest more complex benchmarks are still needed. 

- Studying the interplay between plasticity and stability in rehearsal-free continual learning. The authors note there is a tradeoff between retaining past knowledge and adapting to new tasks that needs further investigation.

- Developing theory and formal analysis around rehearsal-free continual learning to better understand why methods like prompting work well. The authors note this is still an open area needing more analysis.

- Exploring whether rehearsal-free continual learning can approach or match the performance of replay-based continual learning. The authors show prompting methods are closing this gap but more work is needed.

In summary, the authors highlight the need for advances in prompt optimization, architectural generalization, benchmark complexity, plasticity-stability tradeoffs, theoretical understanding, and performance parity with replay-based methods as key future directions for rehearsal-free continual learning research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a continual learning method called CODA-Prompt that uses attention-based prompting to address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in vision transformers. The key ideas are:

- They propose a decomposed prompt consisting of a weighted sum of learnable prompt components. This allows higher prompting capacity compared to prior works like DualPrompt that use a fixed pool of prompts. 

- The prompt components are combined using an attention mechanism, where the weights are computed using cosine similarity between the input query and prompt component keys. This allows end-to-end optimization unlike prior works.

- When training on new tasks, they freeze previous prompt components and expand with new components to mitigate forgetting. Orthogonality regularization is used to reduce interference between old and new components.

- Experiments on ImageNet-R, CIFAR-100 and DomainNet benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance, improving average accuracy over DualPrompt by up to 4.5%. The method also generalizes well to a challenging dual-shift setting with both class-incremental and domain-incremental shifts.

- Overall, the decomposed attention-based prompting provides higher capacity, end-to-end optimization, and strong empirical performance compared to prior rehearsal-free continual learning methods for vision transformers.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes CODA-Prompt, a new method for rehearsal-free continual learning using prompts with vision transformers. Existing state-of-the-art prompting methods like DualPrompt select prompts from a fixed pool using a separate optimization process that cannot be trained end-to-end. The authors introduce a decomposed prompting approach where prompts are formed as a weighted sum of learnable prompt components. This allows prompts to grow in capacity and enables end-to-end training. 

The key ideas are: 1) Prompts are formed from a weighted sum of components rather than selected from a fixed pool. 2) Prompting capacity can grow by expanding the set of components. 3) The weighting scheme enables end-to-end training unlike prior prompting methods. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-R, CIFAR-100, and a new dual-shift benchmark with both class and domain incremental shifts. The method improves average accuracy over DualPrompt by up to 4.5% while using a comparable number of parameters. This highlights the benefits of the decomposed prompting approach for continual learning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a continual learning method called CODA-Prompt that uses a decomposed attention-based prompting approach. The key ideas are:

- Instead of selecting prompts from a fixed pool like in prior work, they form prompts dynamically using a weighted sum of learnable prompt components. This allows prompts to have higher capacity and grow adaptively. 

- They introduce an attention mechanism to weight the contribution of each prompt component based on similarity of keys to an input-conditioned query. This allows end-to-end optimization of the prompts.

- When learning new tasks, they freeze old prompt components and expand with new components, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Orthogonality regularization between components further reduces interference.

- Evaluated on ImageNet-R, CIFAR-100, and DomainNet benchmarks, their method sets a new state-of-the-art for rehearsal-free continual learning. It improves average accuracy over prior work by up to 4.5\% by having better plasticity while maintaining competitive forgetting. The gains highlight the benefits of their decomposed attention-based prompting approach.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for computer vision models. Specifically, it considers the challenging setting of rehearsal-free continual learning where past training data cannot be stored and replayed when learning new concepts.

- Existing approaches rely on directly fine-tuning the model, which leads to catastrophic forgetting. Recent prompting-based methods mitigate forgetting by learning prompts instead of fine-tuning weights, but have limitations in plasticity and end-to-end optimization. 

- This paper proposes a new prompting approach called CODA-Prompt that uses a decomposed set of learnable prompt components. The components are combined using input-conditioned attention-based weights to generate adaptive prompts. 

- The benefits are higher capacity from the component decomposition, encouragement of knowledge reuse across prompts, and end-to-end differentiability.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on common benchmarks like ImageNet-R and CIFAR-100, outperforming prior prompting techniques. The method also excels on a new proposed dual-shift benchmark with both class and domain shifts.

- The main contributions are a novel prompting scheme for rehearsal-free continual learning, superior results on existing benchmarks, and strong performance on a new challenging dual-shift benchmark.

In summary, the key question addressed is how to do effective rehearsal-free continual learning in computer vision without catastrophic forgetting, and the solution is a new attention-based prompting method with decomposed components that mitigates forgetting while improving plasticity.
