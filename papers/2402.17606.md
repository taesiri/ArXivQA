# [Learning Topological Representations with Bidirectional Graph Attention   Network for Solving Job Shop Scheduling Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17606)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing learning-based methods for solving job shop scheduling problems (JSSP) tailor off-the-shelf GNN models to undirected graphs, neglecting the rich topological structures of disjunctive graphs (DGs) used to represent JSSP instances and solutions. 
- Learning these topological structures can help GNNs better differentiate between high-quality and inferior solutions.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel bidirectional graph attention network (TBGAT) tailored for DGs to embed their unique topological features from both forward and backward perspectives.
- Independent graph attention modules learn embeddings by propagating messages following the respective topologies of the forward and backward views of the DG.
- A new algorithm inspired by message-passing mechanisms efficiently computes the forward and backward topological sorts of nodes in linear time, capturing global processing orders and DG topology.
- These topological sorts are then used as node features during embedding.

Main Contributions:  
- A topology-aware GNN architecture (TBGAT) tailored for learning on DGs using bidirectional attention and topological sorts as features.
- A novel linear-time algorithm for batch computation of topological sorts of DGs compatible with GPUs.  
- New state-of-the-art results on five synthetic and seven classic JSSP benchmark datasets, significantly outperforming neural baselines.
- Both theoretical and empirical demonstration of the linear time complexity of TBGAT w.r.t. number of jobs and machines.

In summary, the key innovation is in designing a GNN architecture and training approach specifically catered for DGs to effectively learn topological structures, unlike off-the-shelf GNNs. This allows superior modeling of JSSP instances and solutions using DGs.
