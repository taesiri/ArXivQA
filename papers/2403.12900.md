## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Generative AI models like LLMs are rapidly growing in popularity, requiring extensive computing infrastructure that contributes significant carbon emissions. 
- Specifically, the autoregressive inference process of generative LLMs is highly energy-intensive and poses an urgent need to reduce associated carbon footprint.
- Prior works focused on model size reduction or static configurations, failing to address the unique opportunities in LLM inference to dynamically optimize carbon efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces "generation directives" - instructions guiding how LLMs generate tokens for a prompt to control response length.  
- Presents Sprout - a system leveraging generation directives to minimize LLM inference carbon footprint while ensuring high quality.
- Formulates an optimization strategy to assign directive probabilities based on carbon intensity and generation quality feedback.
- Implements opportunistic offline evaluator using auto-LLM, ensuring quality assessments align with lower emissions periods.  

Key Contributions:
- First work addressing the carbon footprint of generative LLM inference services.
- Innovative concept of generation directives for carbon-aware LLM inference optimization.
- Detailed system design and implementation of the Sprout framework.
- Extensive evaluation demonstrating over 40% carbon reduction with high quality generation across global regions.
- Sets stage for continued research into sustainable practices for rapid Generative AI advancements.

In summary, this paper makes a pioneering contribution in tackling the environmental impacts of increasingly critical generative LLM inference workloads by strategically guiding output generation to enhance carbon efficiency. The proposed Sprout system offers a vital step toward ecologically responsible Generative AI.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Sprout, an innovative framework that leverages generation directives to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of generative language model inference while maintaining high quality content generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of Sprout, an innovative framework to reduce the carbon footprint of generative large language model (LLM) inference services. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) It introduces the concept of "generation directives", which are instructions associated with a user prompt to guide the LLM's token generation process. Using directives can generate accurate yet more concise responses, thus reducing carbon emissions. 

2) It designs and implements an optimization strategy leveraging generation directives to minimize the inference carbon footprint based on dynamic electricity grid carbon intensity and quality feedback. This is formulated as a linear programming problem.

3) It proposes an automatic offline quality assessment mechanism using a separate LLM evaluator to ensure the optimization decisions are informed by up-to-date content quality preferences. 

4) Extensive evaluations demonstrate Sprout reduces LLM inference carbon emissions by over 40% across regions while achieving high quality generations close to an idealized Oracle scheme.

In summary, the main contribution is the design and evaluation of the first carbon-aware inference framework for generative LLMs using the innovative concept of generation directives to guide token generation. This marks an important step toward sustainable AI practices.
