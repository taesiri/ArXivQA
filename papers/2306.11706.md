# [RoboCat: A Self-Improving Foundation Agent for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11706)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) Can a large transformer sequence model solve a diverse set of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks on multiple real robotic platforms? 2) Can the model quickly adapt to new, unseen tasks and embodiments using only a small dataset of expert demonstrations for fine-tuning?3) Does training the model on more and more diverse tasks improve its generalisation and adaptation capabilities? 4) Can the model be used to generate more data on new tasks, and can this data be incorporated to "self-improve" the model in an iterative fashion?The authors propose a goal-conditioned transformer model called RoboCat that is trained on a large dataset of robotic manipulation tasks spanning different embodiments, control modes, and object sets. The key hypotheses seem to be that RoboCat can leverage this heterogeneous dataset to perform well on a diverse test set, efficiently adapt to new tasks and platforms, and self-improve through an autonomous data generation and retraining loop. The experiments aim to validate these capabilities in simulation and the real world across different generalization axes.In summary, the main research questions revolve around training a single robotic manipulation agent on diverse multi-modal experience to enable generalisation, efficient adaptation, and self-improvement. The novelty lies in the goal-conditioned transformer approach trained end-to-end at scale on both simulated and real heterogeneous robotic experience.
