# [FLM-101B: An Open LLM and How to Train It with $100K Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03852)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions and hypotheses appear to be:

1. Can a large language model with over 100B parameters be trained from scratch with a budget of only $100K? The authors hypothesize that by using a "growth strategy" where the model starts small and expands during training, it is possible to train a 100B+ parameter model much more cost-effectively. 

2. Can a systematic evaluation paradigm be developed to evaluate the "IQ" of large language models in a way that complements existing knowledge-focused evaluations? The authors hypothesize that evaluations focused on symbolic mapping, rule understanding, pattern mining, and anti-interference abilities can provide a more holistic assessment of model intelligence.

3. How does the proposed model FLM-101B, trained with a $100K budget using the growth strategy, compare to powerful closed-source models like GPT-3 in terms of performance and cost-effectiveness? The authors hypothesize that FLM-101B can achieve comparable performance to GPT-3 at a fraction of the training cost.

In summary, the key research questions focus on training a 100B+ model cost-effectively, developing a systematic IQ evaluation benchmark, and benchmarking the performance and efficiency of the proposed FLM-101B model relative to state-of-the-art alternatives. The growth strategy and IQ evaluation are positioned as the main technical innovations to address these questions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Proposing a "growth strategy" to train a large language model (FLM-101B) with 100B+ parameters from scratch with a budget of only $100K. This is achieved by starting with a smaller model and progressively growing it to larger sizes during training. 

2. Developing a systematic benchmark to evaluate the "Intelligence Quotient" (IQ) of large language models, focusing on aspects like symbolic mapping, rule understanding, pattern mining, and anti-interference that require generalization beyond memorized knowledge.

3. Releasing the checkpoint and code for the FLM-101B model to promote research on large bilingual Chinese-English language models. The model achieves competitive results with powerful models like GPT-3 but at a fraction of the computational cost.

4. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the growth strategy through experiments showing knowledge inheritance and performance improvements as model size increases from 16B to 51B to 101B parameters.

So in summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing and demonstrating a highly cost-effective approach to training large language models, along with a new benchmark to evaluate model intelligence in a more fair and generalized manner. The release of the open-source FLM-101B model is also a valuable contribution to the community.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one-sentence summary:

The paper introduces FLM-101B, an open-source 101 billion parameter English-Chinese bilingual language model trained from scratch with a $100K budget using a growth strategy, and evaluates its performance on knowledge benchmarks as well as a proposed systematic IQ benchmark compared to GPT-3 and GLM-130B.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in large language model training:

- This paper focuses on training a large model (100B+ parameters) on a very limited budget of $100k. Most other work trains models of this scale on budgets orders of magnitude larger, so the budget constraint here is quite unique.

- The use of a "growth strategy" where the model size expands during training is an interesting approach to reducing costs. Most other work keeps the model size fixed throughout training. Expanding the model progressively could allow wider knowledge acquisition with the small model and better loss optimization with the large model.

- The model architecture uses decoder-only transformers like GPT, whereas some other large models use encoders (BERT) or encoder-decoders (T5). The choice of a GPT-style architecture seems well suited to the language modeling objective.

- For evaluation, this paper emphasizes evaluating "IQ" - symbolic mapping, rule understanding, pattern mining, etc. This differs from common evaluation schemes that focus more on knowledge and language tasks. Assessing these core facets of intelligence is a notable contribution.

- The model is bilingual, whereas many other large models focus only on English. Training a model with broader linguistic coverage on a budget is impressive.

Overall, the constrained budget training, unconventional growth strategy during training, and emphasis on evaluating intelligence and generalizability set this work apart from much other research on scaling up language models. The techniques used here to train a capable model at low cost could open up large language model development to a broader range of researchers.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Continuing to explore cost-effective training methods for large language models, such as the growth strategy proposed in this paper. The authors suggest this could help make training 100B+ models more feasible for a wider range of researchers.

- Developing better evaluation methods to assess the intelligence and capabilities of large language models. The authors propose their IQ evaluation benchmark as a step in this direction, but suggest more work is needed on systematic and fair evaluations.

- Applying the trained large language model checkpoints (like their released FLM-101B) to downstream tasks and fine-tuning approaches. The authors suggest their models could serve as a strong foundation for subsequent alignment studies.

- Expanding the knowledge and capabilities of large language models by incorporating more data from diverse domains. The authors suggest constructing basic large models with high IQ first, then expanding their knowledge as needed.

- Further work on aligning large language models with human preferences and ethics through techniques like policy learning. The authors cite this as an important direction for developing beneficial AI.

- Continued scaling up of model sizes, with careful evaluation, as larger models continue to show gains. The authors suggest their growth training strategy could be useful here.

In summary, the main future directions focus on developing more accessible and beneficial training paradigms for large models, improving evaluation methods, expanding model knowledge, aligning models with human values, and continued careful scaling. The authors present their work as a step toward enabling wider LLM research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces FLM-101B, an open-source large language model (LLM) with 101 billion parameters that was trained from scratch on a budget of only $100,000. To reduce training costs, the authors employ a growth strategy where the model starts small and expands in size during training, inheriting knowledge from previous stages. FLM-101B is based on the FreeLM architecture and incorporates improvements like unified training objectives. The authors also develop a systematic IQ benchmark to evaluate the intelligence and generalization abilities of LLMs, assessing symbolic mapping, rule understanding, pattern mining, and anti-interference skills. Experiments show FLM-101B achieves performance comparable to powerful closed-source models like GPT-3 but with much lower training costs. The model and code will be open-sourced to make large bilingual English-Chinese LLMs more accessible for research and applications. Overall, the paper demonstrates an effective method to train a competitive 100B+ LLM on a budget using growth strategies and introduces a promising IQ evaluation paradigm for assessing model intelligence.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces FLM-101B, a new open-source 101 billion parameter language model trained on a budget of only $100K. The key to reducing training costs is using a growth strategy, where the model starts small and expands during training. This allows the model to learn rapidly while small, then inherit that knowledge as it grows wider and deeper. FLM-101B uses the FreeLM architecture as a base, and integrates innovations like xPos embeddings for better long context modeling. It is trained on a mixture of English and Chinese data in an unsupervised fashion, with no task-specific datasets. 

The paper also proposes a new systematic benchmark to evaluate model intelligence quotient (IQ), not just knowledge. This includes tests of symbolic mapping, rule understanding, pattern mining, and anti-interference abilities. Experiments show FLM-101B achieves results comparable to powerful closed models like GPT-3, especially on the IQ tests where training data is unseen. Overall, the work demonstrates the feasibility of training 100B+ models at low cost, and the need for evaluations that go beyond knowledge to really measure intelligence. The authors plan to release FLM-101B checkpoints to enable more research opportunities on large multilingual models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using a "growth strategy" to train a large language model (LLM) called FLM-101B with 101 billion parameters on a budget of only $100,000. Instead of fixing the number of parameters from the start, they sequentially train models of increasing size - first 16B, then 51B, and finally 101B parameters. At each stage, the larger model inherits knowledge from the smaller predecessor through the use of function-preserving growth operators, enabling faster and more stable training. This growth strategy allows them to reduce the total training time and cost by over 50% compared to training a 101B model directly. The paper also introduces a systematic benchmark to evaluate the "Intelligence Quotient" (IQ) of LLMs on tasks like symbolic mapping, rule understanding, pattern mining, and anti-interference that require generalization beyond memorized knowledge. Experiments show FLM-101B achieves competitive performance to models like GPT-3 and GLM-130B on both knowledge and IQ benchmarks, despite its low training budget.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, this paper seems to be addressing two main issues:

1. High computational cost of training large language models (LLMs). The paper proposes using a "growth strategy" to significantly reduce the cost of training a 101B parameter LLM.

2. Fair and objective evaluation of LLMs. The paper consolidates additional evaluations inspired by IQ tests that focus on knowledge-oriented abilities and minimize the impact of memorization. These include symbolic mapping, rule understanding, pattern mining, and anti-interference evaluations.

In summary, the key problems/questions addressed are:

- How to reduce the computational cost of training very large LLMs?

- How to evaluate LLMs in a fair, objective manner that focuses more on reasoning/inference capabilities rather than memorization?

The growth strategy and additional IQ-inspired evaluations seem to be the main proposals to tackle these issues.
