## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Decision planning using large language models (LLMs) for AI agents faces the challenge of hallucination, where the LLM is overly confident about incorrect decisions. 
- Existing approaches to quantify uncertainty and address this issue either require access to internal model states or are computationally expensive, limiting the use of proprietary black-box LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an efficient non-parametric method to estimate point-wise dependencies between the user prompt+agent history and candidate agent actions using a single auxiliary network. 
- This dependency score indicates the likelihood of the action being correct, without needing access to internal LLM states.
- The paper also outlines a full pipeline to build an interactive home assistant agent that makes step-by-step decisions based on user prompts, using this uncertainty score to select high-confidence actions.

Main Contributions:
- An efficient black-box uncertainty quantification method for language models using point-wise dependency estimation.
- Demonstration of its use to build an interactive decision-making agent that solicits user feedback when uncertain and makes step-by-step plans. 
- Analysis showing the agent has higher accuracy with step-by-step planning compared to one-shot planning, and that the uncertainty score helps select more accurate actions.

In summary, the key innovation is an efficient uncertainty quantification approach for black-box LLMs to improve interactive decision planning, with analyses demonstrating its benefits. The method and overall agent design enable safer use of large proprietary models.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient non-parametric uncertainty quantification method for black-box large language models to enable reliable step-by-step decision planning in an interactive AI agent.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an efficient non-parametric uncertainty quantification method for black-box large language models, estimating point-wise dependencies between input-decision pairs using a single inference pass and without access to model internals like token logits. This allows uncertainty estimation when using proprietary models within budget constraints.

2. It outlines a systematic design for a decision-making agent that can generate actions like "turn on the bathroom light" based on user prompts like "take a bath". The agent incorporates the proposed uncertainty estimation method to determine when to ask for user clarification between multiple possible actions.

In summary, the key innovations are an efficient uncertainty quantification approach for black-box language models to enable their use in decision planning, along with a complete pipeline for an interactive decision-making agent that leverages this uncertainty information. The overall goal is to improve safety and robustness when using large language models for decision planning tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an efficient non-parametric uncertainty quantification method for black-box large language models. How does this method estimate the point-wise dependency between the input and output without access to internal model representations?
