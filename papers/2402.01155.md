# [CABINET: Content Relevance based Noise Reduction for Table Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01155)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "CABINET: Content Relevance based Noise Reduction for Table Question Answering":

Problem:
- Question answering (QA) over tables using large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied. However, typically only a small part of a table is relevant to answer a given question. 
- The irrelevant table data acts as noise which distracts LLMs, leading to poorer performance as they are vulnerable to noise. This issue becomes more severe for larger tables.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes CABINET, a framework to enable LLMs to focus on relevant tabular data by suppressing extraneous information.

- CABINET has two main components:
  1) Unsupervised Relevance Scorer: Assigns a relevance score to each table token indicating how relevant it is to the question. The relevance score is used to weigh the token embeddings before feeding to the QA LLM. This ensures irrelevant content gets suppressed.

  2) Relevant Cell Predictor: Comprises two modules - 
     a) Parsing Statement Generator: Generates a natural language statement describing criteria for rows/columns relevant to the question.  
     b) Cell Highlighting Module: Identifies and highlights cells matching the criteria. Content of highlighted cells gets an increased relevance score.

- The Unsupervised Relevance Scorer is trained along with the QA LLM in an end-to-end differentiable manner using the answer generation loss. The Relevant Cell Predictor provides additional weak supervision.

Main Contributions:
- CABINET achieves new state-of-the-art on WikiTQ, FeTaQA and WikiSQL datasets, outperforming table-specific models and in-context learning methods.
- It is more robust to noise and structural biases in tables. The gains are more pronounced for larger tables.
- Ablation studies validate the efficacy of the unsupervised relevance scoring and relevant cell prediction components.

In summary, CABINET enables QA LLMs to focus better on relevant table content by suppressing noise through content weighting, without removing any information explicitly. The weakly supervised relevant cell highlighter further aids the relevance scorer.
