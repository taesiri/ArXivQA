# [CABINET: Content Relevance based Noise Reduction for Table Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01155)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "CABINET: Content Relevance based Noise Reduction for Table Question Answering":

Problem:
- Question answering (QA) over tables using large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied. However, typically only a small part of a table is relevant to answer a given question. 
- The irrelevant table data acts as noise which distracts LLMs, leading to poorer performance as they are vulnerable to noise. This issue becomes more severe for larger tables.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes CABINET, a framework to enable LLMs to focus on relevant tabular data by suppressing extraneous information.

- CABINET has two main components:
  1) Unsupervised Relevance Scorer: Assigns a relevance score to each table token indicating how relevant it is to the question. The relevance score is used to weigh the token embeddings before feeding to the QA LLM. This ensures irrelevant content gets suppressed.

  2) Relevant Cell Predictor: Comprises two modules - 
     a) Parsing Statement Generator: Generates a natural language statement describing criteria for rows/columns relevant to the question.  
     b) Cell Highlighting Module: Identifies and highlights cells matching the criteria. Content of highlighted cells gets an increased relevance score.

- The Unsupervised Relevance Scorer is trained along with the QA LLM in an end-to-end differentiable manner using the answer generation loss. The Relevant Cell Predictor provides additional weak supervision.

Main Contributions:
- CABINET achieves new state-of-the-art on WikiTQ, FeTaQA and WikiSQL datasets, outperforming table-specific models and in-context learning methods.
- It is more robust to noise and structural biases in tables. The gains are more pronounced for larger tables.
- Ablation studies validate the efficacy of the unsupervised relevance scoring and relevant cell prediction components.

In summary, CABINET enables QA LLMs to focus better on relevant table content by suppressing noise through content weighting, without removing any information explicitly. The weakly supervised relevant cell highlighter further aids the relevance scorer.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

To enable language models to focus on relevant tabular data for question answering, the proposed CABINET framework weighs table content based on relevance using an unsupervised scorer trained jointly with the QA model, supplemented by a weakly supervised module that highlights relevant rows/columns through a generated parsing statement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing CABINET, a framework to enable language models to focus on relevant tabular data for table question answering by suppressing extraneous information. Specifically, CABINET comprises:

1) An Unsupervised Relevance Scorer that assigns relevance scores to table tokens based on their relevance to the input question. This allows suppressing irrelevant table content.

2) A weakly supervised module with two components: a) A Parsing Statement Generator that describes criteria for rows and columns relevant to the question; and b) A Cell Highlighter that identifies table cells matching the criteria and highlights them. The content of highlighted cells is given more weight.

3) CABINET significantly outperforms prior table QA methods and large language models on three challenging benchmarks - WikiTQ, FeTaQA and WikiSQL. It is also more robust to noise and performs stronger on larger tables.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a relevance scoring framework CABINET to help language models focus on pertinent table content for question answering by reducing the impact of irrelevant distracting information.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Table question answering (Table QA)
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Noise reduction
- Content relevance scoring
- Unsupervised relevance scorer
- Weakly supervised parsing statement generator
- Cell highlighting 
- Robustness to noise
- Performance on tables of varying sizes
- State-of-the-art results on WikiTQ, FeTaQA, and WikiSQL datasets

The paper proposes an approach called CABINET that weighs the relevance of table content to the question before feeding it to a question answering LLM. This allows the model to focus more on relevant information and reduces the impact of irrelevant or noisy content. The unsupervised relevance scorer and weakly supervised parsing statement generator are two key components. Experiments show CABINET achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple table QA datasets while also being more robust to noise, especially for larger tables.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an Unsupervised Relevance Scorer (URS) to weigh the relevance of table tokens to the question. How does the URS model the relevance score as a latent variable and use variational inference for estimation? What objectives and losses are used to train it?

2. The URS clusters the latent representations of table tokens into relevant and non-relevant categories. How is this clustering performed in a trainable manner? What is the intuition behind using a Student's t-distribution and KL divergence minimization for this? 

3. What is the Parsing Statement Generator module and how is it trained using a small set of manually annotated samples? What is the intuition behind using the complex WikiTableQuestions dataset for collecting annotation samples?

4. Once the Parsing Statement Generator creates statements describing relevant rows/columns, how does the Cell Highlighting module identify relevant cells? Explain the procedure of using the ToTTo dataset for this task.

5. How exactly are the unsupervised relevance scores from URS combined with the weakly supervised cell-based relevance scores? What impact does giving different weights to these two scores have on overall performance?

6. What design choices were explored for the different components of the proposed method (e.g. using BERT similarity instead of URS)? How did they perform compared to the proposed approach?

7. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of URS through quantitative experiments on robustness to different kinds of perturbations. Can you explain these experiments on row addition, row/column permutation etc. and how URS helps?

8. How does the performance of the proposed method vary with increasing table size? What conclusions can you draw about the method's ability to handle noise and identify relevant information?

9. Can you explain the interactions between the different losses used for trainable clustering of table token representations in URS through a case study? How do the losses complement each other?

10. The paper proposes an interpretation about why the different components like URS, Parsing Statement Generator and Cell Highlighting module are needed. Do you agree with this interpretation? What alternate approaches could also have been plausible?
