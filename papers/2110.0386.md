# [Dynamic processes in superconductors and the laws of thermodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.0386)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: How do dynamic processes in superconductors relate to the laws of thermodynamics, specifically the second law about entropy and irreversibility?The key points relevant to this research question are:- The paper examines the history of how physicists viewed superconducting transitions, in terms of whether they were reversible (no entropy increase) or irreversible (with entropy increase from Joule heating).- Before 1933 superconducting transitions were seen as irreversible with Joule heating. But after the discovery of the Meissner effect in 1933, they were viewed as reversible to avoid contradicting the second law. - The paper argues this was illogical, since Joule heating in the normal state should not depend on origins of currents in the superconducting state. - Experimental evidence is presented on phenomena like persistent currents in the presence of resistance, suggesting superconducting processes are not fully reversible.- The paper suggests conventional theories of superconductivity based on equilibrium thermodynamics are inconsistent regarding entropy and irreversibility. In summary, the central hypothesis is that standard theoretical frameworks may fail to fully capture the thermodynamic nature of superconducting transitions and dynamics. The evidence aims to highlight inconsistencies with the second law assumption of reversibility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of the main contributions:- The paper discusses the history of how physicists' views on whether the superconducting transition is reversible or irreversible have changed over time. - It highlights that before 1933, physicists believed the transition from the superconducting state to the normal state was irreversible due to Joule heating. - After the discovery of the Meissner effect in 1933, physicists had to change their view and consider the transition reversible, to avoid contradicting the 2nd law of thermodynamics.- The paper argues that this change in viewpoint was illogical, since the dissipation of energy in the normal state should not depend on how the current was generated in the superconducting state.- It points out that no theory of superconductivity, including the conventional BCS theory, can explain how a current could be dissipated in the normal state without Joule heating.- The paper presents experimental results on persistent currents and voltages in superconducting rings that provide evidence of irreversibility and Joule heating, contradicting the conventional reversible view. - It concludes that the belief in the 2nd law led to an inconsistent theory of superconductivity, and physicists should reconsider the status of the 2nd law based on logic and experimental evidence.In summary, the main contribution is highlighting the contradictory history and theories of reversible vs. irreversible superconducting transitions, and providing experimental support showing irreversibility and implications for reconsidering the 2nd law.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of superconductivity:- The paper focuses on analyzing the thermodynamic reversibility of the superconducting transition, especially in relation to the Meissner effect and Joule heating. This ties into fundamental questions about whether superconductivity can be described within equilibrium thermodynamics. Other recent work by J.E. Hirsch has similarly questioned the internal consistency of conventional BCS theory regarding reversibility and the Meissner effect.- The author provides a historical overview of how views on the reversibility of the superconducting transition have evolved since the 1930s. This historical context is useful, as most current research does not delve into the origins of the theoretical foundations in depth.- A significant portion of the paper is devoted to discussing experimental observations of persistent currents and spontaneous voltage in superconducting rings. The author argues these effects provide evidence for violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Comparatively fewer experimental papers focus on the thermodynamic implications; rather they aim to understand the underlying mechanisms behind persistent currents.- Theoretical analysis of the Ginzburg-Landau equations demonstrates their limitations for describing the dynamics of the superconducting transition. Other theoretical work utilizes GL theory extensively, so this critical perspective stands out. - Overall, the themes of irreversibility and connections to the second law of thermodynamics make this paper quite unique compared to other contemporary research on superconductivity, which tends to stay within the standard theoretical framework. The historical analysis and experimental evidence provide context for reconsidering long-standing fundamental assumptions.In summary, this paper provides a rare critical examination of the foundations of superconductivity theory, complemented by historical analysis and experimental results. This sets it apart from most current research, which operates wholly within the standard BCS/GL theoretical framework.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper discusses the historical belief that the transition from the superconducting to normal state involves irreversible Joule heating, and how this view was changed in the 1930s to consider the transition as reversible to avoid contradicting the Meissner effect and the second law of thermodynamics, resulting in an inconsistency in conventional theories of superconductivity regarding Joule heating that persists today.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors of this paper suggest a few future research directions:- Further experimental studies of dynamic processes in superconductors to clarify the issue of whether the superconducting transition violates the second law of thermodynamics. They suggest experiments investigating how surface screening currents are damped when superconductivity is destroyed.- Theoretical development of a model that can fully describe the dynamics of the superconducting transition, including changes in velocities and angular momenta of charge carriers. The current theories like Ginzburg-Landau theory have limitations in explaining the dynamics.- Studies of persistent currents and voltage generation in asymmetric superconducting rings to further probe the thermodynamic nature of superconductivity. The authors suggest experiments varying parameters like the switching frequency between superconducting and normal states.- Experiments investigating the force propelling charge carriers in the Meissner effect and other superconductivity dynamics. There are open questions about what provides the driving force when standard electromagnetic forces seem insufficient.- Broader reconsideration of belief in the absolute validity of the second law of thermodynamics. The experimental results mentioned in this paper appear to challenge the second law, so the authors suggest the physics community re-evaluate this long-standing assumption.In summary, the main future directions are further experiments probing the dynamic processes and thermodynamics of superconductivity, developing theories to explain the observed dynamics, and questioning underlying assumptions like the absolute status of the second law of thermodynamics. The authors aim to spur research to resolve inconsistencies in the current understanding of superconductivity.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper discusses the transition from the superconducting to normal state in a magnetic field and how it relates to the laws of thermodynamics. Historically, before 1933 this transition was considered an irreversible process with Joule heating. But after the discovery of the Meissner effect in 1933, physicists considered it a reversible process to avoid contradicting the second law of thermodynamics. The author argues that this change in thinking was illogical, since Joule heating in the normal state should not depend on how the current appeared in the superconducting state. He reviews experimental evidence showing that persistent currents can exist with nonzero resistance, indicating Joule heating occurs, contradicting the conventional theories of superconductivity based on equilibrium thermodynamics. The author concludes that the belief in the validity of the second law of thermodynamics has led to inconsistencies in theories of superconductivity and conflicts with experimental results.
