# [Dynamic processes in superconductors and the laws of thermodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.0386)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: How do dynamic processes in superconductors relate to the laws of thermodynamics, specifically the second law about entropy and irreversibility?The key points relevant to this research question are:- The paper examines the history of how physicists viewed superconducting transitions, in terms of whether they were reversible (no entropy increase) or irreversible (with entropy increase from Joule heating).- Before 1933 superconducting transitions were seen as irreversible with Joule heating. But after the discovery of the Meissner effect in 1933, they were viewed as reversible to avoid contradicting the second law. - The paper argues this was illogical, since Joule heating in the normal state should not depend on origins of currents in the superconducting state. - Experimental evidence is presented on phenomena like persistent currents in the presence of resistance, suggesting superconducting processes are not fully reversible.- The paper suggests conventional theories of superconductivity based on equilibrium thermodynamics are inconsistent regarding entropy and irreversibility. In summary, the central hypothesis is that standard theoretical frameworks may fail to fully capture the thermodynamic nature of superconducting transitions and dynamics. The evidence aims to highlight inconsistencies with the second law assumption of reversibility.
