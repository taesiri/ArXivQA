# [HyperZ$\cdot$Z$\cdot$W Operator Connects Slow-Fast Networks for Full   Context Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17948)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Residual networks rely on additive skip connections between layers to address performance degradation in very deep models. However, this limits model interpretability and greedy layerwise training.  
- Small convolution kernels in residual nets lead to loss of information at each layer, requiring compensation from prior layers. Increasing kernel size causes exponential growth in parameters.
- Attention mechanisms in transformers have high compute and memory costs that limit input sizes. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a "Terminator" architecture without residual learning, using multi-branch blocks and large implicit convolution kernels for full context interaction at each layer.
- Use a slow network to generate large "hyper-kernels", and a fast network that interacts with the input. The weights of the slow network remain fixed after training.
- Propose a HyperZZW operator to make the kernels context-dependent. It combines the hyper-kernels and activations using elementwise multiplication rather than expensive dot-product attention.
- Construct multi-branch SFNE blocks with hyper-kernels of varying sizes, bottleneck layers to remove noise, and components like RGU and hyper-channel interaction modules.

Main Contributions:  
- Ablation of residual learning through novel slow-fast network and HyperZZW operator
- Faster training convergence and fewer parameters than ResNets
- Introduce concepts like local feedback loss, recursive gated units, hyper-channel interactions
- Achieve SOTA on pixel-level 1D & 2D image classification with fewer parameters than prior arts
- Model exhibits excellent properties like zero-mean features and stability without affine/momentum parameters

In summary, the paper presents a Terminator architecture without residual learning that interacts features at all scales while being trainable efficiently. The design choices allow it to surpass prior models on several image recognition tasks.
