# [GaussCtrl: Multi-View Consistent Text-Driven 3D Gaussian Splatting   Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08733)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "GaussCtrl: Multi-View Consistent Text-Driven 3D Gaussian Splatting Editing":

Problem:
- Neural 3D scene representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow high-quality novel view synthesis, but editing them remains challenging. 
- Recent works edit them by rendering images, editing the images with text prompts, and updating the 3D model. However, editing images independently causes inconsistencies across views, leading to blurry or unreasonable 3D results.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes GaussCtrl, a text-driven method to edit 3DGS scenes with multi-view consistency.
- It renders images using the 3DGS scene and edits them with a pre-trained diffusion model (ControlNet) based on text prompts. The edited images are then used to update the 3DGS.
- Two key contributions for multi-view consistency:
   1) Depth-conditioned image editing: Conditions image editing on consistent depth maps using ControlNet to enforce geometric consistency.
   2) Attention-based latent code alignment: Aligns appearance of edited images to reference views using self- and cross-view attention on latent codes.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes an efficient approach to text-guided editing of 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes.
- Uses depth guidance and attention-based alignment for multi-view consistent editing, avoiding blurriness or artifacts.  
- Demonstrates higher visual quality and better consistency than previous state-of-the-art methods on various 3D editing tasks.
- The depth-conditioned editing and latent code alignment provide faster editing and improved realism.

In summary, the paper presents a novel framework GaussCtrl that leverages diffusion models to edit 3D scene representations in a multi-view consistent manner for high-quality text-driven 3D editing. The consistency control through geometric and appearance alignment leads to more realistic edits compared to prior arts.
