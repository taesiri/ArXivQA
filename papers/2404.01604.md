## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "WaveDH: Wavelet Sub-bands Guided ConvNet for Efficient Image Dehazing":

Problem:
Image dehazing aims to restore a haze-free image from a hazy input image. While deep learning methods have advanced image dehazing performance, many rely on complex and computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-world applications with limited resources. Therefore, there is a need for efficient and lightweight deep dehazing models that balance performance and computational complexity.

Solution:
The paper proposes WaveDH, a novel wavelet sub-bands guided convolutional network for efficient single image dehazing. The key ideas are:

1) Wavelet-guided upsampling and downsampling blocks that leverage discrete wavelet transform's invertible downsampling to optimize feature sampling while preserving details. This includes a squeeze-and-attention mechanism for downsampling and a dual upsample & fuse mechanism for upsampling.

2) Frequency-aware feature refinement block that separates low- and high-frequency features and refines them in a coarse-to-fine manner, enhancing computational efficiency. Structural context is extracted from downsampled low-frequencies while high-frequency details are recovered through feature distillation.  

3) Overall lightweight network design optimized for efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. This includes customized depthwise separable convolutions and group convolutions configured for an optimal efficiency-performance trade-off.

Main Contributions:
- Novel wavelet sub-bands guided ConvNet architecture for efficient image dehazing
- Wavelet-based upsampling & downsampling blocks with squeeze-and-attention and dual upsample & fuse mechanisms
- Frequency-aware feature refinement block refining low- and high-frequencies separately in a coarse-to-fine approach  
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art dehazing quality with up to 4x fewer parameters and 3.7x fewer computations than existing methods

The experiments validate WaveDH's effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. This enables high-quality dehazing suitable for real-world resource-constrained applications.
