# [SwissNYF: Tool Grounded LLM Agents for Black Box Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10051)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing approaches for tool usage by large language models (LLMs) rely on accessing the responses from tool API calls. This works well for simple APIs but faces challenges with irreversible APIs that can significantly impact systems, APIs requiring extensive time per call, and scenarios needing forward planning like pipelines.  
- LLMs also struggle in "black box" settings where there is no access to API implementations, responses or secrets to use them. Traditional planning methods fail here. However, LLMs excel at program synthesis tasks useful for such settings.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose TOPGUN, combining program synthesis with tool orchestration planning for black box systems. 
- They introduce SwissNYF, a suite enabling LLM agents to efficiently navigate action spaces to find valid solutions using only tool descriptions. It has components for function signature generation, corpus and retrieval, planning, verification and parsing.
- A key innovation is CodeSynth which generates pseudo function signatures from tool descriptions for the planner to use instead of actual APIs. This enhances efficiency.
- TOPGUN formulates planning as a code generation task using these pseudo functions. It leverages the inherent capabilities of LLMs in program synthesis to directly create coherent tool orchestration plans.

Contributions:
- They coin the term "black box" setting for tool planning and develop the first suite to address it.
- For the first time, they augment LLMs' tool usage capability by harnessing their program synthesis strengths. This substantially enhances performance.  
- They introduce a robust and efficient framework for tool planning using only descriptions that generalizes across diverse queries and limited user data/tools.
- Evaluations demonstrate superior performance against prior methods on standard and custom black box datasets.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in adapting LLMs for complex tool planning tasks using program synthesis, especially in black box constrained environments. SwissNYF and TOPGUN offer an emerging paradigm for private, efficient and versatile tool usage.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces SwissNYF, a comprehensive suite for developing algorithms to enable large language models to effectively plan and verify tool usage strategies in complex black box environments with limited tool knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors coin the term "black box setting" for tool planning scenarios where the outcomes of APIs/tools are not observable. They develop a suite called SwissNYF to enable LLMs to effectively operate in such black box settings.

2. They introduce a framework called TOPGUN that unifies code generation, reasoning, and strategic tool planning for addressing complex tasks. TOPGUN leverages the program synthesis capabilities of LLMs to substantially augment their efficacy in tool usage.

3. They present a robust and cost-efficient methodology that is scalable across a wide array of open-domain queries, even when faced with limited knowledge of user data/tools. Their approach is evaluated to demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional tool planning strategies.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing methods (SwissNYF, TOPGUN) to enable effective tool planning by LLMs in challenging black box scenarios by harnessing LLMs' program synthesis capabilities. Their proposed approach is more accurate, efficient and generalizable compared to prior methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper introduces the concept of a "black box" setting for tool planning. What are the key characteristics of this setting and what makes it challenging compared to white box or gray box settings?

2) The TOPGUN framework combines program synthesis and tool orchestration. How does leveraging program synthesis capabilities of LLMs help address limitations of previous approaches like traversal-based techniques or reverse chain?

3) CodeSynth is used to generate pseudo function signatures from tool descriptions. What is the rationale behind this and how does the iterative refinement using reflexion ensure high quality signatures? 

4) The paper claims TOPGUN offers enhanced generalizability for black box settings. What aspects of the approach contribute to this? How is the evaluation methodology designed to validate this?

5) The prompting methodology seems crucial to guiding the LLM effectively. What nuances go into crafting prompts for complex objectives like tool orchestration and program synthesis? How have the prompts been refined over multiple experiments?

6) How suitable is ToolBench for evaluating gray box performance despite being originally compiled for black box settings? What adaptations were required to the dataset and evaluation approach?

7) The private dataset comprises tools with renamed internal functions to preclude LLM's prior knowledge. Why is this important and how does it rigorously validate generalizability? 

8) How effective is the win rate metric in drawing comparisons between tool orchestration techniques? What are its limitations? Are there better evaluation metrics that can be explored?

9) For black box evaluation, the paper compares against a tailored Reverse Chain approach. What modifications were made to this baseline and why is it an appropriate performance benchmark?

10) The framework seems generic enough to incorporate more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms like AnyTool. How can the overall approach be extended to leverage such future advancements in a plug-and-play manner?
