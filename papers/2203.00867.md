# [Incremental Transformer Structure Enhanced Image Inpainting with Masking   Positional Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00867)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a novel image inpainting method that focuses on restoring both textures and structures in images. The central hypothesis is that leveraging an auxiliary attention-based transformer model to explicitly restore global structures, and incrementally incorporating this structural information into a pretrained inpainting model, can significantly improve inpainting performance compared to existing methods. Specifically, the key research questions/hypotheses seem to be:- Can an auxiliary transformer model effectively restore global image structures (edges, lines) in a low-resolution sketch space? - Can this structural sketch information be seamlessly integrated into a pretrained inpainting model through a residual addition strategy, allowing incremental improvement without full retraining?- Will explicitly providing positional encoding for masked regions, through a proposed masking positional encoding, improve inpainting results compared to implicit positional information?- Can this overall approach of separate structure restoration plus incremental integration outperform existing state-of-the-art inpainting methods, especially for images with weak textures or large masks?So in summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging explicit global structure recovery and explicit positional encodings, and incrementally integrating this information into a pretrained inpainting model, will push inpainting performance beyond current state-of-the-art. The various research questions address the key components and validate their utility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes an incremental transformer structure enhanced image inpainting method with masking positional encoding. The main contributions are:1. It uses a transformer to learn a normalized grayscale sketch tensor space for inpainting. The transformer can learn better holistic structures compared to CNNs.2. It proposes an incremental training strategy using zero-initialized residual addition to incorporate the structural information from the transformer into a pretrained inpainting model without full retraining. 3. It introduces a masking positional encoding strategy to provide position information for the masked regions, which improves inpainting performance especially for large masks.4.

The masking positional encoding also helps for large irregular masks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel image inpainting method called ZITS that uses a transformer to restore low-resolution image structures which are then incrementally incorporated into a pretrained CNN-based inpainting model to enhance texture recovery, along with a masking positional encoding strategy to handle large irregular mask regions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in image inpainting:- It focuses on improving both texture and structure for inpainting, whereas some prior work focused more on just textures (e.g. periodic textures) or structures (e.g. edges). This paper aims to do better on both.- It proposes using a transformer model to capture long-range dependencies and generate better holistic structures. Most prior inpainting methods rely on CNNs which have more limited receptive fields. Transformers have shown promise in image generation but haven't been explored much for inpainting yet.- The method incorporates auxiliary structure information incrementally into a pretrained texture inpainting model via a novel ZeroRA training strategy. This allows flexibly improving an existing model without full retraining. Prior auxiliary-based inpainting methods typically require training the full model from scratch. - It introduces a masking positional encoding technique specifically designed for the inpainting task, to provide useful position information for masked regions. Explicit positional encoding hasn't been explored for inpainting before.- The model achieves state-of-the-art results on Places and indoor datasets especially for structural recovery. It also generalizes well to high resolutions like 1K and 2K images where many prior methods degrade.Overall, the incremental transformer structure with masking positional encoding provides a novel way to enhance both texture and structure generation for inpainting. The flexible training approach and strong results across datasets and resolutions are advantages over prior art. This looks like an promising new direction for inpainting research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Investigating more powerful transformer architectures for structure recovery. The authors used a relatively simple transformer model, but mention that exploring larger and more advanced transformer models could further improve performance for learning holistic structures.- Extending the auxiliary sketch tensor space. The current model uses edges and lines as the sketch representation. The authors suggest investigating other types of sparse auxiliary representations that could provide useful structural cues for image inpainting.- Improving the upsampling of auxiliary representations. The paper relies on a simple learned upsampling for edges and lines. More advanced upsampling techniques tailored for sparse structural representations could help convey finer details to higher resolutions. - Applying the incremental training approach to other inpainting methods. The ZeroRA technique showed promise for efficiently integrating auxiliary information into an existing model. Exploring this for other inpainting architectures could make them more flexible.- Developing better positional encodings for inpainting. The masking positional encoding helped, but more informative encodings of masked regions could further improve results.- Evaluating on more diverse and higher-resolution datasets. Testing on more varied and larger images can better reveal strengths and limitations of different approaches.- Exploring applications beyond inpainting. The ideas may generalize to other image restoration tasks like denoising, super-resolution, etc.So in summary, the main directions are developing better transformer architectures, auxiliary representations, upsampling techniques, positional encodings, and training strategies for inpainting. And testing the ideas on more diverse data and applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new image inpainting method called ZeroRA based Incremental Transformer Structure (ZITS) enhanced with Masking Positional Encoding (MPE). The key idea is to leverage a transformer-based model to restore holistic image structures in a low-resolution grayscale sketch space consisting of edges and lines. This structural information is then incrementally incorporated into a pretrained inpainting model using a Zero-initialized Residual Addition (ZeroRA) technique, which allows efficient finetuning. Additionally, a novel Masking Positional Encoding strategy is introduced to provide positional information for the mask region and improve generalization. Experiments on Places2, ShanghaiTech, NYUDepthV2, and MatterPort3D datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to prior inpainting methods. The model is able to generate high-quality inpainting results with improved textures and structures. A simple upsampling module can scale the sketch space to arbitrary resolutions. Overall, the work presents an effective way to enhance image inpainting through explicit holistic structure modeling and incremental auxiliary incorporation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel ZeroRA based Incremental Transformer Structure (ZITS) image inpainting framework enhanced with Masking Positional Encoding (MPE). The key idea is to leverage a transformer-based model to restore holistic image structures in a grayscale sketch space. This allows capturing long-range dependencies to recover edges and lines. The grayscale sketch maps can then be easily upsampled to higher resolutions to provide structural guidance. A gated convolution network encodes these structural features and transfers them to a Fourier Convolution Network (FCN) inpainting model using a Zero-initialized Residual Addition (ZeroRA). This allows efficiently integrating the structural information into a pretrained FCN model with just a small amount of finetuning. Additionally, a Masking Positional Encoding (MPE) strategy is introduced to provide explicit position information for the masked regions, which helps generate smoother and more consistent results. The proposed ZITS framework is evaluated on Places2, ShanghaiTech, NYUDepthV2, and MatterPort3D datasets. It demonstrates improved performance over prior methods like EdgeConnect, Contextual Residual Aggregation, and Large Mask Inpainting, especially for recovering reasonable holistic structures. Ablations verify the contribution of the transformer structure restorer, ZeroRA incremental training strategy, and MPE components. Experiments also show ZITS can generate competitive results on high-resolution images up to 2048x2048 pixels. Overall, it provides an effective way to leverage explicit structural and positional information to boost image inpainting performance.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:This paper proposes a novel image inpainting method called ZITS that incrementally incorporates structural information to restore corrupted images. The key components are: 1) A Transformer Structure Restorer (TSR) that uses axial and standard attention blocks to recover holistic image structures like edges and lines in a low-resolution grayscale sketch space. 2) A Simple Structure Upsampler (SSU) using a CNN to upsample the sketch structures to higher resolutions. 3) A Structure Feature Encoder (SFE) that extracts multi-scale features from the upsampled sketches using gated convolutions. 4) A Fourier CNN Texture Restoration (FTR) model that restores textures using Fast Fourier Convolutions (FFC). 5) A Zero-initialized Residual Addition (ZeroRA) technique to incrementally fuse the structural features from SFE into the pretrained FTR model for fast finetuning. 6) A Masking Positional Encoding (MPE) that encodes distances and directions from unmasked to masked regions to improve generalization. Experiments show the proposed ZITS method outperforms other image inpainting techniques, especially for recovering structures and textures in high-resolution images.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing several issues with current image inpainting methods:1. Limited receptive fields of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - CNNs struggle to generate semantically consistent textures and fill in large missing regions due to their local inductive bias and narrow receptive fields. 2. Missing holistic image structures - Reconstructing key edges and lines, especially in images with weak textures, is difficult without a holistic understanding of the image.3. Heavy computational load - Training GANs for large, high-resolution images is very computationally expensive.4. Lack of positional information - Without explicit position encoding, inpainting models tend to repeat artifacts in large irregular mask regions. To address these issues, the paper proposes an incremental transformer structure enhanced image inpainting method with masking positional encoding. The key ideas are:- Using a transformer to recover holistic grayscale image structures (edges/lines) in a normalized sketch space that can be easily upsampled.- Incrementally incorporating the recovered structures into a pretrained CNN inpainting model using zero-initialized residual addition.- Introducing masking positional encoding to provide position information for masked regions.So in summary, the paper aims to improve inpainting performance, especially for large and high-resolution images, by enhancing existing models with holistic structural information and positional encoding. The proposed incremental training approach also allows efficiently integrating these improvements into pretrained models.
