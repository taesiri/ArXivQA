# Incremental Transformer Structure Enhanced Image Inpainting with Masking   Positional Encoding

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a novel image inpainting method that focuses on restoring both textures and structures in images. The central hypothesis is that leveraging an auxiliary attention-based transformer model to explicitly restore global structures, and incrementally incorporating this structural information into a pretrained inpainting model, can significantly improve inpainting performance compared to existing methods. Specifically, the key research questions/hypotheses seem to be:- Can an auxiliary transformer model effectively restore global image structures (edges, lines) in a low-resolution sketch space? - Can this structural sketch information be seamlessly integrated into a pretrained inpainting model through a residual addition strategy, allowing incremental improvement without full retraining?- Will explicitly providing positional encoding for masked regions, through a proposed masking positional encoding, improve inpainting results compared to implicit positional information?- Can this overall approach of separate structure restoration plus incremental integration outperform existing state-of-the-art inpainting methods, especially for images with weak textures or large masks?So in summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging explicit global structure recovery and explicit positional encodings, and incrementally integrating this information into a pretrained inpainting model, will push inpainting performance beyond current state-of-the-art. The various research questions address the key components and validate their utility.
