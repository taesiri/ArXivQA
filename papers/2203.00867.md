# Incremental Transformer Structure Enhanced Image Inpainting with Masking   Positional Encoding

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a novel image inpainting method that focuses on restoring both textures and structures in images. The central hypothesis is that leveraging an auxiliary attention-based transformer model to explicitly restore global structures, and incrementally incorporating this structural information into a pretrained inpainting model, can significantly improve inpainting performance compared to existing methods. Specifically, the key research questions/hypotheses seem to be:- Can an auxiliary transformer model effectively restore global image structures (edges, lines) in a low-resolution sketch space? - Can this structural sketch information be seamlessly integrated into a pretrained inpainting model through a residual addition strategy, allowing incremental improvement without full retraining?- Will explicitly providing positional encoding for masked regions, through a proposed masking positional encoding, improve inpainting results compared to implicit positional information?- Can this overall approach of separate structure restoration plus incremental integration outperform existing state-of-the-art inpainting methods, especially for images with weak textures or large masks?So in summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging explicit global structure recovery and explicit positional encodings, and incrementally integrating this information into a pretrained inpainting model, will push inpainting performance beyond current state-of-the-art. The various research questions address the key components and validate their utility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes an incremental transformer structure enhanced image inpainting method with masking positional encoding. The main contributions are:1. It uses a transformer to learn a normalized grayscale sketch tensor space for inpainting. The transformer can learn better holistic structures compared to CNNs.2. It proposes an incremental training strategy using zero-initialized residual addition to incorporate the structural information from the transformer into a pretrained inpainting model without full retraining. 3. It introduces a masking positional encoding strategy to provide position information for the masked regions, which improves inpainting performance especially for large masks.4. Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art inpainting methods on datasets like Places2, ShanghaiTech, NYUDepthV2, and MatterPort3D.In summary, the key novelty is using a transformer and incremental training to enhance a pretrained inpainting model with holistic structure and positional information, which leads to improved performance while being efficient. The masking positional encoding also helps for large irregular masks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel image inpainting method called ZITS that uses a transformer to restore low-resolution image structures which are then incrementally incorporated into a pretrained CNN-based inpainting model to enhance texture recovery, along with a masking positional encoding strategy to handle large irregular mask regions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in image inpainting:- It focuses on improving both texture and structure for inpainting, whereas some prior work focused more on just textures (e.g. periodic textures) or structures (e.g. edges). This paper aims to do better on both.- It proposes using a transformer model to capture long-range dependencies and generate better holistic structures. Most prior inpainting methods rely on CNNs which have more limited receptive fields. Transformers have shown promise in image generation but haven't been explored much for inpainting yet.- The method incorporates auxiliary structure information incrementally into a pretrained texture inpainting model via a novel ZeroRA training strategy. This allows flexibly improving an existing model without full retraining. Prior auxiliary-based inpainting methods typically require training the full model from scratch. - It introduces a masking positional encoding technique specifically designed for the inpainting task, to provide useful position information for masked regions. Explicit positional encoding hasn't been explored for inpainting before.- The model achieves state-of-the-art results on Places and indoor datasets especially for structural recovery. It also generalizes well to high resolutions like 1K and 2K images where many prior methods degrade.Overall, the incremental transformer structure with masking positional encoding provides a novel way to enhance both texture and structure generation for inpainting. The flexible training approach and strong results across datasets and resolutions are advantages over prior art. This looks like an promising new direction for inpainting research.
