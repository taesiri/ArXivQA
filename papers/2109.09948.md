# [Neural networks with trainable matrix activation functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09948)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we construct neural network activation functions that are adaptive and trainable, in order to improve the performance and robustness of neural networks? The key ideas and contributions are:- The paper proposes a systematic approach to constructing matrix activation functions whose entries are generalized from ReLU. The activation functions depend on parameters that can be trained along with the weights and biases.- The activation functions are based on matrix-vector multiplications using only scalar multiplications and comparisons, making them simple and efficient.- The paper introduces diagonal and tridiagonal matrix activation functions where the diagonal and off-diagonal entries are piecewise constant functions represented with trainable parameters. - This allows different activation functions to be learned for each neuron and layer, adapted to the specific problem. The approach includes ReLU networks as a special case.- Neural networks with the proposed trainable matrix activation functions are shown to be robust and effective on function approximation and image classification tasks, outperforming networks with fixed activation functions like ReLU.In summary, the central hypothesis is that making the activation functions adaptive and trainable can improve neural network performance. The paper proposes an approach to achieve this and validates the hypothesis through numerical experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method to construct matrix activation functions for neural networks, whose entries depend on trainable parameters. The key ideas are:- The activation function at each layer is realized by a matrix-vector multiplication, instead of applying a fixed nonlinear scalar function component-wise. - The entries of the activation matrix are generalized from ReLU and depend on trainable parameters such as thresholds and function values. - This allows the activation function to be adapted to the data during training. The resulting neural network has activation functions that vary for different layers and neurons.- The proposed trainable matrix activation is shown to be more flexible and achieve better performance than standard ReLU-based activations in numerical experiments on function approximation and image classification tasks.In summary, the authors develop a systematic way to make the activation functions in neural networks trainable, so that they can be optimized along with the weights and biases during training. This allows adapting the activation functions to fit the target function or dataset.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper on trainable matrix activation functions compares to other related research:- Most prior work on activation functions has focused on proposing new fixed nonlinear activation functions like ReLU, ELU, SELU etc. This paper takes a different approach by making the activation function trainable and adaptive.- A few prior works have explored making activation functions trainable, like parametric ReLU. However, this paper proposes more complex trainable matrix-based activation that goes beyond just scalar parameters. - The matrix activation functions proposed in the paper are able to approximate any piecewise constant function, allowing greater flexibility compared to standard fixed activation functions.- The paper shows strong empirical results on function approximation and image classification tasks, demonstrating the benefits of the trainable activation approach. The method outperforms baseline ReLU and parametric ReLU models.- The proposed technique is simple and efficient to implement, requiring only scalar operations. It can be easily incorporated into standard neural network architectures.- Overall, the trainable matrix activation function idea is novel compared to prior activation function research, and the paper provides a systematic framework and promising results on this concept. The approach allows activation to be optimized for each problem, overcoming limitations of fixed activations.In summary, this paper introduces a new way of thinking about adaptive, trainable activation functions that is different from most prior work and demonstrates effective results on representative tasks. The approach opens up a new research direction of learning problem-specific flexible activation within neural networks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring more general matrix activation functions beyond the diagonal and tridiagonal forms presented in this work. The authors suggest that even full matrix activations could be possible, though potentially costly to train.- Adjusting or optimizing the intervals used to define the piecewise constant activations during training. They mention this could further improve performance on benchmark datasets. - Considering trainable nonlinear activation operators based on rescaling other activation functions like sigmoid instead of just generalizing ReLU.- Analyzing the theoretical properties of the trainable matrix activation functions, such as approximation capabilities or optimization landscape. - Evaluating the performance on a broader range of problems and datasets, especially more complex ones where trainable activations may have a bigger impact.- Comparing to other adaptive activation functions like maxout units or adaptive piecewise linear units.- Investigating whether insights from the matrix activation framework could inform development of new fixed activation functions.- Considering extensions for convolutional neural networks and other architectures beyond fully-connected networks.- Studying how to best set the number of piecewise intervals and neurons to balance accuracy and computational complexity.So in summary, the authors lay out a research program for further developing matrix activation functions and applying them to demonstrate their effectiveness on practical problems. Both theoretical analysis and more extensive experimentation are needed to fully understand these proposed trainable activations.
