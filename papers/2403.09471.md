# [MambaTalk: Efficient Holistic Gesture Synthesis with Selective State   Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09471)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating realistic and diverse full-body gestures that synchronize with speech is challenging. RNNs struggle with long sequences due to cumulative latency and long-term forgetting. Transformers have quadratic computational complexity which hinders generation of long sequences. Diffusion models are computationally expensive leading to high latency. Generating long, holistic gesture sequences with low latency remains an open challenge.

Method:
The paper explores using selective state space models (SSMs) for gesture synthesis to address the above challenges. Simply applying SSMs results in jittery outputs. To refine the outputs, a two-stage modeling approach is proposed:

1) Discrete gesture space modeling using VQVAE: Multiple VQVAEs are used to learn discrete codebooks tailored for different body parts like face, upper body etc. This captures subtle motion variations across body parts. Quantization enhances quality by mitigating jitter.

2) Speech conditioned selective SSM: Multiple Mamba SSM blocks, each informed by distinct VQVAE priors, are used. The blocks dynamically interact, iteratively refining latent representations of different body parts. This enhances quality and diversity. Features from speech are fused using CNN and FastText encoders.

The selective scan mechanism efficiently focuses on salient parts of long sequences. The overall approach achieves high quality gesture generation with low latency.

Contributions:
1) First exploration of selective SSM for gesture synthesis
2) Two-stage approach with VQVAE priors to refine SSM outputs 
3) Multiple Mamba blocks for different body parts to enhance quality and diversity
4) Efficient low latency generation of long holistic gesture sequences

The method is evaluated on the BEATX dataset. Both quantitative metrics and user studies demonstrate the method's ability to generate high quality, diverse and well synchronized gestures, outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches while being efficient to train.
