# [Refine and Imitate: Reducing Repetition and Inconsistency in Persuasion   Dialogues via Reinforcement Learning and Human Demonstration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15375)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we improve persuasion dialogue systems to generate more diverse, consistent, and persuasive responses, while reducing repetition and inconsistency problems?The authors propose an approach involving two main components:1) Using reinforcement learning without user simulators (DialGAIL) to refine a language model by learning from its own mistakes and generating multiple candidates. This allows the model to reduce repetition and inconsistency at the sentence level.2) Imitating human persuasion demonstrations to select the most persuasive response from the candidates. This helps accomplish the persuasion task by quantifying intellectual persuasion activities. The overall goal is to develop a persuasion dialogue system that can carry out smooth and coherent conversations while successfully persuading people, as measured by metrics like donation amount and probability. The research hypothesizes that combining reinforcement learning without user simulators and imitation learning from human demonstrations can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a complex donation persuasion task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new reinforcement learning (RL) based framework called PersRFI to improve dialogue response generation for persuasion dialogues. The key components are:- DialGAIL: An extension of generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) to refine a baseline language model by generating multiple response candidates and providing rewards/penalties based on whether they are repetitive, inconsistent etc. This allows improving the model without needing a user simulator.- Response Filter: Using repetition and inconsistency detectors to filter out bad response candidates. - Response Imitator: Imitating human demonstration of persuasive responses to select the best response from remaining candidates.2. The PersRFI framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on a donation persuasion task compared to previous approaches like MISSA and ARDM. It generates more diverse, consistent and persuasive responses according to both automatic metrics and human evaluations.3. The introduction of a new human persuasion demonstration dataset that can facilitate research in this area. 4. The framework is generalizable beyond just repetition/inconsistency reduction and could be applied to other dialogue tasks as well.5. The work highlights the importance of strategic persuasion dialogues at the intersection of task-oriented and open-domain systems. It helps advance research in an underexplored but useful area of conversational AI.In summary, the main contribution is a novel RL-based framework to improve the quality and persuasiveness of dialogue responses by refining language models and imitating human demonstrations, leading to state-of-the-art results on a persuasion task. The work has broader impact in advancing strategic dialogue research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper proposes a reinforcement learning and human demonstration based approach to reduce repetition and inconsistency and generate more persuasive responses in dialogue systems for a donation persuasion task.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:- The paper presents a novel framework (PersRFI) for improving persuasion dialog systems using reinforcement learning and human demonstrations. This appears to be the first work applying these techniques in combination for persuasion dialogues specifically.- Most prior work on persuasion dialog systems has focused on rule-based or retrieval-based methods. Using large pretrained language models and refining them with RL and imitation learning is a newer approach that leverages recent advances in NLG. - The paper introduces a new human persuasion demonstration dataset. While some prior work has used human feedback or demonstrations, collecting richer demonstration data specifically for persuasion seems novel. This could enable more imitation learning research.- Evaluating on a complex persuasion task (donation dialogues) is more difficult than simpler chit-chat or QA tasks. The improved persuasion outcomes demonstrate these methods can work for strategic dialogue goals.- The incorporation of both task-specific elements (persuasion strategies and profiles) and general conversational aspects (repetition, consistency) is notable. This combines the challenges of task-oriented and open-domain dialog.- Compared to some benchmark RL dialogue papers, this work does not use an explicit user simulator. Removing this requirement extends applicability and reduces engineering effort.- Overall, the paper moves forward persuasion and strategic dialog research by adapting modern NLG techniques in an innovative way tailored for this space. The results demonstrate improved training processes and outcomes compared to prior approaches on a difficult task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing methods to further automate the process of extracting high-frequency questions for the profile ontology in the inconsistency detection module. The authors suggest applying dialogue reading comprehension models for this.- Improving the performance of the inconsistency detector module, such as by exploring domain adaptation methods.- Collecting more human demonstration data and using algorithms like DAgger to improve the response imitator's ability to select persuasive responses.- Exploring personalized persuasion to tailor persuasive messages based on individual user's personalities and preferences. The authors note differences in how users respond to various persuasive strategies. - Applying the DialGAIL framework to improve other sentence-level qualities beyond just reducing repetition and inconsistency, by plugging in other customized detectors.- Generalizing the overall PersRFI framework to other complex dialogue tasks beyond just persuasion, to address issues like repetition, inconsistency, and nonspecificity.- Further analysis on differences between pure task-oriented vs. mixed task/social dialogues like persuasion, to inform future research on strategic dialogues.In summary, the main directions are improving the automation and performance of the system's components, collecting more data to enhance the imitation learning, personalizing the persuasion strategies, and generalizing the framework to other tasks and qualities. The authors aim to inspire more work on strategic dialogues that involve both social and task elements.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework called PersRFI to reduce repetition and inconsistency in persuasive dialogue systems. PersRFI has two main components: 1) DialGAIL, an RL algorithm that refines a baseline language model by generating multiple candidate responses and providing rewards/penalties based on whether they are repetitive, inconsistent, or persuasive. This allows the model to learn from its own mistakes without needing a user simulator. 2) A response imitator module that is trained on a small amount of human demonstration data to select the most persuasive response from the candidate set. Experiments on a donation persuasion task show that PersRFI outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. It generates more diverse, consistent, and persuasive conversations according to user feedback, resulting in higher donation amounts. The key contributions are using RL to refine language models without needing user simulators, and showing that even small amounts of human demonstration data can significantly improve persuasion and task success.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) and human demonstration based framework called PersRFI to generate persuasive dialogues while reducing repetition and inconsistency. The framework has two main components - using RL to refine a baseline conversational model to reduce repetition and inconsistency at the sentence level, and leveraging human demonstrations to teach the model to select persuasive responses. Specifically, the RL module called DialGAIL generates multiple candidate responses for a given context and provides rewards to good candidates and penalties to repetitive/inconsistent ones to refine the model without needing a user simulator. The human demonstration module collects a small set of examples from experts selecting persuasive responses and trains a classifier to imitate that selection. Experiments on a donation persuasion task show the framework generates more diverse, consistent and persuasive responses compared to baselines, leading to better persuasion outcomes like higher donations. The human evaluations also rate the model's responses higher on metrics like non-repetition, consistency and persuasiveness. The overall framework presents a way to improve strategic conversational agents using RL and human feedback.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework called PersRFI to generate more diverse, consistent, and persuasive responses in persuasion dialogues. The framework has two main steps: 1) It uses a novel RL algorithm called DialGAIL to refine an initial conversational model by having it generate multiple candidate responses to each context and then giving feedback on which responses are good or bad. This allows it to reduce repetition and contradiction without needing a user simulator. 2) It then selects the most persuasive response from the candidates using a classifier trained on human demonstrations of persuasive dialogues. So it refines the base conversational model using RL to reduce bad candidates, and imitates human behavior to choose good candidates. The refined model is shown to produce better responses and have better persuasion outcomes compared to baseline models.
