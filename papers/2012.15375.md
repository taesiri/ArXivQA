# Refine and Imitate: Reducing Repetition and Inconsistency in Persuasion   Dialogues via Reinforcement Learning and Human Demonstration

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we improve persuasion dialogue systems to generate more diverse, consistent, and persuasive responses, while reducing repetition and inconsistency problems?The authors propose an approach involving two main components:1) Using reinforcement learning without user simulators (DialGAIL) to refine a language model by learning from its own mistakes and generating multiple candidates. This allows the model to reduce repetition and inconsistency at the sentence level.2) Imitating human persuasion demonstrations to select the most persuasive response from the candidates. This helps accomplish the persuasion task by quantifying intellectual persuasion activities. The overall goal is to develop a persuasion dialogue system that can carry out smooth and coherent conversations while successfully persuading people, as measured by metrics like donation amount and probability. The research hypothesizes that combining reinforcement learning without user simulators and imitation learning from human demonstrations can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a complex donation persuasion task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new reinforcement learning (RL) based framework called PersRFI to improve dialogue response generation for persuasion dialogues. The key components are:- DialGAIL: An extension of generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) to refine a baseline language model by generating multiple response candidates and providing rewards/penalties based on whether they are repetitive, inconsistent etc. This allows improving the model without needing a user simulator.- Response Filter: Using repetition and inconsistency detectors to filter out bad response candidates. - Response Imitator: Imitating human demonstration of persuasive responses to select the best response from remaining candidates.2. The PersRFI framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on a donation persuasion task compared to previous approaches like MISSA and ARDM. It generates more diverse, consistent and persuasive responses according to both automatic metrics and human evaluations.3. The introduction of a new human persuasion demonstration dataset that can facilitate research in this area. 4. The framework is generalizable beyond just repetition/inconsistency reduction and could be applied to other dialogue tasks as well.5. The work highlights the importance of strategic persuasion dialogues at the intersection of task-oriented and open-domain systems. It helps advance research in an underexplored but useful area of conversational AI.In summary, the main contribution is a novel RL-based framework to improve the quality and persuasiveness of dialogue responses by refining language models and imitating human demonstrations, leading to state-of-the-art results on a persuasion task. The work has broader impact in advancing strategic dialogue research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper proposes a reinforcement learning and human demonstration based approach to reduce repetition and inconsistency and generate more persuasive responses in dialogue systems for a donation persuasion task.
