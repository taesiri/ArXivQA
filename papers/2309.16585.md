# [Text-to-3D using Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16585)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we generate realistic and detailed 3D models from text prompts using Gaussian splatting as the 3D scene representation?The key hypothesis appears to be:By representing 3D scenes with Gaussian splatting and incorporating explicit 3D priors like point clouds, we can generate text-to-3D models that have accurate geometry, delicate details, and consistency across views. The authors argue that previous text-to-3D generation methods like those based on NeRF or DMTet struggle with collapsed/inconsistent geometry and lack of fine details due to the absence of direct 3D supervision. They propose using the more explicit and manipulable nature of Gaussian splatting to introduce 3D point cloud guidance, leading to improved geometry. The two-stage optimization strategy further allows generating detailed appearance while preserving the global structure. Experiments validate the approach's ability to create high-quality 3D assets.In summary, the central research question relates to improving text-to-3D generation through the novel application of Gaussian splatting along with 3D priors, in order to address limitations like geometric inconsistency and limited details in prior state-of-the-art. The key hypothesis is that the explicit and supervisable nature of Gaussian splatting can facilitate introducing 3D guidance to enhance geometry, while the two-stage optimization can balance global structure and local details.
