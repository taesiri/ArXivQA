## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper deals with the challenge of ensuring feasibility (existence of a solution) at all times for a quadratic program (QP) controller subject to multiple control barrier function (CBF) constraints. CBFs are used to encode state constraints such as obstacle avoidance, but simply imposing multiple CBF constraints simultaneously in a QP does not guarantee feasibility. The paper terms this persistent feasibility and aims to design controllers that maintain it.  

Proposed Solution:
The key idea is to quantify the feasible solution space of the CBF-QP in terms of its volume. The paper introduces a novel feasible-space CBF (FS-CBF) that restricts the rate-of-change of the volume of the feasible polytopic space. It shows that the existence of an FS-CBF is necessary and sufficient to ensure compatibility of multiple CBFs and hence persistent feasibility.  

For a QP with multiple CBF constraints, the paper visualizes the feasible space as a convex polytope. It discusses methods to compute and approximate the volume of this polytope, which is then used to construct the FS-CBF condition. A FS-CBF based QP controller is presented that maps the nominal control input to the interior of the feasible space instead of its boundary to prevent infeasibility.

Contributions:
1. Introduced the notion of persistent feasibility for CBF-QP formulations and provided a formal problem statement.

2. Proposed the novel idea of a feasible-space CBF (FS-CBF) that restricts the rate-of-change of volume of the feasible solution space of a QP with multiple CBF constraints.

3. Demonstrated through simulations that the FS-CBF approach enhances persistence of feasibility and reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters compared to simply imposing multiple CBF constraints.

4. Evaluated the FS-CBF controller in a large scale simulation of a hospital environment with humans using ROS 2 stack, where it achieved improved feasibility over standard CBF-QP.

In summary, the paper makes a novel contribution in CBF based control design by considering the geometry of the feasible space and using its volume as a barrier function. The results showcase improved safety and robustness properties.
