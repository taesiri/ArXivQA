# [NYC-Indoor-VPR: A Long-Term Indoor Visual Place Recognition Dataset with   Semi-Automatic Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00504)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Visual place recognition (VPR) in indoor environments is challenging but useful for localization and navigation. Issues arise due to perceptual aliasing (different places appearing similar), obstructed views from walls and objects, and difficulty in obtaining ground truth trajectories for training and evaluation.

- Existing datasets use additional sensors, which increases cost. Other image-only methods like structure-from-motion (SfM) fail to accurately reconstruct indoor scenes. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) can map trajectories but not match them across time. 

- There is a need for methods that can efficiently and accurately annotate indoor image locations to generate ground truth for VPR benchmarking.

Solution:
- The paper introduces the NYC-Indoor-VPR dataset, comprising over 36,000 images from 13 distinct crowded indoor scenes in NYC captured over a year under varying conditions. Identities are anonymized.

- A semi-automatic annotation method is proposed to establish ground truth locations. It takes pairs of videos capturing the same route at different times as input. Visual SLAM identifies keyframes and topometric locations. Turning points are detected automatically and matched manually. Trajectories are matched and frame pairs extracted along with estimated relative locations. Humans verify matching accuracy.  

Contributions:
- Introduction of a unique long-term indoor VPR benchmark dataset with images of crowded scenes captured under appearance changes over a year. Images are anonymized.

- A semi-automatic annotation method to efficiently and accurately match trajectories and generate images with ground truth topometric locations for indoor VPR evaluation.

- Benchmark experiments evaluating several state-of-the-art VPR algorithms on the dataset, showing the challenge it presents.

In summary, the paper introduces a new challenging indoor VPR dataset with an efficient annotation approach and benchmark experiments that highlight the value of the dataset to push VPR research forward.
