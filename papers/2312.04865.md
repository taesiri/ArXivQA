# [StructComp: Substituting propagation with Structural Compression in   Training Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04865)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Structural Compression (StructComp), a simple yet effective training framework to improve the scalability of graph contrastive learning (GCL). Motivated by a sparse low-rank approximation of the diffusion matrix, StructComp substitutes propagation with structural compression during training. Specifically, it compresses the nodes into mixed nodes based on graph partitioning, and trains a MLP encoder on these mixed nodes, transferring the parameters to a GNN encoder later for inference. This allows avoiding message passing during training, and significantly reduces the number of sample pairs needed for contrastive learning. Theoretically, the authors prove the compressed contrastive loss can approximate the original GCL loss, and StructComp introduces an extra regularization. Empirically, StructComp improves performance of GCL models on seven benchmarks, while greatly reducing time and memory consumption compared to full graph training and other scalable methods. Key advantages are: 1) first unified framework for scalable GCL training, 2) high quality sampling by node compression, 3) implicit regularization. Overall, StructComp advances the scalability of graph contrastive learning with negligible performance sacrifice.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel GCL training framework called Structural Compression (StructComp). This framework significantly improves the scalability of GCLs by substituting message-passing with node compression during training.

2. Customizing a data augmentation method called DropMember specifically for StructComp, making it adaptive to both single-view and multi-view GCL models. To the best of the authors' knowledge, StructComp is the first unified framework designed specifically for scalable GCL training. 

3. Theoretically guaranteeing that the compressed contrastive loss can approximate the original GCL loss under an Erdős–Rényi graph assumption. Also proving that StructComp introduces an extra regularization term into scalable GCL training, resulting in a more robust encoder.

4. Empirically demonstrating that StructComp improves GCL models' performance and significantly reduces memory consumption and training time compared to full graph training and other scalable training methods. Experiments on seven datasets validate the effectiveness of StructComp.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the StructComp framework to improve the scalability of graph contrastive learning methods by substituting propagation with structural compression. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations are provided to demonstrate its effectiveness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Graph contrastive learning (GCL): The paper focuses on making GCL models more scalable and efficient to train, while maintaining or improving performance.

- Structural compression (StructComp): This is the name of the proposed training framework to improve scalability of GCL models. It works by compressing the nodes and substituting propagation with this compression.

- Scalability: A major focus of the paper is improving the scalability of GCL models to handle large graphs. This involves reducing time and memory consumption.

- Low-rank approximation: The StructComp framework is motivated by a sparse, low-rank approximation of the graph diffusion matrix. This allows simplification of computations.

- Contrastive loss: The core of GCL relies on contrastive losses that aim to bring positive sample pairs closer in the embedding space while pushing negative pairs further apart. 

- Message passing: GCL models typically rely on message passing or propagation steps. StructComp removes the need for message passing during training.

- Data augmentation: The paper introduces a "DropMember" data augmentation method tailored for StructComp to enable application to multi-view GCL.

So in summary, the key things this paper focuses on are scalability, structural compression, low-rank approximations, and contrastive learning on graphs.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has shown promising performance for unsupervised representation learning on graphs. However, scaling GCL to large graphs remains challenging due to two main issues: 1) The computation complexity grows exponentially with graph size due to message passing in GNN encoders. 2) GCL typically requires computation over a quadratic number of node pairs for contrastive learning, incurring substantial computational costs. Existing methods for scalable supervised GNN training are not readily applicable to GCL models.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Structural Compression (StructComp), an extremely simple yet effective training framework to improve the scalability of GCL models. The key idea is to substitute message passing with a structural compression of nodes during training. Specifically:

1) A graph partition matrix is computed to group nodes into clusters. Node features within each cluster are aggregated to obtain "mixed node" features. 

2) An MLP encoder is trained on the mixed node features using contrastive loss. This avoids message passing and significantly reduces number of node pairs.

3) After training, parameters are transferred to a GNN encoder which is used with the original graph for inference.

Theoretical Analysis:
The paper provides theoretical justifications for StructComp:

1) The contrastive loss on compressed nodes can approximate the original GCL loss, up to an error related to the quality of graph partitioning. 

2) StructComp introduces an additional regularization effect for robustness against perturbations.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes StructComp, a simple and unified training framework to improve scalability for both single-view and multi-view GCL models, without need for specialized sampling methods.

- Provides theoretical analysis to show compressed loss can approximate original loss, and StructComp has an implicit regularization effect.

- Achieves superior efficiency and performance compared to full-graph training and other sampling-based methods for GCL on 7 datasets. Reduces memory usage by up to 57x and training time by up to 21x.

The paper makes significant contributions towards scalable training of GCL models to handle large graph data. StructComp offers a simple yet effective solution by substituting propagation with structural compression during training.
