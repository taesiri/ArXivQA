# [SatSynth: Augmenting Image-Mask Pairs through Diffusion Models for   Aerial Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16605)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is important for applications like disaster response and monitoring climate change. However, obtaining dense pixel-level annotations is costly and difficult.
- Conventional data augmentation techniques are often insufficient to capture the immense diversity of satellite scenes across locations, seasons, resolution etc.

Proposed Solution: 
- Learn the joint distribution $p(x,y)$ of satellite images $x$ and segmentation masks $y$ using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM).
- Generate additional novel training pairs $(x',y') \sim p(x,y)$ to augment existing training data.
- Transform discrete labels $y$ to bit space representation that is more stable for joint modeling.
- Employ super-resolution DDPM to upsample generated low-res pairs to 256x256.

Main Contributions:
- First approach to generate both satellite images and segmentation masks using diffusion models to augment training data.
- Demonstrate significant boost in downstream segmentation accuracy by training on real + synthetic pairs. 
- Establish connections between generative modeling and discriminative segmentation.
- Analyze impact of number of synthetic samples and handle class imbalance.
- Compare to GAN alternatives and show higher sample quality and better segmentation performance.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel strategy to synthesize additional training data for satellite image segmentation by learning the joint distribution with a diffusion model. Adding such diverse yet realistic samples is shown to consistently improve performance of standard segmentation models.
