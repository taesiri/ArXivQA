# [Day-ahead regional solar power forecasting with hierarchical temporal   convolutional neural networks using historical power generation and weather   data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01653)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurate forecasts of solar power generation from distributed rooftop PV systems across an entire region are becoming important for grid and market operators to ensure electricity system reliability. However, forecasting the total solar output of a region is challenging as it depends on the generation from hundreds or thousands of PV systems across diverse locations experiencing different weather conditions. Existing methods either use just the aggregated regional solar generation data, disregarding location-specific factors, or require forecasting each individual PV system separately and aggregating, which requires many models.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two deep neural network architectures called Hierarchical Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (HTCNNs) to forecast regional solar generation. HTCNNs jointly model the aggregated regional generation time series along with time series data from individual PV systems and associated weather data from multiple locations. This allows capturing features across all data in a single model. Two network architectures HTCNN A1 and A2 are introduced. Further, two strategies are proposed on how to apply HTCNNs for regional forecasting: (1) Directly forecasting the entire region using one HTCNN, (2) Dividing the region into sub-regions based on weather data similarities and training separate HTCNNs to forecast each sub-region.

Main Contributions:
- Two neural network architectures HTCNN A1 and HTCNN A2 to model aggregated and individual time series with weather data
- Two strategies to apply HTCNNs for regional solar forecasting
- Evaluated on a large solar PV dataset from 101 locations in Western Australia
- HTCNN A2 with sub-region strategy achieves the best performance, reducing forecast error by 6.5% and increasing skill score by 40.2% compared to the best baseline.
- Requires fewer models than existing approaches while effectively leveraging available data.

In summary, the paper introduces innovative deep learning models and strategies to significantly improve regional solar forecast accuracy while overcoming limitations of existing approaches. The hierarchical modeling of data is a key contribution for solar forecasting applications.
