# [Neither hype nor gloom do DNNs justice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05355)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points made in the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper responds to Bowers et al.'s target article which expresses a gloomy view on deep neural networks (DNNs) as models in vision science. 
- Bowers et al. point out limitations of DNNs at several "psychological tasks" related to human vision.
- Bowers et al. also critique some exaggerated claims that portray DNNs as "best models" for vision, which may border on hype.

Proposed Solution/Viewpoint:  
- The authors agree that some claims about DNNs are exaggerated hype but argue this is the fault of those making such claims, not an inherent flaw with DNNs. 
- They counter Bowers et al.'s gloomy view, stating that DNNs' limitations reflect a snapshot in time rather than fundamental issues. Many previous DNN limitations have already been overcome.
- They argue both explanation and prediction (e.g. image-computability) are needed for good models. Bowers et al. overemphasize explanation over predictive ability.  
- Future research should carefully explore similarities and differences between human vision and evolving DNNs instead of hype or gloom.

Main Contributions:
- Identification of issues with hype about DNN performance as well as counterarguments to the gloomy view expressed by Bowers et al.  
- Balanced perspective that DNNs have limitations but these reflect a snapshot in time rather than fundamental flaws, evidenced by rapid improvements addressing past limitations.
- Argument for importance of both explainability and predictability for good models of human vision.
- Call for more research on DNNs inspired by vision science and careful comparison to human vision, avoiding hype and gloom.

In summary, the authors provide a measured perspective highlighting that DNNs are an evolving technology that shows promise as models of human vision if guided by vision science, avoiding hype but also undue gloom about their current limitations. The key is to leverage their strengths while working to address weaknesses through continued research.
