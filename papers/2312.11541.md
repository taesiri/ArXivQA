# [CLIPSyntel: CLIP and LLM Synergy for Multimodal Question Summarization   in Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11541)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing medical question summarization (MQS) research has focused solely on text, neglecting integration of visual information like images of symptoms. 
- Visual cues can provide critical additional context to understand patient queries more accurately and generate better medical summaries.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces new Multimodal Medical Question Summarization (MMQS) dataset pairing textual medical questions with images of symptoms.
- Proposes CLIPSyntel framework with 4 modules harnessing Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) and Large Language Models (LLMs):
   1) Identify medical disorders from images using CLIP
   2) Generate relevant medial context using LLM 
   3) Filter context to distill key medical concepts
   4) Craft final summary incorporating visual details using LLM

Key Contributions:
- Novel MMQS dataset advancing multimodal medical question summarization research 
- New evaluation metric, Multimodal Fact Capturing Metric (MMFCM), to quantify integration of visual information
- CLIPSyntel framework synergizing CLIP and LLMs to enrich summaries with visual cues
- Showcases value of fusing textual and visual data for more accurate, responsive medical question summarization

The paper argues effectively integrating images of symptoms in medical question summarization via the MMQS dataset and CLIPSyntel framework can lead to better decision making and patient care. The multimodal approach accounts for limitations in patients' medical knowledge and ability to describe symptoms purely through text.
