# [Towards Robust Car Following Dynamics Modeling via Blackbox Models:   Methodology, Analysis, and Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07139)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Classical car-following (CF) models like IDM, GIPPS, etc. need to select a target variable (e.g. acceleration, velocity, headway) to optimize their parameters. However, there is limited research on optimal target variable selection for black-box CF models like LSTM, Gaussian Processes, etc.

- The choice of target variable impacts model performance, but the effects may differ across model types due to differences in objective functions and vector spaces (e.g. parameter space vs function space).

Proposed Solution  
- Evaluate CF model performance using 3 black-box models (Gaussian Processes, Kernel Ridge, LSTM) and 3 target variables (acceleration, velocity, headway) on 3 datasets with both automated and human-driven vehicles.

- Compare recommendations for black-box models versus classical CF models to analyze the impact of objective function and vector space on optimal target variable.

- Use ANOVA to evaluate the robustness of recommendations across diverse datasets.

Key Findings
- Optimal target variables differ for black-box vs classical models. Classical & LSTM prefer velocity or headway due to SSE objective function and parameter space, while Gaussian Processes & Kernel Ridge prefer acceleration or velocity due to working in function space.

- Recommendations are robust across datasets as indicated by ANOVA results showing no interaction between dataset and target variable.

- LSTM performs the best overall. Gaussian Processes act more as a filter and struggle with multi-step prediction.

Main Contributions  
- First study to systematically evaluate target variable selection for black-box CF models and compare to classical models.

- Demonstration that choice of target variable depends on model type, objective function and vector space.

- Robust recommendations for selecting optimal target variables for different CF model types, irrespective of dataset.
