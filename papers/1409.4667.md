# [Computable Stochastic Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4667)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, this paper aims to present an elementary computable theory of probability, random variables and stochastic processes. The key goals appear to be:- Develop a theory of probability distributions based on valuations and lower integrals that has an explicit link to Turing computation and clean mathematical formulation.- Discuss different approaches to modeling random variables, focusing on representing them as limits of continuous partial functions. - Apply the theory to study discrete-time stochastic processes and establish computability results.- Give an exposition of the Wiener process as a foundation for stochastic differential equations, and show solutions can be effectively computed.So in summary, the central research goal seems to be establishing a rigorous framework for computable probability and stochastic processes, with a focus on making concepts like random variables, expectations, stochastic differential equations, etc. amenable to computation. The key hypothesis is that using topological constructions like valuations and completion of continuous functions will yield a theory with good computability properties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:- Developing a computable theory of probability, random variables and stochastic processes using type-two effectivity and computable types. This provides a computational foundation for analyzing discrete-time continuous-state Markov chains and stochastic differential equations.- Defining computable types for probability distributions (valuations), measurable functions, and random variables. Random variables are defined as limits of Cauchy sequences of continuous partial functions. This allows computing probabilities and expectations.- Showing key operations like products, conditioning, and expectations of random variables are computable. Also convergence results like the dominated convergence theorem are made effective.- Applying the theory to derive computability results for discrete-time stochastic processes. The distribution of states can be computed recursively.- Providing a new construction of the Wiener process with computable sample paths. This is used to show solutions of stochastic differential equations can be effectively computed.So in summary, the paper develops a clean mathematical framework for computable probability and stochastics, with concrete applications to analyzing stochastic processes and stochastic differential equations algorithmically. The key seems to be using topological constructions that can be effectively computed, instead of more general measurable structures.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper on computable stochastic processes compares to other related research:- The focus on developing a computable theory of probability, random variables, and stochastic processes based on type-two effectivity provides a nice foundation for rigorous numerical analysis of stochastic systems. Other work in this area has used domain theory or constructive mathematics as the computability framework.- Defining random variables as limits of Cauchy sequences of continuous partial functions is an elegant approach that seems well-suited for the aims of the paper. This is similar to some other constructive theories like Spitters' integration theory, but contrasts with classical measurable function representations.- The paper gives clean and intuitive computable versions of basic results like computability of distributions, products, conditioning, and expectations. This aligns well with other computable probability research trying to effectivize classical concepts.- The application to discrete-time and continuous-time stochastic processes builds nicely on the computable probability foundations. Constructing an effective Wiener process and proving computability of stochastic differential equations are nice results. Other work has considered Markov processes and stochastic relations, but this seems a simpler and more direct treatment. - Overall, the paper develops an elementary but powerful computable theory of stochastic processes anchored in core concepts like random variables and integration. The type-theoretic framework provides computational meaning while still enabling classical mathematical arguments. The results on stochastic processes demonstrate the applicability of the theory.
