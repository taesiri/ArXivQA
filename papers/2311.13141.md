# [Diffusion360: Seamless 360 Degree Panoramic Image Generation based on   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13141)

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Diffusion360 for generating high-quality, seamless 360-degree panoramic images using diffusion models. The key innovation is a circular blending strategy that smooths the transition between the left and right edges of the panorama during the denoising and decoding steps to maintain geometric continuity. The authors present approaches for two tasks - text-to-360-panorama, which generates panoramas from text prompts, and single-image-to-360-panorama, which expands a standard 2D image into a surround view. Their method outperforms prior work in creating artifacts-free and high-resolution 360 panoramas. The code and models have been open-sourced.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called Circular Blending to generate seamless and high-quality 360-degree panoramic images using diffusion models. Unlike previous works like MVDiffusion, StitchDiffusion, and PanoDiff, this method performs blending between the left and right edges of the image during the denoising and decoding stages to maintain geometric continuity. Two models are presented: Text-to-360-Panoramas, which generates panoramas from text prompts in a multi-stage framework involving super-resolution; and Single-Image-to-360-Panoramas, which converts a single perspective image to a 360-degree panorama using a ControlNet-Outpainting model. A key advantage is that existing diffusion models like DreamBooth can be readily adapted to this task without modification. Results demonstrate high visual quality 360-degree panoramas with smooth transitions between edges. Limitations include inability to change styles using external models. Overall, this paper makes notable contributions in enabling diffusion models to produce seamless 360 imagery through a simple but effective circular blending technique.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How to generate high-quality, seamless 360-degree panoramic images using diffusion models?

Specifically, the key challenges outlined are:

1) Unlike regular 2D images, 360-degree panoramic images require geometric continuity between the leftmost and rightmost sides of the image. 

2) Existing diffusion models and training methods are not designed to handle such circular image geometry.

To address this, the main proposal is a "circular blending" strategy that blends the left and right edges of images during the denoising and decoding steps. This is intended to improve the continuity of generated 360-degree panoramas.

The paper then presents models for two tasks:

1) Text-to-360-panoramas: Generating 360-degree panoramas from text prompts.

2) Single-image-to-360-panoramas: Expanding a regular 2D image to a 360-degree panorama.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed circular blending strategy can enable diffusion models to effectively generate seamless, high-quality 360-degree panoramic images. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the presented models and results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1) Proposing a circular blending strategy to generate seamless 360-degree panoramic images using diffusion models. This involves blending the right and left parts of the image/features with adaptive weights during the denoising and VAE decoding stages.

2) Presenting two models for text-to-360-panoramas and single-image-to-360-panoramas generation tasks using the proposed circular blending technique.

3) Releasing code for the text-to-360-panoramas model as an open-source project. The technique allows finetuning a DreamBooth model using the standard diffusion pipeline and applying circular blending at inference time to generate 360-degree outputs.

4) Showing results that demonstrate the ability to generate high-resolution, seamless 360-degree panoramas for the two tasks using a multi-stage framework involving super-resolution. The panoramas exhibit smooth transitions between the left and right sides.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the circular blending strategy to enable diffusion models to generate seamless and high-quality 360-degree panoramic images.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The circular blending strategy is a key contribution of this paper. Can you provide more details on how the adaptive weights are calculated during blending? What criteria or constraints guide this weighting?

2. You mention the circular blending in the VAE decoder is more important than in the denoising stage. What specifically makes the decoder blending more critical? How much performance gain does the decoder blending provide over just having denoising stage blending?

3. For the text-to-360 task, what criteria determine when to use diffusion super-resolution versus GAN super-resolution in the pipeline? What are the tradeoffs between these two approaches? 

4. What modifications were made to the DreamBooth training procedure or architecture to enable 360 image generation? Were any changes made beyond just incorporating the blending strategy?

5. How does the proposed approach compare in quality and artifacts versus previous state-of-the-art methods like PanoDiff? What specific metrics could be used for this comparison?

6. For the single image to 360 task, how are occluded regions filled in a realistic way when outpainting beyond the visible perspective view? Does this rely more on dataset priors or is there an explicit completion strategy?

7. What failure cases or artifacts can occur with this approach? When does it still struggle to produce seamless, high-quality panoramas? 

8. How does training time and sample efficiency compare to previous diffusion panorama generation methods? Does the blending strategy introduce any training overhead?

9. Could this approach be extended to video panoramas? Would any modifications be needed to maintain temporal consistency across frames?

10. Have the authors considered any applications of this work beyond creative generation, such as for augmented or virtual reality? Could it enable more immersive experiences?


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 According to the paper, it compares its approach to other related diffusion-based 360-degree panorama generation methods like MVDiffusion, StitchDiffusion, and PanoDiff in the following ways:

1) MVDiffusion requires 8 perspective view images as input to generate the 360 panorama, whereas this method does not. The panoramas from MVDiffusion also have artifacts in the sky and floor regions.

2) StitchDiffusion uses global cropping to maintain continuity, but still has cracks at the junctions when zoomed in. This method uses circular blending for better continuity.

3) PanoDiff uses a similar circular padding scheme, but differs in using an adaptive weighting policy for better geometric continuity, not needing a Rotating Schedule, and being able to apply the technique to ControlNet-Tile for high resolution outputs.

In summary, the key differentiation of this method seems to be the adaptive circular blending strategy, which helps achieve better geometric continuity and seamlessness in the generated 360 panoramas compared to prior arts, while also being simpler by not needing specialized schedules or inputs. The ability to combine it with ControlNet-Tile is also presented as an advantage for high resolution outputs.
