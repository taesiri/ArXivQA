# [Are Large Language Models Table-based Fact-Checkers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02549)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Table-based Fact Verification (TFV) aims to identify whether a statement is supported or refuted by a structured table. Existing methods for TFV rely on large amounts of labeled training data and have weak zero-shot ability. The potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for TFV is still unknown. Thus, the paper explores the following research question - "Are large language models table-based fact-checkers?".

Proposed Solution:
The paper conducts comprehensive experiments to evaluate the capability of LLMs for TFV under zero-shot, few-shot and instruction tuning settings:

1) Zero-shot learning: Prompt engineering to evaluate inherent TFV capability of LLMs. Various prompts like sentences, paragraphs and dialogs are designed. 

2) Few-shot learning: In-context examples added to prompts to assess how LLMs' in-context learning promotes TFV performance.

3) Instruction tuning: TFV instructions constructed to fine-tune LLMs and induce their full potential for TFV. 

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrates acceptable zero-shot and few-shot TFV capability of LLMs with careful prompt engineering, while instruction tuning significantly stimulates the performance.

- Makes valuable findings regarding format of zero-shot prompts, optimal number of examples for few-shot learning.

- Analyzes limitations of current methods and suggests promising directions to further enhance LLMs' accuracy on TFV via handling long inputs, specifying inference procedures and developing table-specific LLMs.

In summary, the paper shows LLMs can be qualified table-based fact checkers, and provides insights on how to further improve their capability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores using large language models for table-based fact verification through prompt engineering and instruction tuning, finding that models like ChatGPT can perform decently with careful prompting while larger gains require instruction tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It conducts the first comprehensive study on using large language models (LLMs) directly as table-based fact checkers under three settings: zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, and instruction tuning. 

2. It shows that LLMs like ChatGPT can achieve acceptable performance on table-based fact verification (TFV) through prompt engineering under zero-shot and few-shot settings. However, larger LLMs like LLaMA still perform poorly without instruction tuning. 

3. It demonstrates that instruction tuning can significantly improve LLaMA's performance on TFV, though finetuned LLaMA still lags behind state-of-the-art small task-specific models.  

4. It discusses several valuable findings about prompt formats, number of examples, and makes analysis on failure cases. It also points out three promising research directions to further enhance LLMs' capability on TFV.

In summary, this paper conducts the first comprehensive empirical study on directly leveraging LLMs for table-based fact verification, and provides guidance for future research in this direction.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) for table-based fact verification. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of using LLMs compared to traditional small models for this task?

2. The paper studies LLMs under zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction tuning settings. What are the key differences between these settings and why is it valuable to study them separately? 

3. For the zero-shot setting, the paper explores different prompt formats like sentences, paragraphs, and dialogues. Why do you think the dialogue format worked best and how could the prompts be further improved?
