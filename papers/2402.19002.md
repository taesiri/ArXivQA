# [GoalNet: Goal Areas Oriented Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19002)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting pedestrian trajectories is crucial for autonomous vehicles to avoid collisions. However, trajectory prediction is challenging due to the uncertainty in human behavior and decision making.  
- Most prior works use past trajectories alone to predict future trajectories. They do not sufficiently consider scene context and pedestrian goals/targets which affect the trajectories.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes GoalNet, a new neural network to predict pedestrian trajectories by first predicting goal points/areas that represent pedestrian targets. 
- The network extracts scene context features using a ConvNeXt encoder-decoder. It then predicts goal areas represented as a probability distribution over the scene.
- The network feeds back the goal points to predict multiple plausible future trajectories to capture uncertainty.

Key Contributions:
- GoalNet significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art on public datasets - JAAD and PIE. It improves performance by 48.7% on JAAD and 40.8% on PIE.
- The method is based on convolutional neural networks instead of recurrent networks used predominantly for trajectory prediction.
- The network predicts bounding box trajectories along with center point trajectories.
- Detailed experiments validate the impact of different architectural choices and justify the rationale behind GoalNet's design.

In summary, the key idea is to use scene context and goals to limit trajectory uncertainty and predict better future trajectories. The method advances state-of-the-art on public benchmarks significantly.
