# [Agile Catching with Whole-Body MPC and Blackbox Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08205)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:What are the relative merits of model predictive control (MPC) and blackbox policy optimization for high-speed robotic catching, in terms of reaction time, sample efficiency, robustness to distribution shifts, and versatility in generating whole-body multimodal behaviors?The paper compares an MPC approach using constrained trajectory optimization to a blackbox policy learning approach using zeroth-order optimization. The goal is to provide insights into the trade-offs between these two fundamentally different solution strategies for the challenging task of agile robotic catching. The main axes of comparison are:- Reaction time: How fast can each method react and compute control actions?- Sample efficiency: How much real-world data is needed to train each method?- Robustness: How sensitive is each method to shifts in the ball throwing distribution? - Versatility: How well can each method leverage the robot's whole body (base + arm) to enable multimodal catching behaviors?Through extensive experiments in simulation and the real world, the paper aims to understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of model-based optimal control vs learning-based methods for dexterous, dynamic robot control tasks.
