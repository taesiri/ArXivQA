# [PILLOW: Enhancing Efficient Instruction Fine-tuning via Prompt Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05621)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources to fine-tune, making it impractical for small entities/individuals to utilize them. 
- Methods like LoRA enable efficient fine-tuning but may limit model performance.
- Attaining good performance by fine-tuning LoRA is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes PiLLow, a prompting framework to enhance LoRA's performance using the reserved in-context learning (ICL) capacity of LLMs. 
- PiLLow incorporates a matching network trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to select optimal prompts from a user-defined pool to concatenate with the input instruction.
- The RL agent is trained to maximize performance of the LoRA-tuned LLM on the downstream task.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes PiLLow to achieve supervised fine-tuning (SFT) comparable performance using LoRA with limited resources.
- Makes it easy to build task-specific LoRA adapters and matching nets using a shared pre-trained LLM.
- Shows PiLLow is effective in boosting performance of LoRA-tuned LLMs on diverse instruction-following datasets.
- Introduces a new technique combining prompting, matching and RL for low-resource LLM adaptation.

In summary, the paper presents PiLLow, an RL-based prompting framework to enhance LoRA fine-tuning performance by leveraging the ICL capacity of LLMs. PiLLow demonstrates SFT-comparable results on multiple benchmarks with reduced computational requirements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes PiLLow, a novel reinforcement learning-based prompting framework that trains a prompt matching network to select optimal prompts from a user-defined set to enhance the performance of large language models fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation under limited computational resources.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new framework called PiLLow to achieve supervised fine-tuning (SFT) comparable performance by utilizing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and in-context learning with limited resources. 

2. Making PiLLow easy to use and widely applicable because a pre-trained language model can be shared and used to build many LoRA adapters and matching networks for different tasks.

3. Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed PiLLow framework is effective in instruction-finetuning datasets that contain diverse tasks across various domains.

In summary, the key contribution is developing an efficient and effective prompting framework called PiLLow that can enhance the performance of LoRA-fine-tuned large language models by leveraging their in-context learning ability, using only limited computational resources.
