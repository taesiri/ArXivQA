# [PILLOW: Enhancing Efficient Instruction Fine-tuning via Prompt Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05621)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources to fine-tune, making it impractical for small entities/individuals to utilize them. 
- Methods like LoRA enable efficient fine-tuning but may limit model performance.
- Attaining good performance by fine-tuning LoRA is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes PiLLow, a prompting framework to enhance LoRA's performance using the reserved in-context learning (ICL) capacity of LLMs. 
- PiLLow incorporates a matching network trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to select optimal prompts from a user-defined pool to concatenate with the input instruction.
- The RL agent is trained to maximize performance of the LoRA-tuned LLM on the downstream task.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes PiLLow to achieve supervised fine-tuning (SFT) comparable performance using LoRA with limited resources.
- Makes it easy to build task-specific LoRA adapters and matching nets using a shared pre-trained LLM.
- Shows PiLLow is effective in boosting performance of LoRA-tuned LLMs on diverse instruction-following datasets.
- Introduces a new technique combining prompting, matching and RL for low-resource LLM adaptation.

In summary, the paper presents PiLLow, an RL-based prompting framework to enhance LoRA fine-tuning performance by leveraging the ICL capacity of LLMs. PiLLow demonstrates SFT-comparable results on multiple benchmarks with reduced computational requirements.
