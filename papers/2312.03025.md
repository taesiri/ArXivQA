# [Training on Synthetic Data Beats Real Data in Multimodal Relation   Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The paper investigates multimodal relation extraction (MRE), which aims to categorize the relationship between two entities based on a text snippet and an accompanying image. 
- MRE suffers from data scarcity issues, which hinders progress. Using cross-modal generative models to supplement training data is a promising direction.
- The paper studies a novel problem setting called "Multimodal Relation Extraction with a Missing Modality (MREMM)" where only unimodal data (text or image) are available during training. The goal is to train an MRE model by generating the missing modality data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a method called "Mutual Information-aware Multimodal Iterated Relational dAta GEneration (MI2RAGE)" to tackle the MREMM problem.
- It applies chained text-to-image and image-to-text generation to create diverse synthetic multimodal training data. 
- To prevent loss of label information in the synthetic data, separate teacher networks are used to select synthetic samples with high mutual information with the labels.
- The selected synthetic data along with the available real unimodal data are used to train student networks to perform MRE.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of a new challenging problem setting for MRE where only unimodal text or image data are accessible during training.
- A chained cross-modal generation technique to enhance diversity of synthetic training data.
- Use of teacher networks for selecting valuable synthetic samples with high mutual information with labels to prevent semantic drift.  
- State-of-the-art performance on MRE benchmark dataset using models trained on synthetic data, outperforming models trained on real multimodal data.
- Demonstration of consistent benefits of the proposed techniques through ablation studies and extension to a text-based relation extraction dataset.
