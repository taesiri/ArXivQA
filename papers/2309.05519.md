# NExT-GPT: Any-to-Any Multimodal LLM

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is developing an end-to-end multimodal large language model (MM-LLM) that can accept inputs and generate outputs in arbitrary combinations of modalities including text, images, videos, and audio. The central hypothesis is that by connecting an LLM core with multimodal encoders/decoders and applying lightweight alignment techniques, it is possible to build an effective any-to-any MM-LLM system with minimal training. Specifically, the paper proposes:- An architecture consisting of multimodal encoders, an LLM core, and diffusion decoders for various modalities. Only 1% of parameters need to be updated during training.- An LLM-centric alignment to map input features to the LLM's text space. - An instruction-following alignment to connect the LLM's outputs to the diffusion decoders.- A modality-switching instruction tuning (MosIT) method and dataset to enhance cross-modal understanding.The key research question is whether the proposed techniques can enable building an MM-LLM that achieves strong performance in comprehending and generating content flexibly across text, images, video and audio with high sample efficiency. The paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of developing an end-to-end any-to-any multimodal LLM system.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents NExT-GPT, an end-to-end general-purpose any-to-any multimodal large language model (MM-LLM) that can accept inputs and generate outputs in arbitrary combinations of text, images, videos, and audio modalities. The key contributions are:1. NExT-GPT connects an LLM with multimodal adaptors and different diffusion decoders, enabling any-to-any multimodal input and output capabilities. It leverages existing well-trained encoders/decoders to avoid expensive training from scratch.2. Lightweight alignment techniques (LLM-centric alignment and instruction-following alignment) are introduced to align features across modules with minimal overhead (only 1% params updated). This enables efficient end-to-end training.3. A new modality-switching instruction tuning (MosIT) method and manually curated dataset are proposed to empower NExT-GPT with sophisticated cross-modal semantic understanding and content generation abilities.4. Experiments show NExT-GPT achieves strong performance on a range of multimodal tasks. The end-to-end design and lightweight tuning help it outperform pipeline systems and achieve more coherent multimodal generation.5. This work demonstrates the promising possibility of building human-like AI agents capable of universally modeling and converting between modalities. It represents an important step towards more capable multimodal LLMs.In summary, the key innovation is the end-to-end any-to-any MM-LLM design with efficient lightweight tuning techniques to enable complex cross-modal understanding and generation. This showcases the potential for developing more human-like multimodal AI systems.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper presents an end-to-end multimodal language model named NExT-GPT, which can accept inputs and generate outputs in any combination of text, images, audio, and video. This capability for true any-to-any multimodality is novel compared to prior work. Most existing multimodal LLMs can only understand multimodal inputs but not generate multimodal outputs.- The most related prior work is CoDi, which can also handle arbitrary input-output modality combinations in parallel. However, CoDi lacks the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of a large language model. In contrast, NExT-GPT leverages an existing strong text-based LLM (Vicuna) as its core.- Other related works like visual ChatGPT and HuggingGPT employ LLMs with external tools in a discrete pipeline fashion. This can introduce errors and limitations compared to the end-to-end training of NExT-GPT.- A key advantage of NExT-GPT is efficiently training the system by freezing most parameters and only updating the projection layers (1% of params). This allows leveraging powerful pre-trained modules and expanding to new modalities easily.- The proposed modality-switching instruction tuning (MosIT) and associated high-quality dataset is novel, providing the complex cross-modal examples needed to train a capable any-to-any system.- Overall, NExT-GPT pushes forward the state-of-the-art in multimodal LLMs through its end-to-end architecture, efficient training approach, and instruction tuning. The results demonstrate stronger reasoning and generation abilities compared to prior pipeline-based and parallel multimodal systems.In summary, the end-to-end design, efficient training, and instruction tuning of NExT-GPT allows it to advance multimodal LLM capabilities beyond prior works focused solely on multimodal understanding. This represents an important step toward more human-like multimodal AI.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes NExT-GPT, an end-to-end multimodal large language model capable of accepting inputs and generating outputs in arbitrary combinations of text, images, videos, and audio. NExT-GPT consists of three main components: 1) Established encoders to encode inputs in various modalities into language-like representations that are aligned to the LLM via projection layers. 2) An existing pre-trained LLM as the core to process input information and generate textual responses directly, as well as modality signal tokens that serve as instructions for decoding. 3) Conditioned diffusion models to decode the signal tokens and generate content in the instructed modalities. A key advantage of NExT-GPT is efficiently leveraging existing encoders and decoders, with only the small projection layers requiring training. This avoids costly training from scratch. To enable complex cross-modal understanding, the authors introduce modality-switching instruction tuning (MosIT) and manually curate a dataset for tuning NExT-GPT. Experiments demonstrate NExT-GPT's strong performance on various multimodal tasks like text-to-image/video/audio generation, image/video/audio captioning, and text-conditioned content editing. The work showcases the promise of building a more general, human-like multimodal agent capable of universal modality modeling. Limitations include supporting only four modalities currently and generating lower quality content compared to the state of the art diffusion models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents an end-to-end multimodal large language model (MM-LLM) called NExT-GPT that is capable of accepting and generating content in any combination of text, images, videos, and audio modalities. The model has three main components: 1) Established encoders like ImageBind encode inputs in different modalities into language-like representations via projection layers. 2) An existing pre-trained LLM like Vicuna serves as the core for semantic understanding and reasoning over the multimodal inputs. It generates text responses and special "modality signal" tokens indicating what additional modal content to generate. 3) Transformer-based output projection layers route the signal tokens to different pre-trained diffusion model decoders like Stable Diffusion, Zeroscope, and AudioLDM to generate content in the instructed modalities. Only the projection layers are fine-tuned, with encoders/decoders frozen, enabling low-cost training. A modality-switching instruction tuning (MosIT) technique and dataset are introduced to enhance complex cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities.
