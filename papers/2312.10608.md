# [Robust 3D Tracking with Quality-Aware Shape Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10608)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Robust 3D Tracking with Quality-Aware Shape Completion":

Problem:
Existing 3D object trackers struggle to track objects in sparse and incomplete point clouds, which are common due to limited sensor capabilities and self-occlusion. Two main strategies have been used to address this: 1) Learning dense features from sparse points, but this is difficult and uncertain. 2) Aggregating features across frames, but this results in imprecise shape representations.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a voxelized 3D tracking framework with shape completion called SCVTrack. The key idea is to fuse real target points from multiple frames to construct a synthetic dense target representation depicting shape precisely. This allows addressing sparsity/incompleteness issues.  

A quality-aware shape completion module selectively fuses source points into the synthetic representation based on quality scores to prevent noise accumulation. Relation modeling is done in a voxelized manner to handle imbalance in densities. A box refinement module further refines predictions using the synthetic representation.

Main Contributions:
- Novel tracking framework performing shape completion to construct precise synthetic target representation for dealing with sparse/incomplete clouds  
- Quality-aware completion mechanism to selectively fuse points based on quality scores, preventing noise accumulation
- Voxelized relation modeling and box refinement modules to improve tracking
- Favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness of the proposed quality-aware shape completion approach

In summary, the key innovation is the use of shape completion to construct a dense/complete synthetic target representation, with quality-aware fusion and voxelized tracking modules, for robust 3D tracking in sparse and incomplete point clouds.
