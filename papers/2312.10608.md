# [Robust 3D Tracking with Quality-Aware Shape Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10608)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Robust 3D Tracking with Quality-Aware Shape Completion":

Problem:
Existing 3D object trackers struggle to track objects in sparse and incomplete point clouds, which are common due to limited sensor capabilities and self-occlusion. Two main strategies have been used to address this: 1) Learning dense features from sparse points, but this is difficult and uncertain. 2) Aggregating features across frames, but this results in imprecise shape representations.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a voxelized 3D tracking framework with shape completion called SCVTrack. The key idea is to fuse real target points from multiple frames to construct a synthetic dense target representation depicting shape precisely. This allows addressing sparsity/incompleteness issues.  

A quality-aware shape completion module selectively fuses source points into the synthetic representation based on quality scores to prevent noise accumulation. Relation modeling is done in a voxelized manner to handle imbalance in densities. A box refinement module further refines predictions using the synthetic representation.

Main Contributions:
- Novel tracking framework performing shape completion to construct precise synthetic target representation for dealing with sparse/incomplete clouds  
- Quality-aware completion mechanism to selectively fuse points based on quality scores, preventing noise accumulation
- Voxelized relation modeling and box refinement modules to improve tracking
- Favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness of the proposed quality-aware shape completion approach

In summary, the key innovation is the use of shape completion to construct a dense/complete synthetic target representation, with quality-aware fusion and voxelized tracking modules, for robust 3D tracking in sparse and incomplete point clouds.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a robust 3D tracking framework with shape completion that constructs a dense and complete representation of the target object by fusing points from historical frames to address the challenges of sparsity and incompleteness in LiDAR tracking.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

1) Proposing a voxelized 3D tracking framework with shape completion to effectively leverage the real target points from historical frames to address the challenges of sparsity and incompleteness in 3D tracking. 

2) Designing a quality-aware shape completion mechanism that takes the quality of the points into account for shape completion to alleviate the adverse effect of historical prediction errors.

3) Achieving favorable 3D tracking performance against state-of-the-art algorithms on three datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In summary, the key contribution is using shape completion in a quality-aware manner to construct a synthetic target representation for robust 3D tracking, and designing a voxelized tracking framework to deal with the imbalance issue caused by shape completion. The effectiveness is validated by experiments on multiple datasets.
