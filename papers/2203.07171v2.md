# [Orchestrated Value Mapping for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07171v2)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:Can mapping the value function to different spaces using arbitrary functions from a broad class, combined with linearly decomposing the reward signal into multiple channels, lead to a general convergent class of reinforcement learning algorithms? The key ideas that the paper puts forth and aims to validate are:1) Mapping value estimates to different spaces using suitable functions can incorporate specific properties into the value estimator that enhance learning (e.g. dealing with varying reward scales).2) Decomposing the reward signal into multiple channels allows the value function to be represented as a composition of multiple utility functions. This can be leveraged for various purposes like handling varying reward scales, incorporating prior knowledge about reward sources, and ensemble learning. 3) Combining these two principles yields a general blueprint for constructing new convergent algorithms by orchestrating diverse mapping functions over multiple reward channels. 4) This unified approach generalizes and subsumes prior algorithms like Q-Learning, Log Q-Learning, and Q-Decomposition.5) The convergence proof for this algorithm class relaxes certain assumptions made in previous proofs for specific algorithms like Log Q-Learning.The core hypothesis seems to be that by intelligently mapping value functions and decomposing rewards, we can create a broad class of new RL algorithms that converge under relatively mild assumptions while overcoming limitations of existing techniques. The paper aims to formally develop this approach and illustrate its potential.
