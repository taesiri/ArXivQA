# [PBSCSR: The Piano Bootleg Score Composer Style Recognition Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16803)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to facilitate research on composer style recognition by creating a dataset that is diverse, large-scale, and easy to use. Previous datasets for this task have limitations in size, diversity, data format, or accessibility. The goal is to create a dataset that pushes the boundaries on all these fronts.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces the Piano Bootleg Score Composer Style Recognition (PBSCSR) dataset. It consists of:

(1) 40,000 62x64 binary images of piano bootleg score fragments in a 9-way classification task 

(2) 100,000 62x64 binary images of piano bootleg score fragments in a 100-way classification task

(3) 29,310 unlabeled variable-length piano bootleg scores from IMSLP for pretraining

The key idea is to extract fixed-length "bootleg score" representations from sheet music images. This simplifies the data format while allowing access to large, diverse sheet music data. Metadata is provided to trace fragments back to original IMSLP data.

Contributions:

- The largest and most challenging dataset for composer style recognition, with simple MNIST-like format
- Baseline models (CNN, Transformers) and results for future comparison 
- Detailed proposals for model-based classification, few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, data augmentation, and multimodal research directions
- Identification of open questions on data encoding schemes, few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, data augmentation, and multimodal integration

The aim is to create an open, large-scale dataset to drive progress on composer style recognition across multiple research directions. Its scale and simplicity facilitate rapid iteration.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces the Piano Bootleg Score Composer Style Recognition (PBSCSR) dataset, a large-scale dataset of binary piano sheet music images aimed at facilitating research on musical style recognition tasks that is as easy to use as MNIST but as challenging as ImageNet.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction and description of the Piano Bootleg Score Composer Style Recognition (PBSCSR) dataset for studying composer style recognition of piano sheet music. Specifically:

- The paper presents a new dataset consisting of 40,000 labeled 62x64 bootleg score images for a 9-way classification task, 100,000 labeled 62x64 bootleg score images for a 100-way classification task, and over 29,000 unlabeled variable-length bootleg scores for pretraining. 

- The goal was to create a dataset that is "as accessible as MNIST and as challenging as ImageNet" - easy to work with but still complex. The bootleg score representation allows the use of a large, diverse dataset from IMSLP while keeping the data format simple.

- Metadata is included to link the bootleg scores back to the original sheet music images and composer information on IMSLP. This allows access to additional modalities like audio recordings and text descriptions.

- Baseline experiments and results are provided for the 9-way and 100-way classification tasks using CNN, GPT-2, and RoBERTa models.

- Several research directions are discussed that the new dataset could help facilitate, including few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, encoding schemes, data augmentation, and multimodal integration.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of a large-scale, accessible dataset to push forward research on composer style recognition using multimodal representations of sheet music.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the dataset was designed to be "as accessible as MNIST and as challenging as ImageNet." In what ways is the dataset accessible like MNIST? In what ways is it challenging like ImageNet?

2. The bootleg score representation discards a lot of musical information like note durations, accidentals, etc. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using this simplified representation? How does it impact the types of models and tasks that can be studied?

3. The paper explores both image-based (CNN, ViT) and token-based (Transformer) encodings of the bootleg score data. What are some of the tradeoffs between these two encoding schemes? When might one encoding be preferred over the other?

4. Data augmentation is mentioned as an interesting area for future work. What are some data augmentation techniques that could be effectively applied to the bootleg score representation? What kinds of musically-meaningful augmentations are possible?

5. The baseline models still perform relatively poorly on the 100-way classification task. What are some ideas for improving classification performance? What kinds of architectural modifications or training strategies might help? 

6. The paper proposes few-shot and zero-shot variants of the classification task. What makes these tasks difficult? What kinds of techniques could be used to tackle the extreme data scarcity?

7. Multimodal learning with text, audio, MIDI, etc is discussed as an area for future work. What are some of the challenges in training multimodal models? How can the bootleg score representation facilitate connecting these modalities?

8. The dataset links each sample to the underlying sheet music images and metadata on IMSLP. In what ways could this raw data be leveraged to improve model performance or study new tasks?

9. The paper explores shallow CNN, Transformer, and RoBERTa architectures. What are some recent state-of-the-art models across vision, language, and music domains that could push performance further?

10. The data has 100 labeled composers but 29310 unlabeled pieces. What are some ways this unlabeled data could be utilized, either with self-supervised pretraining techniques or semi-supervised learning?
