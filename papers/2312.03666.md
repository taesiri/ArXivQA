# [Towards small and accurate convolutional neural networks for acoustic   biodiversity monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03666)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated classification of animal sounds to enable large-scale acoustic biodiversity monitoring. The authors designed a family of small CNNs called SIMP-FU that take spectrograms as input and output multi-label time-indexed predictions. A key aspect studied was the temporal receptive field size. Models were trained on a moderate-sized manually annotated dataset of 20 tropical bird species. Usage of time-indexed labels during training led to far better generalization performance compared to segment-level labels. The best models had a receptive field size of 1.5 seconds, matching the duration of most targeted sounds. Some models achieved AUC over 0.95 for 18 of 20 classes while being compact enough to run faster than real-time on low-cost hardware. The results demonstrate that with explicit time-indexing of labels and adequately sized receptive fields, small CNNs can achieve strong predictive performance without large training sets. This enables deployment on low-cost devices for biodiversity monitoring.
