# [Background Prompting for Improved Object Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05428)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve the object depth prediction from existing depth networks using a simple yet effective strategy of learning background prompts?Specifically, the authors propose a "background prompting" method where they learn to replace the background of an input image with a learned background prompt. This adapted image is then passed into an existing pre-trained depth network to get improved depth estimates, especially for object regions. The key ideas explored in the paper around this central question are:- Learning background prompts helps the network focus on predicting better foreground depth by reducing dependence on variable backgrounds.- Replacing backgrounds minimizes the sim2real gap between synthetic training data and real test images.- The prompting strategy is very data efficient compared to full finetuning of large depth networks.- The method can work with different depth network architectures and requires no retraining or modification of original networks.- Background prompting allows repurposing of disparity prediction networks to directly predict metric depths.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that learning to adapt the input images via background prompting is an effective and efficient way to improve object depth predictions from existing depth networks. The experiments aim to validate this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a background prompting strategy to improve object depth prediction from existing depth networks. The key ideas are:- They propose to replace the background pixels of an input image with a learned background prompt, while keeping the foreground object pixels unchanged. This adapted image is then passed to an off-the-shelf pre-trained depth network to get better object depth predictions.- They learn the background prompts in a data-efficient manner using only small-scale synthetic object datasets with depth labels. The prompts are learned by backpropagating through frozen pre-trained depth networks.- They propose both unconditional (single background for all objects) and conditional (input-dependent background prediction) prompting strategies. The conditional strategy uses a lightweight network conditioned on foreground mask.- Their prompting strategy allows improving depth predictions from existing networks without retraining them, and also helps in sim2real transfer by reducing the domain gap.- They demonstrate consistent depth improvements on multiple datasets (synthetic and real) by prompting diverse existing depth networks like MiDaS, DPT, OmniData etc.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a simple and effective background prompting strategy to adapt existing depth networks to the task of improved object depth prediction in a data-efficient and network-agnostic manner.
