# [Background Prompting for Improved Object Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05428)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve the object depth prediction from existing depth networks using a simple yet effective strategy of learning background prompts?Specifically, the authors propose a "background prompting" method where they learn to replace the background of an input image with a learned background prompt. This adapted image is then passed into an existing pre-trained depth network to get improved depth estimates, especially for object regions. The key ideas explored in the paper around this central question are:- Learning background prompts helps the network focus on predicting better foreground depth by reducing dependence on variable backgrounds.- Replacing backgrounds minimizes the sim2real gap between synthetic training data and real test images.- The prompting strategy is very data efficient compared to full finetuning of large depth networks.- The method can work with different depth network architectures and requires no retraining or modification of original networks.- Background prompting allows repurposing of disparity prediction networks to directly predict metric depths.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that learning to adapt the input images via background prompting is an effective and efficient way to improve object depth predictions from existing depth networks. The experiments aim to validate this idea.
