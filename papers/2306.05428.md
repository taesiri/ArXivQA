# [Background Prompting for Improved Object Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05428)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve the object depth prediction from existing depth networks using a simple yet effective strategy of learning background prompts?Specifically, the authors propose a "background prompting" method where they learn to replace the background of an input image with a learned background prompt. This adapted image is then passed into an existing pre-trained depth network to get improved depth estimates, especially for object regions. The key ideas explored in the paper around this central question are:- Learning background prompts helps the network focus on predicting better foreground depth by reducing dependence on variable backgrounds.- Replacing backgrounds minimizes the sim2real gap between synthetic training data and real test images.- The prompting strategy is very data efficient compared to full finetuning of large depth networks.- The method can work with different depth network architectures and requires no retraining or modification of original networks.- Background prompting allows repurposing of disparity prediction networks to directly predict metric depths.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that learning to adapt the input images via background prompting is an effective and efficient way to improve object depth predictions from existing depth networks. The experiments aim to validate this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a background prompting strategy to improve object depth prediction from existing depth networks. The key ideas are:- They propose to replace the background pixels of an input image with a learned background prompt, while keeping the foreground object pixels unchanged. This adapted image is then passed to an off-the-shelf pre-trained depth network to get better object depth predictions.- They learn the background prompts in a data-efficient manner using only small-scale synthetic object datasets with depth labels. The prompts are learned by backpropagating through frozen pre-trained depth networks.- They propose both unconditional (single background for all objects) and conditional (input-dependent background prediction) prompting strategies. The conditional strategy uses a lightweight network conditioned on foreground mask.- Their prompting strategy allows improving depth predictions from existing networks without retraining them, and also helps in sim2real transfer by reducing the domain gap.- They demonstrate consistent depth improvements on multiple datasets (synthetic and real) by prompting diverse existing depth networks like MiDaS, DPT, OmniData etc.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a simple and effective background prompting strategy to adapt existing depth networks to the task of improved object depth prediction in a data-efficient and network-agnostic manner.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a background prompting strategy to improve object depth estimation from a single image by replacing the background pixels with a learned background prompt, enabling better generalization from synthetic object training data to real images.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper proposes a novel background prompting strategy to improve object depth estimation from single images. Here are some key ways it compares to other related works on monocular depth estimation:- Most prior work has focused on scene-level depth estimation, training networks on datasets of full scenes. This paper focuses specifically on improving depth for individual objects segmented from scenes.- A common approach for improving depth estimation is to train or fine-tune networks on diverse datasets. This paper takes a different approach - adapting the input image rather than retraining networks. This makes it very efficient and widely applicable.- Some recent works like visual prompting and boosting adapt pretrained networks to new tasks/improve performance by modifying inputs or using multiple passes. This work introduces background prompting as a new prompting strategy tailored for depth estimation. - Using synthetic data to train depth networks can help with diversity but struggles with sim2real transfer. This work uses a small synthetic dataset to learn prompting backgrounds that minimize the sim2real gap and generalize well to real images.- Most monocular depth networks predict relative depth/disparity rather than metric depth. A contribution here is adapting networks to predict metric depth by changing only the input via prompting.- Compared to input transformations like zooming used in other prompting works, background replacement is better suited for depth as it preserves scale. Compared to other prompting approaches that add features to images, background prompting modifies existing pixels making it widely applicable.In summary, this paper explores a new direction of learning to adapt the inputs using background prompting specifically to improve generalizability and quality of object depth estimation. The approach is simple, efficient, and broadly applicable compared to prior works.
