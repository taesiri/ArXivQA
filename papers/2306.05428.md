# [Background Prompting for Improved Object Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05428)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve the object depth prediction from existing depth networks using a simple yet effective strategy of learning background prompts?Specifically, the authors propose a "background prompting" method where they learn to replace the background of an input image with a learned background prompt. This adapted image is then passed into an existing pre-trained depth network to get improved depth estimates, especially for object regions. The key ideas explored in the paper around this central question are:- Learning background prompts helps the network focus on predicting better foreground depth by reducing dependence on variable backgrounds.- Replacing backgrounds minimizes the sim2real gap between synthetic training data and real test images.- The prompting strategy is very data efficient compared to full finetuning of large depth networks.- The method can work with different depth network architectures and requires no retraining or modification of original networks.- Background prompting allows repurposing of disparity prediction networks to directly predict metric depths.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that learning to adapt the input images via background prompting is an effective and efficient way to improve object depth predictions from existing depth networks. The experiments aim to validate this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a background prompting strategy to improve object depth prediction from existing depth networks. The key ideas are:- They propose to replace the background pixels of an input image with a learned background prompt, while keeping the foreground object pixels unchanged. This adapted image is then passed to an off-the-shelf pre-trained depth network to get better object depth predictions.- They learn the background prompts in a data-efficient manner using only small-scale synthetic object datasets with depth labels. The prompts are learned by backpropagating through frozen pre-trained depth networks.- They propose both unconditional (single background for all objects) and conditional (input-dependent background prediction) prompting strategies. The conditional strategy uses a lightweight network conditioned on foreground mask.- Their prompting strategy allows improving depth predictions from existing networks without retraining them, and also helps in sim2real transfer by reducing the domain gap.- They demonstrate consistent depth improvements on multiple datasets (synthetic and real) by prompting diverse existing depth networks like MiDaS, DPT, OmniData etc.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a simple and effective background prompting strategy to adapt existing depth networks to the task of improved object depth prediction in a data-efficient and network-agnostic manner.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a background prompting strategy to improve object depth estimation from a single image by replacing the background pixels with a learned background prompt, enabling better generalization from synthetic object training data to real images.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper proposes a novel background prompting strategy to improve object depth estimation from single images. Here are some key ways it compares to other related works on monocular depth estimation:- Most prior work has focused on scene-level depth estimation, training networks on datasets of full scenes. This paper focuses specifically on improving depth for individual objects segmented from scenes.- A common approach for improving depth estimation is to train or fine-tune networks on diverse datasets. This paper takes a different approach - adapting the input image rather than retraining networks. This makes it very efficient and widely applicable.- Some recent works like visual prompting and boosting adapt pretrained networks to new tasks/improve performance by modifying inputs or using multiple passes. This work introduces background prompting as a new prompting strategy tailored for depth estimation. - Using synthetic data to train depth networks can help with diversity but struggles with sim2real transfer. This work uses a small synthetic dataset to learn prompting backgrounds that minimize the sim2real gap and generalize well to real images.- Most monocular depth networks predict relative depth/disparity rather than metric depth. A contribution here is adapting networks to predict metric depth by changing only the input via prompting.- Compared to input transformations like zooming used in other prompting works, background replacement is better suited for depth as it preserves scale. Compared to other prompting approaches that add features to images, background prompting modifies existing pixels making it widely applicable.In summary, this paper explores a new direction of learning to adapt the inputs using background prompting specifically to improve generalizability and quality of object depth estimation. The approach is simple, efficient, and broadly applicable compared to prior works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more robust depth estimation methods that can better handle challenging cases like transparent, reflective, textureless surfaces, as well as highly occluded objects. The authors note that current methods still struggle with these cases.- Exploring different background prompt parameterizations and conditioning strategies beyond the unconditional and mask-conditioned approaches presented. This could allow adapting depth networks in a more fine-grained way for different objects and scenes. - Scaling up background prompt learning with larger and more diverse synthetic datasets to improve generalization. The authors used a relatively small synthetic object dataset, so using more varied data could help.- Combining background prompting with other techniques like attention mechanisms or patch-based processing to focus on particular object regions and refine depth predictions.- Extending the approach to video depth estimation by learning temporal background prompts that provide useful spatiotemporal cues.- Developing better strategies to merge the improved object depths with the original background depths for a full scene. The current work focused only on improving foreground object depth.- Applying background prompting strategies to other tasks beyond depth estimation like segmentation, pose estimation, etc. where the background affects generalization.- Exploring the use of background prompting for unsupervised or self-supervised depth learning. This could help adapt networks trained without ground truth supervision.So in summary, the authors point to many promising directions, including improvements to the prompting framework itself as well as extending it to new tasks, settings, and training regimes. Overall, it seems background prompting could become a widely useful technique for vision networks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes Background Prompting, a simple yet effective technique to improve object depth prediction from single images using existing pretrained depth networks. The key idea is to extract the foreground object from the input image and composite it onto a learned background prompt before feeding to the depth network. The background prompts are learned on synthetic object datasets by backpropagating through the frozen pretrained networks. This allows adapting the networks to focus better on predicting accurate object depth while eliminating dependency on the input background context, leading to improved generalization. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets and network architectures demonstrate consistent depth improvements. The approach also shows good sim2real transfer of prompts learned on synthetic data. Key benefits are data efficiency, network agnosticism, and direct reuse of state-of-the-art depth networks without modification.
