# [SAMCT: Segment Any CT Allowing Labor-Free Task-Indicator Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13258)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Segmentation foundation models like SAM struggle to segment medical images due to lack of medical knowledge, limited feature encoding, and reliance on accurate manual prompts. 
- Existing methods that tune SAM for medical images sacrifice versatility or still require laborious prompts.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose SAMCT, a modality-specific foundation model tailored for segmenting CT images.
- Adds a U-shaped CNN branch to capture local features alongside SAM's global features.  
- A cross-branch interaction module transfers information between the CNN and SAM branches.
- An optional task-indicator prompt encoder replaces manual prompts with automatic prompts based just on the segmentation target.

Main Contributions:
- Construct and release CT5M, a large-scale CT dataset with 1.1M images and 5M masks covering 118 objects from 30 public datasets.
- Demonstrate SAMCT's superior versatility and generalization ability versus SOTA foundation models and task-specific models by evaluating on CT5M's 30 datasets.
- Show the effectiveness of the CNN branch, cross-branch interaction, and automatic task-indicator prompts in boosting segmentation accuracy.
- Provide the first labor-free promptly foundation model for medical imaging, facilitating clinical deployment.

In summary, the paper presents SAMCT, an automated and versatile CT segmentation model requiring no manual interaction, along with CT5M for comprehensive evaluation across diverse objects and datasets. Experiments validate marked improvements over existing methods.
