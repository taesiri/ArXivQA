# [REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility   for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Location prediction aims to predict a user's future location based on historical mobility traces. However, real-world mobility traces are often sparse and incomplete due to the voluntary check-in behavior. 
- Existing RNN-based methods incorporate spatiotemporal contexts (e.g. distances) between locations to handle sparsity. But they fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where the strength of regularities varies across different time periods.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes REPLAY, an RNN architecture to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction.
- It incorporates smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging into RNNs. The timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths can automatically adapt to regularities of different strengths across timestamps.
- Specifically, REPLAY transforms check-in time into hour-in-week timestamps, and generates smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with learnable bandwidths. 
- The smoothed timestamp embeddings are fed as inputs together with POI embeddings into an RNN with flashback mechanism that searches informative historical hidden states using spatiotemporal contexts.
- Finally, REPLAY makes predictions conditioned on user embedding, aggregated RNN hidden state and a smoothed timestamp embedding of the query time.

Main Contributions:
- Reveals the limitation of existing RNN models in capturing the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility
- Designs REPLAY to seamlessly incorporate smoothed timestamp embeddings with learnable bandwidths into RNNs to capture such temporal regularities
- Conducts extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, showing that REPLAY outperforms 18 state-of-the-art methods by 7.7%-10.9%, and the learned bandwidths reveal interesting temporal regularity patterns
