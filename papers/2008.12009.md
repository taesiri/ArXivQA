# [A Survey of Evaluation Metrics Used for NLG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12009)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the central research question is: 

How can we develop an accurate automatic evaluation metric for natural language generation (NLG) systems that captures the nuances required for assessing different NLG tasks?

The paper discusses the challenges in evaluating NLG systems due to the wide variety of criteria that need to be checked across different NLG tasks. It argues that existing metrics like BLEU and ROUGE are inadequate as they were designed mainly for machine translation and do not correlate well with human judgments for many other NLG tasks. 

The authors survey the large number of evaluation metrics proposed since 2014 and organize them into a taxonomy of context-free versus context-dependent metrics. They highlight the need for more task-specific context-dependent metrics, as well as more interpretable metrics that provide fine-grained scores corresponding to different evaluation criteria.

The central hypothesis appears to be that progress in automatic NLG evaluation requires metrics that are tailored for specific tasks, leverage contextual information, and provide nuanced multi-dimensional judgments akin to human evaluation. The paper recommends directions like developing common frameworks for metrics, collecting human judgment datasets, and critically analyzing proposed metrics.

In summary, the key research question is how to develop accurate automatic NLG evaluation metrics that can act as a good proxy for multi-faceted human evaluation across diverse NLG tasks. The paper surveys existing work and provides recommendations towards addressing this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be presenting a taxonomy of automatic evaluation metrics for natural language generation (NLG) systems. The paper provides a comprehensive survey of existing metrics, organizes them into a coherent taxonomy, highlights shortcomings of current metrics, and makes recommendations for future research directions. 

Specifically, some of the key contributions are:

- Proposing a taxonomy to categorize existing automatic NLG evaluation metrics into context-free vs context-dependent metrics. The context-free metrics are further divided into trained vs untrained metrics. 

- Providing details on a wide variety of existing metrics ranging from classics like BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR to more recent metrics like BERTScore, BLEURT, etc. The metrics are organized based on the taxonomy.

- Summarizing studies that have criticized automatic metrics due to poor correlation with human judgements, lack of interpretability, biases, poor adaptability across tasks, etc.

- Discussing different methodologies used for evaluating evaluation metrics - correlation measures, significance tests, adversarial evaluations, etc.

- Providing recommendations on developing common codebases and datasets, building context-dependent and interpretable metrics, critical benchmarking of metrics, etc.

In summary, the key contribution is providing a structured taxonomy and comprehensive overview of automatic NLG evaluation metrics, summarizing their limitations, and giving recommendations for advancing research in this area. The paper helps quickly get up to speed on the developments in NLG evaluation metrics over the past few years.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

This LaTeX template provides a starting point for writing an ACM conference paper, including predefined document classes, bibliography styles, and formatting guidance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on the excerpt provided, this appears to be a sample LaTeX manuscript for submitting papers to ACM publications. The key things I notice are:

- It uses the acmart LaTeX style, which is designed for ACM publication formatting. This handles things like page layout, fonts, headings, etc. to match ACM requirements.

- It includes examples of common frontmatter like abstract, author information, keywords, etc. as well as bibliography formatting. This allows authors to easily format papers for ACM submission. 

- It demonstrates how to format a sample paper in LaTeX. The manuscript content itself is generic placeholder text ("lorem ipsum").

So in summary, this does not represent novel research itself, but rather provides a template for formatting and submitting research papers to ACM venues. It encapsulates best practices like using the official acmart style and including necessary frontmatter. Similar templates are commonly used to simplify formatting for conference paper submissions. This allows authors to focus on the content rather than LaTeX formatting details.

In terms of actual research, this sample does not contribute new scientific findings. It serves more as a helper for academic writing and streamlining the submission process rather than introducing research innovations within a field. The placeholder manuscript text does not have scholarly content.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on their survey, the authors make the following recommendations for future research directions:

- Developing a common code base for evaluation metrics to allow for easier adoption and critical examination. 

- Building more datasets containing fine-grained human judgements for training and evaluating metrics. These datasets should have judgements on different criteria like fluency, coherence, etc.

- Developing more task-specific context-dependent metrics using the human judgement datasets. Currently most metrics are context-free.

- Creating more interpretable metrics that provide separate scores for different criteria rather than a single score. This would give clearer feedback for improvement.

- Constructing robust benchmarks to critically evaluate proposed metrics and reveal their limitations/biases. This could include adversarial examples to test metric robustness. 

- Performing more fine-grained and multi-criteria evaluation of NLG systems rather than using a single metric score.

- Developing self-explainable evaluation metrics that can provide rationales behind the assigned scores.

- Testing evaluation metrics on their real-world usability by end users of NLG systems.

In summary, the authors recommend efforts towards making evaluation metrics more reliable, interpretable, adversarial-robust, and tailored for specific NLG tasks by utilizing human judgement datasets. They also suggest improving evaluation protocols by checking systems on multiple relevant criteria.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using a hierarchical RNN encoder to obtain vector representations of the dialogue context, reference response, and candidate response. What are the benefits of using a hierarchical encoder compared to a standard RNN encoder? How does it help capture both utterance-level and full context-level information?

2. The paper trains ADEM using squared error loss between the model predictions and human scores. Why is squared error an appropriate loss function for this regression task? What are some other possible loss functions that could be used for training?

3. The paper collects training data by obtaining human ratings on responses from dialogue models as well as humans. This provides a mix of good and bad responses. Why is it important to have both high and low quality responses in the training data? How would the model perform if trained only on good responses?

4. The paper encodes the context, reference response, and candidate response separately before combining them to produce the final score. What is the motivation behind encoding them individually first? Why not encode them together from the start?

5. The scoring function uses matrix multiplications between the context, reference, and candidate embeddings. Intuitively, what is the purpose of these matrix multiplications in the scoring function?

6. The paper re-scales the model outputs to be in the range [1, 5] to match the scale of human annotations. Why is this re-scaling necessary? What problems could occur if the raw model outputs were used directly without re-scaling?

7. The paper uses a Twitter dialogue corpus for training data. How suitable is Twitter data for training a dialogue evaluation model? What are some potential issues with using Twitter data?

8. The paper combines matrix multiplications and addition in the scoring function. Could more complex interactions between the embeddings be modeled? What are some other possible scoring functions? 

9. The model is trained to minimize squared error between predictions and human judgements. What are some ways the training objective could be modified or improved?

10. The paper evaluates ADEM intrinsically by comparing against human judgements. What are some ways the model could be evaluated extrinsically based on how it impacts an end dialogue system?
