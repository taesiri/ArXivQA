# [Towards Model-Based Data Acquisition for Subjective Multi-Task NLP   Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08198)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a novel model-based data acquisition strategy focused on reducing annotation effort for subjective multi-task natural language processing (NLP) problems. Their method, called Valuable Text Label (VTL), quantifies whether a text-label pair is valuable for annotation based on the predicted number of non-zero annotations. The deep neural network model then automatically annotates invaluable text-label pairs, allowing a reduction of up to 40% in annotation effort based on experiments on three datasets with 23 tasks and thousands of annotations. The evaluation also emphasized that for small datasets, linguistic knowledge is more important than personalization. Moreover, for some datasets, training only on the labels predicted by their model improves performance as a regularization technique in a self-supervised learning manner. Overall, their experiments highlight the potential of model-based annotation optimization to significantly reduce annotation costs for subjective multi-task NLP datasets while maintaining model performance. The proposed VTL measure and accompanying metrics also provide useful indicators for quantifying the reduction in annotation effort versus potential loss of valuable annotations.
