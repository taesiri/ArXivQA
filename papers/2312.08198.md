# [Towards Model-Based Data Acquisition for Subjective Multi-Task NLP   Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08198)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a novel model-based data acquisition strategy focused on reducing annotation effort for subjective multi-task natural language processing (NLP) problems. Their method, called Valuable Text Label (VTL), quantifies whether a text-label pair is valuable for annotation based on the predicted number of non-zero annotations. The deep neural network model then automatically annotates invaluable text-label pairs, allowing a reduction of up to 40% in annotation effort based on experiments on three datasets with 23 tasks and thousands of annotations. The evaluation also emphasized that for small datasets, linguistic knowledge is more important than personalization. Moreover, for some datasets, training only on the labels predicted by their model improves performance as a regularization technique in a self-supervised learning manner. Overall, their experiments highlight the potential of model-based annotation optimization to significantly reduce annotation costs for subjective multi-task NLP datasets while maintaining model performance. The proposed VTL measure and accompanying metrics also provide useful indicators for quantifying the reduction in annotation effort versus potential loss of valuable annotations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a model-based data acquisition strategy for subjective multi-task NLP problems to reduce annotation effort by predicting valuable labels for each text, resulting in up to 40% reduction of annotation effort with negligible loss of knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a novel model-based data acquisition optimization strategy focused on reducing the annotation effort by predicting the valuable labels for each text. This resulted in up to 25% benefit and up to 40% reduction of the annotation effort.

2) Applying the proposed method on three datasets regarding personalized multi-task NLP problems. 

3) Developing new evaluation metrics appropriate for the problem and leveraging them along with standard metrics like macro F1-score.

4) Evaluating the self-supervised scenario, where the model was trained only on labels previously predicted by itself to measure the amount of knowledge not learned during training.

5) Testing the impact of training dataset size on model performance.

6) Analyzing the knowledge transfer between tasks in single-task and multi-task scenarios. 

7) Analyzing the relation between the number of annotations per text, number of unique texts in the dataset, and model performance.

8) Evaluating the personalized architecture for multi-task subjective problems.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel model-based data acquisition strategy to reduce annotation effort by predicting valuable labels, while minimizing the loss of useful knowledge. This is evaluated on multiple subjective multi-task NLP datasets using newly developed metrics.
