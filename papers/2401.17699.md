# [Unified Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17699)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Unified Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection":

Problem:
- Face recognition (FR) systems can suffer from both physical attacks (e.g. print, replay) and digital attacks (e.g. DeepFakes). 
- Previous work handles these two types of attacks separately, requiring multiple models and more computational resources.
- Two main limitations prevent a unified approach: (1) Lack of a dataset with both attack types and ID consistency across real and fake samples; (2) Large intra-class differences between physical and digital attacks make joint modeling difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Collect a new Unified physical-digital Attack Dataset (UniAttackData) with 1,800 IDs, 2 physical attacks and 12 digital attacks per ID, totaling 29,706 videos. Ensures ID consistency.
- Propose UniAttackDetection framework based on Vision-Language Models to jointly detect both attack types:
  - Teacher-Student Prompts module: Extracts unified knowledge via teacher prompts and specific knowledge via learnable student prompts
  - Unified Knowledge Mining module: Enhances complete feature space learning using text-based optimization
  - Sample-Level Prompt Interaction module: Maps prompts to visual space for multi-modal learning of sample semantics

Main Contributions:
- First unified physical-digital attack dataset (UniAttackData) with ID consistency across 29K videos 
- UniAttackDetection framework for joint modeling using vision-language techniques
- State-of-the-art performance on UniAttackData and other datasets, demonstrating capabilities for unified attack detection

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed dataset and model solution, and highlights the three main contributions made in the paper. It explains the key ideas at a high-level without going into excessive technical detail.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new unified physical-digital attack dataset with ID consistency, and a unified attack detection framework using vision-language models that adaptively learns a tight and complete feature space to detect both physical and digital attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a new dataset called UniAttackData that combines physical and digital attacks with guaranteed ID consistency. This is the first unified attack dataset with ID consistency.

2) Proposing a unified attack detection framework called UniAttackDetection that is based on vision-language models (VLMs). The framework has three key modules - Teacher-Student Prompts (TSP) to extract unified and specific knowledge features, Unified Knowledge Mining (UKM) to capture a tight and complete feature space, and Sample-Level Prompt Interaction (SLPI) to grasp sample-level semantics.

3) Conducting comprehensive experiments on UniAttackData and three other datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and method for unified face attack detection. The results show the superiority of the approach over existing methods.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing the first unified physical-digital attack dataset with ID consistency, a new unified attack detection framework based on VLMs, and showing through extensive experiments the importance of ID consistency and the effectiveness of the method.
