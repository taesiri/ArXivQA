## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Graph-based Feature Synthesis (GFS), a novel framework for column prediction tasks on relational databases. GFS formulates the database as a heterogeneous graph, preserving relational structure while eliminating manual feature engineering. It allows incorporating any differentiable single-table model into two modular components: the node embedding function to capture within-table patterns, and the prediction head. Message passing iterates between these components, propagating information across tables. Compared to prior automated feature engineering methods like DFS, GFS is proven invariant to traversal order and capable of covering all join paths. Relative to recent graph-based approaches like RDB2Graph, GFS enhances node embeddings via stronger tabular models, mitigates oversmoothing, and improves efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate consistent performance gains over both categories of baselines. Ablations validate the importance of GFS components like powerful node embeddings. By effectively harnessing relational structure and single-table biases, GFS advances the state-of-the-art in an important yet under-explored area.
