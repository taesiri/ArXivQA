# [Sparse Attention with Linear Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07012)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper aims to address is how to develop a sparse attention mechanism that is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and performs comparably to dense attention in terms of model accuracy. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new attention mechanism called Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA) that replaces the softmax activation in standard attention with a ReLU activation. This results in automatic sparsity as the ReLU drops negative attention scores. The key research questions explored are:

- Can simply replacing softmax with ReLU and adding normalization produce a working sparse attention mechanism for Transformer models? 

- How does ReLA compare to dense attention and other sparse attention methods like sparsemax in terms of model accuracy, training efficiency, inference speed, and induced sparsity?

- Does the automatic sparsity from ReLA provide any benefits in terms of interpretability or model analysis compared to dense attention?

The central hypothesis is that ReLA can achieve comparable accuracy to dense attention while being simpler and more efficient than other sparse attention methods. The experiments aim to validate whether this hypothesis holds across various machine translation tasks and model configurations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), a novel sparse attention mechanism that replaces the softmax activation in standard attention with a ReLU activation. This results in automatic sparsity without needing complex inference algorithms like prior sparse attention methods.

- ReLA is shown to achieve comparable translation performance to strong baselines on five machine translation tasks, while having similar training and inference speed as standard softmax attention.

- Analysis shows that ReLA induces sparse and diverse attention heads, with accuracy on word alignment that is better than prior sparse attention methods. 

- Uniquely, ReLA allows attention heads to assign a total attention of zero to some queries, leading to highly specialized heads. The paper shows this "null attention" can be indicative of translation quality.

In summary, the key novelty is the simple but effective ReLU formulation for sparse attention, which gives both efficiency and interesting properties like null attention. ReLA seems to be an interpretable and efficient drop-in replacement for standard softmax attention.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), a novel sparse attention model that replaces the softmax activation in standard attention with a rectified linear unit, enabling automatic sparsity and flexibility without complex inference algorithms.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in sparse attention mechanisms for neural networks:

- The key contribution of this paper is proposing Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), which uses a ReLU activation instead of softmax to induce sparsity in attention weights. This is a simple but novel method for achieving sparse attention. 

- Compared to prior work on sparsifying softmax attention, such as sparsemax and entmax, ReLA is much more efficient as it does not require complex inference algorithms like sorting. The training and decoding speed of ReLA is on par with standard softmax attention.

- ReLA allows attention weights to be exactly zero, enabling "null attention" where a head attends to nothing for certain queries. This provides greater flexibility compared to softmax-based methods. The emergence of null attention heads with specialized roles is an interesting finding.

- The paper shows ReLA can be successfully applied to Transformer models for machine translation across various language pairs. The translation quality is comparable to strong baselines including softmax and entmax attention.

- Analysis of attention weights shows ReLA induces high sparsity and head diversity. The cross-attention heads learn alignments that correspond better to word alignments than prior sparse methods.

- Overall, ReLA seems to be a promising new approach for sparse attention that is simple, efficient, and flexible. The concept of null attention and emergent head specialization are notable findings compared to prior work. The results demonstrate ReLA's potential as a drop-in replacement for standard softmax attention.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel method for sparse attention that is empirically shown to be efficient, high-performing, and able to induce interesting properties like null attention. The analysis provides new insights compared to prior work on sparsifying attention.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Apply ReLA to other neural models and tasks beyond machine translation, such as language modeling, text classification, etc. The authors are interested in seeing if ReLA generalizes well to other domains.

- Scale ReLA to very long input sequences, as the sparsity induced by ReLA may be beneficial for modeling long texts. The authors suggest applying ReLA in models like Reformer that are designed for long contexts.

- Make the sparsity level in ReLA more controllable, for example by making the threshold in the ReLU activation differentiable. This could allow more flexible tuning of sparsity.

- Explore multi-source architectures with ReLA, where the relevance of each source input may vary. ReLA's ability to assign null attention could be useful here.

- Analyze what linguistic properties lead to the emergence of null attention in ReLA, to better understand the model behavior.

- Apply analysis techniques from ReLA, like using null attention statistics, to tasks like corpus filtering and improving training data quality.

- Scale ReLA to much larger models and datasets via pretraining, to analyze resulting performance and interpretability.

In summary, the main directions are: applying ReLA more broadly, controlling sparsity, analyzing null attention, and leveraging null attention for applications like data filtering. The authors are interested in further improving ReLA's flexibility, generalization and interpretability.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), a novel sparse attention mechanism that replaces the softmax activation in standard attention with a rectified linear unit (ReLU). ReLA abandons the probabilistic constraint of softmax attention and allows attention scores to take on any non-negative value. This inherently induces sparsity, as ReLU drops negative attention scores to zero. To stabilize training, layer normalization is applied to the attention outputs. Two variants of ReLA are proposed: ReLA-i uses a specialized initialization scheme, while ReLA-g adds a gating function. Experiments on machine translation tasks show that ReLA achieves comparable performance to strong baselines, while having similar training and decoding speed as standard softmax attention. Analysis demonstrates that ReLA induces high sparsity and head diversity, and that the learned cross attention better reflects word alignments. Interestingly, ReLA heads learn to attend to nothing for some queries, which is not possible with softmax. Overall, ReLA provides an efficient and flexible way to learn sparse attention automatically.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), a novel sparse attention mechanism. ReLA replaces the softmax activation in standard attention with a ReLU activation, which naturally induces sparsity by zeroing out negative attention scores. To stabilize training, layer normalization is applied to the attention outputs. Two variants are proposed - ReLA-i which uses a specialized initialization for layer normalization, and ReLA-g which adds a gating mechanism. 

Experiments on machine translation tasks show that ReLA achieves comparable performance to strong softmax attention baselines, while having similar training and decoding speed. Analysis shows that ReLA attentions are sparse and accurately reflect word alignments. Interestingly, ReLA allows "null" attention where a head assigns zero attention for some queries. This emerges for certain heads and sentence pairs, indicating specialized behavior and translation quality. Overall, ReLA provides an efficient and flexible approach to learn sparse attention automatically.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel sparse attention mechanism called Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA). ReLA replaces the softmax function typically used in attention with a rectified linear unit (ReLU). This allows negative attention scores to be dropped, leading to inherent sparsity in the attention distribution. To stabilize training, layer normalization is applied to the attention outputs. Two variants of ReLA are proposed - ReLA-i which uses a specialized initialization for the layer normalization, and ReLA-g which adds a gating function. ReLA can be used as a drop-in replacement for standard softmax attention in the Transformer architecture. It is applied to machine translation tasks, where it achieves comparable performance to softmax attention and other sparse attention methods like sparsemax and entmax, while being more efficient computationally. The key advantage of ReLA is its ability to automatically learn sparse attention in a data-driven way, without needing complex specialized inference algorithms like other sparse methods. ReLA also allows for null attention, where the attention scores for some queries can be completely zero. This provides flexibility and interpretability.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing a new attention mechanism called Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA) for sequence-to-sequence models. The key points are:

- Standard softmax attention produces dense attention distributions, assigning small amounts of attention even to irrelevant context. This makes the attention weights harder to interpret and analyze. 

- Prior work has proposed sparsified softmax variants like sparsemax and entmax to induce sparsity. But these require complex inference algorithms which reduce efficiency.

- This paper proposes ReLA which uses ReLU instead of softmax, abandoning the probabilistic constraint. ReLU inherently induces sparsity by dropping negative activations.

- To stabilize training, ReLA applies layer normalization and a specialized initialization or gating. 

- ReLA is simple to implement, efficient, and flexible in allowing variable sparsity patterns and null attention across queries.

- Experiments on machine translation tasks show ReLA achieves comparable performance to strong baselines, with similar training/decoding speed as standard softmax attention.

- Analysis shows ReLA delivers high sparsity, head diversity, and better alignment accuracy than prior sparse attention methods. It also enables some heads to produce informative null attentions.

In summary, the paper aims to develop a sparse attention mechanism that is simple, efficient, flexible, and interpretable. ReLA is proposed as an effective approach to achieve this.
