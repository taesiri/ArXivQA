# [Sparse Attention with Linear Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07012)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question this paper aims to address is how to develop a sparse attention mechanism that is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and performs comparably to dense attention in terms of model accuracy. Specifically, the paper proposes a new attention mechanism called Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA) that replaces the softmax activation in standard attention with a ReLU activation. This results in automatic sparsity as the ReLU drops negative attention scores. The key research questions explored are:- Can simply replacing softmax with ReLU and adding normalization produce a working sparse attention mechanism for Transformer models? - How does ReLA compare to dense attention and other sparse attention methods like sparsemax in terms of model accuracy, training efficiency, inference speed, and induced sparsity?- Does the automatic sparsity from ReLA provide any benefits in terms of interpretability or model analysis compared to dense attention?The central hypothesis is that ReLA can achieve comparable accuracy to dense attention while being simpler and more efficient than other sparse attention methods. The experiments aim to validate whether this hypothesis holds across various machine translation tasks and model configurations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), a novel sparse attention mechanism that replaces the softmax activation in standard attention with a ReLU activation. This results in automatic sparsity without needing complex inference algorithms like prior sparse attention methods.- ReLA is shown to achieve comparable translation performance to strong baselines on five machine translation tasks, while having similar training and inference speed as standard softmax attention.- Analysis shows that ReLA induces sparse and diverse attention heads, with accuracy on word alignment that is better than prior sparse attention methods. - Uniquely, ReLA allows attention heads to assign a total attention of zero to some queries, leading to highly specialized heads. The paper shows this "null attention" can be indicative of translation quality.In summary, the key novelty is the simple but effective ReLU formulation for sparse attention, which gives both efficiency and interesting properties like null attention. ReLA seems to be an interpretable and efficient drop-in replacement for standard softmax attention.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), a novel sparse attention model that replaces the softmax activation in standard attention with a rectified linear unit, enabling automatic sparsity and flexibility without complex inference algorithms. Experiments on machine translation tasks show ReLA achieves comparable performance to strong baselines, with efficiency and interpretability benefits such as inducing high attention sparsity and head diversity, better alignment to source words, and allowing null attention to emerge to indicate translation quality.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in sparse attention mechanisms for neural networks:- The key contribution of this paper is proposing Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), which uses a ReLU activation instead of softmax to induce sparsity in attention weights. This is a simple but novel method for achieving sparse attention. - Compared to prior work on sparsifying softmax attention, such as sparsemax and entmax, ReLA is much more efficient as it does not require complex inference algorithms like sorting. The training and decoding speed of ReLA is on par with standard softmax attention.- ReLA allows attention weights to be exactly zero, enabling "null attention" where a head attends to nothing for certain queries. This provides greater flexibility compared to softmax-based methods. The emergence of null attention heads with specialized roles is an interesting finding.- The paper shows ReLA can be successfully applied to Transformer models for machine translation across various language pairs. The translation quality is comparable to strong baselines including softmax and entmax attention.- Analysis of attention weights shows ReLA induces high sparsity and head diversity. The cross-attention heads learn alignments that correspond better to word alignments than prior sparse methods.- Overall, ReLA seems to be a promising new approach for sparse attention that is simple, efficient, and flexible. The concept of null attention and emergent head specialization are notable findings compared to prior work. The results demonstrate ReLA's potential as a drop-in replacement for standard softmax attention.In summary, this paper introduces a novel method for sparse attention that is empirically shown to be efficient, high-performing, and able to induce interesting properties like null attention. The analysis provides new insights compared to prior work on sparsifying attention.
