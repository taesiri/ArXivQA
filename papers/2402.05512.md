# [GPTs Are Multilingual Annotators for Sequence Generation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05512)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Data annotation is essential for constructing datasets to train deep learning models, but the conventional crowdsourcing approach is expensive and time-consuming. It is more challenging for low-resource languages due to limited language pools of crowdworkers.

Proposed Solution:  
- This paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 as autonomous multilingual annotators to generate multiple silver sentence annotations from a single gold sentence annotated by a human.

- For image captioning, the LLM takes an English image caption and generates Korean translations + paraphrases. For text style transfer, it generates formal/informal sentence pairs in French/Portuguese/Italian from an English pair.

- This leverages the multilinguality, flexibility and few-shot learning capability of LLMs to reduce annotation cost. It is especially useful for low-resource languages.

Contributions:
- First work exploring LLMs as multilingual annotators for data augmentation and dataset creation.

- Proposed using GPT-4 as an automatic annotator for image captioning and text style transfer tasks.

- Showed GPT-generated captions improve downstream task performance over machine translation baselines while being more cost-efficient.

- Constructed image captioning datasets in Latvian, Estonian and Finnish using a single English caption per image to demonstrate practical benefits.

- Released annotation software and multilingual datasets to support future research.

In summary, this paper demonstrates that large language models can serve as effective automatic multilingual assistant annotators to reduce the cost and difficulty of dataset creation across diverse languages and tasks.
