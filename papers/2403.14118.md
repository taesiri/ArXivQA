# [From Handcrafted Features to LLMs: A Brief Survey for Machine   Translation Quality Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14118)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Machine Translation Quality Estimation (MTQE) is an important field that aims to evaluate the quality of machine-translated text without human references. However, there has not been a comprehensive review of this field covering key aspects like datasets, annotations methods, shared tasks, methodologies, challenges and future directions. 

Proposed Solution: This paper provides a thorough survey of the MTQE field. It summarizes commonly used datasets and categorizes annotation methods into Human Translation Error Rate (HTER), Direct Assessment (DA) and Multi-dimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). It introduces key shared tasks at word, sentence, document and explainable levels. The paper reviews MTQE methods, categorizing them into those using handcrafted features, deep learning (further divided into classic and with pre-trained LMs), and large language models. It also discusses current challenges and future research directions.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive overview of MTQE covering datasets, annotations, tasks and nearly all key methods, especially latest LLM-based ones
- Classification of methods into handcrafted, deep learning and LLM categories 
- In-depth exploration of representative methods in each category, elucidating connections 
- Discussion of 5 main challenges MTQE faces now 
- Suggestions for future work to address data scarcity, interpretability, standardized benchmarks etc.

In summary, this paper thoroughly surveys the MTQE landscape, documents the evolution of methods, examines current issues, and provides guidance for advancing research in this critical field of machine translation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper categorizes QE methods into three types: handcrafted features-based, deep learning-based, and LLM-based. Can you elaborate on the key differences between these three types of methods and the rationale behind this categorization? 

2. The paper further divides deep learning-based methods into classic deep learning approaches and those incorporating pre-trained LMs. What is the significance of making this distinction? What are the relative pros and cons of these two sub-types of deep learning methods?

3. The paper discusses five types of LLM-based QE methods - direct prediction, generative probabilities, pseudo data generation, foundation models, and retrieval-based. Can you provide a more in-depth explanation and comparison of these five approaches? What are their respective strengths and limitations? 

4. The GEMBA method directly predicts quality scores using LLMs. What prompt engineering strategies did the authors employ and why? What were the key findings regarding model scale in terms of performance?

5. Error Analysis Prompting (EAPrompt) combines CoT and EA to improve LLM performance for quality assessment. Can you explain this approach in greater technical detail? How exactly does it enhance prior methods?

6. INSTRUCTSCORE leverages GPT-4 to construct pseudo MQM-like data for training the LLaMA model. What is the step-by-step process here? What were the key results and why are they significant?

7. The paper identifies five major challenges for QE - data scarcity, interpretability, lack of word/doc-level methods, compute requirements, standardized benchmarks. Can you expand on why each one poses difficulties and how they might be mitigated? 

8. Considering the current state of QE, what do you see as the most promising research directions in the short term and long term? Where should focus and resources be concentrated?

9. How might findings from the wider field of LLMs and foundation models be transferred to advance QE capabilities? What types of innovations could emerge from this cross-pollination? 

10. Could you design a potential new LLM-based QE method that attempts to address some of the challenges outlined in the paper? Explain your approach and the rationale behind it.
