# [From Handcrafted Features to LLMs: A Brief Survey for Machine   Translation Quality Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14118)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Machine Translation Quality Estimation (MTQE) is an important field that aims to evaluate the quality of machine-translated text without human references. However, there has not been a comprehensive review of this field covering key aspects like datasets, annotations methods, shared tasks, methodologies, challenges and future directions. 

Proposed Solution: This paper provides a thorough survey of the MTQE field. It summarizes commonly used datasets and categorizes annotation methods into Human Translation Error Rate (HTER), Direct Assessment (DA) and Multi-dimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). It introduces key shared tasks at word, sentence, document and explainable levels. The paper reviews MTQE methods, categorizing them into those using handcrafted features, deep learning (further divided into classic and with pre-trained LMs), and large language models. It also discusses current challenges and future research directions.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive overview of MTQE covering datasets, annotations, tasks and nearly all key methods, especially latest LLM-based ones
- Classification of methods into handcrafted, deep learning and LLM categories 
- In-depth exploration of representative methods in each category, elucidating connections 
- Discussion of 5 main challenges MTQE faces now 
- Suggestions for future work to address data scarcity, interpretability, standardized benchmarks etc.

In summary, this paper thoroughly surveys the MTQE landscape, documents the evolution of methods, examines current issues, and provides guidance for advancing research in this critical field of machine translation.
