# [Robust automated calcification meshing for biomechanical cardiac digital   twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04998)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately meshing calcified regions within heart CT scans is challenging due to the complex geometry and need for anatomical consistency with surrounding tissue. 
- Existing meshing techniques like boolean operations or naive marching tetrahedra often fail or produce low quality elements.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes C-MAC, an automated pipeline to incorporate voxelgrid segmentations of calcifications into an existing heart tissue mesh.

Key Steps:
1) Use a 3D U-Net to segment calcified regions from the CT scan. Additional post-processing is done to improve anatomical consistency with the heart mesh.

2) Generate a background tetrahedral mesh constrained by the input heart surfaces. Initialize nodal SDF values from the segmentation. 

3) Optimize the background mesh topology and nodal SDF values with Deep Marching Tetrahedra (DMTet) to improve output quality.

4) Further simplify the mesh with constrained remeshing while preserving shared vertices between calcification and heart tissue.  

5) Robustly tetrahedralize the inner cavity formed by the calcification surfaces.

Main Contributions:
- C-MAC enables fully automated and robust meshing of complex calcified geometries for downstream simulations.
- It combines the benefits of both mesh boolean type operations and smooth deformable meshes to establish anatomical consistency while maintaining element quality.
- Demonstrated success on 35 test cases with 100% robust tetrahedralization and improved spatial accuracy over baselines.
- Showcased applicability on valve simulations and TAVR deployment highlighting effects of calcification on stress and strain.

In summary, C-MAC enables accurate and automated meshing of complex calcified cardiac geometries while ensuring compatibility with critical simulation tasks.
