# [An Endoscopic Chisel: Intraoperative Imaging Carves 3D Anatomical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11840)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Chronic sinusitis is a common condition treated with functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). FESS relies on preoperative CTs for navigation to complement endoscope imaging and understand complex nasal anatomy.
- However, FESS removes tissue so the preoperative CT loses correspondence with patient anatomy as surgery progresses, leading to inaccurate visualization and navigation.
- There is a need for solutions to visually represent anatomical changes during FESS to improve surgical guidance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a vision-based method to update the preoperative 3D anatomical model using intraoperative endoscopic video sequences and camera poses from navigation systems.
- They build a truncated signed distance function (TSDF) representation of the preop CT using rendered CT depths and camera poses.
- During surgery, they compare depth renders from the TSDF to monocular depth estimates from endoscopic video to identify modified anatomical regions.
- The new depth estimates are integrated into the TSDF representation at regions of change to update the 3D model.
- This allows sequential updates after each surgical step depicting anatomy modifications.

Main Contributions:
- First vision-based approach to update preoperative anatomical models for navigated FESS using only endoscopic video
- Method accounts for tissue removal through comparison of rendered and estimated depths to detect modifications
- Demonstrated sequential updating over 5 steps of a simulated FESS procedure
- Reduced errors between updated models and intraoperative CTs compared to no model update
- Proposed solution enhances navigation and paves way for endoscope-centered digital twin paradigm in FESS

In summary, the key novelty is using endoscopic video already available in FESS to update patient-specific anatomical models representing progressive surgical changes, with positive results that could improve guidance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a vision-based method to update a preoperative 3D anatomical model for sinus surgery by comparing depth renders from the model to estimated depths from intraoperative endoscopic video to identify modified regions and integrate the new depth values into a truncated signed distance function representation of the anatomy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a vision-based method to update the preoperative 3D anatomical model for navigated sinus surgery using intraoperative endoscopic video. Specifically, the paper leverages monocular depth estimation from endoscopic video along with camera pose information to identify regions of anatomical change compared to a preoperative model. It then integrates the updated depth information into a truncated signed distance function representation to generate an updated 3D model reflecting the tissue changes from surgery. This is posed as an alternative to relying solely on preoperative imaging, which does not capture the anatomical modifications that occur during surgery. The ability to continuously update the patient anatomical model during surgery could help provide surgeons with a more accurate understanding of the current state and improve surgical guidance.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

The paper presents a method to update a preoperative 3D model of the sinus anatomy using intraoperative endoscopic video to reflect the changes produced during functional endoscopic sinus surgery. It employs concepts like truncated signed distance functions, depth estimation, change detection, and volumetric fusion to integrate the visual information from the endoscope into the model. The goal is to provide more accurate guidance during sinus surgery through updated anatomical models, working towards a digital twin paradigm for this application.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions employing a learning-based monocular depth estimator that was fine-tuned on the preoperative sequence. What specific improvements could be made to this depth estimator to improve the accuracy of the updated model? Could other reconstruction methods like SfM or SLAM be explored?

2. The change detection step registers point clouds from consecutive steps using ICP with RANSAC. What other registration methods could be explored here? Could learning-based methods that are robust to partial overlaps be utilized? 

3. The paper currently uses the longest continuous endoscopic sequence with no tools to update the model. Could an approach that integrates information across multiple short glimpses of the anatomy between tool interactions be feasible? What challenges would this introduce?

4. The evaluation currently relies on manual registration between preoperative and intraoperative CTs. Could more robust automation or integration of intraoperative imaging like CBCT reduce potential alignment issues? How could this be achieved?

5. How could the weighting update rule be improved to better integrate new depth information while preserving reliable previous geometry? What assumptions need to be made about depth accuracy?

6. The method currently requires known camera poses from external tracking. How feasible would a tracking-free approach be using only endoscopic video input? What open challenges exist in endoscopic SLAM that need to be resolved?

7. What other modalities like subsurface scattering or multispectral imaging could provide additional intraoperative information to improve change detection and model updating? How would they need to be integrated into the framework?

8. How well would this approach generalize to other surgical sites like transporeneal pituitary surgery or skull base access? What anatomical factors affect the feasibility?

9. Could conditional adversarial networks that translate pre- to intra-operative images help identify surgical changes for model update without requiring depth estimation? What are the limitations?

10. How can the model visualization and rendering be enhanced to better convey updated anatomical changes to surgeons? What forms of visualization are most intuitive in the OR?
