# [An Endoscopic Chisel: Intraoperative Imaging Carves 3D Anatomical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11840)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Chronic sinusitis is a common condition treated with functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). FESS relies on preoperative CTs for navigation to complement endoscope imaging and understand complex nasal anatomy.
- However, FESS removes tissue so the preoperative CT loses correspondence with patient anatomy as surgery progresses, leading to inaccurate visualization and navigation.
- There is a need for solutions to visually represent anatomical changes during FESS to improve surgical guidance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a vision-based method to update the preoperative 3D anatomical model using intraoperative endoscopic video sequences and camera poses from navigation systems.
- They build a truncated signed distance function (TSDF) representation of the preop CT using rendered CT depths and camera poses.
- During surgery, they compare depth renders from the TSDF to monocular depth estimates from endoscopic video to identify modified anatomical regions.
- The new depth estimates are integrated into the TSDF representation at regions of change to update the 3D model.
- This allows sequential updates after each surgical step depicting anatomy modifications.

Main Contributions:
- First vision-based approach to update preoperative anatomical models for navigated FESS using only endoscopic video
- Method accounts for tissue removal through comparison of rendered and estimated depths to detect modifications
- Demonstrated sequential updating over 5 steps of a simulated FESS procedure
- Reduced errors between updated models and intraoperative CTs compared to no model update
- Proposed solution enhances navigation and paves way for endoscope-centered digital twin paradigm in FESS

In summary, the key novelty is using endoscopic video already available in FESS to update patient-specific anatomical models representing progressive surgical changes, with positive results that could improve guidance.
