# [Differentiable Mapper For Topological Optimization Of Data   Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12854)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The Mapper graph is an important tool in Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for data visualization and representation. However, it is very sensitive to its parameters, especially the filter function. Currently, there is no method to automatically tune the filter function, requiring tedious manual tuning. This limits the applicability of Mapper graphs. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new construction called "Soft Mapper", which is a probability distribution over Mapper graphs. This allows defining topological losses and risks that can be optimized with respect to the filter function. Specifically:

1. The authors introduce the notion of "cover assignment schemes", which are probability distributions over binary assignments indicating cluster membership. This generalizes the standard Mapper construction. 

2. Based on this, they define the Soft Mapper as a pushforward measure of the cover assignment scheme through the Mapper complex generating function. This produces a distribution over Mapper graphs.

3. They then define topological losses using persistent homology on Mapper graphs, as well as the risk associated with a Soft Mapper distribution. 

4. For a parameterized family of filters, they show the loss function is smooth under reasonable assumptions, allowing gradient-based optimization.


Main Contributions:

- Introduction of Soft Mapper, a distributional relaxation of Mapper graphs

- Definition of topological risks for Soft Mapper distributions based on persistent homology

- A filter optimization framework for Mapper graphs with convergence guarantees

- Demonstration of filter optimization on 3D point clouds and single-cell RNA sequencing data


The proposed framework allows automatic optimization of Mapper graphs by tuning the filter function. This improves applicability and avoids costly manual tuning. Optimization is shown to produce superior Mapper representations on real data compared to arbitrary choices.
