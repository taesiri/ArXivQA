# [Extracting Class Activation Maps from Non-Discriminative Features as   well](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10334)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we extract class activation maps (CAMs) that cover the complete objects, including both discriminative and non-discriminative features, from classification models trained only with image-level labels?

The key points are:

- Standard CAMs extracted from classification models often focus only on discriminative parts of objects (e.g. heads of animals), missing non-discriminative but important parts (e.g. bodies and legs). 

- The authors propose a method called LPCAM to extract CAMs that cover entire objects by leveraging both discriminative and non-discriminative features.

- LPCAM clusters the local features from all spatial locations into prototypes representing local visual semantics (e.g. heads, legs). It then aggregates spatial similarity maps between these prototypes and image features to generate the CAM.

- Experiments show LPCAM improves CAMs in multiple weak supervision segmentation methods on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets.

In summary, the paper introduces LPCAM to generate more complete CAMs by using both discriminative and non-discriminative features, instead of only relying on discriminative classifier weights like standard CAM methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel method called LPCAM (Local Prototype CAM) to generate class activation maps (CAMs) with better coverage on foreground objects in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). The key ideas are:

1. Using clustering to derive class-specific local prototypes that capture both discriminative and non-discriminative visual patterns of the class. This avoids the bias of original CAM which relies on classifier weights that only focus on discriminative parts. 

2. Sliding prototypes over the conv feature map to generate similarity maps, and aggregating them to get the final CAM. This allows preserving non-discriminative regions during normalization.

3. Additional use of negative context prototypes to suppress false positive regions.

The method is evaluated by plugging into multiple state-of-the-art WSSS pipelines, and shows consistent improvements on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. So the main contribution is proposing a better way to compute CAMs that leverages both discriminative and non-discriminative features, through the use of class-specific local prototypes.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation:

- The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method (LPCAM) to generate better class activation maps by capturing both discriminative and non-discriminative features. This is a novel approach compared to prior work like adversarial erasing or refinement methods. 

- Most prior work focuses on either better seed generation or mask refinement. This paper tackles seed generation. The proposed LPCAM can be plugged into various mask refinement methods like IRN, EDAM, etc. to further boost performance. So it is complementary to refinement techniques.

- Compared to other seed generation methods, LPCAM has the advantage of not requiring re-training or modifications to the classification model. Methods like adversarial erasing require iteratively re-training the model. LPCAM simply clusters the features from a trained model to derive prototypes.

- The experiments demonstrate consistent improvements by plugging LPCAM into state-of-the-art WSSS pipelines like IRN, EDAM, AMN on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets. The gains over prior art are not huge but consistent. 

- The approach is well-motivated by analyzing issues with conventional CAMs only capturing discriminative features. The ablation studies provide insights on the impact of using class vs context prototypes.

- The method does have limitations like potentially expanding to confusing background contexts that co-occur with objects, as shown in a failure case example.

In summary, LPCAM offers a simple but effective way to improve CAMs for WSSS by capturing non-discriminative features without re-training. The consistent gains across methods and datasets demonstrate its usefulness as a plug-in module.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Expanding LPCAM to video datasets for weakly-supervised video semantic segmentation. The authors mention that extending LPCAM to the video domain could be an interesting direction.

- Exploring different ways to model context and remove false positive pixels caused by confusing contexts. The authors point out a limitation of their current context modeling, where strongly co-occurring contexts like "railroad" for "train" can sometimes be incorrectly preserved instead of removed. More advanced context modeling could help address this issue.

- Applying LPCAM in other weakly-supervised learning tasks beyond semantic segmentation, such as object detection, instance segmentation, etc. The authors suggest LPCAM could be a generic substitute for CAM in other CAM-based weakly-supervised methods.

- Evaluating LPCAM when combined with other state-of-the-art techniques for discovering non-discriminative regions, such as adversarial erasing. The authors mention LPCAM is orthogonal to many existing methods.

- Developing prototypes that are class-specific instead of shared across classes. The authors use shared prototypes currently but suggest class-specific ones could be more beneficial.

- Exploring the effect of using different numbers of prototypes for different classes. Currently the same number of prototypes are used for all classes but tuning this hyperparameter in a class-aware manner could be explored.

In summary, the main future directions pointed out are improving the context modeling, applying LPCAM to new tasks and datasets, and further enhancements to the prototype learning and selection process. The core LPCAM idea seems promising to be extended in many ways.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Local Prototype CAM (LPCAM) to generate better class activation maps (CAMs) for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). The key idea is that conventional CAM only highlights discriminative object regions while missing many non-discriminative parts, leading to poor coverage of foreground objects. To overcome this, LPCAM leverages both discriminative and non-discriminative features by clustering the local features on training images into prototypical parts like "head" and "leg". Specifically, it omits global average pooling when extracting CAM so that non-discriminative features are preserved. Then it matches input image features to these prototypes to generate class-specific similarity maps which are aggregated into the final CAM. This allows LPCAM to cover more complete objects compared to CAM. The authors show LPCAM's effectiveness by plugging it into various WSSS methods like IRN, AMN, MCTformer and EDAM, where it consistently improves segmentation performance on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. Overall, LPCAM is a simple but effective technique to generate better CAMs by utilizing both discriminative and non-discriminative local prototypes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Local Prototype Class Activation Map (LPCAM) to generate better class activation maps (CAMs) for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). The key idea is that conventional CAMs only capture discriminative object regions while missing non-discriminative regions, leading to poor coverage of foreground objects. To address this, LPCAM leverages both discriminative and non-discriminative features by clustering the local features on training images into class prototypes and context prototypes. Each prototype represents a visual pattern like "head" or "leg" of an object class. To generate CAM for a new image, the prototypes are compared to the image's feature map to produce similarity maps highlighting regions matching each prototype. These are aggregated into the final LPCAM, capturing all class-related patterns. 

Experiments validate that LPCAM improves CAM coverage and performance when plugged into WSSS methods like IRN, AMN, EDAM and MCTformer on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets. For example, on VOC it achieves 70.1% mIoU with AMN, outperforming prior arts. Analyses show LPCAM is robust to hyperparameters and generates better quality seed masks. Overall, LPCAM provides a simple and effective way to leverage non-discriminative features in CAM computation through clustered prototypes, consistently improving WSSS performance.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new method called Local Prototype CAM (LPCAM) to improve the localization quality of class activation maps (CAMs) for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. The key idea is to leverage both discriminative and non-discriminative local features to generate CAMs with better object coverage. Specifically, the authors omit the global average pooling layer in the classification model and cluster the local features into class prototypes and context prototypes. To generate the CAM, they compute similarity maps between the input image features and each prototype, and aggregate them while subtracting the context similarity maps. This allows capturing non-discriminative object regions that are often missed by CAMs. The method is evaluated by plugging into various weakly supervised segmentation methods, and shows consistent improvements on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. The main contribution is a simple and effective way to expand CAMs to cover complete objects instead of just discriminative parts.
