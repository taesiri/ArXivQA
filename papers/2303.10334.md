# [Extracting Class Activation Maps from Non-Discriminative Features as   well](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10334)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we extract class activation maps (CAMs) that cover the complete objects, including both discriminative and non-discriminative features, from classification models trained only with image-level labels?

The key points are:

- Standard CAMs extracted from classification models often focus only on discriminative parts of objects (e.g. heads of animals), missing non-discriminative but important parts (e.g. bodies and legs). 

- The authors propose a method called LPCAM to extract CAMs that cover entire objects by leveraging both discriminative and non-discriminative features.

- LPCAM clusters the local features from all spatial locations into prototypes representing local visual semantics (e.g. heads, legs). It then aggregates spatial similarity maps between these prototypes and image features to generate the CAM.

- Experiments show LPCAM improves CAMs in multiple weak supervision segmentation methods on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets.

In summary, the paper introduces LPCAM to generate more complete CAMs by using both discriminative and non-discriminative features, instead of only relying on discriminative classifier weights like standard CAM methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel method called LPCAM (Local Prototype CAM) to generate class activation maps (CAMs) with better coverage on foreground objects in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). The key ideas are:

1. Using clustering to derive class-specific local prototypes that capture both discriminative and non-discriminative visual patterns of the class. This avoids the bias of original CAM which relies on classifier weights that only focus on discriminative parts. 

2. Sliding prototypes over the conv feature map to generate similarity maps, and aggregating them to get the final CAM. This allows preserving non-discriminative regions during normalization.

3. Additional use of negative context prototypes to suppress false positive regions.

The method is evaluated by plugging into multiple state-of-the-art WSSS pipelines, and shows consistent improvements on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. So the main contribution is proposing a better way to compute CAMs that leverages both discriminative and non-discriminative features, through the use of class-specific local prototypes.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called LPCAM to generate better class activation maps for weakly supervised semantic segmentation by using clustered local prototypes that capture both discriminative and non-discriminative features of objects.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation:

- The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method (LPCAM) to generate better class activation maps by capturing both discriminative and non-discriminative features. This is a novel approach compared to prior work like adversarial erasing or refinement methods. 

- Most prior work focuses on either better seed generation or mask refinement. This paper tackles seed generation. The proposed LPCAM can be plugged into various mask refinement methods like IRN, EDAM, etc. to further boost performance. So it is complementary to refinement techniques.

- Compared to other seed generation methods, LPCAM has the advantage of not requiring re-training or modifications to the classification model. Methods like adversarial erasing require iteratively re-training the model. LPCAM simply clusters the features from a trained model to derive prototypes.

- The experiments demonstrate consistent improvements by plugging LPCAM into state-of-the-art WSSS pipelines like IRN, EDAM, AMN on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets. The gains over prior art are not huge but consistent. 

- The approach is well-motivated by analyzing issues with conventional CAMs only capturing discriminative features. The ablation studies provide insights on the impact of using class vs context prototypes.

- The method does have limitations like potentially expanding to confusing background contexts that co-occur with objects, as shown in a failure case example.

In summary, LPCAM offers a simple but effective way to improve CAMs for WSSS by capturing non-discriminative features without re-training. The consistent gains across methods and datasets demonstrate its usefulness as a plug-in module.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Expanding LPCAM to video datasets for weakly-supervised video semantic segmentation. The authors mention that extending LPCAM to the video domain could be an interesting direction.

- Exploring different ways to model context and remove false positive pixels caused by confusing contexts. The authors point out a limitation of their current context modeling, where strongly co-occurring contexts like "railroad" for "train" can sometimes be incorrectly preserved instead of removed. More advanced context modeling could help address this issue.

- Applying LPCAM in other weakly-supervised learning tasks beyond semantic segmentation, such as object detection, instance segmentation, etc. The authors suggest LPCAM could be a generic substitute for CAM in other CAM-based weakly-supervised methods.

- Evaluating LPCAM when combined with other state-of-the-art techniques for discovering non-discriminative regions, such as adversarial erasing. The authors mention LPCAM is orthogonal to many existing methods.

- Developing prototypes that are class-specific instead of shared across classes. The authors use shared prototypes currently but suggest class-specific ones could be more beneficial.

- Exploring the effect of using different numbers of prototypes for different classes. Currently the same number of prototypes are used for all classes but tuning this hyperparameter in a class-aware manner could be explored.

In summary, the main future directions pointed out are improving the context modeling, applying LPCAM to new tasks and datasets, and further enhancements to the prototype learning and selection process. The core LPCAM idea seems promising to be extended in many ways.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Local Prototype CAM (LPCAM) to generate better class activation maps (CAMs) for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). The key idea is that conventional CAM only highlights discriminative object regions while missing many non-discriminative parts, leading to poor coverage of foreground objects. To overcome this, LPCAM leverages both discriminative and non-discriminative features by clustering the local features on training images into prototypical parts like "head" and "leg". Specifically, it omits global average pooling when extracting CAM so that non-discriminative features are preserved. Then it matches input image features to these prototypes to generate class-specific similarity maps which are aggregated into the final CAM. This allows LPCAM to cover more complete objects compared to CAM. The authors show LPCAM's effectiveness by plugging it into various WSSS methods like IRN, AMN, MCTformer and EDAM, where it consistently improves segmentation performance on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. Overall, LPCAM is a simple but effective technique to generate better CAMs by utilizing both discriminative and non-discriminative local prototypes.

The key idea is that conventional CAMs only capture discriminative object regions while missing non-discriminative regions, leading to poor coverage of foreground objects. To address this, LPCAM leverages both discriminative and non-discriminative features by clustering the local features on training images into class prototypes and context prototypes.

To generate CAM for a new image, the prototypes are compared to the image's feature map to produce similarity maps highlighting regions matching each prototype. These are aggregated into the final LPCAM, capturing all class-related patterns. 

Experiments validate that LPCAM improves CAM coverage and performance when plugged into WSSS methods like IRN, AMN, EDAM and MCTformer on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets. For example, on VOC it achieves 70.1% mIoU with AMN, outperforming prior arts. Analyses show LPCAM is robust to hyperparameters and generates better quality seed masks. Overall, LPCAM provides a simple and effective way to leverage non-discriminative features in CAM computation through clustered prototypes, consistently improving WSSS performance.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new method called Local Prototype CAM (LPCAM) to improve the localization quality of class activation maps (CAMs) for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. The key idea is to leverage both discriminative and non-discriminative local features to generate CAMs with better object coverage. Specifically, the authors omit the global average pooling layer in the classification model and cluster the local features into class prototypes and context prototypes. To generate the CAM, they compute similarity maps between the input image features and each prototype, and aggregate them while subtracting the context similarity maps. This allows capturing non-discriminative object regions that are often missed by CAMs. The method is evaluated by plugging into various weakly supervised segmentation methods, and shows consistent improvements on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. The main contribution is a simple and effective way to expand CAMs to cover complete objects instead of just discriminative parts.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of poor coverage of class activation maps (CAMs) extracted from classification models for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). The key points are:

- CAMs tend to only highlight the most discriminative parts of objects (e.g. just the head of a sheep), while missing other non-discriminative but important parts (e.g. body, legs of the sheep). 

- This is because the classifier weights used to compute CAMs are biased towards capturing only discriminative features that help distinguish between classes.

- To address this, the paper proposes a new method called Local Prototype CAM (LPCAM) to compute CAMs using local prototypes that represent both discriminative and non-discriminative parts of an object class.

- LPCAM clusters local features from all spatial locations in the training images of a class into class prototypes and context prototypes. These are then used to generate activation maps that cover more complete objects.

- Experiments show LPCAM improves CAMs and subsequent semantic segmentation across multiple WSSS methods and datasets. The key advantage is capturing non-discriminative parts missed by regular CAMs.

In summary, the paper tackles the poor localization ability of CAMs by using local prototypes to generate activation maps that have better coverage of complete objects, not just the most discriminative parts. This improves weakly supervised semantic segmentation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords are:

- Class activation maps (CAM): The paper focuses on improving CAM, which is a technique to visualize the discriminative image regions used by a CNN to identify a class. 

- Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS): The paper aims to improve CAM for the task of weakly supervised semantic segmentation, where only image-level labels are available for training.

- Local prototypes: The paper proposes using local prototypes, obtained by clustering convolutional features, to compute CAM instead of the classifier weights. This captures both discriminative and non-discriminative regions.

- Discriminative vs non-discriminative features: The key insight is that classifier weights for CAM focus only on discriminative features and neglect non-discriminative object regions. The local prototypes help capture both types of features.

- Context features: In addition to class prototypes, the paper also uses context prototypes to suppress false positive regions correlated with background. 

- Generality: The improved CAM called LPCAM is evaluated by plugging it into various WSSS methods to highlight its general applicability.

- PASCAL VOC, MS COCO: Popular semantic segmentation benchmarks used for evaluation.

In summary, the key terms revolve around improving CAM for weakly supervised segmentation using local prototypes and context features to overcome the limitation of only capturing discriminative object regions.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Local Prototype Class Activation Map (LPCAM) to improve the coverage of CAMs in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). The core idea is to leverage both discriminative and non-discriminative local features of an object class when generating the CAM, in order to activate more complete object regions rather than just the most discriminative parts (e.g. only activating the 'head' region for 'cow'). To achieve this, the authors omit the global average pooling layer from the classification network, cluster the local features from the last convolutional layer into class-specific prototypes, and generate the CAM by calculating similarities between the prototypes and local features of a new image. Each prototype matches different local patterns like 'head', 'leg', etc. Extensive experiments show that simply replacing the original CAM with LPCAM consistently boosts the performance of various WSSS methods across PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. The improvements come with negligible extra computation. LPCAM is demonstrated to be effective yet highly generic and plug-and-play.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Local Prototype CAM (LPCAM) to generate class activation maps (CAMs) with better coverage on foreground objects compared to standard CAMs. The key insight is that standard CAMs, which are extracted from discriminative classifiers, focus only on the most discriminative object regions and miss non-discriminative but salient object parts. To address this, LPCAM clusters the local features on the convolutional feature maps into a set of class prototypes and context prototypes. Each prototype represents a visual pattern related to a local semantic concept like "head" or "leg" of an object class. To generate the CAM, these prototypes are compared to the local features at each spatial location to produce similarity maps highlighting regions containing similar semantics. The class prototype maps are aggregated to capture all discriminative and non-discriminative parts, while the context prototype maps are subtracted to suppress background. Experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO show LPCAM's CAMs lead to improved localization maps and higher segmentation accuracy when used in weakly supervised semantic segmentation pipelines.
