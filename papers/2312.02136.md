# [BerfScene: Bev-conditioned Equivariant Radiance Fields for Infinite 3D   Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02136)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes BerfScene, a method for generating large-scale, even infinite, 3D scenes. It represents scenes using an equivariant radiance field conditioned on 2D bird's-eye view (BEV) maps, which provide efficient spatial layout guidance. To enable scaling up, the model is designed to be equivariant to transformations of the BEV input, using techniques like wider padding and anti-aliasing. This allows splitting a scene into local pieces, generating each one independently with consistency, then stitching together for arbitrary scale. Experiments on datasets like CLEVR, 3D-Front and Carla demonstrate state-of-the-art scene generation quality and flexibility. Both quantitative metrics and visual results of infinite scenes show advantages over other generative models. The BEV conditioning also enables intuitive scene editing operations like object rearrangement, insertion and deletion. Limitations remain in precise attribute control and dynamic scenes, but the proposed representation helps advance controllable large-scale generative 3D scene modeling.
