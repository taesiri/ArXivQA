# [Predict and Interpret Health Risk using EHR through Typical Patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10977)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Predicting health risks from electronic health records (EHR) is an important problem, but deep learning models struggle with patients that have few visits or sparse records. These models learn insufficient representations and perform poorly on such patients.  

Solution - Progressive Prototypical Network (PPN):
The key idea is to select typical patients as "prototypes" and utilize their information to enhance representation of a given patient. This is inspired by how doctors compare patients to previous cases.

PPN has four main components:
1) Multi-channel feature extraction: Extracts features from longitudinal records and static data.  
2) Progressive prototype memory: Selects and stores typical patients as prototypes by clustering. It reclusters prototypes progressively while training to maintain diversity.
3) Prototypical feature integration: Computes similarity between prototypes and the patient. Then incorporates prototype information into the patient's representation.
4) Health risk prediction: Predicts risk using the integrated patient-prototype representation.

Key contributions:
1) A progressive selection and two separation losses to obtain diverse and meaningful prototypes. 
2) A prototypical feature integration method to incorporate prototype information into patient representation.
3) Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 3 datasets, especially for patients with sparse histories.  
4) An interactive application to visualize and interpret predictions.

Overall, PPN advances state-of-the-art in risk prediction from EHR by an innovative prototype-based approach. The interpretability and robustness to sparse data are key strengths.
