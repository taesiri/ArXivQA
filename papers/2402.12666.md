# [Pre-trained Transformer-Enabled Strategies with Human-Guided Fine-Tuning   for End-to-end Navigation of Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12666)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Current autonomous driving (AD) systems face challenges like low data efficiency, training complexity, and poor generalization ability. End-to-end learning methods that integrate perception, decision-making and control into a single model have emerged as a promising approach. However, existing end-to-end methods have limitations in effectively addressing the aforementioned challenges.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel end-to-end AD training framework called PTA-RLHG. It has two main components:

1. Pre-trained Transformer-enabled Actor (PTA): A policy network with a Transformer module is pre-trained using behavior cloning on human driving data. This allows the model to learn general representations and obtain reasonable parameter initialization before task-specific training.

2. Reinforcement Learning with Human Guidance (RLHG): Further fine-tuning of the pre-trained policy using RL methods while leveraging real-time human guidance through supervision, intervention, demonstrations and reward feedback. This helps adapt the model to specific driving tasks efficiently.

Main Contributions:

1. Integrating a Transformer module in the actor network and pre-training through behavior cloning enhances context understanding for driving tasks.

2. Fine-tuning with RLHG allows the model to systematically optimize its policy via human interactions, acquiring more precise and safe driving behaviors.

3. Evaluated on highway overtaking and unprotected left turns in simulation, the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in addressing challenging AD tasks, showcasing superiority in sample efficiency, safety and reliability.

4. The Transformer integration and human-guided fine-tuning offers valuable insights and techniques for AD research and applications.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative end-to-end AD training framework utilizing Transformer and human guidance. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing adaptability, data efficiency and performance for autonomous driving systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel end-to-end autonomous driving training framework integrating a Transformer module into the policy network for behavior cloning pre-training and then fine-tuning it using reinforcement learning with human guidance for sample efficiency and performance improvements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. Integrating the Transformer architecture into the actor network of reinforcement learning, coupled with pre-training through behavior cloning, enhances the model's representation ability for driving tasks by advancing context understanding. 

2. Fine-tuning with reinforcement learning with human guidance (RLHG), following the pre-trained Transformer-enabled actor (PTA) network, allows the model to systematically optimize its driving strategy through human supervision, intervention, demonstration, and reward feedback.

3. In simulated highway and urban driving scenarios, the proposed approach clearly outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and imitation learning baseline methods in addressing challenging autonomous driving tasks comprehensively.

So in summary, the key innovations are using a Transformer-based actor network with pre-training, and then fine-tuning it with human guidance through RLHG. This combined approach leads to significant improvements in learning efficiency, safety, robustness and overall autonomous driving performance.
