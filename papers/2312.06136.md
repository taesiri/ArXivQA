# [BACTrack: Building Appearance Collection for Aerial Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06136)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents BACTrack, a lightweight aerial tracking framework for building a dynamic collection of target appearance templates to enhance tracking robustness. A key innovation is the Mixed-Temporal Transformer (MTT) module for efficiently fusing features from multiple templates using a novel mixed-temporal attention mechanism. This allows parallel matching between the search region and various historical target representations. An adaptive appearance discriminator is also introduced to ensure the reliability and diversity of collected templates, enabling adaptation to complex appearance changes. Comprehensive experiments on four aerial tracking benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for BACTrack, with an impressive speed of 87 FPS on a GPU. Additional tests show practical deployability on UAV platforms. The main contributions include the novel MTT architecture for multi-template fusion, the adaptive template update strategy, and the overall tracking framework for constructing a target appearance collection to effectively perceive appearance variations in aerial scenarios.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking faces unique challenges compared to conventional tracking, including rapid camera motion, viewpoint changes, blurring, and limited on-board computation power. Existing Siamese trackers rely solely on template matching between the initial frame and current frame, failing to handle complex appearance changes over long sequences. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes BACTrack, a lightweight aerial tracking framework that builds an adaptive collection of target appearance templates to enhance robustness. The key components are:

1) Mixed-Temporal Transformer (MTT): Performs efficient multi-template feature fusion using a novel mixed-temporal attention mechanism. It builds relationships between multiple historical template features and the current search feature in parallel.

2) Appearance Discriminator (AD): Employs an adaptive online strategy to update the template collection, ensuring reliability (via confidence thresholding) and diversity (via structural similarity indexing). This allows the stored templates to closely follow changes in the target's appearance.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes a MTT module that consolidates multi-frame feature integration into a single attention layer for efficiency. This is achieved by introducing mixed-temporal attention to group attention heads.

2) Presents an AD module equipped with a template update strategy to build a reliable and diverse collection of target appearance templates over time.

3) Introduces BACTrack, an aerial tracking framework that constructs a historical collection of target appearances to significantly enhance robustness against appearance changes.

Results:
Extensive experiments on four UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for BACTrack. It achieves an average success rate of 59.9% and precision of 80.1% while running at 87 FPS on a single GPU, showing an ideal balance of accuracy and efficiency.
