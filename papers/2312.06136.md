## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents BACTrack, a lightweight aerial tracking framework for building a dynamic collection of target appearance templates to enhance tracking robustness. A key innovation is the Mixed-Temporal Transformer (MTT) module for efficiently fusing features from multiple templates using a novel mixed-temporal attention mechanism. This allows parallel matching between the search region and various historical target representations. An adaptive appearance discriminator is also introduced to ensure the reliability and diversity of collected templates, enabling adaptation to complex appearance changes. Comprehensive experiments on four aerial tracking benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for BACTrack, with an impressive speed of 87 FPS on a GPU. Additional tests show practical deployability on UAV platforms. The main contributions include the novel MTT architecture for multi-template fusion, the adaptive template update strategy, and the overall tracking framework for constructing a target appearance collection to effectively perceive appearance variations in aerial scenarios.
