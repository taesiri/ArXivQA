# [From Chain to Tree: Refining Chain-like Rules into Tree-like Rules on   Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05130)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing works on rule induction primarily focus on learning chain-like rules, which have limited semantic expressiveness and reasoning accuracy. 
- Chain-like rules often fire on incorrect grounding values, producing inaccurate or even erroneous reasoning results.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper proposes the concept of tree-like rules to expand the scope and improve the reasoning ability of rules. 
- Tree-like rules contain additional branch atoms to provide more constraints on the grounding values compared to chain-like rules.
- An effective framework is proposed to refine chain-like rules into high-quality tree-like rules by searching and adding the best branch atoms.
   - Transform the optimization problem into best branch atom selection.
   - Propose a 3-step pipeline: Forward Reasoning, Backward Reasoning and Candidate Atom Selection to find the best branches.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the concept of tree-like rules and an effective framework to refine chain-like rules into tree-like rules.
- Experiments on 4 datasets show the refined tree-like rules consistently outperform original chain-like rules on link prediction, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.
- The concept of tree-like rules expands the scope and improves the reasoning ability of symbolic rule-based methods.

In summary, this paper tackles the limited expressiveness and inaccuracy of chain-like rules by proposing tree-like rules and an effective refinement framework. Experiments verify tree-like rules achieve superior reasoning performance.
