# [Rethinking Loss Design for Large-scale 3D Shape Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.0546)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn more discriminative shape representations for 3D shape retrieval. Specifically, the paper proposes a new loss function called Collaborative Inner Product Loss (CIP Loss) to optimize the learned shape embeddings to be more discriminative between categories and more compact within each category. The key ideas are:- Use inner product instead of Euclidean distance to provide more explicit geometric constraints on the embedding space. Encourage features from the same class to have large inner product (clustered) while features from different classes have small/negative inner product (orthogonal). - The CIP Loss has two components:  - Cluster Loss - pulls features from the same class to be clustered along a "centerline".  - Ortho Loss - pushes features from different classes to be orthogonal.- Compared to previous metric learning losses like triplet loss, center loss etc., CIP Loss has simpler implementation without needing margins or normalization, and provides better geometric interpretation. - CIP Loss can be combined with other standard losses like softmax and improves performance over using those alone.The central hypothesis is that CIP Loss can learn more discriminative shape embeddings compared to prior losses, thereby improving retrieval accuracy on 3D shape datasets. Experiments on ModelNet and ShapeNet datasets validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new loss function called Collaborative Inner Product Loss (CIP Loss) for improving 3D shape retrieval. The key points are:- CIP Loss uses inner product to impose geometric constraints on the learned shape embeddings, making features from the same class cluster together while features from different classes become orthogonal. This makes the embeddings more discriminative. - CIP Loss has two components - Cluster Loss and Ortho Loss. Cluster Loss reduces intra-class distances by clustering same-class features together. Ortho Loss increases inter-class margins by making features from different classes orthogonal. - CIP Loss is simple to implement without any normalization or margin parameters. It can be combined with other common losses like softmax and center loss.- Experiments on ModelNet and ShapeNetCore55 datasets show state-of-the-art retrieval results using CIP Loss, demonstrating its effectiveness.In summary, the main contribution is proposing CIP Loss, a novel inner product based loss function, to learn more discriminative embeddings for 3D shape retrieval. Its simplicity, interpretability and performance improvements are the key strengths.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new loss function called Collaborative Inner Product Loss (CIP Loss) to learn more discriminative shape representations for 3D shape retrieval, where it enforces features of the same class to cluster together while features of different classes to be orthogonal.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in 3D shape retrieval:- It focuses on improving the loss function used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for 3D shape retrieval. Many recent papers have explored different CNN architectures and training techniques, but relatively little work has focused just on innovating the loss function.- It proposes a novel loss called Collaborative Inner Product (CIP) Loss that has two components - a Cluster loss to reduce intra-class distances, and an Ortho loss to increase inter-class margins. The key novelty is using inner products to impose these geometric constraints. - Most prior work uses loss functions based on Euclidean distances, like contrastive loss, triplet loss, and center loss. A few recent papers use cosine similarity, but CIP Loss is different in using inner products directly without any normalization.- Experiments show CIP Loss alone outperforms softmax loss and achieves state-of-the-art results on ModelNet and ShapeNet when combined with softmax or center loss. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed geometric constraints.- A limitation is that the improvements over some recent methods like triplet-center loss are incremental. The concepts are novel but more work may be needed to show substantial gains over the state-of-the-art.In summary, this paper makes a nice contribution in innovating the loss function for 3D retrieval using some simple but new ideas based on inner products. The results are promising but not yet paradigm-shifting. Overall it provides a solid incremental improvement over prior art.
