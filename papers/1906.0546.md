# [Rethinking Loss Design for Large-scale 3D Shape Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.0546)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn more discriminative shape representations for 3D shape retrieval. Specifically, the paper proposes a new loss function called Collaborative Inner Product Loss (CIP Loss) to optimize the learned shape embeddings to be more discriminative between categories and more compact within each category. The key ideas are:- Use inner product instead of Euclidean distance to provide more explicit geometric constraints on the embedding space. Encourage features from the same class to have large inner product (clustered) while features from different classes have small/negative inner product (orthogonal). - The CIP Loss has two components:  - Cluster Loss - pulls features from the same class to be clustered along a "centerline".  - Ortho Loss - pushes features from different classes to be orthogonal.- Compared to previous metric learning losses like triplet loss, center loss etc., CIP Loss has simpler implementation without needing margins or normalization, and provides better geometric interpretation. - CIP Loss can be combined with other standard losses like softmax and improves performance over using those alone.The central hypothesis is that CIP Loss can learn more discriminative shape embeddings compared to prior losses, thereby improving retrieval accuracy on 3D shape datasets. Experiments on ModelNet and ShapeNet datasets validate this hypothesis.
