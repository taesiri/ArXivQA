# [Large Language Model for Table Processing: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05121)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Large Language Model for Table Processing: A Survey":

Problem:
Tables store large amounts of structured data and are ubiquitous in databases, spreadsheets, and on the web. Automating tasks involving tables like querying, fact checking, summarization, and manipulation using large language models (LLMs) can benefit many people. However, tables have unique properties like being 2D, relying heavily on schema, and being robust to row/column swapping, which poses challenges for LLMs primarily pre-trained on plain text. Early methods using small LMs are limited to tasks like QA and fact verification.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper provides an extensive survey of table tasks, benchmarks, and LLM-based methods. It categorizes methods into training-based (task-specific fine-tuning, instruction tuning, retrieval augmented), prompting-based (table serialization, few-shot example selection), and agent-based (task decomposition, action definition, reflection). It highlights recent paradigms leveraging LLMs including instruction tuning datasets for "table foundations models", prompting techniques utilizing reasoning skills, and agent approaches combining planning with external tools.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive coverage of table tasks ranging from traditional QA to new areas like manipulation and advanced analysis 
- Taxonomy of LLM methods based on training vs prompting and use of agents
- Overview of new benchmarks assessing robustness, incorporating human evaluation, with larger scale
- Identification of limitations around transferability, computational costs, privacy, and complexity of current methods
- Discussion of potential solutions via private deployment of instruction-tuned models and simplified prompting/agent techniques, and need for real-world table benchmarks

The paper provides an extensive review of an important area at the intersection of tables and LLMs, methodically analyzes the landscape, and offers insights into open challenges and promising directions. Its comprehensive analysis can inform both research and applied efforts around automating table-centric tasks using AI.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper categorizes methods into training-based and prompting-based. Can you elaborate on the key differences between these two types of methods and when one might be preferred over the other?

2. The paper discusses instruction tuning as a way to train tabular language models. What are some of the challenges in constructing high-quality instruction tuning datasets? How might the quality of the datasets impact model performance? 

3. Retrieval augmented methods are mentioned which combine a retriever and reader component. What are potential limitations of these types of two-stage pipelines? Could end-to-end learned methods be more effective?

4. For prompting based methods, the paper talks about table serialization and formatting the table appropriately for the LLM. What are some of the key considerations in choosing the right table representation? How sensitive are results to these formatting choices?

5. The paper proposes ways to select good few-shot examples when prompting the LLM. Beyond similarity and diversity of examples, what other criteria could be important for picking the most informative examples? 

6. For agent based methods, the paper discusses task decomposition strategies. What are some challenges in effectively breaking down tasks and defining the right subtasks? How can we evaluate if a decomposition is optimal?

7. What are some of the considerations in defining the action space for an LLM powered agent? What governs the level of abstraction chosen for actions?

8. The paper talks about reflecting upon and revising past actions taken by agents. What are some ways the agent can determine if a past action needs to be revised? How can it avoid repeated mistakes?

9. The paper identifies challenges like limited transferability and high cost for some methods. What are some ways these challenges can potentially be mitigated in future work?

10. For real-world table processing applications, what are some example domains and use cases where LLM powered agents could be impactful? What functionality would need to be built around the LLM to enable these applications?
