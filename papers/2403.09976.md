# [AD3: Implicit Action is the Key for World Models to Distinguish the   Diverse Visual Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09976)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Prior work in visual reinforcement learning primarily focused on eliminating heterogeneous distractors like noisy background videos. However, eliminating homogeneous distractors that closely resemble controllable agents poses significant challenges for existing methods. Distinguishing such homogeneous distractors requires identifying the inherent control semantics and dynamic transitions of task-relevant and irrelevant components.

Solution - Implicit Action Generator (IAG):
The authors propose learning implicit actions of visual distractors to capture their behavior and aid in distinguishing task-irrelevant components. The implicit actions are learned using two models - Task-relevant Action-conditioned Inverse Dynamics (TAID) and Forward Implicit Action-conditioned Dynamics (FIAD). These models employ cycle consistency to extract the semantics of task-irrelevant transitions by implicitly decoupling the impact of task-relevant agent actions. Categorical variables are used to bottleneck the representation of implicit actions.

Solution - Action-Informed Diverse Visual Distractors Distinguisher (AD3): 
The learned implicit actions and agent actions are then used to construct separate world models for task-relevant and irrelevant components using standard variational inference, without needing additional loss objectives. The policy is learned exclusively within the task-relevant world model and latent state space by imagination.

Contributions:
1) Proposal of learning implicit actions of visual distractors to aid in distinguishing task-irrelevant components
2) Introduction of Implicit Action Generator (IAG) module to infer implicit actions
3) Presenting a new algorithm AD3 that utilizes implicit actions from IAG to train separated world models 
4) Demonstrating superior performance of AD3 on visual control tasks with both heterogeneous and homogeneous distractors
5) Empirical validation of the indispensable role of implicit actions learned by IAG
