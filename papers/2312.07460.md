# [Empirical Validation of Conformal Prediction for Trustworthy Skin   Lesions Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07460)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a comparative analysis of three uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods - Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), and Conformal Prediction (CP) - for the task of skin lesion classification. Using the HAM10000 dataset, the authors train a ResNet-18 model and incorporate the different UQ techniques. The results demonstrate CP's superior performance in assigning higher uncertainty to incorrectly classified examples compared to MCD and EDL. CP also maintains consistent uncertainty estimates across samples of varying difficulties. Additionally, CP offers straightforward implementation without needing architectural changes or retraining like MCD and EDL. The authors also evaluate the UQ methods on out-of-distribution data with covariate shifts from the DMF dataset. Again, CP outperforms by assigning high uncertainty to all samples. The paper concludes that CP is more robust, consistent and easier to implement than MCD and EDL, making it well-suited for safety-critical medical applications requiring trustworthy uncertainty quantification. Key limitations around CP's assumption of identically distributed calibration data are also highlighted.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors proposed in-depth explorations and analysis of three deep-learning uncertainty quantification techniques, including the prominent emerging conformal prediction, for the classification task of skin lesions.

2) They presented a comparative analysis and comprehensive evaluation of the implication of conformal prediction parameter variations. In particular, they studied the effect of changing the scoring function, the confidence level, and the calibration set size through a detailed set of experiments. 

3) They conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of each method in addressing out-of-distribution data arising from covariate shifts between the training set and test set.

In summary, the key contribution is a thorough empirical evaluation and analysis of uncertainty quantification methods, with a focus on conformal prediction, for skin lesion classification. The experiments analyze performance under various conditions and provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each technique.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper explores Conformal Prediction (CP) as an emerging uncertainty quantification technique. What are some of the key advantages of CP over other methods like Monte Carlo Dropout and Evidential Deep Learning?

2. The paper emphasizes the importance of the scoring function in CP. How does the choice of scoring function impact the performance of CP, especially in terms of uncertainty assignments and prediction set sizes?

3. The paper studies the effect of varying the confidence level (1-Î±) in CP. How does adjusting the confidence level affect the uncertainty estimates and prediction sets generated by CP?

4. What is the impact of the calibration set size on the empirical coverage achieved by CP? Explain why the size matters.

5. The paper evaluates the performance of CP and other methods on out-of-distribution (OOD) data with covariate shift. Why is the ability to detect OOD examples important for safety-critical applications like skin lesion classification?

6. One limitation mentioned is that CP assumes the calibration data comes from the same distribution as the training data. How can this limitation be addressed through domain adaptation techniques to make CP more robust?

7. Compare and contrast the Regularized Adaptive Prediction Sets (RAPS) method with the standard Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) in CP. What is the trade-off in using one versus the other?

8. What modifications need to be made to the neural network architecture and training procedure when implementing Evidential Deep Learning versus Conformal Prediction?

9. Explain the conformal coverage criteria theoretically guaranteed by CP. Why is this an important property for quantifying uncertainty?

10. The paper analyzes CP for skin lesion classification. What other potential medical applications can benefit from leveraging CP for uncertainty quantification and safety?
