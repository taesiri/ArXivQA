# [Collaborative Learning with Different Labeling Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10445)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies collaborative PAC learning with different labeling functions. In this setup, there are $n$ data distributions $\D_1,\dots,\D_n$. Unlike previous collaborative learning settings which assume all distributions can be accurately classified by a single classifier, this paper allows each distribution to have a different ground truth labeling. The goal is to learn an $\epsilon$-accurate classifier for each distribution, while minimizing the total number of samples drawn across distributions.

Main Results:
- The paper introduces a notion of $(k,\epsilon)$-realizability, meaning there exist $k$ classifiers that can classify each distribution with error $\leq\epsilon$. This is a relaxation of previous assumptions.  
- Under $(k,\epsilon)$-realizability, the paper gives an upper bound of $O(kd\log(n/k) + n\log n)$ on the sample complexity, where $d$ is the VC dimension of the base classifier class. This smoothly interpolates between $O(\log n)$ overhead at $k=1$ and $O(n)$ overhead at $k=n$.
- A nearly matching lower bound of $\Omega(kd\log(n/k))$ is proved on the sample complexity.
- The paper shows that the natural learning algorithm based on empirical risk minimization is NP-hard for $k\geq 3$. Despite this, for two special cases efficient algorithms are provided: when distributions share the same marginal, and for 2-refutable hypothesis classes.

Key Technical Ideas:
- Define an augmented classifier class over $n$ "nodes", consisting of $k$ base classifiers and assignments of distributions to classifiers. Connect collaborative learning in this setup to learning a single classifier over the augmented class.   
- Upper bound the VC dimension of the augmented class to obtain sample complexity results.
- Hardness is shown by reduction from graph coloring and related problems. Positive results rely on exploiting structures of special cases.

In summary, the paper significantly extends the theory of collaborative learning to settings with heterogeneous labeling, obtains sample complexity bounds and computational hardness results, and gives efficient algorithms for notable special cases. The problem statement and results connect machine learning theory to practical federated learning scenarios.
