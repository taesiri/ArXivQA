# [Progressive trajectory matching for medical dataset distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13469)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sharing medical image datasets is challenging due to privacy issues. Dataset distillation is a promising solution where a small synthetic dataset that preserves useful information is generated to replace the original dataset.
- Existing dataset distillation methods for natural images do not work well for medical images which have different characteristics. A comprehensive benchmark and analysis of challenges are lacking.

Proposed Solution:
- A new benchmark (MDD) with 6 public medical image datasets covering various modalities, tasks and resolutions is proposed.

- Two key challenges are identified through experiments on the benchmark:
   1) Degraded training stability when matching trajectory segments randomly.  
   2) Lack of diversity in synthetic images leading to saturated gradients.

- A novel progressive trajectory matching strategy is proposed to schedule start and end points when matching trajectories. This promotes stability.

- A dynamic overlap mitigation module is proposed to improve synthetic image diversity. It eliminates overlap across images and retrains parts of images.

Main Contributions:
- New medical image dataset distillation benchmark covering diverse conditions.
- Identification of key challenges through the benchmark.
- Progressive trajectory matching for improved stability.
- Dynamic overlap mitigation and retraining for better diversity.
- State-of-the-art performance, e.g. 8.33% average improvement over previous methods.

In summary, this paper establishes a benchmark to analyze medical image dataset distillation, identifies stability and diversity as main challenges, and proposes progressive trajectory matching along with dynamic retraining/overlap mitigation to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The solutions help advance progress in this area.
