# [Probability-based Global Cross-modal Upsampling for Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13659)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop an improved upsampling method for pansharpening that better utilizes global and cross-modal information while modeling channel specificity?

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) Existing upsampling methods used in pansharpening are limited because they mainly rely on local information from the low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image and do not effectively exploit global information from the LRMS or cross-modal information from the guiding panchromatic (PAN) image. 

2) An upsampling method that utilizes global LRMS information, cross-modal PAN information, and models channel specificity will lead to improved performance for pansharpening.

3) Formulating the upsampling method from a probabilistic perspective, where each pixel is modeled via a probability distribution conditioned on the LRMS and PAN images, is an effective way to incorporate global, cross-modal, and channel specific information.

The authors propose a new probability-based global cross-modal upsampling (PGCU) method to address these limitations and test their hypotheses. The paper presents the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of the PGCU method for pansharpening.
