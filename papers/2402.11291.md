# [Puzzle Solving using Reasoning of Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11291)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper surveys the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in puzzle solving, which provides critical insights into their reasoning abilities and applicability in complex tasks. Solving puzzles in textual formats poses unique challenges for LLMs to demonstrate skills in deductive logic, lateral thinking, and real-world reasoning. However, there has not been a focused analysis across the spectrum of textual puzzles to assess LLMs' performance.  

Solution:
The paper categorizes textual puzzles into rule-based (deterministic and stochastic) and rule-less (riddles, programming, commonsense reasoning) categories. This taxonomy aligns puzzles to the type of reasoning required - whether strictly logical deduction within a closed system of rules, or more flexible inference using real-world knowledge. The authors explore various methods like prompting strategies, neuro-symbolic techniques, and fine-tuning that enhance LLM puzzle-solving. By surveying specialized datasets and benchmarks, they evaluate model performance across puzzle categories, identifying strengths, limitations and research gaps.

Contributions:
- Proposes a conceptual taxonomy of textual puzzles based on core reasoning type rather than question format or attributes
- Collates prompting techniques, neuro-symbolic methods and fine-tuning strategies for LLM puzzle solving
- Surveys rule-based and rule-less puzzle datasets, analyzing model performance across categories
- Identifies gaps in stochastic puzzle datasets and limitations in complex inductive reasoning scenarios
- Highlights the need for advanced strategies and diversified benchmarks to improve LLM proficiency in puzzle solving

In summary, this paper offers a structured analysis of LLM puzzle-solving abilities through a novel taxonomy, methodological review, dataset analysis and performance assessment. The identified limitations underscore the disparity from human reasoning, directing future work towards strategies and resources that can enhance LLMs' logical deduction and creative problem-solving.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper surveys the capabilities of large language models in solving puzzles, categorizing them into rule-based and rule-less puzzles, analyzing the methods and datasets used to evaluate performance, and identifying challenges and future research directions to enhance reasoning abilities for complex puzzle solving.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a taxonomy of puzzles for evaluating Large Language Models, along with a survey of methods, datasets, and benchmark tasks used to assess LLMs' reasoning capabilities in solving different types of puzzles. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) A categorization of puzzles into rule-based (deterministic and stochastic) versus rule-less (riddles, programming puzzles, commonsense reasoning). This distinguishes puzzles based on whether they rely on formal constraints versus real-world knowledge for solution derivation.

2) An analysis of methods for applying LLMs to puzzle solving, including prompting techniques, neuro-symbolic translation approaches, and fine-tuning strategies. 

3) A curated collection and examination of benchmark datasets across the puzzle taxonomy categories to characterize available resources for evaluation.

4) A discussion of current limitations and future research directions needed to advance LLMs' proficiency in complex puzzle solving.

In summary, the paper provides a structured taxonomy for puzzles focused on logical reasoning requirements, a methodology overview, dataset summary, and qualitative assessment to highlight open challenges in progressing LLMs as creative problem solvers.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper for evaluating puzzle solving capabilities of large language models:

1. The paper categorizes puzzles into rule-based and rule-less categories. What are the key differences in how models need to reason to solve puzzles in each of these categories? How does this categorization enable a more nuanced analysis of model capabilities?

2. The paper discusses various prompting strategies like chain-of-thought and self-consistency. How do these methods specifically aid in puzzle solving? What limitations do they have and how can they be further improved? 

3. Neuro-symbolic techniques involve translating puzzles into other representations like code or logical formulas. What are the advantages and disadvantages of such methods compared to having models directly reason on natural language puzzles?

4. What specific fine-tuning approaches have shown promise in enhancing puzzle solving abilities? How do techniques differ based on the puzzle type and complexity? What gaps need to be addressed?

5. The paper finds rule-based stochastic puzzles are lacking in diversity. What unique challenges do stochastic puzzles present over deterministic ones? What specialized datasets could be created to evaluate this reasoning? 

6. For programming puzzles, what differences were found between formats like P3 and multiple choice questions? How do these affect the way models need to reason?

7. What role do interactive, conversational formats play in evaluating commonsense reasoning for puzzles? What unique insights do they provide over static puzzle presentations?

8. The survey reveals overall poor performance on certain puzzles like BoardGameQA. What specific reasoning limitations cause models to struggle on such benchmarks? 

9. Certain advanced prompting techniques like inference-exclusion prompting demonstrate benefits. How specifically do they approximate human logic more closely? What weaknesses need to be still addressed?

10. The paper did not substantially cover puzzle generation abilities. What core skills would models need to master before being capable of quality puzzle generation? What research directions seem promising to enable this?
