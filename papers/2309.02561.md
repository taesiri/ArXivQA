# [Physically Grounded Vision-Language Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02561)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that vision-language models (VLMs) can be improved at physical reasoning about common household objects by fine-tuning them on a dataset of human annotations of physical concepts for such objects. Specifically, the authors propose that by fine-tuning a VLM on their PhysObjects dataset of physical concept annotations, the VLM will gain improved abilities at physical reasoning in a way that is useful for household robotics applications. They test this hypothesis by evaluating the fine-tuned VLM on held-out test data from PhysObjects, on physical reasoning tasks situated in real-world scenes, and on a real robot. Their results support the hypothesis, showing improved physical reasoning abilities of the fine-tuned VLM across these evaluations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

- Proposing PhysObjects, a new dataset of physical concept annotations for images of common household objects. The dataset contains 36.9K crowd-sourced and 417K automated annotations for images from the EgoObjects dataset.

- Demonstrating that fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) like InstructBLIP on PhysObjects significantly improves its ability to reason about physical properties of objects, as evidenced by improved accuracy on held-out test examples from the dataset.

- Incorporating the fine-tuned physically-grounded VLM into an interactive framework with a large language model (LLM) planner, and showing this leads to improved performance on household robotic manipulation tasks requiring physical reasoning, compared to using an unmodified VLM. 

- Validating the benefits of using the physically-grounded VLM on a real robot, where it improved success rates on physical reasoning tasks.

So in summary, the key contributions seem to be proposing the new PhysObjects dataset to improve physical reasoning abilities of VLMs, and showing this can improve performance on downstream robotic manipulation tasks by integrating the fine-tuned VLM with an LLM planner. The physically grounded VLM provides the LLM with better information about physical properties of objects in the scene to enable more effective planning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a dataset of physical concept annotations for household objects to improve vision-language models for robotic manipulation tasks requiring reasoning about real-world physical properties.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review, here is how I see this paper comparing to other related work:

- The paper makes a novel contribution in proposing PhysObjects, a new dataset for physical reasoning about household objects. While there are some existing datasets for visual attributes or physical properties, PhysObjects focuses specifically on physical concepts highly relevant for robotics, using real images of common household objects. This makes it more directly applicable for improving physical reasoning abilities of vision-language models in service of robotic manipulation.

- The methodology of fine-tuning a large pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) on the PhysObjects dataset follows a similar approach to some prior works that also fine-tune VLMs on human-annotated data. However, the application to physical reasoning is novel, and the paper demonstrates clear benefits in improved physical reasoning abilities compared to baseline VLMs.

- The interactive framework incorporating the fine-tuned physically-grounded VLM with a language model planner is similar in spirit to some prior works on grounding language models through vision. But the focus on physical reasoning specifically, and the gains shown on physical reasoning tasks, are novel contributions.  

- Compared to works that try to learn physical reasoning from interaction data, the proposed approach offers a more scalable alternative that leverages human priors along with pre-trained VLMs. This removes the need for extensive real-world interaction data collection.

- The focus on high-level human-like physical reasoning, as opposed to precise physical property estimation, is also notable. This qualitative style of reasoning has been less explored compared to direct property regression, but could be highly useful for robotics.

Overall, I see the paper making significant contributions through the novel PhysObjects dataset, the application of VLM fine-tuning to improve physical reasoning, and demonstrations of how this can improve planning for manipulation tasks requiring physical understanding. The approach appears competitive or complementary to related existing works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Incorporating data with continuous physical measurements of objects to improve grounding of the model outputs in real physical quantities. This could help with applications like determining if an object is too heavy to pick up.

- Expanding the physical concepts studied beyond those in the PhysObjects dataset, to cover additional concepts useful for robotics. Examples could include geometric reasoning (e.g. whether an object can fit inside a container) or social reasoning (e.g. what objects are acceptable to move in a scene).

- Using the dataset and approach as a starting point to develop more sophisticated reasoning abilities in vision-language models for robotics, beyond just physical concepts.

- Mitigating issues with out-of-distribution generalization when using the fine-tuned vision-language model, perhaps through additional training techniques like co-training on other vision-language datasets.

- Evaluating the benefits of the approach on a wider variety of robotic manipulation tasks and environments.

- Studying techniques to attain more positive transfer when fine-tuning on held-out physical concepts, such as by co-training on additional vision-language data.

In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding the concepts covered, improving out-of-distribution generalization, and evaluating the approach on more complex robotic tasks. The authors view the PhysObjects dataset and use of vision-language models as a starting point for developing more sophisticated reasoning abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes PhysObjects, a new dataset of physical concept annotations for common household objects to improve the physical reasoning abilities of vision-language models (VLMs). The dataset contains 36.9K crowd-sourced and 417K automated annotations of physical properties like mass, fragility, and contents for images from the EgoObjects dataset. The authors fine-tune a state-of-the-art VLM called InstructBLIP on PhysObjects and show that it significantly improves the model's accuracy on predicting physical properties compared to the base model. They incorporate this physically-grounded VLM into a planning framework with a large language model, where the language model can query the VLM about objects to improve its plans. Evaluations on physical reasoning tasks using real images and a robot demonstrate that the physically-grounded VLM enables improved planning performance compared to not using it. The key contributions are the PhysObjects dataset and showing how it can improve VLM reasoning and language model based planning when incorporated.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new dataset called PhysObjects for improving the physical reasoning abilities of vision-language models (VLMs). The dataset consists of over 36K crowdsourced and 417K automated annotations capturing physical concepts such as mass, fragility, and contents for images of common household objects from the EgoObjects dataset. The annotations include both categorical labels and continuous preference comparisons between objects. The authors demonstrate that fine-tuning a VLM on PhysObjects significantly improves its accuracy at predicting held-out annotations compared to the original VLM. They also show that incorporating the fine-tuned VLM into an interactive framework with a large language model robotic planner improves planning performance on household tasks requiring physical reasoning. For example, the fine-tuned VLM better enables the planner to identify heavy vs. light objects or fragile vs. sturdy containers based on their appearance. Experiments also illustrate benefits on a real robot, where the fine-tuned VLM helps produce plans that lead to higher task success rates.

Overall, this work makes progress towards improving the physical understanding and reasoning abilities of VLMs by leveraging a new dataset of human annotations. The physically grounded VLM is shown to provide useful information for robotic planning systems that require reasoning about physical properties and concepts of objects in their environment. The proposed approach of fine-tuning VLMs on human-annotated physical concepts provides a promising direction for expanding their applicability to real-world robotics tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a dataset called PhysObjects consisting of 36.9K crowd-sourced and 417K automated physical concept annotations of common household objects, based on images from the EgoObjects dataset. The annotations include categorical labels (e.g. material type) and preference pairs (e.g. object X is heavier than object Y) for concepts like mass, fragility, and deformability. The authors use this dataset to fine-tune a vision-language model called InstructBLIP. They frame the annotations as visual question answering examples to let the model learn physical reasoning abilities. For continuous concepts annotated with preferences, they derive a continuous scoring function from the model's likelihoods for yes/no questions. They show that the fine-tuned model, called Physically Grounded InstructBLIP (PG-InstructBLIP), achieves higher accuracy on held-out PhysObjects test examples compared to the base InstructBLIP model and other baselines. The fine-tuned model is then incorporated into a framework with a large language model that queries it about physical properties of objects, in order to improve planning performance on manipulation tasks requiring physical reasoning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of physical reasoning about objects in vision-language models for robotic manipulation tasks. Specifically:

- Modern VLMs have shown strong performance on visual reasoning tasks like VQA, but still lack sufficient understanding of physical object concepts like fragility and deformability. This limits their usefulness for robotics applications where physical reasoning is important.

- Prior datasets for physical reasoning either rely on object interactions, which are hard to scale up, or are not focused on common real-world objects relevant for robotics. 

- To address this, the paper proposes PhysObjects, a large dataset of physical concept annotations for images of common household objects.

- The key contributions are:

1) PhysObjects dataset of 39.6K crowdsourced and 417K automated annotations of physical concepts for household objects.

2) Demonstrating that fine-tuning VLMs on PhysObjects significantly improves their physical reasoning abilities, including on held-out concepts.

3) Incorporating the fine-tuned VLM with an LLM-based robotic planner improves planning performance on tasks requiring physical reasoning.

4) Evaluating on a real robot shows the fine-tuned VLM improves task success rates.

In summary, the paper aims to improve physical reasoning of VLMs using a new dataset PhysObjects, in order to make VLMs more useful for robotic manipulation tasks requiring understanding of real-world physical concepts.
