# Robots That Ask For Help: Uncertainty Alignment for Large Language Model   Planners

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that conformal prediction can be used to align the uncertainty of large language model (LLM)-based robot planners in order to minimize reliance on human assistance while still maintaining high levels of task success. Specifically, the paper proposes a framework called "KnowNo" that applies conformal prediction to LLM-based planners in order to generate prediction sets over possible next actions. If the prediction set contains multiple options, this signals uncertainty on the part of the LLM planner, triggering a request for human assistance. The conformal prediction methodology allows KnowNo to provide statistical guarantees on task success for a given level of human assistance. The central hypothesis is that by aligning the LLM's uncertainty in this way, KnowNo can minimize the amount of human help requested while still ensuring reliable task completion.Experiments across simulated and real robot platforms on various manipulation tasks seem to validate this hypothesis, showing that KnowNo reduces the rate of human assistance compared to baselines, while maintaining calibrated confidence at a user-specified level. The central contribution is demonstrating that conformal prediction provides a promising approach to aligning uncertainty in LLM-based planners in order to balance autonomy and human assistance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents KnowNo, a framework that applies conformal prediction to align the uncertainty of large language model (LLM)-based planners for language-instructed robots. The key contributions are:1. It utilizes a pretrained LLM to generate a set of possible next actions for the robot. By framing LLM planning as multiple choice question answering, it eliminates length bias and utilizes the LLM's ability to evaluate options. 2. It uses conformal prediction to select a subset of the LLM-generated options that provides statistical guarantees on calibrated confidence in both single-step and multi-step planning problems. This allows the robot to execute an action if the subset is a singleton, or seek human assistance otherwise.3. It evaluates KnowNo in simulation and on hardware across a variety of language-instructed robot manipulation tasks involving different types of ambiguities. Results validate its ability to provide guaranteed task success rates while reducing human intervention compared to baselines.In summary, KnowNo provides a lightweight approach to align the uncertainty of LLM planners to "know when they don't know" and leverage human assistance efficiently. The conformal prediction framework allows providing statistical assurances without finetuning the LLM, complementing the growing capabilities of large language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- The paper presents a new framework called KnowNo that uses conformal prediction to align the uncertainty of large language model (LLM) based planners. This appears to be a novel approach not explored in prior work on language-instructed robots.- Most prior work on using LLMs for robot planning does not explicitly model or account for uncertainty. Some exceptions have started exploring uncertainty quantification, but primarily focus on fine-tuning models or training separate confidence predictors. In contrast, KnowNo applies conformal prediction in a lightweight way without model finetuning.- The use of conformal prediction for set-based predictions with statistical guarantees is gaining more traction in language modeling, but has not been extensively applied to free-form language generation tasks. This paper demonstrates an interesting application of conformal prediction to natural language robot planning.- Compared to typical calibration methods that associate uncertainty with point estimates, KnowNo provides coverage guarantees for set-valued predictors. The guarantees hold regardless of LLM accuracy.- For robot planning, KnowNo appears to be the first work using conformal prediction. It provides a novel multi-step extension for guarantees over the full planning horizon. This is an advancement compared to prior CP robotics work that often makes simplifying assumptions about planning horizons.- Overall, the paper makes a nice contribution in bringing together conformal prediction and robot language planning. The proposed approach and guarantees seem innovative compared to related works. Evaluating on a diverse set of tasks is also a strength. The limitations discussed provide good inspiration for future work.
