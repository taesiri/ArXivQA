# [Robots That Ask For Help: Uncertainty Alignment for Large Language Model   Planners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01928)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that conformal prediction can be used to align the uncertainty of large language model (LLM)-based robot planners in order to minimize reliance on human assistance while still maintaining high levels of task success. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a framework called "KnowNo" that applies conformal prediction to LLM-based planners in order to generate prediction sets over possible next actions. If the prediction set contains multiple options, this signals uncertainty on the part of the LLM planner, triggering a request for human assistance. The conformal prediction methodology allows KnowNo to provide statistical guarantees on task success for a given level of human assistance. The central hypothesis is that by aligning the LLM's uncertainty in this way, KnowNo can minimize the amount of human help requested while still ensuring reliable task completion.

Experiments across simulated and real robot platforms on various manipulation tasks seem to validate this hypothesis, showing that KnowNo reduces the rate of human assistance compared to baselines, while maintaining calibrated confidence at a user-specified level. The central contribution is demonstrating that conformal prediction provides a promising approach to aligning uncertainty in LLM-based planners in order to balance autonomy and human assistance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents KnowNo, a framework that applies conformal prediction to align the uncertainty of large language model (LLM)-based planners for language-instructed robots. The key contributions are:

1. It utilizes a pretrained LLM to generate a set of possible next actions for the robot. By framing LLM planning as multiple choice question answering, it eliminates length bias and utilizes the LLM's ability to evaluate options. 

2. It uses conformal prediction to select a subset of the LLM-generated options that provides statistical guarantees on calibrated confidence in both single-step and multi-step planning problems. This allows the robot to execute an action if the subset is a singleton, or seek human assistance otherwise.

3. It evaluates KnowNo in simulation and on hardware across a variety of language-instructed robot manipulation tasks involving different types of ambiguities. Results validate its ability to provide guaranteed task success rates while reducing human intervention compared to baselines.

In summary, KnowNo provides a lightweight approach to align the uncertainty of LLM planners to "know when they don't know" and leverage human assistance efficiently. The conformal prediction framework allows providing statistical assurances without finetuning the LLM, complementing the growing capabilities of large language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper presents a new framework called KnowNo that uses conformal prediction to align the uncertainty of large language model (LLM) based planners. This appears to be a novel approach not explored in prior work on language-instructed robots.

- Most prior work on using LLMs for robot planning does not explicitly model or account for uncertainty. Some exceptions have started exploring uncertainty quantification, but primarily focus on fine-tuning models or training separate confidence predictors. In contrast, KnowNo applies conformal prediction in a lightweight way without model finetuning.

- The use of conformal prediction for set-based predictions with statistical guarantees is gaining more traction in language modeling, but has not been extensively applied to free-form language generation tasks. This paper demonstrates an interesting application of conformal prediction to natural language robot planning.

- Compared to typical calibration methods that associate uncertainty with point estimates, KnowNo provides coverage guarantees for set-valued predictors. The guarantees hold regardless of LLM accuracy.

- For robot planning, KnowNo appears to be the first work using conformal prediction. It provides a novel multi-step extension for guarantees over the full planning horizon. This is an advancement compared to prior CP robotics work that often makes simplifying assumptions about planning horizons.

- Overall, the paper makes a nice contribution in bringing together conformal prediction and robot language planning. The proposed approach and guarantees seem innovative compared to related works. Evaluating on a diverse set of tasks is also a strength. The limitations discussed provide good inspiration for future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Exploring how to combine conformal prediction with other uncertainty quantification methods like ensemble methods. The paper showed that ensemble-based probabilities can potentially improve performance, but ensembling is computationally expensive. Investigating approaches to get the benefits of ensembling while keeping computational costs low could be useful.

- Applying conformal prediction to model the uncertainty of other components in the robot system besides just the LLM planner, like the perception module or low-level action policies. This could provide end-to-end uncertainties and guarantees. 

- Incorporating modeling of human errors/uncertainty into the conformal prediction framework when relying on human assistance. The current guarantees assume the human perfectly clarifies uncertainties, but accounting for imperfect human help could make the framework more robust.

- Developing methods to allow conformal prediction to optimize for different metrics related to human assistance, like directly minimizing the human intervention rate rather than just the prediction set size. This could further reduce the burden on humans.

- Exploring modifications to the conformal prediction approach that can provide guarantees with less calibration data. Reducing the data requirements could make deployment of these methods more practical.

- Applying these uncertainty estimation techniques to other areas like active learning, to generate queries that maximally reduce uncertainty. This could complement the capabilities of conformal prediction.

So in summary, some key directions are combining conformal prediction with other methods, extending it to more parts of the robot system, accounting for human imperfections, optimizing new metrics, reducing data needs, and applications to other problems like active learning. The paper provides a solid foundation that opens up many possibilities for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents KnowNo, a framework that uses conformal prediction to align the uncertainty of large language model (LLM)-based robot planners. Given a language instruction, KnowNo uses an LLM to generate possible next actions and scores reflecting the LLM's confidence in each one. Conformal prediction then selects a subset of these options that covers the true option with a user-specified probability. If the subset contains multiple options, the robot asks the human for help; otherwise, it executes the single option. Experiments in simulation and on hardware demonstrate that KnowNo provides statistically guaranteed task success rates while reducing human intervention compared to baselines. Theoretically, KnowNo is shown to provide calibrated confidence guarantees in both single-step and multi-step planning problems. Overall, by modeling LLM uncertainty with conformal prediction, KnowNo enables robots to know when they don't know and ask for help only when needed.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper presents a framework called KnowNo for aligning the uncertainty of large language model (LLM) based planners for robots. Knowing when the LLM planner is uncertain and seeking human help when needed is important for safe and reliable robot operation. The key idea is to use conformal prediction (CP) to generate prediction sets that contain the correct next action with high probability. By converting LLM planning to multiple choice question answering, the LLM generates a few candidate next actions and ranks them. CP then selects a subset above a confidence threshold to form the prediction set. If the set is not a singleton, the robot asks for human help to resolve the ambiguity. Experiments across simulated and real robotic platforms with natural language instructions show that KnowNo reduces human help requests by 10-24% compared to baselines while still achieving the user-specified task success rate.  

The paper makes three main contributions. First, it shows how to generate prediction sets from LLM confidences and apply CP for selecting unambiguous actions or triggering help. Second, theoretical guarantees are provided relating the CP coverage level to end-to-end task completion rates. A multi-step CP method is introduced to maintain calibration across planning timesteps. Third, the approach is demonstrated in tabletop rearrangement, mobile manipulation, and bimanual tasks, validating improved autonomy and assurance. Overall, KnowNo provides a promising lightweight approach to uncertainty modeling that maintains reliability as LLMs grow more capable. The work helps move towards safer language-instructed robotics.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using conformal prediction to calibrate the uncertainty of large language model (LLM) based robot planners. The key idea is to formulate the LLM planning task as multiple choice question answering (MCQA) to evaluate the model's confidence in different possible next actions. Specifically, the LLM is first prompted to generate a diverse set of candidate plans labeled A-D plus an additional "none of the above" option E. The same LLM is then asked to predict the correct option given this multiple choice setup. By collecting a calibration dataset of such MCQA examples and applying conformal prediction, the method generates a prediction set of options that is guaranteed to contain the true next action with user-specified confidence. At test time, if this conformal prediction set is not a singleton, it triggers requesting human assistance before acting. The paper shows both theoretically and empirically how this approach can provide statistical guarantees on task success rates while minimizing the intervention rate.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is addressing the challenge of getting language models to know when they don't know the right answer or action. Specifically, the context is using large language models (LLMs) for robot planning based on natural language instructions. 

- LLMs tend to hallucinate and generate plausible but incorrect outputs confidently. This is problematic for robot planning as incorrectly following a plan could lead to unsafe actions.

- The paper proposes a framework called "KnowNo" that uses conformal prediction to align the uncertainty of LLM-based planners. The goals are to achieve calibrated confidence (bounds on task success rate) and minimal help (minimize clarification queries to humans).

- KnowNo formulates planning as multiple choice QA which helps evaluate semantic uncertainty of the LLM. It then applies conformal prediction on the MCQA scores to generate prediction sets that contain the correct option with high probability. Asking for help is triggered when the set is not a singleton.

- Theoretical guarantees are provided on achieving a target task success rate by seeking help when necessary. Experiments in simulation and hardware validate improved efficiency and autonomy compared to baselines.

In summary, the paper addresses the important challenge of uncertainty estimation and alignment for LLM-based planning, in order to build reliable robots that know when they don't know and can ask humans for help when needed. The proposed KnowNo framework provides formal guarantees on task success while minimizing human clarifications.
