# Robots That Ask For Help: Uncertainty Alignment for Large Language Model   Planners

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that conformal prediction can be used to align the uncertainty of large language model (LLM)-based robot planners in order to minimize reliance on human assistance while still maintaining high levels of task success. Specifically, the paper proposes a framework called "KnowNo" that applies conformal prediction to LLM-based planners in order to generate prediction sets over possible next actions. If the prediction set contains multiple options, this signals uncertainty on the part of the LLM planner, triggering a request for human assistance. The conformal prediction methodology allows KnowNo to provide statistical guarantees on task success for a given level of human assistance. The central hypothesis is that by aligning the LLM's uncertainty in this way, KnowNo can minimize the amount of human help requested while still ensuring reliable task completion.Experiments across simulated and real robot platforms on various manipulation tasks seem to validate this hypothesis, showing that KnowNo reduces the rate of human assistance compared to baselines, while maintaining calibrated confidence at a user-specified level. The central contribution is demonstrating that conformal prediction provides a promising approach to aligning uncertainty in LLM-based planners in order to balance autonomy and human assistance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents KnowNo, a framework that applies conformal prediction to align the uncertainty of large language model (LLM)-based planners for language-instructed robots. The key contributions are:1. It utilizes a pretrained LLM to generate a set of possible next actions for the robot. By framing LLM planning as multiple choice question answering, it eliminates length bias and utilizes the LLM's ability to evaluate options. 2. It uses conformal prediction to select a subset of the LLM-generated options that provides statistical guarantees on calibrated confidence in both single-step and multi-step planning problems. This allows the robot to execute an action if the subset is a singleton, or seek human assistance otherwise.3. It evaluates KnowNo in simulation and on hardware across a variety of language-instructed robot manipulation tasks involving different types of ambiguities. Results validate its ability to provide guaranteed task success rates while reducing human intervention compared to baselines.In summary, KnowNo provides a lightweight approach to align the uncertainty of LLM planners to "know when they don't know" and leverage human assistance efficiently. The conformal prediction framework allows providing statistical assurances without finetuning the LLM, complementing the growing capabilities of large language models.
