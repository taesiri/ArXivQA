# [RED-PSM: Regularization by Denoising of Partially Separable Models for   Dynamic Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03483)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to effectively reconstruct dynamic objects from highly undersampled tomographic projections over time using partially separable models and learned image priors. 

Specifically, the authors propose a new approach called RED-PSM that combines partially separable models (PSM) with regularization by denoising (RED) to address the challenging problem of reconstructing time-varying objects from sequentially acquired undersampled projection data. The key ideas are:

- Using a PSM to represent the spatio-temporal object in a compressed form with separated spatial and temporal components. This introduces an effective low-rank prior on the object. 

- Leveraging recent advances in image denoising through deep learning by incorporating a learned denoising model as a regularizer via the RED framework. This provides a flexible way to exploit impressive denoising performance without requiring training on spatio-temporal data.

- Developing an efficient optimization scheme based on ADMM that enforces the PSM constraint and incorporates the learned spatial regularizer.

- Providing theoretical analysis that guarantees convergence to a stationary point of the objective.

The paper shows through experiments on simulated dynamic CT data that RED-PSM reconstructs time-varying objects more accurately and with much faster run times compared to a recent deep learning-based method. The framework is also demonstrated to work well for dynamic MRI.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that the proposed combination of PSM and learned regularization via RED can effectively address the challenging undersampled dynamic reconstruction problem, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches. The theoretical and empirical results support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes RED-PSM, a new approach that combines partially separable models (PSM) with regularization by denoising (RED) for dynamic imaging problems such as dynamic tomography and dynamic MRI. This is the first PSM-based approach that incorporates a learned spatial prior using RED.

2. It develops a novel ADMM algorithm to optimize the proposed variational objective function with the PSM as a hard constraint. The algorithm uses variable splitting and enables efficient integration of a learned denoiser into the iterations.

3. It provides theoretical analysis that proves the convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point satisfying first-order optimality conditions.

The integration of RED with PSM and the ADMM optimization framework are novel.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of dynamic imaging:

- It proposes a new method called RED-PSM that combines partially separable models (PSM) with regularization by denoising (RED) for the first time. This combines the benefits of PSM for efficiently modeling spatio-temporal data with the flexibility and performance of learned image denoisers through RED. Other PSM-based methods have used more basic regularization like total variation. 

- It provides theoretical analysis and convergence guarantees for the proposed optimization algorithm. Many other papers in this field do not include convergence proofs. 

- Experiments compare RED-PSM to a recent deep learning-based method called TD-DIP. The results show RED-PSM achieves higher accuracy and orders of magnitude faster run time. Other learning-based methods like TD-DIP can suffer from overfitting.

- RED-PSM uses a pre-trained denoiser on static training data, avoiding the need for dynamic spatio-temporal training data. Other supervised methods require dynamic training data which may not always be available.

- The patch-based version of RED-PSM enables convenient scaling to higher dimensions. Some other methods like TD-DIP don't easily extend to high-resolution 3D+time cases.

- Experiments on both simulated dynamic tomography data and real cardiac MRI demonstrate broad applicability. Many other papers focus on either tomography or MRI.

Overall, RED-PSM moves the state-of-the-art forward in dynamic imaging by combining modeling, learning, and theory in a novel way with strong empirical results. The analysis and comparisons provide useful insights into the pros and cons of different approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying the RED-PSM approach to different imaging scenarios beyond tomography and MRI, such as ultrasound, OCT, etc. The authors suggest the framework could be useful in other inverse problems with various forward models.

- Developing more robust training methods for the denoisers used in the RED framework. The authors note that the deep denoisers encounter varying artifact distributions during the RED-PSM optimization process, and more robust training could improve overall performance.

- Improving the generalizability of the framework to handle different types of objects and dynamics. The current framework relies on training denoisers on static slices similar to the object of interest. Developing more generic learned priors could make the approach more widely applicable. 

- Extending the approach to 3D and 4D (3D+time) settings. The authors show the potential for this with a patch-based regularizer variant, but further exploration of efficient implementations would be useful.

- Incorporating more advanced learned regularization beyond current discriminative denoisers like DnCNN. Leveraging recent generative and self-supervised models could provide further improvements.

- Combining the approach with model-based reconstruction methods that incorporate accurate physical models. This could further improve accuracy in applications where such models are available.

- Evaluating the clinical utility of the dynamic reconstructions in medical imaging applications through observer studies or diagnostic tasks.

Overall, the authors point to many interesting opportunities for extending the RED-PSM framework and applying it to new inverse problems and imaging modalities. Advancing the learned regularization, scaling to higher dimensions, and demonstrating diagnostic value seem to be the major suggested directions.

The paper proposes a method called RED-PSM for dynamic imaging, which combines partially separable models (PSM) with regularization by denoising (RED). Dynamic imaging involves reconstructing a time-varying 2D or 3D object from undersampled measurements, like a single projection per time instant.
