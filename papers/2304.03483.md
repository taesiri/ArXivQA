# [RED-PSM: Regularization by Denoising of Partially Separable Models for   Dynamic Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03483)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to effectively reconstruct dynamic objects from highly undersampled tomographic projections over time using partially separable models and learned image priors. 

Specifically, the authors propose a new approach called RED-PSM that combines partially separable models (PSM) with regularization by denoising (RED) to address the challenging problem of reconstructing time-varying objects from sequentially acquired undersampled projection data. The key ideas are:

- Using a PSM to represent the spatio-temporal object in a compressed form with separated spatial and temporal components. This introduces an effective low-rank prior on the object. 

- Leveraging recent advances in image denoising through deep learning by incorporating a learned denoising model as a regularizer via the RED framework. This provides a flexible way to exploit impressive denoising performance without requiring training on spatio-temporal data.

- Developing an efficient optimization scheme based on ADMM that enforces the PSM constraint and incorporates the learned spatial regularizer.

- Providing theoretical analysis that guarantees convergence to a stationary point of the objective.

The paper shows through experiments on simulated dynamic CT data that RED-PSM reconstructs time-varying objects more accurately and with much faster run times compared to a recent deep learning-based method. The framework is also demonstrated to work well for dynamic MRI.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that the proposed combination of PSM and learned regularization via RED can effectively address the challenging undersampled dynamic reconstruction problem, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches. The theoretical and empirical results support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes RED-PSM, a new approach that combines partially separable models (PSM) with regularization by denoising (RED) for dynamic imaging problems such as dynamic tomography and dynamic MRI. This is the first PSM-based approach that incorporates a learned spatial prior using RED.

2. It develops a novel ADMM algorithm to optimize the proposed variational objective function with the PSM as a hard constraint. The algorithm uses variable splitting and enables efficient integration of a learned denoiser into the iterations.

3. It provides theoretical analysis that proves the convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point satisfying first-order optimality conditions.

4. It demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods like PSM-TV and TD-DIP on dynamic tomography and MRI data. The method achieves higher accuracy and faster runtimes. 

5. A patch-based version of the approach is shown to provide comparable accuracy with massive reductions in memory requirements, enabling scaling to high-resolution dynamic 3D imaging.

In summary, the main contribution is a new PSM-based dynamic imaging approach that leverages learned image priors through RED, supported by theory, algorithms, and experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The integration of RED with PSM and the ADMM optimization framework are novel.
