# [RED-PSM: Regularization by Denoising of Partially Separable Models for   Dynamic Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03483)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to effectively reconstruct dynamic objects from highly undersampled tomographic projections over time using partially separable models and learned image priors. Specifically, the authors propose a new approach called RED-PSM that combines partially separable models (PSM) with regularization by denoising (RED) to address the challenging problem of reconstructing time-varying objects from sequentially acquired undersampled projection data. The key ideas are:- Using a PSM to represent the spatio-temporal object in a compressed form with separated spatial and temporal components. This introduces an effective low-rank prior on the object. - Leveraging recent advances in image denoising through deep learning by incorporating a learned denoising model as a regularizer via the RED framework. This provides a flexible way to exploit impressive denoising performance without requiring training on spatio-temporal data.- Developing an efficient optimization scheme based on ADMM that enforces the PSM constraint and incorporates the learned spatial regularizer.- Providing theoretical analysis that guarantees convergence to a stationary point of the objective.The paper shows through experiments on simulated dynamic CT data that RED-PSM reconstructs time-varying objects more accurately and with much faster run times compared to a recent deep learning-based method. The framework is also demonstrated to work well for dynamic MRI.In summary, the main hypothesis is that the proposed combination of PSM and learned regularization via RED can effectively address the challenging undersampled dynamic reconstruction problem, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches. The theoretical and empirical results support this hypothesis.
