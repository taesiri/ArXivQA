# [Learning to Fly by Crashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05588)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to learn to navigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and avoid obstacles indoors using only monocular images, without relying on explicit 3D representations or depth estimation. The key hypothesis is that a large-scale dataset of drone crashes can be used in a self-supervised manner to teach a model how NOT to crash, and this can lead to effective policies for indoor UAV navigation.Specifically, the paper proposes an approach to autonomously collect a dataset of over 11,500 drone crashes by having the drone sample naive trajectories and crash into random objects. This crash dataset, along with positive examples from the same trajectories, is then used to train a deep network to predict if the drone should move forward or not based on image crops. At test time, this model allows the drone to navigate complex indoor environments by choosing directional movements based on the network's predictions.The central hypothesis is that, compared to small expert datasets or simulated data, this self-supervised approach of collecting real-world crash data and learning from it can enable more effective policies for UAV navigation in cluttered indoor environments, despite using only a monocular camera. The experiments aim to demonstrate the advantages of this large-scale crash data collection paradigm.
