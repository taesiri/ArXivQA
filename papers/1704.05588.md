# [Learning to Fly by Crashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05588)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to learn to navigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and avoid obstacles indoors using only monocular images, without relying on explicit 3D representations or depth estimation. The key hypothesis is that a large-scale dataset of drone crashes can be used in a self-supervised manner to teach a model how NOT to crash, and this can lead to effective policies for indoor UAV navigation.Specifically, the paper proposes an approach to autonomously collect a dataset of over 11,500 drone crashes by having the drone sample naive trajectories and crash into random objects. This crash dataset, along with positive examples from the same trajectories, is then used to train a deep network to predict if the drone should move forward or not based on image crops. At test time, this model allows the drone to navigate complex indoor environments by choosing directional movements based on the network's predictions.The central hypothesis is that, compared to small expert datasets or simulated data, this self-supervised approach of collecting real-world crash data and learning from it can enable more effective policies for UAV navigation in cluttered indoor environments, despite using only a monocular camera. The experiments aim to demonstrate the advantages of this large-scale crash data collection paradigm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a self-supervised learning approach for navigating drones in indoor environments. The key ideas are:- Collecting a large-scale dataset of drone crashes - the authors crash their drone 11,500 times to create a dataset of negative examples showing how not to fly. This is one of the largest UAV crash datasets. - Using the negative crash data along with positive non-crash data from the same trajectories to train a deep neural network to predict good vs bad trajectories.- Developing a simple but effective policy to use the binary classification network to fly long distances while avoiding obstacles. The policy essentially crops the image and uses the network predictions on the crops to decide which way to turn.- Showing that their self-supervised approach outperforms methods using depth prediction and is comparable to human pilots in navigating cluttered indoor environments.So in summary, the main contribution is demonstrating the power of large-scale self-supervised data along with simple learning strategies for enabling drones to fly autonomously while avoiding obstacles in complex environments. The key idea is to embrace drone crashes during data collection rather than avoiding them.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a self-supervised approach to train a drone to navigate indoors by deliberately crashing it over 11,500 times to create a large dataset of failures, and uses this negative data along with positive data from the same trajectories to learn a surprisingly effective policy for collision avoidance.
