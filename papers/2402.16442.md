# [On Distributed Larger-Than-Memory Subset Selection With Pairwise   Submodular Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16442)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Subset selection is crucial for reducing costs and enhancing model quality in machine learning. It involves identifying the most informative subsets from large datasets.
- Existing subset selection algorithms relying on submodularity for optimization are sequential and centralized. Prior distributed algorithms require a central machine to hold the final subset, which is infeasible at scale.
- There is a need for distributed subset selection algorithms that can scale to massive datasets without needing a central machine to store the final subset.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper presents two components - a novel bounding algorithm and a distributed greedy optimization algorithm - for selecting high-quality subsets in a distributed manner without needing a central machine.

- The bounding algorithm iteratively tightens the bounds on the minimum and maximum utilities of data points to identify high-utility points to expand the subset and low-utility points to discard. Both exact and approximate bounding algorithms are proposed.

- If bounding does not find the complete subset, a multi-round distributed greedy algorithm based on random partitioning is used. It runs greedy optimization on partitions and unions the results over multiple rounds to find the remaining subset. Adaptive partitioning is also used to minimize partitions.

Main Contributions:
- A novel bounding algorithm for distributed subset selection that iteratively includes high-utility points and discards low-utility ones. Approximation guarantees are proved.

- A distributed multi-round greedy optimization algorithm using partitioning that achieves near centralized greedy performance without needing a central machine.

- Evaluations on CIFAR and ImageNet showing bounding discards up to 50% of points and distributed optimization achieves â‰¥90% centralized performance.

- Demonstration of scalability by selecting subsets from a 13 billion point dataset, with bounding able to exclude 60% of points.

In summary, the paper provides new distributed algorithms for submodular subset selection that scale massively without needing central machines, with strong empirical performance.
