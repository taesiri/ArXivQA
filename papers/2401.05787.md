# [Evidence to Generate (E2G): A Single-agent Two-step Prompting for   Context Grounded and Retrieval Augmented Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05787)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs) suffer from limitations like slowness, limited context grounding, hallucination and inconsistent outputs. 
- Specifically, when applied to complex context-based reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks, CoT and its variants fail to produce grounded and verified reasoning, often resorting to unverified claims or imaginary scenarios not mentioned in the given context.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel single-agent, two-step prompting framework called "Evidence to Generate" (E2G). 
- In the first E step, the prompt explicitly asks the LLM to provide the reasoning paths ("evidences") that are mentioned in the given context, i.e. series of intermediate reasoning steps with extracted relevant rationales. 
- In the second G step, only these extracted "evidences" are passed to the LLM for generating the final output, guiding it with greater precision.  

Key Idea:
- By harnessing the power of grounded "evidence" sequences explicitly stated in the context, E2G allows more accurate, efficient and reliable reasoning. 
- It converts the complex reasoning task into two simpler sub-problems: extracting reasoning paths from context, and generating outputs purely from those paths.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes E2G, a simple yet powerful two-step prompting approach to enhance context-aware reasoning for LLMs.
- Provides comprehensive analysis of limitations of CoT methods for grounded reasoning.
- Extensive experiments across 8 context-heavy tasks and multiple LLMs show E2G outperforming CoT and its variants.
- Unlocks COt-like prompting's true potential for fast, reliable and contextual reasoning in LLMs.
- Overall, a novel technique to make LLMs reason in more interpretable, factual and context-aware manner.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key ideas from the paper:

The paper proposes Evidence to Generate (E2G), a novel single-agent, two-step prompting framework that first extracts reasoning rationales explicitly grounded in the given context as "evidence" and then uses only that evidence to guide language models to generate more accurate, reliable outputs across a variety of reasoning and generation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel prompting framework called "Evidence to Generate" (E2G) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) when working with contextual or retrieved information. 

Specifically, E2G is a single-agent, two-step prompting approach that first focuses on extracting the key "evidence" from the context - the intermediate reasoning steps explicitly mentioned that are relevant to generating the final output. This evidence then serves to guide the LLM's reasoning process in the second step, leading to outputs that are more grounded in the provided context. 

The paper shows through experiments on a diverse set of 8 context-heavy tasks that E2G outperforms existing prompting approaches like chain-of-thought in accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of reasoning. The authors also analyze the limitations of E2G.

In summary, the key contribution is the E2G prompting framework to unlock greater context-aware reasoning for LLMs by harnessing the power of reasoning evidence extracted from the context itself.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-step prompting framework called "Evidence to Generate (E2G)". What are the two key steps in this framework and what is the purpose of each step? Explain in detail.  

2. In the E-step of E2G, the prompt asks the model to "generate the answer with evidence and explanation". Why is prompting the model for evidence and explanation important compared to just asking it to think step-by-step like in CoT?

3. The paper identifies two key bottlenecks of existing prompting approaches for context-aware reasoning. What are these two bottlenecks and how does the E2G framework aim to overcome them? Explain.  

4. The E2G framework relies on the concept of leveraging "evidence" from the context towards generating the final output. What constitutes evidence in this context and why is it important to rely on evidence from the given context?

5. Compared to iterative CoT approaches like ReACT, Reflexion etc., what are some of the key advantages of the proposed single-agent two-step E2G framework, especially for tasks involving reasoning over long contexts?

6. The paper evaluates E2G on a diverse set of 8 context-driven language tasks. Pick any 2 of those tasks and analyze the improvements obtained by E2G over baseline CoT on those tasks. What insights do the results provide regarding E2G?  

7. The G-step in E2G involves re-prompting the model with the evidence extracted in E-step. What are some of the best practices proposed regarding the input context to use in this G-step? When and why is each practice useful?

8. While E2G shows strong performance on several benchmark datasets, the paper also identifies some limitations and failures of the approach through ablation studies. What are 2-3 key limitations highlighted and what scenarios cause E2G to underperform baseline CoT?  

9. The paper demonstrates the application of E2G to fact verification, open-domain QA, knowledge-grounded dialog etc. Pick any one of these tasks and propose an extension or variant of E2G tailored specifically for that task to further improve performance.  

10. The paper mentions future work involving collecting human annotations on model outputs and distilling them into open-source LLMs. What is the purpose of this future work direction and what challenges do you foresee in implementing it effectively?
