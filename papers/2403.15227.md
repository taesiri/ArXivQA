# [LeGO: Leveraging a Surface Deformation Network for Animatable Stylized   Face Generation with One Example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15227)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Creating stylized and animatable 3D avatars that encapsulate personal identity and artistic style requires extensive manual effort. Recent methods for generative 3D stylization have limitations in: 1) Generating avatars in desired topologies compatible with animation pipelines; 2) Achieving stylization capabilities beyond statistical 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs); 3) Enabling animation with blend shapes.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel method to generate highly stylized 3D face meshes by translating the domain of a surface deformation network trained on 3DMM into a target artistic style. Key elements:

1. Train a surface deformation network $D_S$ on FLAME model to generate diverse face shapes and expressions in a self-supervised manner. Enhance training using Surface-Intensive Mesh Sampling (SIMS).

2. Fine-tune $D_S$ into target style network $D_T$ using paired identity and style exemplars, combining vertex reconstruction loss, hierarchical CLIP losses, and novel style loss with pseudo-pairs to preserve animation capability.

3. Introduce Mesh Agnostic Encoder (MAGE) to map various mesh topologies to $D_T$'s latent space, enabling stylization of diverse input.

Main Contributions:

- Achieve stylized avatar generation in desired topologies, beyond 3DMM constraints, with animation capabilities. 

- Propose novel components: SIMS for improved geometry representation; MAGE for mesh agnostic stylization; hierarchical CLIP losses and style loss with pseudo-pairs for effective fine-tuning.

- Demonstrate applications like style interpolation, image-based avatar creation, and facial animation of stylized avatars.

- Comprehensive experiments validate stylization quality, identity preservation and key applications compared to baselines.

In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive framework to generate animated and highly stylized 3D avatars in desired topologies using a novel fine-tuning approach and mesh agnostic processing, with both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrating marked improvements.
