# [Learning on manifolds without manifold learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12687)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of approximating an unknown target function based only on sample data drawn from an unknown probability distribution, under the assumption that the data lies on an unknown low-dimensional manifold. This is a central problem in machine learning, where typically an optimization approach is used to minimize a loss function. However, this has some drawbacks in terms of needing assumptions on the probability distribution and target function.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new "one-shot" method to directly construct an approximation from the data without needing to collect any information about the manifold, apart from its dimension. This avoids a two-step procedure common in manifold learning of first extracting information about the manifold structure, then using it to approximate functions. The key ideas are:

- Project the manifold in the ambient space to a sphere using localized kernels based on spherical polynomials. This allows approximation capabilities studied in spherical polynomial approximation theory.

- Define a smoothness class for functions on the manifold involving restrictions to tangent spheres, avoiding needing a full atlas/coordinate charts.

- Construct a direct approximation using the localized kernels applied to the data samples. This empirical approximation converges to an expected integral operator.

- Use concentration inequalities to relate the empirical approximation to the integral operator with high probability and nearly optimal uniform convergence rate.


Main Contributions:

- A new paradigm of "learning on manifolds without manifold learning", avoiding needing to extract information about the manifold geometry.

- Introduction of smoothness classes and approximation operators intrinsic to the unknown manifold, using tangent spheres.

- A constructive one-shot approximation scheme with optimal convergence rates dependent on the manifold dimension rather than ambient dimension.

- Applicability to functions not necessarily in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, without needing optimization/training.

- Numerical experiments confirming improved convergence and localization properties. An application is shown for parameter estimation problems arising in magnetic resonance relaxometry.

The method contributes a new framework for approximating unknown functions directly from sample data drawn from unknown manifolds, with theoretical analysis and demonstrated practical advantages.
