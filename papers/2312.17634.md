## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Exploring and mapping unknown and unstructured environments is a key challenge for autonomous robots, especially in hazardous areas like underground spaces. 
- Issues like robotic odometry, path planning, and exploration need to be addressed for fully autonomous digital modelling and mapping.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops an aerial robot system called AREX for exploration and mapping. The hardware uses carbon fiber frames, brushless motors, Lidar and camera sensors, and onboard computing. 
- The software architecture has modules for odometry, exploration planning, motion planning, and control. Visual-inertial and Lidar-inertial solutions are used and compared for odometry.  
- For exploration, an RRT approach finds boundary points to unexplored regions. The strategy evaluates candidate points based on information gain, distance to point, and correlation with previous exploration direction. This maintains continuity.
- For motion planning, an optimization algorithm handles obstacle avoidance and path smoothing with feasibility constraints. Environment is represented as an occupancy grid map.

Main Contributions:
- Design of complete hardware and software architecture of AREX system for autonomous exploration and mapping
- Novel exploration strategy using direction-aware RRT to improve efficiency over traditional frontier-based methods
- Real-world demonstration of the system performance in complex scenes like forests and underground parking garages
- Detailed experimental analysis, comparison between visual and Lidar odometry, and failure mode discussion

The key innovation is the direction-aware RRT strategy that enables efficient and continuous exploration for complete coverage of unknown environments, overcoming limitations like revisiting explored areas in traditional methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an improved utility function for frontier point selection during exploration. How exactly does the new term related to exploration direction help improve exploration efficiency? Can you theoretically analyze or mathematically prove the benefits of adding this directional term?

2. The paper uses both visual and LiDAR odometry systems. What are the key differences between these two modalities for odometry estimation? What are the failure cases or limitations specific to each one? 

3. Obstacle inflation is used during motion planning to improve safety. However, determining the right inflation radius is tricky. What factors need to be considered when selecting the inflation radius? How can the system dynamically adapt the radius?

4. What are the key algorithmic differences between ERRT and traditional RRT exploration methods? What modifications were made specifically to integrate exploration more tightly into the planning process?

5. The occupancy grid map representation has some limitations in complex 3D environments. What alternative environment representations could be used instead? How would the exploration and planning algorithms need to be adapted?

6. The exploration module uses a stopping criterion based on remaining unknown space. How exactly is this unknown space estimated during the exploration process? What are some failures cases or limitations?

7. The RRT exploration selects the next best view based on a utility function. What other reward formulations could be used instead for frontier point selection? What are the tradeoffs?

8. How does the system handle dynamic obstacles or changes in the environment during exploration? What assumptions need to be made about environmental dynamics?

9. What simulator environments were used to develop and evaluate the algorithms before real-world testing? How accurately can they represent real-world conditions?

10. The system uses a hierarchical decomposition with different modules. What alternative system architectures could be used? What are the pros and cons compared to the proposed decomposition?
