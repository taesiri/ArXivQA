# [SSCAE -- Semantic, Syntactic, and Context-aware natural language   Adversarial Examples generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11833)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarially crafted inputs called adversarial examples (AEs) that cause the models to make incorrect predictions. Defending against such attacks by training models on AEs (adversarial training) improves model robustness. However, progress in generating high-quality AEs for natural language processing (NLP) tasks has been slower compared to computer vision. Existing NLP attack methods fail to properly preserve semantic consistency and grammatical correctness of the generated AEs.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a new black-box attack model called SSCAE (Semantic, Syntactic and Context-Aware natural language AE generator) that generates imperceptible and context-aware AEs while preserving semantic consistency and syntactic/grammatical correctness. 

Key steps of SSCAE:
1) Identify important words in the input text that have the most influence on the model's prediction.  
2) Generate substitute words for the important words using BERT masked language model.
3) Refine substitutes using semantic similarity scores from Universal Sentence Encoder and syntactic probability scores from GPT-2 language model to filter out poor substitutes. A novel dynamic thresholding technique is used instead of a fixed threshold.
4) Perform simultaneous substitution of multiple important words using a greedy search to generate high-quality AEs.
5) If no successful AE found, replace input text with the AE that reduces model confidence the most and repeat process.

Main Contributions:
1) A comprehensive NLP attack model (SSCAE) that generates imperceptible and fluent AEs by accounting for semantic, syntactic and grammatical constraints.

2) A dynamic thresholding technique that computes adaptive thresholds per important word to capture efficient perturbations considering non-linear distribution of language features.

3) A greedy local search method to substitute multiple important words simultaneously leading to better AEs than sequential substitution.

Experiments & Results:
- Tested on 7 text classification/inference datasets against BERT model. SSCAE achieves best attack success rate while preserving higher semantic consistency than state-of-the-art attack methods.

- Demonstrated effectiveness against other target models like WordLSTM, ALBERT etc. and on commercial NLP APIs.

- Human evaluation shows SSCAE AEs have much closer semantic similarity to original texts than other attacks. 

The summary covers the key aspects of the paper including the problem being addressed, the proposed technique, major contributions and evaluation of results. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes SSCAE, a practical black-box adversarial attack model that generates high-quality, imperceptible adversarial examples for natural language processing models by identifying important words and refining candidate substitutions using semantic, syntactic, and contextual filters, including a novel dynamic threshold technique.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes SSCAE, a practical and efficient adversarial attack method to generate imperceptible context-aware adversarial examples. The method takes into account different contextual linguistic requirements like semantics, syntax, and grammar to refine candidate substitutions from BERT-MLM to produce high-quality perturbations. Two key novelties introduced are:

(a) Dynamic thresholding to meet semantic and syntactic requirements per important word instead of using a constant threshold. This considers the non-linearity of the distributions.

(b) Word permutation-substitution technique called local greedy search to substitute multiple important words simultaneously to generate high-quality adversarial examples. 

2. It introduces the dynamic threshold technique which outperforms constant thresholding in terms of after-attack accuracy, average perturbation percentage, and average semantic consistency.

3. It introduces the local greedy search technique which outperforms conventional sequential substitutions in terms of after-attack accuracy, average query number, and average semantic consistency.

4. It evaluates SSCAE on different deep learning models over text classification and natural language inference tasks. SSCAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by maintaining higher semantic consistency and lower query numbers with comparable perturbation rates.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient adversarial attack method called SSCAE that generates imperceptible and high-quality adversarial examples by preserving linguistic features better than previous methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Adversarial examples (AEs) - maliciously crafted inputs that aim to cause a machine learning model to make incorrect predictions
- Natural language processing (NLP) - applying machine learning techniques to process and analyze textual data
- Black-box attack - an attack where the adversary has no knowledge of the target model's parameters or training data
- Semantic consistency - preserving the meaning/semantics between the original text and adversarial text 
- Syntactic correctness - ensuring the adversarial examples follow proper grammar and language rules
- Context-aware - generating adversarial examples that are fluent and coherent with the surrounding context
- Dynamic thresholding - adaptively computing thresholds for refining substitutions instead of using fixed thresholds
- Local greedy search - simultaneously substituting multiple words to efficiently find worst-case adversarial examples
- Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) - encodes text to vector embeddings that capture semantic similarity
- Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) - language model that predicts the next word given previous words

The key focus is developing a practical black-box attack method called SSCAE that generates high-quality and imperceptible adversarial examples while preserving semantic, syntactic and contextual coherence. Core novelties include the dynamic thresholding concept and local greedy search.
