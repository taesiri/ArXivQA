# [Enhancing Consistency in Multimodal Dialogue System Using LLM with   Dialogue Scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- When building a dialogue system to help users plan visits to sightseeing spots, providing the model with long input contexts compromises response quality and consistency.  
- The model must understand many contexts at once, making it difficult to generate appropriate responses.

Proposed Solution:  
- Develop a dialogue scenario to control the conversation flow and only provide the model necessary context to generate consistent responses. The dialogue starts with an icebreaker, elicits user preferences, searches for sightseeing spots matching those preferences, recommends spots with explanations, confirms the final plan with user, then ends.

- Generate responses with GPT-3.5-turbo based on a prompt containing dialogue instructions, flow, examples, and dialogue acts. Strictly following the specified flow allows properly transitioning through the scenario.

- Improve user satisfaction through motion (nodding, bowing, looking at screen) and speech emphasis on important words (names, questions) based on system utterances and user situation.

Main Contributions:
- Dialogue scenario enables stably deciding a tourism plan without dialogue breakdown by controlling conversation flow and limiting model input context.

- Response generation method provides accurate responses and sightseeing details by outputting dialogue acts and restricting input to necessary context per the scenario.  

- Motion and speech control increases user engagement through nonverbal feedback and emphasis of critical information.

Preliminary Evaluation: 
- 5th place in impression, 6th place in plan evaluation out of 12 teams
- Excels in informativeness, naturalness and usefulness but needs improvement in satisfaction and reusability.
