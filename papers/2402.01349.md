# [Beyond the Answers: Reviewing the Rationality of Multiple Choice   Question Answering for the Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01349)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Multiple choice question answering (MCQA) formats are widely used to evaluate large language models (LLMs). However, the paper challenges the rationality of using MCQA as an evaluation metric, as LLMs show inconsistencies (termed as Response Variability Syndrome or REVAS) when minor variations are made to the MCQA questions. 

- Experiments conducted on prominent LLMs like LLaMA, Baichuan and ChatGPT on datasets like MMLU and MedMCQA reveal that while LLMs achieve high accuracy on the original MCQA questions, their performance drops significantly when modifications like reordering options, varying number of options, substituting correct option with "None of the above", or converting questions to True/False format are made.

- This shows LLMs may not fully understand the semantics or knowledge required to answer the questions, rather they tend to choose the "most correct" option instead of the "solely correct" option. Their knowledge appears limited despite high MCQA accuracy.

Proposed Solution and Contributions
- Comprehensive experiments are conducted with over 50,000 test instances to analyze LLM behavior and the reliability of MCQA benchmarks. The concept of Response Variability Syndrome (REVAS) in LLMs is introduced.

- Analysis is provided on why LLMs exhibit this inconsistent behavior, attributing it to their tendency to consider multiple options as correct instead of a single option, and their training process which focuses more on learning from "correct" contexts rather than "incorrect" ones.  

- Strategies are proposed like complementary training with negative samples to enhance model robustness and refine their understanding of correctness. Overall, the study critically analyzes limitations of current LLM evaluation paradigms.

In summary, the paper conducts an extensive set of studies to demonstrate inconsistencies in LLM responses to minor MCQA variations, explains underlying reasons behind this behavior, and proposes the need for more robust evaluation mechanisms for gauging progress in LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper challenges the rationality of using multiple-choice question answering to evaluate large language models, finding that inconsistencies in model responses to variations of the same question indicate these models may not fully understand the questions or learn the requisite knowledge to answer them correctly.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It challenges the rationality of evaluating large language models (LLMs) using multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks by conducting experiments with various configurations derived from the MCQA datasets. 

2) It reveals the phenomenon of response variability syndrome (REVAS) in LLMs, where they show inconsistencies in responses even to minor variations of the same questions. This casts doubts on the reliability of using MCQA for evaluating LLMs.

3) It hypothesizes underlying causes for the observed inconsistent behavior patterns in LLMs, such as their tendency to choose the "most correct" option rather than the "solely correct" one, and their predominant learning from "correct" contexts rather than "incorrect" ones. 

4) It proposes potential strategies like complementary training with negative samples to enhance the robustness and adaptability of LLMs, in order to bridge the gap between machine and human-like understanding and reasoning.

In summary, the paper challenges the commonly used MCQA evaluation methodology for LLMs and provides important insights into their limitations, aimed at developing more robust language models and evaluation strategies.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new phenomenon called "Response Variability Syndrome (REVAS)" in large language models (LLMs). Can you explain in more detail what REVAS refers to and how it manifests in LLMs based on the experiments conducted in the paper? 

2. The paper conducts experiments by modifying answer options in multiple-choice QA tasks, such as reordering options, varying number of options, and substituting correct options. Can you analyze the results of these experiments and explain what they reveal about the capabilities and limitations of LLMs?

3. The paper transforms some MCQA instances into true/false questions to test consistency. Can you describe this experiment in more detail and discuss what the results show about the reliability of LLMs in QA tasks? 

4. The paper hypothesizes that LLMs tend to choose the "most correct" option instead of the "solely correct" option. Can you explain this hypothesis further and how the experiments on option probability analysis and multiple selection MCQA support it?

5. The paper conducts an experiment to train an LLM on positive, negative, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) instances. Can you describe the design of this experiment and what the results indicate about the learning process in LLMs?

6. The paper proposes that current MCQA benchmarks may not adequately capture the true capabilities of LLMs. Can you suggest some ways the community could develop more robust QA benchmarks that avoid the pitfalls outlined in this paper?

7. The paper defines a new metric called "accuracy-hard" to measure consistency of LLMs across answer option permutations. Can you explain this metric and its significance compared to normal accuracy?

8. The paper hypothesizes that the pre-training process focuses predominantly on "correct" sequences and neglects learning from "incorrect" ones. Do you agree? How could the pre-training process be improved?

9. The paper suggests "complementary training with negative samples" as a way to enhance LLM robustness. Can you elaborate on what this might involve and the challenges associated with generating effective negative training samples?

10. Beyond deficiencies in training and evaluation, what other factors could contribute to the response variability issues observed in LLMs when answering questions?
