# [Towards the mathematical foundation of the minimum enclosing ball and   related problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06629)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper studies the mathematical foundation and analysis of the Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB) problem, which aims to find the smallest sphere enclosing a given bounded set of points in Euclidean space. 

- The MEB problem has several other names such as Chebyshev center/radius problem, smallest enclosing sphere problem etc. It has applications in areas like clustering, machine learning, computational geometry among others.

- The paper develops a theoretical framework to rigorously analyze the MEB problem using enclosing (covering) theorems like Jung's theorem and partitioning (clustering) theorems like Helly's and Tverberg's theorems.

Proposed Solution & Contributions

- The paper first shows that the MEB problem has a unique solution in Euclidean spaces. It then highlights several problems related to MEB. 

- It summarizes key properties of the circumradius, inradius, diameter and width of a convex set and their interrelationships, which are useful for analyzing the MEB problem.

- Important results like Jung's, Steinhagen's and Perel'man's enclosing theorems that give bounds relating different geometric measures are presented. Their extensions and generalizations are also discussed.

- Key partitioning theorems like Caratheodory's, Helly's, Radon's and Tverberg's that permit the reduction of the MEB problem to a finite subset are covered. Recent combinatorial extensions of these classical theorems are also highlighted.

- The paper contributes towards developing a mathematical foundation based on enclosing and partitioning theorems to rigorously study the MEB problem. It helps better understand the geometry related to the problem and tools for analyzing it.

In summary, the paper comprehensively reviews the mathematical theory related to enclosing and partitioning of point sets and develops a framework for rigorously studying the fundamental MEB problem by leveraging these theories.
