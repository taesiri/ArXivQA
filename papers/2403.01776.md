## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Conventional analytical models for cyclic plasticity like the Radial Return Mapping (RRM) algorithm can be complex to establish and require separate fitting steps for different materials.  
- Existing data-driven approaches with neural networks exhibit instability over multiple load cycles or require complex recurrent architectures.

Proposed Solution
- The paper proposes a hybrid data-driven and physics-informed neural network model to learn cyclic plasticity. 
- It uses a simple feedforward neural network with the plastic strain and back stress increments as outputs. These are fed back as inputs to make it recurrent.
- Additional physics-informed regularization terms are added to the loss function to enforce constraints like deviatoric strains, yield condition satisfaction, no plastic evolution during elastic steps etc.

Key Contributions
- The proposed model is simpler, more efficient and more stable compared to prior recurrent neural network architectures for this problem.
- It trains a complete 3D material model with good accuracy using less data than required in literature. 
- The choice of output variables makes the model behavior explainable and enables its use as a drop-in replacement for conventional models.
- Numerical tests demonstrate the stability and accuracy of predicted stresses, plastic strains and back stresses over multiple load cycles.
- The results indicate the model's potential for extension to non-associated plasticity laws.
- An equation is derived to calculate the elastic tangent modulus automatically for finite element implementation.

In summary, the key novelty is in the design of the neural network architecture and loss function to develop an efficient yet robust data-driven technique for cyclic plasticity while retaining explainability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a hybrid data-driven and physics-informed neural network approach using a stateless recurrent architecture to efficiently and accurately model cyclic plasticity while ensuring stability, explainability, and generalizability compared to existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a hybrid data-driven and physics-informed neural network approach to model cyclic plasticity. Specifically:

- It develops a stateless recurrent neural network architecture that takes in the current strain, previous plastic strain, and previous back stresses as inputs to predict the increments in plastic strain and back stresses. This makes the model explainable and serves as a drop-in replacement for conventional plasticity algorithms.

- It incorporates physics-informed regularization in the loss function to ensure properties like deviatoric plastic strains/back stresses, compliance with yield criterion, no update of internal variables in elastic steps, etc. This improves accuracy and stability compared to pure data-driven approaches. 

- It demonstrates the approach on 3D problems with multiple nonlinear kinematic hardening terms. The model is simpler and more efficient than prior RNN approaches for plasticity modeling, while achieving comparable or better accuracy on cyclic loading tests.

- Key enablers are proper normalization, maximal off-loading of the network, stateless architecture with explainable recurrent terms, and the physics-informed hybrid training approach.

In summary, the main contribution is the development and demonstration of an accurate, efficient and explainable neural network methodology to replace traditional cyclic plasticity models. The approach is generalizable to non-associated plasticity and additional inelastic phenomena as well.
