# [Aligning Step-by-Step Instructional Diagrams to Video Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13800)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we align in-the-wild web videos of furniture assembly with the respective diagrams in the instruction manuals?

Specifically, the paper introduces a new multimodal alignment task between:

(i) Instruction steps depicted as assembly diagrams in instruction manuals 

(ii) Video segments from real-world videos demonstrating the assembly process

The key challenges highlighted are:

- Instructional diagrams can be highly abstract compared to text/audio 

- Subtle differences between instruction steps 

- Assembly actions depicted may be unclear to machines

- No standard visual language followed in manuals

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel contrastive learning framework to align videos and diagrams using specialized losses. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated on two tasks:

1) Nearest neighbor retrieval between video clips and diagrams

2) Aligning the instruction steps to video segments

The core hypothesis seems to be that the proposed losses will enable more effective video-diagram alignment on these tasks compared to alternatives. The paper introduces a new dataset called IAW to study this problem in a realistic setting.
