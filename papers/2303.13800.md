# [Aligning Step-by-Step Instructional Diagrams to Video Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13800)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we align in-the-wild web videos of furniture assembly with the respective diagrams in the instruction manuals?

Specifically, the paper introduces a new multimodal alignment task between:

(i) Instruction steps depicted as assembly diagrams in instruction manuals 

(ii) Video segments from real-world videos demonstrating the assembly process

The key challenges highlighted are:

- Instructional diagrams can be highly abstract compared to text/audio 

- Subtle differences between instruction steps 

- Assembly actions depicted may be unclear to machines

- No standard visual language followed in manuals

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel contrastive learning framework to align videos and diagrams using specialized losses. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated on two tasks:

1) Nearest neighbor retrieval between video clips and diagrams

2) Aligning the instruction steps to video segments

The core hypothesis seems to be that the proposed losses will enable more effective video-diagram alignment on these tasks compared to alternatives. The paper introduces a new dataset called IAW to study this problem in a realistic setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel method for aligning step-by-step instructional diagrams with in-the-wild web videos of furniture assembly. Specifically:

- They propose a supervised contrastive learning approach with three novel losses designed for the task of aligning abstract instructional diagrams with real-world videos. 

- They introduce a new dataset called Ikea Assembly in the Wild (IAW) containing 183 hours of assembly videos crawled from YouTube and nearly 8,300 instructional diagrams scraped from Ikea manuals. The videos and diagrams are annotated with ground truth alignments.

- They define two tasks on this dataset - nearest neighbor retrieval between videos and diagrams, and full alignment of diagrams to video clips.

- They demonstrate through experiments that their method outperforms compelling alternatives like CLIP on both retrieval and alignment on this challenging new dataset.

So in summary, the main contribution is a novel supervised contrastive learning method tailored for aligning abstract instructional diagrams with real videos, evaluated on a new challenging dataset collected specifically for this purpose. The introduced dataset itself to study this problem is also a contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new method and dataset for aligning real-world instructional videos of furniture assembly with diagrams from instruction manuals using contrastive learning and novel loss functions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this CVPR 2022 paper compares to other related research:

- The problem of aligning instructional diagrams to real-world demonstration videos is quite novel. Most prior work on multimodal alignment focuses on text, audio, and visual data. Aligning abstract diagrams to complex video is an interesting and challenging new direction.

- The proposed dataset IAW is unique and fills an important gap. While there are some related assembly instruction datasets (e.g. IKEA ASM, IKEA-FA, LEGO), none focus on aligning in-the-wild videos to manuals. IAW pushes multimodal understanding into a realistic setting.

- The method builds on ideas like contrastive learning from CLIP, but introduces specialized losses tailored to this problem. The video-manual and intra-manual contrastive losses are creative extensions to handle the nuances of aligning steps within a manual to unlabeled video clips.

- The sinusoidal progress rate feature is a simple but clever idea to inject weak temporal information into the model without strict temporal assumptions. This seems to work better than alternatives like position encodings or dynamic time warping.

- The results demonstrate superior performance over intuitive baselines like cosine similarity and off-the-shelf CLIP. The gains from 9-12% appear meaningful for this challenging task.

- The paper explores an interesting direction connecting computer vision and instructional videos. The ideas could be extended to other instructional domains like recipes, LEGO building, etc. 

Overall, this paper introduces a novel problem setup and dataset, proposes tailored techniques to address the challenges, and shows promising results. It opens up an interesting research area at the intersection of vision, language, and robotics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Incorporating additional modalities such as video narrations into the framework. The current work focuses just on aligning videos and instructional diagrams, but adding other modalities like narrated audio could provide additional useful signals. 

- Extending the task to unsupervised or weakly supervised settings. The current approach requires ground truth alignments during training. Developing methods that can learn without explicit alignment supervision or with only weak supervision would increase applicability.

- Developing downstream applications leveraging the video-diagram alignment, such as automatically monitoring and guiding users through assembly processes or enabling robot-human collaboration for instructional tasks. The alignment itself is a precursory capability - building systems that can make use of it is an important next step.

- Evaluating the approach on additional instructional video domains beyond just furniture assembly. The concepts could likely transfer to other types of how-to videos but this needs to be verified.

- Exploring different encoders or mods for encoding the video and diagram modalities. The representations used directly impact what is learned during alignment so this is an important direction.

Overall, the authors lay out several interesting avenues for extending the video-to-diagram alignment work to make it more practical, applicable, and useful in real-world systems. Moving beyond supervised lab datasets and strict one-to-one alignment formulations seem like critical next steps in this line of research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a new method for aligning furniture assembly videos found online with the instructional diagrams from the corresponding Ikea manuals. They formulate this as a multimodal alignment problem and propose a contrastive learning framework with three novel losses to handle the challenges of subtle visual differences in diagrams and variable numbers of steps across manuals. To study the problem they collect a new dataset, Ikea Assembly in the Wild (IAW), containing 183 hours of assembly videos from YouTube and nearly 8,300 instructional diagrams covering 420 furniture types, with ground truth alignments. They evaluate on two tasks: nearest neighbor retrieval between videos and diagrams, and alignment of full manuals to videos using optimal transport. The proposed approach with sinusoidal progress rate features and specialized losses outperforms compelling baselines like CLIP, demonstrating the importance of tailoring the method to the specifics of this novel video-diagram alignment task. The work brings an exciting new direction in multimodal alignment with potential applications in robotic imitation learning and human guidance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new method for aligning instructional diagrams with real-world demonstration videos, focusing on the application of Ikea furniture assembly. The authors create a dataset called Ikea Assembly in the Wild (IAW) consisting of 8,300 Ikea assembly diagrams paired with 1,005 YouTube videos of people assembling Ikea furniture. 

The key contribution is a contrastive learning framework with three novel losses to align the subtle details in instructional diagrams with video clips. This includes a video-diagram loss, a video-manual loss to only match clips with diagrams from the corresponding manual, and an intra-manual loss to encourage better discrimination between similar diagrams. Experiments demonstrate superior performance on retrieval and alignment tasks compared to alternatives. The model achieves 31.61% top-1 accuracy for video-to-diagram retrieval and aligns diagrams to video clips with 26.62% recall@1 using optimal transport.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a supervised contrastive learning approach to align instructional diagrams depicting assembly steps with segments from in-the-wild instructional videos that enact those steps. The method uses pre-trained video and image encoders to extract features from the input video clips and diagrams. These features are augmented with a sinusoidal progress rate feature to encode temporal ordering information. The encoders are then finetuned using three novel contrastive losses: (1) a video-diagram contrastive loss that distinguishes between matched and unmatched video-diagram pairs across the dataset, (2) a video-manual contrastive loss that matches video clips only to diagrams from their corresponding instruction manual, and (3) an intra-manual contrastive loss that spreads out the feature embeddings for diagrams from the same manual. During inference, optimal transport is used to align an entire sequence of video clips to an entire instruction manual based on the learned video and diagram embeddings. The method is evaluated on a new dataset collected by the authors, called Ikea Assembly in the Wild, consisting of 8,300 instructional diagrams and 183 hours of in-the-wild instructional videos.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of aligning in-the-wild web videos of furniture assembly to the abstract instructional diagrams in their respective manuals. Specifically, the authors aim to align video segments depicting assembly steps to the corresponding diagrams illustrating those steps in the furniture's instruction manual. 

The key challenges this presents include:

- Instructional diagrams can be highly abstract compared to videos.

- Diagrams may only have subtle differences between steps (e.g. placing one part on top of another).

- Assembly actions depicted clearly in diagrams can be ambiguous in videos. 

- There is no standard visual language for depicting parts/steps in manuals.

To address these challenges, the authors propose a novel contrastive learning framework to align videos and diagrams using specialized losses. They also introduce a new dataset called Ikea Assembly in the Wild (IAW) to study this problem in a realistic setting. The two main tasks they define on this dataset are:

1) Nearest neighbor retrieval between video segments and instructional diagrams.

2) Alignment of instruction steps to video clips for each video.

So in summary, the key problem is aligning real-world instructional videos to abstract diagrams by learning joint embeddings, which requires overcoming the challenges of subtle inter-diagram differences and video ambiguity.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel sinusoidal progress rate feature (SPRF) to incorporate temporal ordering information into the video and diagram representations. How is SPRF formulated and why is a sinusoidal mapping used rather than a linear mapping of progress through the video/diagram sequence?

2. The paper introduces 3 new loss functions for training the alignment model - video-diagram contrastive loss, video-manual contrastive loss, and intra-manual contrastive loss. What is the motivation behind each of these losses and how do they complement each other? 

3. The video-manual contrastive loss treats all diagrams from the corresponding manual as negatives for a given video clip. But some steps may be visually similar. Does this cause issues in training? How could the loss be modified to address this?

4. The intra-manual contrastive loss encourages diagrams from the same manual to be distinguishable. But early steps usually introduce key components that remain throughout. Does this make the loss overly difficult to optimize? 

5. The paper shows optimal transport (OT) outperforms dynamic time warping (DTW) for aligning full videos and manuals. Why might OT be better suited to this task than DTW?

6. The image and video encoders are pretrained on ImageNet and Kinetics datasets respectively. What impact does the choice of pretrained dataset have on alignment performance?

7. What are the limitations of using static instructional diagrams for representing assembly steps? Could complementary video data simulating the diagrams improve feature learning?

8. How does performance vary across different furniture types? Are some categories intrinsically harder to align than others?

9. The paper assumes access to ground truth alignments for training. How could the method be extended to learn alignments in a weakly supervised or unsupervised manner?

10. The paper focuses on Ikea furniture assembly. What are the challenges in applying the method to other complex real world instructional domains like cooking, arts and crafts, car maintenance etc?
