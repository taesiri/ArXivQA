# MM-Vet: Evaluating Large Multimodal Models for Integrated Capabilities

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main research goals are:1) To propose the MM-Vet benchmark to systematically evaluate large multimodal models (LMMs) on their ability to perform complicated multimodal reasoning tasks involving the integration of multiple vision-language capabilities. 2) To design suitable evaluation metrics for the diverse open-ended outputs generated by LMMs on this benchmark, using an LLM-based evaluator.3) To provide an analysis of different LMM paradigms (end-to-end models vs LLM+tool models) and gain insights into their relative strengths/weaknesses in terms of the capabilities measured by MM-Vet.The key hypothesis appears to be that the ability of LMMs to solve complicated reasoning tasks comes from the integration of different core vision-language capabilities. By defining these capabilities and their combinations of interest, MM-Vet aims to probe and compare models in terms of their integrated skills. The LLM-based evaluator is proposed to allow unified scoring across diverse response types.In summary, the central goals are:1) Design a benchmark (MM-Vet) to evaluate integrated VL capabilities of LMMs2) Develop suitable evaluation metrics using an LLM-based evaluator 3) Provide analysis of different LMM paradigms and models using this benchmark


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing MM-Vet, a new benchmark for evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs) on their ability to integrate different core vision-language capabilities to solve complicated tasks. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Defining 6 core VL capabilities (recognition, OCR, knowledge, language generation, spatial awareness, math) and 16 tasks requiring integrations of these capabilities for evaluating LMMs. This allows going beyond just ranking models on a single score to gaining more insights into their strengths/weaknesses.- Designing an open-ended LLM-based evaluator to score diverse outputs from LMMs, unifying evaluation across different question types and answer styles. This enables thorough assessment of both factual correctness and text quality.- Benchmarking various representative LMMs on MM-Vet, analyzing their performance to reveal insights about different system paradigms (end-to-end tuning vs tool-using) and model design choices. - Providing analysis of current models and takeaways for future work, showing top models still only achieve around 50% score on MM-Vet, indicating significant room for improving LMMs' integrated reasoning abilities.In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of MM-Vet, including its capability-based categories, open-ended evaluation, and model analysis, to support more systematic and informative evaluation of LMMs on complicated multimodal tasks.
