# [MM-Vet: Evaluating Large Multimodal Models for Integrated Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02490)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main research goals are:

1) To propose the MM-Vet benchmark to systematically evaluate large multimodal models (LMMs) on their ability to perform complicated multimodal reasoning tasks involving the integration of multiple vision-language capabilities. 

2) To design suitable evaluation metrics for the diverse open-ended outputs generated by LMMs on this benchmark, using an LLM-based evaluator.

3) To provide an analysis of different LMM paradigms (end-to-end models vs LLM+tool models) and gain insights into their relative strengths/weaknesses in terms of the capabilities measured by MM-Vet.

The key hypothesis appears to be that the ability of LMMs to solve complicated reasoning tasks comes from the integration of different core vision-language capabilities. By defining these capabilities and their combinations of interest, MM-Vet aims to probe and compare models in terms of their integrated skills. The LLM-based evaluator is proposed to allow unified scoring across diverse response types.

In summary, the central goals are:
1) Design a benchmark (MM-Vet) to evaluate integrated VL capabilities of LMMs
2) Develop suitable evaluation metrics using an LLM-based evaluator 
3) Provide analysis of different LMM paradigms and models using this benchmark


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing MM-Vet, a new benchmark for evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs) on their ability to integrate different core vision-language capabilities to solve complicated tasks. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Defining 6 core VL capabilities (recognition, OCR, knowledge, language generation, spatial awareness, math) and 16 tasks requiring integrations of these capabilities for evaluating LMMs. This allows going beyond just ranking models on a single score to gaining more insights into their strengths/weaknesses.

- Designing an open-ended LLM-based evaluator to score diverse outputs from LMMs, unifying evaluation across different question types and answer styles. This enables thorough assessment of both factual correctness and text quality.

- Benchmarking various representative LMMs on MM-Vet, analyzing their performance to reveal insights about different system paradigms (end-to-end tuning vs tool-using) and model design choices. 

- Providing analysis of current models and takeaways for future work, showing top models still only achieve around 50% score on MM-Vet, indicating significant room for improving LMMs' integrated reasoning abilities.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of MM-Vet, including its capability-based categories, open-ended evaluation, and model analysis, to support more systematic and informative evaluation of LMMs on complicated multimodal tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a brief analysis comparing this paper to other related research:

- The key contribution of this paper is proposing a new multimodal benchmark, MM-Vet, to evaluate the integrated vision-language capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). This is similar in spirit to other recent multimodal evaluation benchmarks like MME, MMBench, and SEED-Bench, which also aim to provide comprehensive assessments of LMM abilities. However, a unique aspect of MM-Vet is the focus on examining the integration of different core vision-language capabilities. 

- Most prior vision-language benchmarks like VQA, VCR, and NLVR concentrate on evaluating specific isolated capabilities like visual recognition or reasoning. In contrast, MM-Vet defines tasks requiring the combination of capabilities like recognition, OCR, knowledge, language generation, spatial awareness, and math. This is more representative of real-world multimodal tasks.

- The paper introduces an original dataset of 200 images and 218 open-ended questions annotated with ground truths. Other benchmarks rely more heavily on existing datasets. The diversity of question types and required capabilities in MM-Vet is a distinguishing factor.

- For evaluation, the authors propose using an LLM-based evaluator to score open-ended responses. This provides a unified metric across different outputs. Other benchmarks use multiple-choice formats or focus on specific answer types. The LLM evaluator allows measuring both correctness and text quality.

- The paper provides an extensive empirical evaluation of various LMM methods on MM-Vet. The insights about model architectures and capabilities are useful for guiding future research. Other papers are more narrowly focused on proposing a new model or technique.

In summary, the novelty of MM-Vet's capability-focused design, diverse multimodal dataset, and LLM-based evaluation help advance multimodal research and offer comparisons to existing benchmarks. The thorough analysis also provides valuable insights into LMM models and training.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing stronger large language models (LLMs) and advancements in multimodal training to further improve the performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) on integrated vision-language capabilities. The current top models still have significant room for improvement on the proposed MM-Vet benchmark.

- Exploring different model architectures and training techniques for LMMs to determine the optimal approaches for integrating vision and language modalities. The authors suggest ablation studies could help provide more insights on the effects of different vision encoders, language models, and training data.

- Enhancing LMMs with specialized external tools and capabilities, as the MM-ReAct results demonstrate the potential benefits of a modular, tool-based approach even compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end LMMs like Bard.

- Expanding the scope and diversity of tasks in the MM-Vet benchmark to cover an even wider range of integrated vision-language capabilities. The authors suggest future extensions like adding box localization tasks.

- Developing additional multimodal benchmarks structured around integrated capabilities to provide complementary insights to MM-Vet and facilitate more rigorous evaluation of LMMs.

- Exploring techniques to enable better understanding and analysis of LMMs' capabilities, beyond just the overall performance scores. The capability-based analysis in MM-Vet provides an initial model analysis approach.

- Research into improved evaluation techniques and metrics for open-ended multimodal tasks, building on the LLM-based evaluator proposed in this work.

In summary, the key directions are developing more advanced LMMs, expanding evaluation benchmarks for integrated vision-language tasks, and gaining better insights into multimodal models' capabilities. The MM-Vet benchmark provides a solid foundation for guiding and assessing progress in these areas.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes MM-Vet, a new benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) on complicated multimodal tasks. The key idea is that the ability to solve complicated tasks is achieved by integrating different core vision-language capabilities. MM-Vet defines 6 core capabilities - recognition, OCR, knowledge, language generation, spatial awareness, and math. It contains 16 tasks derived from integrating these capabilities, and 200 images with 218 open-ended questions. Since the desired outputs have diverse formats, an LLM-based evaluator is proposed to provide a unified scoring metric. Representative LMMs are evaluated on MM-Vet, including end-to-end models like OpenFlamingo and LLaVA, as well as LLM-tool systems like MM-ReAct. The benchmark provides capability insights beyond a single overall ranking. For instance, tool-using MM-ReAct excels in OCR, spatial, and math capabilities benefiting from external tools, while end-to-end LLaVA demonstrates balanced capabilities. The LLM-based evaluator is shown to be more consistent with human judgment than keyword matching. The benchmark and analysis motivate developing LMMs with stronger capability integration.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark called MM-Vet to evaluate large multimodal models (LMMs) on their ability to solve complicated multimodal tasks. The key insight is that the ability to solve complicated tasks requires integrating different core vision-language capabilities. The benchmark defines six core capabilities: recognition, OCR, knowledge, language generation, spatial awareness, and math.
