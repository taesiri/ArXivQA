# MM-Vet: Evaluating Large Multimodal Models for Integrated Capabilities

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main research goals are:1) To propose the MM-Vet benchmark to systematically evaluate large multimodal models (LMMs) on their ability to perform complicated multimodal reasoning tasks involving the integration of multiple vision-language capabilities. 2) To design suitable evaluation metrics for the diverse open-ended outputs generated by LMMs on this benchmark, using an LLM-based evaluator.3) To provide an analysis of different LMM paradigms (end-to-end models vs LLM+tool models) and gain insights into their relative strengths/weaknesses in terms of the capabilities measured by MM-Vet.The key hypothesis appears to be that the ability of LMMs to solve complicated reasoning tasks comes from the integration of different core vision-language capabilities. By defining these capabilities and their combinations of interest, MM-Vet aims to probe and compare models in terms of their integrated skills. The LLM-based evaluator is proposed to allow unified scoring across diverse response types.In summary, the central goals are:1) Design a benchmark (MM-Vet) to evaluate integrated VL capabilities of LMMs2) Develop suitable evaluation metrics using an LLM-based evaluator 3) Provide analysis of different LMM paradigms and models using this benchmark


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing MM-Vet, a new benchmark for evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs) on their ability to integrate different core vision-language capabilities to solve complicated tasks. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Defining 6 core VL capabilities (recognition, OCR, knowledge, language generation, spatial awareness, math) and 16 tasks requiring integrations of these capabilities for evaluating LMMs. This allows going beyond just ranking models on a single score to gaining more insights into their strengths/weaknesses.- Designing an open-ended LLM-based evaluator to score diverse outputs from LMMs, unifying evaluation across different question types and answer styles. This enables thorough assessment of both factual correctness and text quality.- Benchmarking various representative LMMs on MM-Vet, analyzing their performance to reveal insights about different system paradigms (end-to-end tuning vs tool-using) and model design choices. - Providing analysis of current models and takeaways for future work, showing top models still only achieve around 50% score on MM-Vet, indicating significant room for improving LMMs' integrated reasoning abilities.In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of MM-Vet, including its capability-based categories, open-ended evaluation, and model analysis, to support more systematic and informative evaluation of LMMs on complicated multimodal tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a brief analysis comparing this paper to other related research:- The key contribution of this paper is proposing a new multimodal benchmark, MM-Vet, to evaluate the integrated vision-language capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). This is similar in spirit to other recent multimodal evaluation benchmarks like MME, MMBench, and SEED-Bench, which also aim to provide comprehensive assessments of LMM abilities. However, a unique aspect of MM-Vet is the focus on examining the integration of different core vision-language capabilities. - Most prior vision-language benchmarks like VQA, VCR, and NLVR concentrate on evaluating specific isolated capabilities like visual recognition or reasoning. In contrast, MM-Vet defines tasks requiring the combination of capabilities like recognition, OCR, knowledge, language generation, spatial awareness, and math. This is more representative of real-world multimodal tasks.- The paper introduces an original dataset of 200 images and 218 open-ended questions annotated with ground truths. Other benchmarks rely more heavily on existing datasets. The diversity of question types and required capabilities in MM-Vet is a distinguishing factor.- For evaluation, the authors propose using an LLM-based evaluator to score open-ended responses. This provides a unified metric across different outputs. Other benchmarks use multiple-choice formats or focus on specific answer types. The LLM evaluator allows measuring both correctness and text quality.- The paper provides an extensive empirical evaluation of various LMM methods on MM-Vet. The insights about model architectures and capabilities are useful for guiding future research. Other papers are more narrowly focused on proposing a new model or technique.In summary, the novelty of MM-Vet's capability-focused design, diverse multimodal dataset, and LLM-based evaluation help advance multimodal research and offer comparisons to existing benchmarks. The thorough analysis also provides valuable insights into LMM models and training.
