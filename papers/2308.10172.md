## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VLN-PETL, a parameter-efficient transfer learning method for vision-and-language navigation (VLN) tasks. VLN requires an agent to navigate in an environment by following natural language instructions. Large pretrained models like VLNBERT have led to performance gains on VLN tasks, but fully finetuning these large models for each new task is computationally expensive. The paper explores using parameter-efficient transfer learning techniques like adapters and LoRA to efficiently tune the pretrained models for new VLN tasks by only updating a small subset of parameters. They propose two new adapter-based modules tailored for VLN - Historical Interaction Booster (HIB) which enhances interaction between the current observation and previous history, and Cross-modal Interaction Booster (CIB) which enhances interaction between the language and visual features. Experiments on four VLN datasets show VLN-PETL matches or improves on full finetuning performance while only updating 2.82% of parameters. Ablations validate the effectiveness of the proposed HIB and CIB modules. Overall, the paper demonstrates a parameter-efficient way to transfer large pretrained VLN models to new tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VLN-PETL, a parameter-efficient transfer learning method for vision-and-language navigation (VLN) tasks. VLN tasks require an agent to navigate in an environment and follow natural language instructions. Large pre-trained models have shown great success on VLN tasks but fine-tuning them for each new task is computationally expensive due to their large size. 

The proposed VLN-PETL aims to exploit the knowledge in pre-trained models while only tuning a small subset of parameters for new VLN tasks. It incorporates existing parameter-efficient methods like adapters and LoRA. It also introduces two new components specifically designed for VLN: Historical Interaction Booster (HIB) which enhances the agent's use of navigation history, and Cross-Modal Interaction Booster (CIB) which improves cross-modal interactions between language and vision. Experiments on four VLN datasets show VLN-PETL matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning while only updating 2-3% of parameters. It also outperforms other parameter-efficient methods. This provides an efficient way to transfer pre-trained models to new VLN tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents VLN-PETL, a method for parameter-efficient transfer learning in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) tasks. 

The key idea is to leverage large pre-trained vision-language models for VLN while only fine-tuning a small subset of parameters to make the training more efficient. The authors incorporate existing PETL techniques like adapters and LoRA into their model, along with two new PETL modules tailored for VLN:

- Historical Interaction Booster (HIB): Uses cross-attention between the current observation and previous history to better model temporal dependencies. 

- Cross-Modal Interaction Booster (CIB): Applies cross-attention between the language and visual features to enhance multimodal interaction.

These modules are injected into the pre-trained encoder blocks with bottleneck layers and trainable gates. Only the new module parameters are updated during fine-tuning while most of the pre-trained model is frozen.

Experiments on R2R, REVERIE, NDH and RxR benchmarks show their VLN-PETL matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning while only updating 2-3% of parameters. Ablations demonstrate the benefits of their tailored VLN modules over generic adapters. So in summary, they effectively adapt PETL to VLN via specialized modules for history and cross-modal modeling.

 Based on my reading, the key points about the paper are:

- The paper aims to explore Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) methods for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks. 

- VLN tasks involve navigating in environments by following natural language instructions. They require understanding visual, linguistic and action inputs.

  - VLN relies on historical action knowledge and cross-modal interactions, which need to be enhanced during efficient tuning.

  - Existing PETL methods like BitFit and Prompt Tuning perform poorly on VLN tasks.

- VLN-PETL incorporates existing PETL techniques like adapters and LoRA. It also uses two new modules - Historical Interaction Booster and Cross-modal Interaction Booster - to boost history and cross-modal interactions.

- Experiments on four VLN tasks show VLN-PETL outperforms other PETL methods, and achieves comparable performance to full fine-tuning while using much fewer parameters.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating a tailored PETL method for efficient tuning of pre-trained models on complex VLN tasks. VLN-PETL outperforms generic PETL techniques on VLN.
