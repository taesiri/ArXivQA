# [AI capabilities can be significantly improved without expensive   retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07413)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper analyzes "post-training enhancements" - techniques for improving AI model performance after initial training, without additional pre-training. It introduces a metric called "compute-equivalent gain" (CEG) to quantify performance improvements, measuring how much extra training compute would be needed to match the improvement. After reviewing 14 enhancements across 5 categories (tool-use, prompting, scaffolding, solution choice, and data generation), the paper finds most provide a CEG above 5x, meaning significant capability gains for little cost. For example, teaching models to use web browsers or calculators improves performance on question-answering benchmarks as much as 10-20x more training compute. Fine-tuning costs for enhancements are typically <1% of original training costs. The paper argues enhancements will continue improving capabilities, especially when combined, posing governance challenges since many actors could enhance frontier models. It suggests incorporating "safety buffers" into deployment decisions to account for potential future enhancements. Overall, cheap post-training techniques may profoundly impact AI progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the performance improvements and costs of various "post-training enhancements" that can significantly increase model capabilities after initial training, finding that most provide large capability gains for little additional compute.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is analyzing the benefits (via the compute-equivalent gain or CEG) and the compute costs of a wide range of post-training enhancements for improving the capabilities of large language models. The paper introduces a framework for quantifying these benefits and costs, surveys fourteen examples of post-training enhancements from the literature, calculates their CEG and costs, and summarizes the results in Table 1. The paper also discusses limitations in measuring the CEG, argues that post-training enhancements will continue driving progress in AI capabilities, and explores policy implications relating to potentially dangerous capabilities unlocked by enhancements. Overall, it aims to systematically assess the significance of post-training enhancements in improving AI model performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to it include:

- Post-training enhancements - Techniques applied after initial model training to improve performance, like fine-tuning or prompting methods. These are a key focus of the paper.

- Compute-equivalent gain (CEG) - A metric introduced in the paper to quantify the benefit of a post-training enhancement by estimating how much additional training compute would be needed to attain the same performance gain.

- Tool enhancements - Enhancements that provide models with new tools like web browsers or calculators. Examples discussed include Toolformer and WebGPT. 

- Prompting enhancements - Enhancements that change the text prompts given to models to improve their behavior, like few-shot prompting or chain of thought prompting.

- Scaffolding enhancements - Enhancements that structure the flow of information and reasoning in models, like the Tree of Thoughts or agent architectures. 

- Solution choice enhancements - Techniques to generate and select good solutions from among multiple candidates, like verification and best-of-n sampling.

- Data enhancements - Methods to generate more or higher-quality fine-tuning data. Examples given include InstructGPT and self-generated coding puzzles.

- Safety buffers - Proposed idea to activate safety measures at lower capability thresholds, accounting for potential future capability increases from enhancements.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using "compute-equivalent gain" (CEG) as a common metric to quantify and compare the benefits of different post-training enhancements. What are some limitations or potential pitfalls of using CEG as a metric? For example, how might it over- or under-estimate the actual capability gains?

2. The CEG aims to measure the increase in pre-training compute required to match the performance improvement from a post-training enhancement. However, the paper notes that the CEG likely varies depending on the scale of the model. How might you design an experiment to systematically measure how the CEG changes across model scales? 

3. The paper categorizes post-training enhancements into five types (tool, prompting, scaffolding, solution choice, data). Can you think of other categories that might be useful additions? What enhancements would fall into those new categories?

4. Many of the post-training enhancements discussed require some amount of fine-tuning, which has an associated one-time compute cost. If we think on longer time scales, how might the tradeoff between pre-training costs and fine-tuning costs for enhancements change?

5. The paper argues that post-training enhancements will likely continue improving capabilities in the future. What factors might drive continued progress in finding new enhancements versus diminishing returns? How could you test some of those hypotheses?

6. What do you think is the upper limit or ceiling in terms of the amount of combined capability gain that could be achieved by applying multiple post-training enhancements? How might that limit change as models get bigger?

7. The safety implications discussed assume that post-training enhancements will expand capabilities in dangerous ways. But could some enhancements potentially make models safer instead? What would that look like?

8. The compute-equivalent gains for agent scaffolding specifically are difficult to estimate. What new benchmarks or evaluation frameworks could better measure capability gains from scaffolding techniques?

9. The paper analyzes historical post-training enhancements found in the literature. What data could you collect to better understand the resources and actors involved in discovering impactful new enhancements? 

10. The API inputs and outputs of deployed models can be monitored to prevent dangerous enhancements. What are limitations of this approach? Could it be circumvented? How else could policy aim to govern downstream enhancement and deployment?
