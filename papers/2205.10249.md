# [Sampling Is All You Need on Modeling Long-Term User Behaviors for CTR   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10249)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively model long-term user behaviors for CTR prediction in large-scale industrial systems. Specifically, the paper focuses on tackling two key challenges:1. How to efficiently model long sequences of historical user behaviors (up to thousands) for CTR prediction, given the strict latency requirements of online industrial systems. 2. How to effectively model long-term user interests without losing important information, compared to using only recent/short-term behaviors.The main hypothesis is that a hash sampling-based approach called SDIM can effectively address both these challenges - it can efficiently handle long behavior sequences while retaining the modeling capacity of standard attention-based methods that use the full behavior history.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing SDIM, a simple yet effective sampling-based approach for modeling long-term user behaviors in CTR prediction. The key ideas are:- Use locality-sensitive hashing to generate hash signatures for the candidate item and each item in the user behavior sequence. - Approximate the softmax attention distribution with the collision probability between the candidate item and behavior items. Directly gather behavior items with the same hash signature as the candidate item to form the user interest representation.- Theoretically prove that the proposed method can produce very similar attention patterns as the standard softmax-based attention, while being much more efficient.- Introduce a practical framework to deploy SDIM online by decoupling the behavior sequence hashing from the CTR prediction server. This makes SDIM able to handle extremely long behavior sequences.- Conduct extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SDIM over competitive baselines in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The online deployment of SDIM brings significant business improvement.In summary, the key contribution is proposing an efficient and effective sampling-based approach to model long-term user behaviors for CTR prediction, with solid theoretical analysis and promising empirical results. The ideas and framework behind SDIM are simple yet powerful.
