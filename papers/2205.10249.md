# [Sampling Is All You Need on Modeling Long-Term User Behaviors for CTR   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10249)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively model long-term user behaviors for CTR prediction in large-scale industrial systems. Specifically, the paper focuses on tackling two key challenges:1. How to efficiently model long sequences of historical user behaviors (up to thousands) for CTR prediction, given the strict latency requirements of online industrial systems. 2. How to effectively model long-term user interests without losing important information, compared to using only recent/short-term behaviors.The main hypothesis is that a hash sampling-based approach called SDIM can effectively address both these challenges - it can efficiently handle long behavior sequences while retaining the modeling capacity of standard attention-based methods that use the full behavior history.
