# [AADNet: Attention aware Demoiréing Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08384)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Moiré patterns frequently appear in images captured by mobile devices and cameras, degrading image quality. Removing these patterns is challenging due to the dynamic variations in shape, color, and frequency of moiré patterns. Existing methods either struggle to generalize to diverse real-world data or have high computational costs for high-resolution images. There is a need for efficient and robust methods that can handle ultra high-definition (UHD) image demoiréing. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes AADNet, an Attention Aware Demoiréing Network, for UHD image demoiréing. AADNet uses an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections and incorporates two key elements:

1) Semantic-aligned multi-scale (SAM) modules that dynamically extract and fuse multi-scale features to capture information across scales.

2) Global attention blocks in the decoder to focus on relevant contexts and enhance representations.  

Additionally, AADNet uses focal frequency loss to operate in the frequency domain for removing moiré patterns.

Main Contributions:

1) First attention-aware network for UHD image demoiréing, which is practical yet challenging

2) Benchmark study summarizing limitations of existing methods, motivating the proposed baseline AADNet

3) AADNet achieves state-of-the-art on UHD dataset in quantitative and qualitative results. It is lightweight and can process 4K images at 60 fps.

The proposed AADNet effectively bridges the gap between high computational costs and robustness to diverse data, tackling the pressing issue of UHD image demoiréing. Its attention mechanism and multi-scale feature fusion provide contextual focusing and scale-awareness for superior performance.
