# [Do LLMs Work on Charts? Designing Few-Shot Prompts for Chart Question   Answering and Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10610)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Chart comprehension tasks like question answering and summarization are challenging for language models due to the need to jointly reason over textual and visual information.  
- Existing models struggle to generalize across different chart types and reasoning skills.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a unified pre-training framework called PromptChart for chart comprehension tasks. 
- PromptChart is composed of two modules - a Visual Data Table Generator (VDTG) to convert charts into structured visual tables, and prompt-based finetuning for different downstream tasks.
- The prompts are designed with explicit demonstrations and construction rules to provide sufficient inductive bias. 

Key Contributions:
- PromptChart achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple chart QA and summarization benchmarks including ChartQA, OpenCQA and Chart-to-Text.
- Ablations show the benefits of unified pre-training, visual tables and carefully designed prompts. 
- PromptChart generalizes better across different chart types and reasoning skills compared to previous approaches.
- The paper provides insights into effectively utilizing both visual and textual modalities for chart comprehension through structured visual tables and prompt engineering.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel pre-training framework to address the joint visual and textual reasoning challenges in chart comprehension tasks through conversions to visual tables and controlled prompt-based finetuning. The strong empirical results demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities over existing approaches.
