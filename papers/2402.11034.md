# [PAT-Questions: A Self-Updating Benchmark for Present-Anchored Temporal   Question-Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11034)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing work on temporal question answering (TQA) focuses on questions anchored to specific timestamps or events. Little work on present-anchored temporal QA (PATQA) which is relative to the present time (e.g. "Who was the previous US president?").
- PATQA poses challenges due to: (1) large language models (LLMs) having outdated knowledge, (2) complex temporal relationships (e.g. "before", "previous") being hard to reason about, (3) multi-hop reasoning often required, and (4) gold answers needing continuous updates in benchmarks.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce PAT-Questions benchmark with 6,172 present time-sensitive factual question-answer pairs requiring single and multi-hop temporal reasoning over complex relations.
- Questions are grounded in Wikidata facts and can be automatically updated over time by associating SPARQL queries. This allows retrieving accurate answers from the latest Wikidata dump.
- Evaluate SOTA LLMs and temporal reasoning model (TEMPREASON-T5) on PAT-Questions through direct prompting and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Main Contributions:
- Release novel self-updating PATQA benchmark where answers can be refreshed over time.
- Evaluation of LLMs and TEMPREASON-T5 highlights limitations in handling PATQA, especially on multi-hop questions (accuracy between 1.5%-15.5%). 
- Experimental analysis motivates need for new methods to improve PATQA reasoning capabilities of models.
- Provide system to automatically update answers over time for research community.

In summary, the paper introduces a valuable benchmark to advance research on present-anchored temporal QA, which poses open challenges for existing models. The ability to automatically update the answers over time makes this a unique contribution.
