# [Bipartite Graph Variational Auto-Encoder with Fair Latent Representation   to Account for Sampling Bias in Ecological Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02011)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Ecological networks linking species like plants and pollinators are prone to sampling biases based on how/when interactions are observed. This can affect analysis and interpretation of the networks.
- Common methods to analyze these bipartite networks don't account for continuous sampling covariates and focus more on categorical protected variables.
- Goal is to construct graph embeddings of the network that are independent of continuous sampling covariates to mitigate sampling bias issues.

Proposed Solution: 
- Adapt the variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) framework to bipartite graphs linking two types of nodes. Allows probabilistic embedding that captures connection probabilities.
- Incorporate the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a penalty term in the VGAE loss function being optimized. This encourages independence between continuous sampling covariates and the latent graph embeddings.
- Apply approach to real-world citizen science dataset of plant-pollinator interactions with number of user observations as a sampling covariate.

Main Contributions:
- Extension of VGAE methods to bipartite ecological networks.
- Use of HSIC with VGAE to encourage independence w.r.t. continuous sampling covariates, unlike most prior graph embedding fairness techniques.  
- Analysis showing the approach can provide different understanding of the ecological networks after accounting for sampling biases.
- First application of modern graph representation learning methods to address sampling issues in analysis of ecological networks.

In summary, the key innovation is a bipartite, probabilistic graph embedding framework that leverages ideas of algorithmic fairness to mitigate issues caused by sampling bias in the study of ecological interaction networks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a bipartite graph variational autoencoder model to obtain a fair latent representation of ecological networks that is independent of continuous variables related to sampling bias.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a bipartite extension of the graph variational autoencoder (VGAE) method for graph embedding. This allows embedding bipartite networks like ecological networks into a latent vector space while accounting for various covariates on the nodes.

2) Introducing a new way to achieve "fairness" in the latent representation with respect to a continuous variable, using the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). This ensures the latent representation is independent of certain continuous covariates that may introduce bias, like variables related to sampling effort. 

3) Applying the proposed fair bipartite VGAE to an ecological network dataset (Spipoll) to remove the effects of observer experience level and show how it changes the understanding of the network structure compared to a model without fairness constraints.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a bipartite and fair extension of the VGAE that can remove effects of continuous sampling bias covariates, and showing its utility on an ecological network dataset. The key innovation is using HSIC to enforce fairness constraints for continuous variables in the graph embedding process.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Bipartite graphs/networks - The paper focuses on modeling ecological networks which are bipartite graphs between two types of nodes (e.g. plants and pollinators).

- Graph variational autoencoders - The method adapts variational autoencoders, a type of neural network model, to learn latent representations of graphs. 

- Sampling bias - A key challenge in ecological networks is accounting for bias in how network data is sampled.

- Fairness - The paper draws on the concept of algorithmic fairness to make the latent representations independent of variables related to sampling effort/bias. 

- Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) - Used to measure and enforce independence between the latent representation and continuous variables representing sampling bias.

- Citizen science data - The method is applied to a dataset from a citizen science program monitoring plant-pollinator interactions, which is subject to observer biases.

Some other terms: link prediction, graph neural networks, graph embeddings, Spipoll dataset.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper adapts the variational graph autoencoder approach to the bipartite case. Can you explain in detail how the encoder and decoder are formulated for the bipartite graph? What modifications were made compared to the standard variational graph autoencoder?

2. The paper introduces a fairness framework to address sampling bias in ecology. Can you explain the key ideas behind this framework and how it relates to the concept of fairness in sociology? How is the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) incorporated? 

3. The simulation study generates bipartite networks using latent variables $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. Can you explain the process of how these latent variables are used to generate the networks? What is the interpretation of the latent space?

5. The paper compares the proposed fair variational graph autoencoder with an adversarial debiasing approach. What is adversarial debiasing and what are its limitations compared to the proposed approach?

6. The Spipoll dataset from citizen science raises issues of sampling bias. Can you explain what variables capture the sampling effects and how the protected variable is defined in this application?

7. The model proposed has separate formulations for the session-pollinator network versus the plant-pollinator network. Can you explain the differences and how the decoding is performed to obtain the plant-pollinator network?

8. In the Spipoll results, the fair adjustment changes the network structure and interpretation compared to the normal autoencoder. Can you explain some of the key differences observed qualitatively in the interaction probabilities?

9. The introduction section motivates the use of graph neural networks in ecology. Can you explain some of the key advantages of using GNNs for analyzing ecological networks?

10. The paper aims for a fair latent representation independent of continuous covariates. What are some limitations of existing related work on debiasing, fairness and disentanglement that this paper addresses?
