# [Integration Of Evolutionary Automated Machine Learning With Structural   Sensitivity Analysis For Composite Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AutoML systems that create flexible, variable-shaped pipelines can result in overly complex and non-interpretable solutions. This hurts adoption in real-world scenarios.  
- Evolutionary AutoML optimizers like TPOT and FEDOT suffer from long convergence times as they search large pipeline spaces.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes EVOSA, an AutoML system that integrates evolutionary optimization with sensitivity analysis (SA). 
- Local SA evaluates the contribution of each pipeline component and suggests removals to simplify the pipeline. This increases interpretability without compromising predictive performance.
- Global SA uses past pipeline performance to guide mutations and prioritize more promising pipelines. This speeds up convergence.

Key Contributions:
- Implementation of local SA to quantify node/edge importance for simplification and increased transparency of variable pipelines.
- Implementation of global SA using "appearance analysis" and meta-model to leverage past pipeline performance.
- Experimental validation showing local SA decreases standard deviation of quality metrics by 6% and inference time by 19.5% without loss in predictive performance.
- Demonstration of faster convergence using global SA.
- Extended experiments confirm applicability beyond tabular data to areas like multimodal modeling, molecular energy regression, and neural architecture search.

In summary, the paper makes variable-shaped evolutionary AutoML more usable by increasing simplicity, interpretability and convergence speed using sensitivity analysis techniques. Experiments across domains validate the real-world potential.
