# [Influence of External Information on Large Language Models Mirrors   Social Cognitive Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04812)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions seem to be:

1) How does a piece of false information impact the relevant memories in large language models (LLMs)? 

2) How do the style and authority of false information affect the behavior of LLMs?

3) How do different knowledge injection paradigms affect the way LLMs use false information?

The paper aims to investigate the mechanisms of how false information spreads within LLMs and impacts their behaviors. The key hypothesis appears to be that false information can spread and contaminate related memories in LLMs through a semantic diffusion process, having a global impact beyond just direct effects. The paper examines this by looking at how false information with different relevance, styles, and injection methods affects LLM responses to associated questions.

In summary, the central research questions focus on understanding how false information spreads and impacts LLMs, by investigating factors like relevance, style, and injection method. The key hypothesis is that false information can have a broad, contaminating effect on LLM memories and behaviors. The experiments aim to elucidate these mechanisms of spread and impact.

The results significantly advance knowledge in this important area and point out critical needs for future work on reliable and safe LLMs. The methodology and analysis set a strong foundation for follow-up studies.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following promising future research directions:

1. Develop new algorithms that can detect, trace and defend against the effects of false information globally in large language models (LLMs). The paper shows false information has a global impact on LLMs due to their distributed representations, so new robust and global methods are needed.

2. Explore more comprehensive defense strategies against false information that cover the whole life cycle of LLMs including pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment. The paper demonstrates false information can contaminate LLMs at different stages. 

3. Design new human-machine alignment algorithms that can lead LLMs to learn essential human values rather than relying on superficial patterns. The paper found current alignment methods may bias LLMs to focus on styles like authoritative writing rather than truthfulness.

4. Investigate differences in how various LLM architectures propagate and are affected by false information, to understand their mechanisms. The paper already observes differences between ChatGPT and Alpaca-LLaMA.

5. Expand the study to broader categories of false information beyond the ones tested in the paper, such as conspiracy theories, propaganda, etc. to fully understand their impact.

In summary, the main future directions are developing new robust algorithms for global false information defense, comprehensive life cycle defense strategies, unbiased alignment methods focused on human values, analyses of model architectures, and broader false information categories. Let me know if you need me to expand or clarify any part of the answer!


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates the impact and spread of false information in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Alpaca-LLaMA. The authors conduct experiments by injecting different types of false statements (e.g. fake news, commonsense) presented in various styles (e.g. Twitter, research papers) into the LLMs using two methods - in-context injection and fine-tuning. They evaluate the model responses to direct, indirect and peripheral questions related to the false information and find that: 1) False information spreads in LLMs via semantic diffusion, contaminating even indirectly related memories beyond direct impact; 2) LLMs are susceptible to authority bias, being more influenced by false info from trustworthy styles like research papers; 3) In-context injection affects LLMs more severely than fine-tuning. The findings highlight the need for robust false information defense and human-aligned training methods to improve reliability.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates how false information spreads in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and affects their responses. The authors conduct experiments by injecting false statements of different types (commonsense, fake news, fiction, math) expressed in different styles (Twitter, blogs, news, research papers) into LLMs using two methods (in-context injection and fine-tuning). They evaluate the impact by designing direct, indirect, and peripheral questions related to the false statements, and manually labeling the LLM responses. 

The key findings are: (1) False information spreads through semantic diffusion, contaminating even indirectly related memories beyond direct impact. This is likely due to the distributed representations in LLMs. (2) LLMs are susceptible to authority bias, being more affected by false information from authoritative sources like news and research. This causes wider pollution of information. (3) In-context injection of false information has a greater impact than fine-tuning, severely challenging LLM reliability even with all correct training data. The authors highlight the need for new false information defense and human alignment algorithms that address global impact and rely on content rather than style.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper investigates the spread and impact of false information in large language models (LLMs) through a series of experiments. The authors first collect various false statements covering commonsense, fake news, fiction and math. These false statements are transformed into fictitious texts in four styles: Twitter, web blogs, news reports and research papers. The false information is then injected into LLMs using two methods - in-context injection and learning-based injection (LoRA tuning). To evaluate the impact, the authors design direct, indirect and peripheral questions related to each false statement. The questions are posed to the LLMs and the accuracy of the responses is manually evaluated. By comparing results across different degrees of relevance, source styles and injection methods, the paper examines how false information spreads in LLMs and influences related responses. The main findings highlight the global impact of false information, the susceptibility of LLMs to authority bias, and their higher sensitivity to in-context injection over learning-based approaches.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is addressing is:

How does false information spread in large language models (LLMs) and affect their behaviors and responses? 

The paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of how false information impacts LLMs. Specifically, it examines three key questions:

1. How does a single piece of false information affect the relevant memories in LLMs? The goal is to understand the scope of the impact of false information.

2. How does the style/authority of false information affect LLM behaviors? This examines if LLMs are more susceptible to false info from authoritative styles. 

3. How do different knowledge injection approaches influence the way LLMs use false information? It compares in-context injection vs learning-based injection.

By conducting experiments on factors like information relevance, source styles, and injection methods, the paper aims to shed light on how false information spreads in and impacts LLMs. The goal is to provide insights to build more reliable and trustworthy LLMs.

In summary, the key problem addressed is understanding the mechanisms of how false information impacts LLMs in order to develop more robust models and defense strategies against false information pollution.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper uses both in-context injection and learning-based injection (LoRA tuning) to inject false information into LLMs. What are the key differences between these two injection methods and why did the authors choose to evaluate both? How might the choice of injection method impact the conclusions drawn?

2. For the learning-based injection using LoRA tuning, the paper experiments with both a small dataset of 80 fictitious texts and a larger dataset of 1846 texts. Why did the authors evaluate different dataset sizes, and what insights does this provide about the impact of training data scale and diversity when injecting false information? 

3. The paper finds that increasing the amount and diversity of training data in LoRA tuning amplifies the spread of false information. What might explain this phenomenon? Does this finding reveal limitations of the LoRA method itself or more general issues with learning-based injection approaches?

4. The paper generates fictitious texts in four different styles (Twitter, blogs, news, research papers) to evaluate how writing authority impacts false information spread in LLMs. Why is authority an important variable to test? Are there other text styles that would provide additional insights?

5. The paper finds LLMs are more susceptible to false information from authoritative sources like research papers. But Figure 3 shows a contradictory trend for Alpaca-LLaMA on peripheral questions. What explains this outlier result? Does it reveal something specific about Alpaca-LLaMA's training?

6. The paper manually designs 3 types of questions (direct, indirect, peripheral) to evaluate the spread of false information. What are the benefits and potential limitations of using human-designed questions versus an automated question generation approach?

7. The accuracy analysis relies on manual evaluation of LLM responses. What are some of the challenges and biases that may impact the reliability of manual labeling? Could the analysis be strengthened by having multiple annotators?

8. How robust and reliable are the accuracy results presented, given the relatively small sample of 20 false statements tested? Would a larger set of statements give greater confidence in the conclusions?

9. The paper focuses on textual false information spread in English LLMs. How might the findings change for multimodal or multilingual models? What additional experiments could shed light on this?

10. The paper provides useful insights into false information spread in LLMs, but is limited to a set of probing-based experiments. How could the methodology be expanded to do more in-depth auditing of how falsehoods spread through and impact LLMs?


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates how external information influences the memories, opinions, and behaviors of large language models (LLMs) from a social cognitive perspective. Three experiments were conducted, showing that counterfactual statements can modify LLMs' memories of relevant knowledge, subjective opinions expressed in context can significantly shift LLMs' viewpoints, and emotions in social media posts can alter LLMs' online sharing and replying behaviors. These influences mirror human cognitive biases like authority bias, in-group bias, positivity bias, and emotional contagion. The findings imply that as LLM intelligence approaches human levels, the models inevitably inherit human weaknesses. This "imitation paradox" raises concerns about model security and fairness. The susceptibility of LLMs to external influence underscores the importance of developing robust techniques to detect and defend against the manipulation of LLM memories, viewpoints, and behaviors. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the social cognitive aspects of LLMs to inform the responsible development of large language models.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates how external statements and opinions influence the thoughts and behaviors of large language models (LLMs) from a social cognitive perspective. The authors conducted three experiments to analyze the effects of external information on LLMs' memories, opinions, and social media behavioral decisions. The results showed that external information significantly influenced LLMs' memories, opinions, and behaviors in ways that mirror human social cognitive patterns and biases. Specifically, the authors found authority bias, in-group bias, emotional positivity, and emotional contagion in LLMs when exposed to external statements, opinions, and social media posts. The susceptibility of LLMs to external influences raises concerns about their safety, fairness and ethical application. The authors emphasize understanding this susceptibility and aligning LLMs with human values while avoiding risks of amplifying biases and misinformation.
