# [Data Science Education in Undergraduate Physics: Lessons Learned from a   Community of Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00961)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Data science skills are becoming increasingly important for physicists to possess, due to the rise of data-driven discovery and data-intensive experiments and simulations. However, undergraduate physics curricula have historically not included training in data science.  
- Surveys by the authors found that only 30% of physics faculty teach any data science in undergraduate courses. Main barriers are perceptions that it is not relevant, lacks room in packed curricula, and faculty lack expertise.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors created the Data Science Education Community of Practice (DSECOP) to support faculty interested in integrating data science into undergraduate physics courses. 
- DSECOP provides physics-focused educational modules introducing data science concepts and techniques, developed by grad students and faculty. The modules are designed to fit into existing courses without curriculum overhaul.
- Modules start from introductory data science and build up to advanced techniques. They cover a wide range of undergraduate physics course topics.

Key Contributions:
- Detailed analysis motivating the imperative of adding data science training to undergraduate physics education
- Overview of survey results confirming gap in data science coverage and barriers faced by faculty 
- Introduction of DSECOP community and approach to creating modular add-on educational content  
- Examples of two modules - one introductory on data processing/histograms, one advanced using neural networks to solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation
- DSECOP provides physics faculty a pathway to incrementally integrating data science into courses via modular content.

In summary, the paper clearly describes the need and solutions for adding more data science capabilities to undergraduate physics curricula, through the DSECOP program.
