# [PairingNet: A Learning-based Pair-searching and -matching Network for   Image Fragments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08704)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes PairingNet, an end-to-end deep learning network for searching and matching image fragment pairs to solve challenging image restoration problems. PairingNet leverages both contour and texture features extracted using a graph convolutional network backbone. For the pair-searching task, it encodes global features for each fragment using a linear transformer module and contrastive loss. For the pair-matching task, it fuses the local contour and texture features in a weighted manner to calculate a similarity matrix between fragments and infer adjacent contour segments. The authors also contribute a new large-scale dataset of image fragments generated by an algorithm they designed to simulate real-world tearing. Experiments demonstrate PairingNet's superior performance in both tasks compared to a baseline method and a rule-based approach, especially for more difficult fragment pairs. Ablation studies validate the design decisions regarding feature fusion and modality. Key strengths are the novel architecture, the dataset enabling future learning methods, and demonstrations of accuracy and efficiency gains on a challenging computer vision problem.
