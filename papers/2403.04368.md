# [Learning to Remove Wrinkled Transparent Film with Polarized Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04368)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses a new problem called Film Removal (FR), which aims to remove the interference of wrinkled transparent films covering industrial materials/products and reconstruct the original information under the films. This is important for improving the robustness of industrial recognition systems (e.g. QR code reading, text OCR) which often fail due to the distortions caused by such films.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper first models the imaging process of materials covered by wrinkled transparent films. The degradation is categorized into - (1) specular highlights from the film surface, and (2) other distortions like change in light transmittance.  
- An end-to-end framework is proposed with two modules - a prior estimation module and a reconstruction network. 
- The prior estimation module uses a lightweight network to estimate polarization angles that can minimize specular highlights. This processed image acts as a prior to locate specular highlights.
- The reconstruction network takes the polarization images and the estimated prior as input to restore the original diffuse reflection, thereby eliminating both specular highlights and other distortions.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies and defines the new problem of Film Removal (FR) to eliminate interference of wrinkled transparent films.
- Physically models the imaging process and categorizes the distortions into specular highlights and other degradations.
- Proposes an end-to-end solution with a polarized prior to eliminate distortions and reconstruct original information.
- Creates a real-world polarization dataset containing industrial images with and without films.
- Demonstrates SOTA performance on FR task and shows significant improvements in downstream industrial applications like QR code reading and text OCR.

In summary, the paper pioneers the concept of Film Removal which can enable more robust industrial recognition systems. The proposed method accurately models the distortions and effectively removes them using polarization cues and learning based approaches. Extensive experiments validate the solution.
