# [PathFinder: Guided Search over Multi-Step Reasoning Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05180)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes PathFinder, a novel tree-search-based decoding method to generate and refine reasoning chains from large language models. PathFinder has two main components: candidate generation using tree search to produce diverse reasoning paths, and candidate selection to choose the best path using similarity metrics. During candidate generation, dynamic decoding with different sampling methods enables branching at the reasoning step level rather than token level. Additional constraints on repetition, contradiction, and quality further guide reasoning path exploration. PathFinder incorporates novel pruning and scoring functions to improve efficiency and quality. For selecting the best candidate, PathFinder benchmarks n-gram similarity against verifier models like FLAN and GPT-3.5. Experiments on complex arithmetic and commonsense reasoning datasets show PathFinder outperforms competitive baselines by 6% on average. A key benefit is improved performance on longer, unseen reasoning chains, enabled by the tree search. Overall, PathFinder advances language model reasoning through guided search over multi-step paths.
