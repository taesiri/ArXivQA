# [Suppress and Rebalance: Towards Generalized Multi-Modal Face   Anti-Spoofing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19298)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to secure face recognition systems against presentation attacks. Recently, multi-modal FAS using multiple data modalities (RGB, depth, infrared etc.) has become popular. 
- However, existing multi-modal FAS methods fail to generalize well to unseen attacks and deployment conditions. This is due to two key issues: (1) Modality unreliability - Domain shifts can introduce noise and errors in certain modalities, propagating unreliable information during cross-modal fusion and misleading other modalities. (2) Modality imbalance - Models tend to overly rely on a dominant fast-converging modality, preventing full utilization of other slow-converging modalities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Multi-Modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) framework to enhance generalizability of multi-modal FAS by addressing modality unreliability and imbalance.
- For modality unreliability, it develops Uncertainty-guided Cross-Adapters (U-Adapter) to recognize and suppress the impact of uncertain/unreliable tokens during cross-modal fusion, preventing the spread of misleading information.
- For modality imbalance, it designs a Rebalanced Modality Gradient Modulation (ReGrad) strategy to monitor and adaptively adjust the convergence of different modalities by modulating their gradients, ensuring no single modality dominates.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first framework to address key issues of modality unreliability and imbalance for generalized multi-modal FAS
- Develops adapters guided by uncertainty estimation to reliably fuse cross-modal features by suppressing uncertain tokens  
- Designs a gradient modulation strategy to rebalance and monitor convergence of different modalities
- Establishes first large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-modal FAS generalization performance
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art cross-dataset testing performance on the benchmark
