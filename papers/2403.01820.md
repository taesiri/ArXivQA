# [Macroscopic auxiliary asymptotic preserving neural networks for the   linear radiative transfer equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01820)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper aims to solve the linear radiative transfer equations (LRTEs) which describe the transport of radiation photons in materials. Solving LRTEs is challenging due to two main reasons:

1. High dimensionality: LRTEs describe the evolution of radiation intensity in phase space (time, spatial coordinates, angles), resulting in a very high (6+1) dimensional problem. 

2. Multiscale nature: LRTEs involve multiple spatial and temporal scales characterized by the Knudsen number (mean free path). In optically thick regions, LRTEs simplify to diffusion equations. Capturing this multiscale behavior is difficult.

Existing methods like Monte Carlo methods can handle high dimensions but not the multiscale issue. Asymptotic-preserving (AP) schemes can resolve the multiscale behavior but are difficult to extend to high dimensions.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper develops a Macroscopic Auxiliary Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (MA-APNN) method to tackle both challenges in solving LRTEs. The key ideas are:

1. Derive a macroscopic auxiliary equation from LRTEs that contains information about the diffusion limit. This equation serves as a perturbation of the diffusion limit when Knudsen number is small.

2. Design an adaptive exponentially weighted loss function incorporating this macroscopic equation. As Knudsen number goes to 0, the loss transitions smoothly from transport to diffusion regimes.

3. Use physics-informed neural networks, initialized using suitable initial and boundary conditions. Hard constraints on initial/boundary conditions are also enforced.

Main Contributions:

1. New macroscopic auxiliary equation derived from LRTEs that captures diffusion limit.

2. Exponentially weighted adaptive loss function that enables capturing both kinetic and diffusive regimes of LRTEs.

3. Demonstrated MA-APNN method's ability to solve problems in up to 6+1 dimensions and in both kinetic and diffusive regimes through several numerical experiments.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in developing methods to solve high-dimensional multiscale LRTEs by combining asymptotic-preserving ideas and physics-informed neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops a Macroscopic Auxiliary Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network method to solve multiscale, high-dimensional linear radiative transfer equations by incorporating a macroscopic auxiliary equation and an adaptive exponential weight into the loss function.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel Macroscopic Auxiliary Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (MA-APNN) method to solve time-dependent linear radiative transfer equations (LRTEs). Specifically:

1) The paper derives a macroscopic auxiliary equation for LRTEs by repeatedly substituting the original equation into itself and integrating over the angular direction. This macroscopic equation contains information about the diffusion limit and can be viewed as a perturbation to the diffusion limit equation when the Knudsen number (characteristic scale parameter) is small. 

2) The paper designs an adaptive exponentially weighted asymptotic-preserving loss function that incorporates both the original LRTE residual and the macroscopic auxiliary equation residual. As the Knudsen number goes to zero, this loss function gradually transitions from the transport regime to the diffusion regime, achieving asymptotic-preserving property.

3) The initial/boundary data and conservation laws are incorporated into the loss function as regularization terms. Several numerical experiments are presented, including multiscale problems and high dimensional uncertainty quantification, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MA-APNN method in capturing both kinetic and diffusive behaviors.

In summary, the key innovation is the derivation of the macroscopic auxiliary equation and construction of an asymptotic-preserving loss function based on it within a neural network framework to resolve the multiscale nature of LRTEs. Compared to prior APNN methods, MA-APNNs have simpler network construction without needing decomposition.
