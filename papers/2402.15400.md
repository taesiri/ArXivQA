# [Faithful Temporal Question Answering over Heterogeneous Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15400)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper identifies three main limitations of prior work on temporal question answering (QA): 
(i) Methods use "soft matching" techniques based on embeddings/language models, which can lead to invalid answers that do not faithfully satisfy the temporal constraints. 
(ii) Implicit temporal questions are challenging but poorly supported by existing methods.
(iii) Methods operate on a single source (KB or text), limiting coverage and recall.

Proposed Solution - FAITH:
The paper proposes a novel temporal QA system called FAITH that addresses the above issues. The key ideas are:

(1) Explicitly enforce temporal constraints during answering to ensure faithfulness. Temporally inconsistent candidates are pruned out.

(2) Handle implicit questions by transforming the implicit temporal constraint into an explicit one, by recursively invoking the QA system itself to generate intermediate questions.

(3) Operate over heterogeneous sources (KB, text, tables) in a unified manner to improve coverage.

The method has three main stages - Temporal Question Understanding, Faithful Evidence Retrieval, and Explainable Heterogeneous Answering. Explanatory evidence is provided with each answer.

Contributions:
(1) First temporal QA system giving faithful answers with tangible provenance over heterogeneous sources.
(2) Mechanism to transform implicit to explicit constraints by recursively calling the QA system.
(3) Principled construction of a new benchmark TIQ with 10K difficult, implicit temporal questions.

Experiments show superior performance over several baselines on the TIQ benchmark and the existing TempQuestions dataset. The faithfulness and robustness across benchmarks is highlighted.
