# [Collaborative Knowledge Infusion for Low-resource Stance Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19219)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Stance detection aims to identify attitudes or perspectives towards a specific target based on a given context. It faces challenges with incorporating accurate and reliable target-related knowledge, and training data efficiency, especially in low-resource scenarios.
- Previous works rely on singular knowledge sources like Wikipedia which can be limited in scope and accuracy. Low-resource training data poses optimization difficulties for large language models. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a collaborative knowledge infusion approach to select high-quality background knowledge from both structured (Wikipedia) and unstructured (web search) sources. A knowledge verifier chooses the knowledge with maximum semantic similarity to the target.
- Employ efficient parameter learning through a collaborative adapter module with minimal trainable parameters. This retains representation capabilities of the large frozen backbone model while enabling optimization on limited data.
- Design a staged optimization algorithm to handle unbalanced stance distribution. Applies label smoothing initially, then weighted loss to align model predictions with true distribution.

Main Contributions:
- First work to infuse verified knowledge from collaborative sources for enhanced accuracy in stance detection. 
- Novel collaborative adapter module with efficient parameterization through composition of gated low-rank units, prefix tuning and attentive fusion. Enables optimization in low-resource regime.
- Staged optimization algorithm to mitigate impacts of unbalanced and limited stance data during model training process. 
- Extensive experiments validate state-of-the-art performance on multiple public stance detection datasets including zero-shot, few-shot and cross-target scenarios.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative stance detection approach to address key knowledge quality, incorporation and low-resource training challenges through collaborative knowledge fusion and efficient adaptable modeling paired with staged optimization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for low-resource stance detection that infuses verified target knowledge from multiple sources into an efficient parameter learning framework with staged optimization to address challenges like limited training data, unbalanced classes, and incorrect knowledge infusion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It introduces a collaborative knowledge verification approach to select more accurate and semantic-relevant background knowledge from different sources (both structured like Wikipedia and unstructured like search engines) to enhance stance detection models. This helps address issues like out-of-scope knowledge or false infusions that can happen when relying on just one knowledge source.

2) It proposes an efficient parameter learning framework through collaborative adaptors that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to fine-tuning the entire pretrained language model. This facilitates more efficient training on low-resource stance detection tasks while retaining the knowledge encoded in the pretrained models. 

3) It provides a staged optimization algorithm to handle challenges like unbalanced data distributions in low-resource stance detection tasks. Techniques like label smoothing and weighted loss are incorporated to improve model training.

4) It combines the above ideas - collaborative knowledge verification, efficient parameter learning, and staged optimization - to advance stance detection performance, especially in low-resource scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results.

In summary, the main contribution is a new method for knowledge-enhanced low-resource stance detection that can select reliable background knowledge, enable efficient parameter learning, and handle data imbalance challenges - leading to improved detection accuracy.
