# [Mind2Web: Towards a Generalist Agent for the Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06070)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the key points from this paper are:- The paper introduces a new dataset called Mind2Web for developing and evaluating generalist agents that can follow natural language instructions to complete tasks across diverse websites. - The goal is to build agents that can work on any real-world website, without making simplifying assumptions or only working on pre-specified websites like prior work.- The dataset contains over 2000 open-ended tasks collected from 137 websites across 31 domains. It provides real website snapshots and crowdsourced action sequences for completing the tasks.- The diversity of tasks, websites, and domains allows testing agents on their ability to generalize, including to entirely new websites or domains.- The paper proposes MindAct, a model that uses a small LM to filter website elements and a large LM to select elements and actions in a multi-choice QA format. This shows promise for using LLMs for generalist web agents.- Experiments demonstrate decent generalization ability but also substantial room for improvement, presenting opportunities for future work on more capable and generalizable web agents.In summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed Mind2Web dataset, along with the MindAct model, can facilitate research towards building generalist agents that can follow natural language instructions to complete diverse tasks across any website. The key research questions are around evaluating and improving generalization across different websites and domains.
