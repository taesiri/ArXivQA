# [Can Large Language Models Truly Understand Prompts? A Case Study with   Negated Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12711)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

Can large language models truly understand prompts, especially negated prompts?

The authors hypothesize that as language models scale up in size, their ability to understand negated prompts does not improve and may even get worse, contrary to the general trend of larger models performing better. They test this hypothesis through a case study evaluating large LMs on tasks with negated prompts.

In summary, the main research question is whether scaling up language models leads to better understanding of prompts, with a focus on probing their ability on negated prompts as a way to test true prompt understanding. The central hypothesis is that larger models will not show improved performance on negated prompts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is highlighting the limitation of large language models in understanding negated prompts. Specifically:

- The paper shows that larger language models perform worse on tasks with negated prompts, exhibiting an inverse scaling law contrary to the normal scaling law seen on original (non-negated) prompts. 

- The paper evaluates various methods like scaling model size, instruction tuning, in-context learning, and fine-tuning, but finds they are still quite limited in handling negated prompts compared to humans. 

- The paper introduces a new testbed of 9 NLP datasets modified to have negated prompts to systematically evaluate language models' ability to follow negated instructions. 

- The paper urges the community to develop new techniques to make language models truly follow instructions before relying on them for real-world applications.

In summary, the key contribution is comprehensively demonstrating the significant limitations current language models have in understanding simple logical negations, using negated prompts as a challenging testbed. The paper suggests this is an important open problem to solve as language models are deployed more broadly.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:

The paper shows that larger language models perform worse on understanding negated prompts, highlighting a limitation in their ability to truly comprehend instructions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on evaluating language models on negated prompts:

- The idea of testing language models on negated prompts is novel. Most prior work has focused on evaluating language models on their capabilities for certain tasks using regular prompts. Evaluating performance on negated versions of those same prompts provides an interesting new perspective.

- Showing the inverse scaling law phenomenon where larger language models actually perform worse on negated prompts is an important finding. This contrasts with the typical finding that larger models have better performance, and highlights issues with relying solely on scale to improve capabilities. 

- Comparing language model performance to human performance is valuable for quantifying the gap. Showing that even fine-tuning leaves a 31.3% gap to humans provides a concrete target for improvement.

- Testing a range of model sizes as well as different methods like InstructGPT, in-context learning, and fine-tuning provides a thorough investigation of current model capabilities on this challenge.

- Using a diverse set of tasks across reasoning, sentence completion, and QA covers a breadth of language understanding skills. Focusing on a specific phenomenon across various tasks strengthens the results.

Overall, this paper introduces a novel and important evaluation paradigm for language models. The thorough experiments and analysis around negated prompts uncover interesting limitations of current models and set a clear benchmark for progress on better instruction following. The results represent an advance in understanding and evaluating this aspect of language model capabilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Develop new methodologies for creating truly instruction-following language models before relying on their capabilities for making real-world decisions. The authors urge the community to focus on this before deploying LLMs in real-world applications.

- Further analyze and experiment to validate the conjecture that the inverse scaling law on negated prompts is caused by biased language modeling objectives. The authors suggest more analysis is needed here.

- Explore new pretraining objectives and methods to better balance positive and negative texts in the pretraining corpora. This could help mitigate the bias towards original prompts over negated prompts. 

- Evaluate LLMs on a broader range of tasks and instructions, not just negated prompts, to further analyze their capabilities in precisely following instructions.

- Develop new evaluation benchmarks and protocols specifically designed to test how well LLMs follow given instructions and prompts.

- Consider how to combine scaling model size with techniques like in-context learning and fine-tuning to improve understanding of concepts like negation.

- Explore whether different model architectures can better capture negation and other challenging linguistic phenomena compared to standard Transformer models commonly used today.

In summary, the authors call for more research into developing LLMs that truly understand instructions, and suggest analyses, new objectives, architectures, and evaluation methods as promising future directions. Evaluating on more complex instructions like negated prompts can reveal limitations to guide this research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a case study evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LMs) to understand negated prompts, which are prompts telling the model NOT to do something. The authors evaluate different scales of pretrained LMs (GPT-3 and OPT), LMs finetuned to follow instructions (InstructGPT), LMs provided with few-shot examples, and LMs finetuned on negated prompts across 9 NLP datasets covering commonsense reasoning, sentence completion, and question answering. The key findings are: (1) Larger LMs perform worse on negated prompts, showing an inverse scaling law, (2) Existing methods like InstructGPT, few-shot learning, and finetuning do not sufficiently help LMs understand negation, (3) There is a huge gap (31.3%) between LMs and 13-year-old humans in understanding negation. The authors highlight this as a critical limitation of current LMs that needs to be addressed before deploying them for real-world applications. Overall, the work urges the community to develop new techniques to make LMs truly follow instructions and not just rely on scaling up model size.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper evaluates the ability of large language models (LMs) to understand negated prompts. The authors test LMs on 9 datasets with original and negated prompts. They find that larger LMs perform worse on negated prompts, showing an inverse scaling law. Specifically, the average performance of LMs on original and negated prompts is around 50%, indicating they cannot distinguish between the two. The authors conjecture this is due to biases in the pretraining data. They also test methods like InstructGPT, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. While fine-tuning helps, it degrades original task performance. Comparing to human evaluations, there is a 31.3% performance gap between humans and the best LM methods. 

In conclusion, this paper highlights a critical limitation of current LMs - their inability to precisely follow negated instructions. As LMs are deployed in real-world applications, it is important they understand instructions accurately. The authors urge developing new methods so LMs can truly follow given prompts before relying on them for real-world decisions. Overall, this is an important case study highlighting LLMs need better capabilities to understand concepts like negation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper describes a study that evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to understand negated prompts. The authors construct tasks using 9 datasets - 3 for commonsense reasoning, 3 for sentence completion, and 3 for question answering. They evaluate models on the original prompts and negated versions of the prompts, where the negation reverses the meaning (e.g. "Generate a correct answer" vs "Generate an incorrect answer"). 

The main method is to test different LLMs on these prompt pairs across varying model sizes and training methodologies. Models tested include pretrained LLMs like GPT-3, LLMs finetuned on instructions (InstructGPT), LLMs provided few-shot examples, and LLMs finetuned specifically on negated prompts. The authors find that in contrast to performance on original prompts, model performance on negated prompts decreases as model size increases, showing an "inverse scaling law." No existing methods fully close the gap with human performance. The authors conclude that current LLMs have limitations in precisely understanding instructions, especially negated ones, which should be addressed before using them in real-world applications.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem the authors are addressing is the limitation of current large language models in truly understanding negated prompts. The key questions they aim to answer are:

1. How does scaling the size of language models affect their ability to understand negated prompts? 

2. Can models specifically trained to follow instructions (like InstructGPT) better understand negated prompts?

3. Can techniques like in-context learning or fine-tuning help mitigate this issue?

4. How do current language models compare to actual humans in understanding negations? What is the performance gap?

The authors find that larger language models perform worse on negated prompts, showing an "inverse scaling law." Models trained to follow instructions also struggle with negated prompts. Techniques like in-context learning and fine-tuning can help in certain cases but lead to trade-offs. Overall, there is still a large gap compared to human performance, highlighting a limitation of current language models.

In summary, the key problem is that language models today still struggle to truly understand the concept of negation and follow negated instructions, despite their strong performance on many NLP benchmarks. The authors aim to analyze this issue systematically across model scales, training techniques, and in comparison to humans.
