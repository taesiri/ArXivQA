# [SpikeReveal: Unlocking Temporal Sequences from Real Blurry Inputs with   Spike Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09486)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SpikeReveal: Unlocking Temporal Sequences from Real Blurry Inputs with Spike Streams":

Problem:
- Traditional cameras produce blurry images when capturing fast motion due to exposure constraints. Recovering the dynamic motion trajectory and sharp image details from a single blurry image is an ill-posed problem.
- Existing learning-based spike-guided motion deblurring methods rely on synthetic training data and degrade on real-world data due to domain gaps. They are also limited by the quality of reconstructed sharp images used as ground truth during training.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a self-supervised spike-guided motion deblurring framework (S-SDM) that can recover sharp image sequences from real-world blurry inputs aided by spike streams.
- They first formulate a Spike-guided Deblurring Model (SDM) based on the theoretical image formation in spike cameras. 
- To make SDM robust to spike noise and resolution mismatches, a processing pipeline with denoising and super-resolution networks is constructed in a self-supervised manner without ground truth sharp images.
- A Lightweight Deblur Network (LDN) is further designed and trained to mimic the pipeline using the reconstructed sequence as supervision. Knowledge distillation and reblurring losses are introduced to improve LDN.

Main Contributions:
- First self-supervised framework for spike-guided motion deblurring that bridges the gap between synthetic and real-world data distributions.
- Theoretical analysis and formulation of the Spike-guided Deblurring Model linking blurry images and spike streams. 
- A real-world blur dataset collected using a calibrated RGB-Spike camera system, enabling benchmarking of motion deblurring methods.
- Comprehensive experiments showing S-SDM produces high quality sharp sequences from real blurry inputs that generalize better than existing supervised approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a self-supervised framework called S-SDM for reconstructing sharp image sequences from a single blurry image using the guidance of a low-resolution spike camera stream, which achieves superior generalization on real-world datasets compared to previous supervised methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes the first self-supervised framework (S-SDM) for spike-guided motion deblurring, which can reconstruct sharp image sequences from real-world blurry inputs and corresponding spike streams. This overcomes the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between synthetic and real datasets in previous supervised methods.

2. It performs an in-depth theoretical analysis of the fusion between the spike stream and blurry image, leading to the development of the Spike-guided Deblurring Model (SDM). 

3. It constructs an RGB-Spike binocular system and proposes the first real-world spatially-temporally calibrated spike blur dataset (RSB) for evaluating spike-guided deblurring methods.

4. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the superior generalization ability of the proposed self-supervised S-SDM framework compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of the first self-supervised framework for spike-guided motion deblurring, which demonstrates superior performance on real-world data compared to existing supervised approaches.
