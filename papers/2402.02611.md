# [PuzzleBench: Can LLMs Solve Challenging First-Order Combinatorial   Reasoning Problems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02611)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper explores the ability of large language models (LLMs) to solve challenging first-order combinatorial reasoning problems, referred to as "puzzles" or FCoRe (First-order Combinatorial Reasoning) problems. Examples include Sudoku, Futoshiki, Dosun Fuwari, etc.
- These problems have an underlying structure described in natural language, can be instantiated to varying sized inputs, and often involve extensive search, planning and reasoning to solve. 
- Prior works have not systematically studied such problems in the context of LLMs. Existing methods also struggle to effectively solve them.

Contributions:
- The paper presents PuzzleBench, a new benchmark of 31 such puzzles to enable research on this.
- It shows that standard prompting techniques perform rather poorly on this benchmark, highlighting limitations of LLMs' reasoning abilities.

Proposed Solution - Puzzle-LM:
- Combines strengths of program-aided LMs (use programs to exploit structure) and symbolic solver aided LMs (leverage solvers for complex reasoning).
- Uses LLM to generate input-agnostic Python programs to convert input puzzle to symbolic representation for a solver, and to convert solver's output to desired solution format.
- Allows exploiting structure while offloading complex reasoning to solvers.
- Shows providing feedback using solved examples significantly boosts performance.

Key Results:
- Puzzle-LM outperforms few-shot prompting by 13.85%, PAL by 12.5% and Logic-LM by 34.44% on the PuzzleBench benchmark.
- Feedback from solved examples improves reasoning ability by 25.36% over no feedback.

The paper offers insights into limitations of current LLMs' reasoning abilities on such structured problems, and demonstrates effectiveness of the proposed techniques to address them.
