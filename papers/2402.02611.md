# [PuzzleBench: Can LLMs Solve Challenging First-Order Combinatorial   Reasoning Problems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02611)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper explores the ability of large language models (LLMs) to solve challenging first-order combinatorial reasoning problems, referred to as "puzzles" or FCoRe (First-order Combinatorial Reasoning) problems. Examples include Sudoku, Futoshiki, Dosun Fuwari, etc.
- These problems have an underlying structure described in natural language, can be instantiated to varying sized inputs, and often involve extensive search, planning and reasoning to solve. 
- Prior works have not systematically studied such problems in the context of LLMs. Existing methods also struggle to effectively solve them.

Contributions:
- The paper presents PuzzleBench, a new benchmark of 31 such puzzles to enable research on this.
- It shows that standard prompting techniques perform rather poorly on this benchmark, highlighting limitations of LLMs' reasoning abilities.

Proposed Solution - Puzzle-LM:
- Combines strengths of program-aided LMs (use programs to exploit structure) and symbolic solver aided LMs (leverage solvers for complex reasoning).
- Uses LLM to generate input-agnostic Python programs to convert input puzzle to symbolic representation for a solver, and to convert solver's output to desired solution format.
- Allows exploiting structure while offloading complex reasoning to solvers.
- Shows providing feedback using solved examples significantly boosts performance.

Key Results:
- Puzzle-LM outperforms few-shot prompting by 13.85%, PAL by 12.5% and Logic-LM by 34.44% on the PuzzleBench benchmark.
- Feedback from solved examples improves reasoning ability by 25.36% over no feedback.

The paper offers insights into limitations of current LLMs' reasoning abilities on such structured problems, and demonstrates effectiveness of the proposed techniques to address them.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a new benchmark of challenging puzzles requiring first-order combinatorial reasoning and proposes Puzzle-LM, a method that combines large language models with program interpreters and symbolic solvers to incrementally convert these puzzles to symbolic representations which are then solved by the symbolic solver for improved reasoning performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting a new dataset called \texttt{\OurDatasetName} comprising of $\NUMPUZZLESPUZZLEBENCH$ challenging first-order combinatorial reasoning problems posed in natural language. 

2. Proposing a new approach called \texttt{\OurMethodName} which combines large language models with both program interpreters and symbolic solvers to solve these kinds of challenging, structured first-order reasoning problems. 

3. Showing how feedback from smaller solved instances can help improve the reasoning ability of language models on these problems.

4. Providing extensive experimentation and analysis that offers new insights into the reasoning abilities of large language models.

So in summary, the key contributions are a new challenging benchmark for testing reasoning, a new method for structured reasoning that combines LLMs with programs and solvers, an analysis of how feedback helps, and new insights into LLM reasoning abilities.

The paper explores the ability of large language models to solve challenging first-order combinatorial reasoning problems, referring to them as "puzzles". It presents a new dataset called PuzzleBench containing 31 such puzzles. The paper proposes a new method called Puzzle-LM that combines LLMs with both program interpreters and symbolic solvers to solve these kinds of problems. It also shows how feedback from solved examples can help improve the reasoning performance. The key terms reflect this focus on using LLMs and additional tools to tackle complicated, structured reasoning tasks as represented in the PuzzleBench benchmark.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes combining program-aided language models with symbolic solvers. What are the key advantages and limitations of each approach on their own for solving challenging combinatorial reasoning problems? How does combining them help address the limitations?

2. The paper introduces the concept of "FCoRe" (First-order Combinatorial Reasoning) problems. What makes these problems particularly challenging compared to other reasoning tasks studied in prior work? What properties do they have that the proposed method is designed to exploit?  

3. Explain in detail the full pipeline proposed in Puzzle-LM for solving a new FCoRe problem instance. What role does each component (LLM, Python program, symbolic solver, etc.) play and how do they fit together?

4. The method relies on the LLM to generate input-agnostic Python programs for formulating and interpreting the symbolic representation. Why is it important that these programs are input-agnostic? What techniques are used to achieve this?

5. Describe the prompting strategy and feedback mechanisms used to iteratively improve the Python programs generated by the LLM. Why is feedback on smaller training instances useful?

6. The paper shows that multiple reruns of Puzzle-LM lead to accuracy improvements. Why might different runs produce different quality programs and solutions? How could the prompting be improved to reduce the need for reruns?  

7. For which types of FCoRe problems might generating the symbolic representation be particularly challenging? What modifications or enhancements to Puzzle-LM could help in those cases?

8. The performance gains of Puzzle-LM over baselines are quantified. What are some possible reasons why Puzzle-LM substantially outperforms Logic-LM despite both using symbolic solvers?

9. Puzzle-LM combines strengths of program-aided LMs and symbolic solver integration. Can you think of other ways these approaches could be blended, perhaps with other techniques like in-context learning?

10. The paper analyzes Puzzle-LM's performance and discusses limitations. What enhancements do you think would be most impactful for improving its reasoning abilities further? What specifically is still lacking?
