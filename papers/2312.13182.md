# [Task-oriented Semantics-aware Communications for Robotic Waypoint   Transmission: the Value and Age of Information Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13182)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Controlling mobile robots like UAVs remotely requires wireless connectivity. But existing 5G/6G research focuses mainly on improving communication performance while ignoring robotics control. Robotics research assumes ideal communication without considering packet loss or latency. So there is a gap in jointly optimizing communication and control for robotic tasks.

- This paper specifically considers a real-time UAV waypoint transmission task where a base station (BS) periodically sends control and command (C&C) data to a UAV to maneuver it to fly along a trajectory. The goal is to minimize the error between the UAV's actual trajectory and the target trajectory by collaboratively optimizing communication and control procedures.

Proposed Solution - Task-oriented and Semantics-aware Communication in Robotic Control (TSRC):

BS Side:
- DeepPro - DRL-based C&C data generator to generate optimal C&C data. Proactive repetition scheme repeats transmissions to increase successful reception probability.  

UAV Side:  
- Value of Information (VoI) and Age of Information (AoI) based Queue Ordering Mechanism (VA-QOM) - Reorganizes queue based on semantic information extracted from VoI and AoI to prioritize important packets.

- VoI defined based on proximity between estimated positions from executing C&C packet vs target position. AoI defines freshness of packet.

Overall TSRC Framework:
- Semantic Level: DeepPro facilitates appropriate C&C data generation and transmission. VA-QOM utilizes semantic information to order queue. 

- Effectiveness Level: Mean square error between actual and target trajectories as performance metric.

Main Contributions:

1) Joint communication and control framework focused on robotic task performance.

2) Novel BS and UAV side designs - DeepPro and VA-QOM.

3) Outperforms traditional framework, achieving 91.5% lower MSE between actual and target UAV trajectories.

In summary, the key innovation is a joint communication and robotics control framework incorporating semantic as well as effectiveness considerations tailored for robotic tasks. Simulation results validate significant performance gains.
