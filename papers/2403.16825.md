# [Weak Convergence Analysis of Online Neural Actor-Critic Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16825)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the convergence properties of online neural network actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning. Actor-critic methods simultaneously learn a policy function ("actor") and a value function ("critic") to optimize rewards in a Markov decision process (MDP). Analyzing the convergence is challenging due to the non-convex neural networks, complex feedback between the actor and critic updates, and the simultaneous online updates that change the data distribution. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proves that as the number of neural network units and training iterations go to infinity, the neural network actor and critic converge to the solution of a random ordinary differential equation (ODE). The limit ODE is derived using a Poisson equation to control the fluctuation terms from the non-i.i.d. data samples. Weak convergence techniques are then used to show the neural networks converge to this ODE. Further analysis of the limit ODE shows that the critic network converges to the true value function, which provides the actor network an asymptotically unbiased estimate of the policy gradient. This enables proving the actor network converges to a stationary point of the expected reward.

Main Contributions:
- Derives a limit ODE for online neural network actor-critic algorithms using a Poisson equation and weak convergence methods. Prior work studied convergence to ODEs for batch updates.
- Proves the critic network in the limit ODE converges to the true value function despite biased estimates from simultaneous actor updates.  
- Shows the actor network converges to a stationary point leveraging the critic's convergence to the true value function.
- Provides convergence guarantees for online updates with careful selection of actor and critic learning rates.
- Develops a mathematical framework incorporating weak convergence and Poisson equations to analyze neural network reinforcement learning algorithms.

The key innovation is using weak convergence to prove convergence to a limit ODE, which provides a trajectory viewpoint. The analysis of the resultant nonlinear limit ODE is also novel and establishes convergence guarantees for the online actor-critic algorithm.
