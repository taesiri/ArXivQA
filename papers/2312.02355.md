# [When is Offline Policy Selection Sample Efficient for Reinforcement   Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02355)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of offline policy selection (OPS) in reinforcement learning. OPS refers to selecting the best policy among a set of candidate policies learned from an offline dataset, without any additional interactions with the environment. OPS is critical for deploying offline RL in real-world applications, but there is little understanding on the fundamental limits and feasibility of OPS. The paper aims to provide clarity on when sample efficient OPS is possible.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1) The paper first shows that OPS inherits the same worst-case hardness results as off-policy policy evaluation (OPE). Specifically, it proves that the sample complexity lower bound of OPE also applies to OPS. This means OPS cannot be more sample efficient than OPE in the worst case without additional assumptions.

2) The paper then proposes a Bellman error (BE) based method called Identifiable BE Selection (IBES) for OPS. Compared to OPE methods, IBES has stricter requirements on data coverage and quality of candidate policies, but can be more sample efficient if satisfied. IBES uses an auxiliary function to predict the Bellman error and enables model selection to balance bias and variance.

3) The paper provides a sample complexity analysis for IBES, and empirically compares IBES with OPE methods under different data conditions. The results show IBES can be more sample efficient but also highlight its limitations.

4) The paper demonstrates the difficulty of OPS on Atari games, where none of the OPS methods consistently outperform random selection. This highlights that many offline RL papers report overly optimistic results by using the true policy performance to select hyperparameters, which is infeasible in practice.

In summary, the paper formally establishes connections between OPS and OPE, proposes a sample efficient BE selection method, and empirically investigates OPS to demonstrate its challenges. The results provide guidance on the feasibility of OPS and suggest directions for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper studies the fundamental limits of offline policy selection for reinforcement learning by connecting it to off-policy policy evaluation and Bellman error estimation, providing hardness results, sample complexity analyses, and an empirical investigation of different methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A hardness result showing that the sample complexity of the offline policy selection (OPS) problem is lower-bounded by the sample complexity of the off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) problem. This formally shows that OPS inherits the same worst-case hardness as OPE, and that no OPS method can be more sample efficient than OPE without additional assumptions.

2. The proposal of an OPS method based on Bellman error (BE) called Identifiable BE Selection (IBES) that has a straightforward way to select its own hyperparameters. The paper shows that IBES can provide improved sample efficiency over OPE methods like fitted Q evaluation, but requires stricter assumptions on the quality of the candidate policies and data coverage compared to OPE methods.

3. An empirical study that systematically compares OPE and BE-based methods for OPS with varying sample sizes. The study shows IBES consistently outperforms other BE methods in terms of sample efficiency. The study also highlights the difficulty of OPS on a benchmark Atari dataset, showing that common OPS methods suffer high regret compared to using tuned hyperparameters from the environment.

In summary, the main contributions are formal hardness results for OPS, a new BE-based OPS algorithm with auto-tuning capabilities, and an empirical analysis that compares different methods and settings for the OPS problem.
