# [When is Offline Policy Selection Sample Efficient for Reinforcement   Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02355)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of offline policy selection (OPS) in reinforcement learning. OPS refers to selecting the best policy among a set of candidate policies learned from an offline dataset, without any additional interactions with the environment. OPS is critical for deploying offline RL in real-world applications, but there is little understanding on the fundamental limits and feasibility of OPS. The paper aims to provide clarity on when sample efficient OPS is possible.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1) The paper first shows that OPS inherits the same worst-case hardness results as off-policy policy evaluation (OPE). Specifically, it proves that the sample complexity lower bound of OPE also applies to OPS. This means OPS cannot be more sample efficient than OPE in the worst case without additional assumptions.

2) The paper then proposes a Bellman error (BE) based method called Identifiable BE Selection (IBES) for OPS. Compared to OPE methods, IBES has stricter requirements on data coverage and quality of candidate policies, but can be more sample efficient if satisfied. IBES uses an auxiliary function to predict the Bellman error and enables model selection to balance bias and variance.

3) The paper provides a sample complexity analysis for IBES, and empirically compares IBES with OPE methods under different data conditions. The results show IBES can be more sample efficient but also highlight its limitations.

4) The paper demonstrates the difficulty of OPS on Atari games, where none of the OPS methods consistently outperform random selection. This highlights that many offline RL papers report overly optimistic results by using the true policy performance to select hyperparameters, which is infeasible in practice.

In summary, the paper formally establishes connections between OPS and OPE, proposes a sample efficient BE selection method, and empirically investigates OPS to demonstrate its challenges. The results provide guidance on the feasibility of OPS and suggest directions for future work.
