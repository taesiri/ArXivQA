# [DiffusionPCR: Diffusion Models for Robust Multi-Step Point Cloud   Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03053)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DiffusionPCR: Diffusion Models for Robust Multi-Step Point Cloud Registration":

Problem:
Point cloud registration (PCR) aims to estimate the rigid transformation between two point clouds. Existing methods like ICP fail in challenging cases with low overlap between point clouds. Recent learning-based methods establish correspondences using transformers and robust estimators but still struggle in low-overlap scenarios. 

Solution:
The paper proposes DiffusionPCR, which formulates PCR as a conditional diffusion process on the rigid transformation. It maps the noisy output of an off-the-shelf PCR model to ground truth in a multi-step manner, refining the registration.  

Key ideas:
- Forward process: Degrade ground truth rigid transformation to prior PCR model's prediction using spherical linear interpolation for rotation and linear interpolation for translation.
- Reverse process: GeoTransformer backbone refines prediction over multiple steps. Proposed one-way cross-attention focuses on estimated overlapping regions.  
- Sampling: Use deterministic DDIM for fast sampling with fewer steps.

Contributions:
- First PCR method based on diffusion models and demonstration of their effectiveness.
- One-way cross-attention mechanism focusing on aligned regions for better feature learning.
- Diffusion pipeline tailored for PCR using spherical space, prior distribution convergence, and ensemble of expert denoisers.

Results: 
- State-of-the-art registration recall rates of 95.3% and 81.6% on 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch datasets, significantly outperforming prior arts.
- Generalizes to different types of priors beyond trained distribution.
- Achieves 99.8% recall on KITTI dataset, on par with state-of-the-art.

The summary covers the core problem tackled, the proposed diffusion-based solution, key technical innovations, contributions over prior works, and results demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. Please let me know if you need any clarification or would like me to expand on any part of the summary further.
