# [TransFill: Reference-guided Image Inpainting by Merging Multiple Color   and Spatial Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15982)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we effectively fill in large holes in a target image by referring to another source image of the same scene, even when there are challenges like parallax, color differences, misalignments, etc. between the images?

The key hypothesis is that by estimating multiple homographies to align different regions, learning color and spatial transformers, and fusing with single image inpainting, they can address these challenges and produce high quality inpainting results by transferring content from the source image.

In summary, the paper focuses on reference-guided image inpainting - using a second image of the same scene as a reference to help fill in large holes or remove objects in the target image. The core problems are dealing with things like parallax, lighting/color differences, and alignment issues between the image pair. Their proposed approach TransFill aims to tackle these challenges.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing TransFill, a multi-homography estimation pipeline to obtain multiple transformations of a source image, where each transformation aligns a specific region of the source to the target image. 

2. Proposing a Color-Spatial Transformer module to simultaneously perform color matching and spatial alignment between the source and target images after initial homography warping. This uses concepts like deep bilateral grids and spatial transformer networks.

3. Learning to selectively combine the multiple transformed proposals from the source image along with the output of a single image inpainting method. This is done using modules like Single-Proposal Fusion and Multi-Proposal Fusion. 

4. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on reference-guided inpainting, especially for holes containing complicated depth/parallax, by effectively leveraging multiple source proposals.

5. Demonstrating the method on a variety of real-world user photos with challenging issues like large baselines, rotations, and lighting differences between source and target.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be a full pipeline for multi-homography estimation, deep image warping, and selective fusion to achieve high-quality reference-guided inpainting results even for complex real-world image pairs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes TransFill, a multi-homography transformed fusion method to fill holes in a target image by referring to another source image, through aligning the source to the target using multiple homographies guided by estimated depth, learning color and spatial adjustments, and selectively merging proposals.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in image inpainting:

- This paper focuses on reference-guided image inpainting, where an additional source image is used as a reference to fill in missing regions. Much prior work has focused on single image inpainting without any reference. Using a reference image provides more information to plausibly fill larger or more complex holes.

- The method uses multiple homographies to align different regions of the source to the target based on estimated depth. This differs from many inpainting methods that rely solely on a global homography or affine warp. Accounting for parallax helps fill holes with diverse depths.

- A learned color and spatial transformer is proposed to refine the alignment and color matching of the warped source images. This goes beyond just warping by addressing color inconsistencies and residual misalignments.

- The pipeline incorporates single image inpainting to complete any remaining holes unfilled by the aligned source images. Integrating single image inpainting helps address limitations of the reference-guided approach.

- For evaluation, the paper uses a dataset of real image pairs gathered from real estate video footage. Many prior works use synthetic hole masks or simpler datasets. Testing on real challenging examples helps demonstrate the method's practical utility.

- Compared to recent video inpainting methods like OPN and DFG, this paper shows advantages of using multiple homographies and learned refinement for one reference image pair rather than simpler warps or patch propagations.

In summary, this paper pushes reference-guided inpainting to handle more complex alignments and appearances than prior works. The experiments on real data for an important application like object removal demonstrate these advantages in practice.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:

1. Improving the multi-homography proposal module to better handle challenging cases like extreme low-light or lack of texture, and extreme viewpoint changes between images. 

2. Exploring specialized models that reason about lighting changes to better transfer color in cases with dramatically different lighting environments, like day to night.

3. Optimizing the single image inpainting module jointly with the overall multi-fusion pipeline instead of using a fixed pre-trained model like ProFill. This could lead to further improvements in quality.

4. Investigating principled ways to incorporate user interaction, for example by allowing users to eliminate certain proposals to avoid artifacts or undesirable results. The correlation between learned masks provides flexibility for user editing.

5. Extending the approach to video inpainting, which may require adapting the initialization and transformation modules.

6. Handling larger regions of the source image that may not exist in the transformed view, perhaps by learning partial masks specifically for hole filling.

7. Applying the multi-homography fusion approach to other image editing tasks beyond inpainting.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the robustness, image quality, and user interactivity of the approach, as well as extending it to video and other applications. The core ideas of fusing multiple homography proposals with learned color and spatial transformations appear promising for many image editing scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes TransFill, a multi-homography transformed fusion method for reference-guided image inpainting. Given a target image with a hole region to be filled and a source image sharing scene content, the method first estimates multiple homographies to align different regions of the source to the target. It then learns a color transformer and spatial transformer to adjust color inconsistencies and misalignments in each aligned source image. A single-proposal fusion module merges each transformed source proposal with the output of a single-image inpainting method and learns confidence maps. Finally, a multi-proposal fusion module selectively combines all the merged proposals into a final coherent inpainting result. Experiments demonstrate superior performance to inpainting baselines, especially for large holes with parallax, by transforming and fusing content from the reference image.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper proposes TransFill, a method for reference-guided image inpainting. The goal is to fill in missing regions (holes) in a target image by referring to a separate source image that depicts the same scene. The method involves estimating multiple homographies to align the source to the target, learning color and spatial transformations to adjust the aligned source images, and fusing the transformed proposals together. 

First, the method estimates multiple homographies between the target and source images to account for parallax effects from scene content at different depths. Each homography aims to align a different region in the hole. Next, a color-spatial transformer module adjusts each aligned source image to match the target in color and spatial alignment. This employs a deep bilateral grid for color transformation and a learned offset field for spatial adjustments. Finally, the transformed source proposals are merged with the output of a single-image inpainting method through learned fusion weights. The approach is evaluated on real estate and user-provided image pairs, outperforming inpainting methods relying on a single image as well as alternatives like optical flow propagation. Experiments validate the design choices and demonstrate improved spatial alignment, color consistency, and faithfulness to source image content.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes TransFill, a reference-guided image inpainting method to fill in missing regions (holes) in a target image by referring to a separate source image of the same scene. The method first estimates multiple homographies to align different regions of the source to the target, addressing issues like parallax. Each homography-aligned source image is then refined using a learned color transformer and spatial transformer to adjust color inconsistencies and residual misalignments. These refined proposals are compared to a single image inpainting result and confidence maps are estimated. Finally, a fusion module merges the best regions from each refined proposal and the single image result using learned masks. This allows filling in the target hole with well-aligned, color-matched content from the source image where available, and falling back to plausibly generated content from single image inpainting when needed.
