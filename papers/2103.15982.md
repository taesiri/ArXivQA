# TransFill: Reference-guided Image Inpainting by Merging Multiple Color   and Spatial Transformations

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we effectively fill in large holes in a target image by referring to another source image of the same scene, even when there are challenges like parallax, color differences, misalignments, etc. between the images?The key hypothesis is that by estimating multiple homographies to align different regions, learning color and spatial transformers, and fusing with single image inpainting, they can address these challenges and produce high quality inpainting results by transferring content from the source image.In summary, the paper focuses on reference-guided image inpainting - using a second image of the same scene as a reference to help fill in large holes or remove objects in the target image. The core problems are dealing with things like parallax, lighting/color differences, and alignment issues between the image pair. Their proposed approach TransFill aims to tackle these challenges.
