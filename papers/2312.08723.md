# [StemGen: A music generation model that listens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08723)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents StemGen, a novel deep learning model for context-aware music generation. It is trained on datasets of songs separated into musical stems, allowing it to generate new stems that match the texture and musical qualities of a provided context mix of existing stems. The model uses a non-autoregressive transformer architecture with improvements for combining multiple audio channels and sampling methods that encourage musical coherence. It is evaluated on an open-source dataset and a larger proprietary one, with results showing it matches state-of-the-art quality for unconditioned music generation models. Both objective metrics and listening tests confirm the musical alignment between generated stems and context mixes. This work presents a promising approach to iterative music production by having AI models that can listen to existing musical ideas and respond appropriately. The model architecture and sampling methods allow generating stems fitting a provided musical context, enabling creative workflows for assisted music production.
