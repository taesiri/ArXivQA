# [Multimodal Fusion of EHR in Structures and Semantics: Integrating   Clinical Records and Notes with Hypergraph and LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08818)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Electronic health records (EHRs) contain heterogeneous data including structured clinical records and unstructured clinical notes. 
- Prior work has focused more on modeling structured data while fusion of multimodal EHR data is less studied.
- Challenges exist in unifying modeling of medical concepts from different coding systems and handling noise and redundancy in clinical notes.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose MINGLE, a multimodal EHR fusion framework that integrates structures and semantics from clinical records and notes.  
- Uses a hypergraph neural network backbone to model complex relationships in structured data.
- Applies a two-level semantics infusion strategy:
   - Infuse medical concept semantics by generating semantic embeddings for concepts using LLMs and fusing with structural embeddings.
   - Infuse clinical note semantics by incorporating document embeddings of discharge summaries into the hypergraph learning.
- Leverages knowledge and NLU capabilities of LLMs to enrich representations.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework to effectively fuse multimodal EHR data combining strengths of hypergraph neural networks and large language models. 
- Two-level semantics infusion strategy to incorporate medical concept semantics and clinical note semantics.
- Demonstrated performance improvements on two EHR datasets by enhanced semantic integration and multimodal fusion.
- Showed the framework can learn comprehensive and nuanced data representations to support accurate and knowledgeable clinical decision making.

In summary, the key innovation is using a synergistic approach leveraging hypergraph modeling and language models to advance multimodal representation learning for EHR data.
