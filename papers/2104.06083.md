# [Spatiotemporal Entropy Model is All You Need for Learned Video   Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06083)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:Can a simple deep learning framework without motion prediction achieve state-of-the-art performance for learned video compression? The key points are:- Existing learned video compression methods use complex frameworks involving motion prediction modules and separate compression of motion vectors and residuals. This leads to issues like error propagation and high complexity. - The authors propose a simplified "motion-free" framework that does not do motion prediction. It uses a single autoencoder network to compress each frame independently. - A spatiotemporal entropy model is used to capture redundancy between frames in the latent space. This avoids doing motion prediction explicitly.- Experiments show this simple framework achieves state-of-the-art MS-SSIM performance compared to prior learned video compression methods. It also has much lower complexity.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a simple motion-free framework can match or exceed the performance of more complex motion-based learned video compression schemes. The results appear to validate this hypothesis.
