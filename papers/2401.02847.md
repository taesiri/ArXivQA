# [Generating Non-Stationary Textures using Self-Rectification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02847)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of example-based synthesis of non-stationary textures. Such textures exhibit large-scale irregular structures and variations in attributes like color, orientation, scale, etc. Mimicking these complex structures and variations through example-based texture synthesis remains an open and difficult problem.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a two-step "lazy editing" approach called self-rectification. 

1) User performs quick edits on the reference texture using standard image editing tools to get an extremely rough initial result. This target image may be incomplete and incoherent.

2) The proposed self-rectification method then automatically refines this target image into a coherent, seamless texture that follows the rough target, while retaining local characteristics of the reference texture. 

The self-rectification leverages a pre-trained diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) and uses attention mechanisms. It performs structure-preserving inversion of the target image to retain user edits. It also does cross-attention feature injection from reference texture during sampling to transfer local patterns. Overall, the output texture aligns with user edits (global structure) while matching details from reference (local patterns).

The method performs self-rectification in two passes - first for overall coarse structure, then for finer details. Data augmentation is used to improve quality for directional textures.

Main Contributions:

- A lazy-editing framework for non-stationary texture synthesis that provides unprecedented controllability over output.

- A self-rectification technique using diffusion models and attention mechanisms to automatically transform a rough user-edited target image into a coherent, seamless texture.

- Structure-preserving inversion and cross-attention feature injection to retain user edits for global structure while transferring local patterns from reference texture. 

- A coarse-to-fine approach over two passes for rectification - first overall structure then finer details.

The method shows exceptional ability in handling challenging non-stationary textures compared to state-of-the-art techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a two-step approach for non-stationary texture synthesis where users first create a rough target texture from a reference texture using image editing tools, then a novel "self-rectification" method automatically refines the target texture to be coherent and seamless while preserving distinct visual characteristics of the reference texture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel two-step approach for non-stationary texture synthesis:

1) The user first modifies a reference texture using standard image editing tools to create a rough target texture that captures the desired structure/layout. 

2) The proposed "self-rectification" method then automatically refines this rough target into a coherent, seamless texture that faithfully preserves the visual characteristics of the reference texture while conforming to the user's edited structure.

Specifically, the self-rectification leverages a pre-trained diffusion model and uses self-attention mechanisms to gradually align the synthesized texture with the reference texture. This enables transferring fine texture details from the reference to the output, while ensuring the output complies with the rough target structure provided by the user.

The method is shown to handle complex non-stationary textures with high quality and flexibility compared to prior state-of-the-art techniques. The ability to quickly create an initial target and then automatically refine it makes the texture synthesis process more user-friendly.

The paper introduces a novel two-step approach for non-stationary texture synthesis. The key ideas include using a diffusion model for texture generation, injecting self-attention features from a reference texture to guide synthesis, and a coarse-to-fine scheme with self-rectification to transform a user-provided rough target texture into a coherent non-stationary output texture. The method demonstrates advanced controllability and quality compared to prior arts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-step approach involving coarse rectification followed by finer rectification. Why is this coarse-to-fine strategy useful? How would results differ if only a single rectification step was used?

2. Structure-preserving inversion involves injecting the KV features from a later time step into an earlier time step during DDIM inversion. Explain the intuition behind why this preserves structure better compared to standard inversion. 

3. For fine texture sampling, the paper first reconstructs the target layout before switching to KV injection from the reference texture. Why is this two-phase approach used instead of just using KV injection from the start?

4. The parameters P and S control when to start and stop KV injection during inversion and sampling. How should these parameters be set for the coarse and fine stages? What is the impact of using non-optimal values?

5. Data augmentation via rotations and flips is used to improve results for directional textures. Why does this help? Are there cases where augmentation makes results worse?

6. How exactly does KV injection enable transferring texture details from the reference to the output? Does the order of keypoints and values matter? 

7. Could this approach be applied to video textures instead of still images? What modifications would be needed?

8. The paper demonstrates applicability for lazy image editing tasks. Does the method extend naturally to this or are special tweaks needed?

9. How does the method compare to optimization-based approaches like the GCD loss? What are the tradeoffs?

10. Texture synthesis typically struggles with structured textures. Could this approach work for textures with some structure like bricks or tiles? What challenges might arise?
