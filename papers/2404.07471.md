# [Structure-aware Fine-tuning for Code Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07471)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing code pre-trained models (CodePTMs) focus on incorporating structural knowledge during pre-training. However, how to enhance the absorption of structural knowledge during fine-tuning remains an open question. Most existing methods are not applicable during fine-tuning as they require model architecture changes or specific pre-training tasks unrelated to downstream tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Structure-Aware Fine-tuning (SAT), a novel multi-task learning approach to enhance structural knowledge absorption for CodePTMs during fine-tuning. The key ideas are:

1) Quantify structural difference between CodePTMs' attention and AST distances as a "structure loss" using Sinkhorn divergence. This does not require architecture changes.

2) Jointly optimize task objective and structure loss via multi-task learning. This enhances structural knowledge absorption during backpropagation without requiring extra pre-training.

3) SAT can be easily implemented as a plug-and-play solution for most transformer-based CodePTMs.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes SAT - the first structure-aware fine-tuning technique for CodePTMs that enhances structural knowledge absorption.

2) SAT achieves consistent performance improvements across 4 CodePTMs and 2 generation tasks. It brings more gains for models with less structural knowledge.

3) SAT is more effective in low-resource scenarios, compensating for limitations in semantic understanding.

4) SAT enables CodePTMs to capture more task-specific structural knowledge during fine-tuning in a seamless manner.

In summary, the paper presents SAT, a novel and effective structure-aware fine-tuning approach that enhances structural knowledge absorption for CodePTMs without architecture changes. Experiments demonstrate its consistent improvements as a general plug-and-play solution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel fine-tuning method called Structure-aware Fine-tuning (SAT) that enhances the absorption of structural knowledge in code pre-trained models by quantifying the difference between the attention matrix and the distance matrix from the abstract syntax tree as a structure loss using multi-task learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing SAT, a novel structure-aware fine-tuning method for Code Pre-trained Models (CodePTMs). Specifically:

1) It proposes a structure loss to quantify the difference between the structural information learned by CodePTMs (attention scores) and the structural knowledge extracted from code (distances between AST leaves). This loss is optimized via multi-task learning to enhance absorption of structural knowledge during fine-tuning.

2) SAT can be easily implemented as a plug-and-play solution with most transformer-based CodePTMs. 

3) Experiments on 4 CodePTMs and 2 code generation tasks demonstrate that SAT can consistently improve fine-tuning performance, especially for models with less pre-trained code knowledge.

4) SAT shows greater improvements in low-resource scenarios, as it helps models learn structural knowledge without requiring much training data.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an effective yet simple method to incorporate structural knowledge into CodePTMs during fine-tuning, instead of only at pre-training. This enhances their representational capacities and downstream performance.

The paper proposes a novel structure-aware fine-tuning method called SAT to help CodePTMs better capture structural code knowledge during fine-tuning. Key ideas include using a structure loss based on the Sinkhorn divergence between the attention matrix and a distance matrix derived from the AST to quantify structural differences, and jointly optimizing this loss with the downstream task loss via multi-task learning. Experiments on code summarization and translation tasks demonstrate SAT's effectiveness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key intuition behind using the distance matrix extracted from ASTs and the attention matrix from transformer blocks to quantify structural knowledge absorption? Why are these two matrices suitable for this purpose?

2. The paper computes Sinkhorn divergence between the distance matrix and attention matrix to obtain the structure loss. Explain why Sinkhorn divergence was chosen over other divergence/distance measures. What are its advantages?  

3. The structure encoder applies linear transformations to the distance matrix before computing Sinkhorn divergence. What is the motivation behind this? How does it help in quantifying structural differences?

4. The paper employs a multi-task learning approach to optimize downstream task loss and structure loss jointly. Explain why this enables better absorption of structural knowledge compared to optimizing only the downstream task. 

5. Figure 3 shows that structure loss decreases during training. Analyze the curve and explain what it indicates about the model's structural knowledge absorption as fine-tuning progresses.

6. Table 2 and Figure 5 show that SAT brings more improvements when training data is limited. Provide an analysis explaining why this is the case.

7. The paper evaluates on code summarization and code translation tasks. What other downstream tasks could benefit from enhanced structural knowledge absorption using the proposed method?

8. The CAT-probing results in Figure 6 show improved CAT-scores with SAT across models. Analyze these results and relate them to the downstream task improvements. 

9. The case study in Table 3 highlights improved outputs with SAT qualitatively. Compare the outputs and relate them to the quantitative improvements observed.

10. The paper focuses on fine-tuning existing CodePTMs. How can the idea of structure loss-based multi-task learning be incorporated during pre-training of new CodePTMs? What benefits would it provide?
