# [Adaptive Discovering and Merging for Incremental Novel Class Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03382)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the task of class-incremental novel class discovery (class-iNCD), where the goal is to continuously identify new classes from unlabeled data streams, while preserving performance on previously learned classes, without accessing old data. Two main challenges exist - discovering novel classes from unlabeled data, and preventing catastrophic forgetting of old classes when learning new concepts.

Proposed Solution - Adaptive Discovering and Merging (ADM):
1) Adaptive novel class discovery: Separate representation learning from classifier learning. Representations are learned via contrastive self-supervised learning on new unlabeled data. Classifiers are trained using proposed techniques - Triple Comparison (TC) minimizes intra-class distance and maximizes inter-class distance for better pseudo-labels, and Probability Regularization (PR) promotes probability diversity across novel classes.

2) Adaptive Model Merging (AMM): A base-novel hybrid model, where the novel branch is gated to minimize interference with base branch. Gating is based on BN gamma weights from base branch, allowing lossless merging of branches after discovery.

Main Contributions:
- TC and PR for more accurate pseudo-labeling and adaptive discovery of novel classes from unlabeled data
- AMM architecture that limits forgetting of old classes, while allowing discovery and integration of new concepts without growth in parameters or computations
- Significantly outperforms prior class-iNCD methods, also benefits regular class-incremental learning by reducing catastrophic forgetting
