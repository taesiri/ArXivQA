# [Evaluating Shortest Edit Script Methods for Contextual Lemmatization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16968)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Modern contextual lemmatizers often rely on automatically induced Shortest Edit Scripts (SES) to transform a word form into its lemma. Different methods have been proposed to compute SES, but their impact on lemmatization performance has not been systematically analyzed. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper compares three popular SES methods - UDPipe, Morpheus, and IXA pipes - by treating lemmatization as a token classification task. The only input the models receive is word-label pairs in context, where labels are the SES. By modifying only the SES labels for the models to learn, the impact of different SES representations on lemmatization can be evaluated.

Experiments: 
The methods are evaluated on 7 languages with varying morphological complexity using multilingual BERT and XLM-RoBERTa as backbones. Both in-domain and out-of-domain tests are conducted. Word accuracy and sentence accuracy metrics are reported. Statistical significance is tested using McNemar's test.

Key Findings:
- The UDPipe method of separating casing and edit operations is most beneficial overall, especially for morphologically complex languages.  
- Multilingual language models consistently outperform language-specific models.
- UDPipe has better generalization capabilities on out-of-vocabulary words.
- Sentence accuracy provides a clearer picture for comparing SES methods than word accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- First systematic evaluation of the impact of different SES representations on contextual lemmatization performance.
- Demonstrates UDPipe's approach to computing SES is optimal among compared methods. 
- Shows sentence accuracy is a useful metric alongside word accuracy for morphological tasks.
- Provides standardized framework for easily evaluating lemmatization methods.

The paper offers insights into designing more accurate contextual lemmatizers using SES and comparing representation methods. The code and models are publicly available to facilitate future research.
