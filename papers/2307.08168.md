# [Feedback is All You Need: Real-World Reinforcement Learning with   Approximate Physics-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08168)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we efficiently and reliably optimize control policies for real-world robotic systems using limited amounts of real-world data?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By systematically exploiting an approximate physics-based model to simultaneously design 1) a policy gradient estimator and 2) a stabilizing low-level feedback controller embedded within the policy class, we can overcome key challenges in policy optimization and learn high-performance policies using limited real-world data.

Specifically, the paper proposes using the model derivatives to get efficient policy gradient estimates, while the embedded low-level controller designed with the model prevents errors in these estimates from exploding over long horizons. This allows the method to efficiently learn from limited real-world data despite potential inaccuracies in the model.

The experiments then aim to validate whether this approach can efficiently learn control policies on real robotic hardware using only a few minutes of real-world data, even when the model has substantial inaccuracies or mismatches from the true system dynamics.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that by carefully leveraging even an approximate physical model, the proposed method can enable reliable and data-efficient policy optimization on real-world robotic systems. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper introduces a novel policy gradient-based framework for efficiently training robot control policies with limited real-world data. The key ideas are leveraging an approximate physics-based model to construct both the policy gradient estimator and a low-level stabilizing controller embedded within the policy architecture. 

2) Theoretical analysis provides insight into how the proposed approach helps overcome key challenges with standard policy gradient methods, including exploding gradients and ill-conditioning. The analysis shows how the presence of stabilizing low-level feedback improves the smoothness properties and reduces the variance of the optimization problem.

3) Hardware experiments demonstrate the approach can reliably learn high-performance control policies for a small RC car and a quadruped robot using only a few minutes of real-world data. This showcases the method's ability to overcome substantial model inaccuracies and learn effectively despite limited real-world interaction.

In summary, the main contribution is a systematic framework for efficiently and reliably training policies on physical systems by exploiting simple models and embedded feedback, with theoretical and empirical validation. The proposed techniques help enable direct policy learning on robotic hardware despite imperfect modeling and limited data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of reinforcement learning for robot control:

- The key novelty of this paper is using an approximate physics-based model to simultaneously design 1) a sample-efficient policy gradient estimator and 2) a stabilizing low-level feedback controller that is embedded in the policy architecture. This allows the method to learn precise control policies from limited real-world data, even with substantial model mismatch. 

- Most prior model-based RL methods for robotics use models to hallucinate simulated experience, which can introduce bias. This paper avoids that issue by only using the model to construct the gradient estimator, not simulate experience. Other methods like PILCO learn a probabilistic dynamics model and explicitly correct for model bias, but require more data.

- Model-free methods like PPO, SAC, and DDPG can learn effective policies without a model, but are very sample inefficient compared to this approach. The key contribution here is efficiently leveraging model structure.

- Methods like guided policy search use model derivatives to shape reward functions and guide policy search. But they don't embed feedback control within the policy class, which this paper shows is crucial for stability and sample efficiency. 

- Some prior work has combined model predictive control with learned components, but don't optimize end-to-end with policy gradients. The end-to-end optimization allows this method to fine-tune the policy using real-world data.

- Overall, this paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions detailing how to efficiently and reliably leverage simple physical models to achieve precise real-world robotic control, despite substantial model errors. The design of the policy class and gradient estimator using the model are novel.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more sophisticated hierarchical control architectures that can handle complex tasks like contact-rich manipulation, where it may be difficult to design an effective low-level controller. The authors suggest this could be done by optimizing over more complex hierarchical control stacks.

- Overcoming situations where the model discrepancy is so large that the initial model-based controller does not effectively reduce the sensitivity of the system. The authors suggest future work could incorporate techniques like the Lyapunov-based methods from recent papers to learn effective stabilizing controllers. 

- Incorporating more techniques from the reinforcement learning literature like off-policy training and value function learning. The authors note their method is very sample efficient but does not leverage many standard RL algorithmic tools, so combining their approach with these could lead to further improvements.

- Combining the proposed approach with emerging model-based reward shaping techniques. The authors suggest their method could potentially be improved by incorporating learned approximate models into the reward function.

Overall, the main directions seem to be 1) developing more sophisticated policy classes/architectures 2) handling larger model mismatch 3) incorporating more standard RL techniques and 4) using approximate models to shape rewards and not just construct gradients. The authors seem optimistic these could allow their approach to scale up to more complex tasks while retaining efficiency.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a novel policy gradient-based reinforcement learning framework for efficiently training control policies on real physical systems. The key idea is to leverage an approximate first-principles model of the system dynamics in two ways: 1) The model is used to construct efficient approximations of the policy gradient along real system trajectories, avoiding the need to learn a model from scratch. 2) The model is used to design a low-level stabilizing controller which is embedded in the policy architecture. By optimizing through this stabilizing controller, the method overcomes challenges like exploding gradients and ill-conditioning that often arise when applying policy gradients to unstable systems. Theoretical analysis provides insight into how embedding low-level feedback addresses key limitations of standard policy gradient approaches. The method is validated on hardware experiments involving a small RC car and a quadruped robot, where it is shown to reliably learn high-precision control strategies from only a few minutes of real-world experience, despite substantial unmodeled effects.
