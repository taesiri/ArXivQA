# [A Parallel Workflow for Polar Sea-Ice Classification using Auto-labeling   of Sentinel-2 Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13135)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Observing the advancing and retreating pattern of polar sea ice is important to monitor global warming. This requires classifying sea ice in satellite images as thick ice, thin ice or open water.  
- Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite captures high resolution optical imagery over polar regions. There are lots of S2 images that need to be classified, requiring high computation power and scalability. 
- A key challenge is the lack of labeled S2 images to train machine learning models, since manually labeling sea ice is extremely time consuming.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a scalable workflow for auto-labeling S2 images using color thresholds, and train U-Net models on this data to classify sea ice.
- Apply parallel processing techniques to scale the auto-labeling and U-Net training.

Key Contributions:
- Scalable auto-labeling gaining 4.5x speedup with Python Multiprocessing and 16.25x speedup with PySpark MapReduce.
- Horovod-based distributed deep learning for U-Net training with 7.21x speedup on 8 GPUs.
- U-Net model trained on auto-labeled data achieving 98.97% accuracy in classifying thick ice, thin ice and open water.

In summary, the paper presents an effective workflow to address the lack of labeled polar sea ice data by auto-labeling S2 images in a scalable way. Parallel techniques are leveraged to accelerate the auto-labeling and model training. The high classification accuracy validates the proposed auto-labeling method.
