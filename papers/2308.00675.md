# [Tool Documentation Enables Zero-Shot Tool-Usage with Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00675)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, this paper does not appear to have a clearly stated central research question or hypothesis. However, it seems the overall focus is on exploring the effectiveness of using tool documentation, rather than demonstrations, to enable large language models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot tool usage. 

Some key points about the research:

- The paper advocates using tool documentation over demonstrations for guiding LLMs in tool usage. Demonstrations show specific examples of how to use tools for certain tasks, while documentation describes what tools can do in a more general, task-agnostic way.

- The authors hypothesize that with comprehensive documentation, LLMs may not need demonstrations to learn how to use new tools. This could make adding new tools easier since no demonstrations would need to be provided.

- Experiments are conducted on 6 diverse tasks covering language and vision domains. The LLM performance with documentation only is compared to using varying amounts of demonstrations.

- Key findings are that documentation enables competitive zero-shot performance compared to using demonstrations, scales better to large toolsets, and allows seamless addition of new tools in a "plug and play" manner.

So in summary, while not framed with an explicit hypothesis, the paper explores documentation as an alternative to demonstrations for more efficient and scalable tool usage by LLMs. The effectiveness of documentation alone is tested across different tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the use of tool documentation, rather than demonstrations, to enable large language models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot tool usage. 

The key points are:

- Tool documentation provides a description of what a tool does without being tied to specific usage examples. In contrast, demonstrations show how to use tools for particular tasks.

- The authors show experimentally that with documentation alone (zero-shot), LLMs can achieve performance on par or better than using a few demonstrations. This suggests documentation reduces the need for carefully curated demonstrations.

- Documentation enables efficiently scaling up tool usage by LLMs, as shown on a new dataset with hundreds of tools. Few-shot demonstrations have limited coverage and do not scale as well.

- Providing documentation allows seamlessly adding new tools and solving new tasks like image editing and video tracking in a plug-and-play manner, without needing extra demonstrations.

- As a powerful demonstration, the authors show LLMs can use documentation to "re-invent" recent advanced vision techniques like Grounded-SAM and Track Anything. This suggests potential for automatic knowledge discovery through tool documentation.

In summary, tool documentation is proposed as an effective alternative to demonstrations that makes tool usage with LLMs more scalable, flexible, and zero-shot. The results highlight the ability of LLMs to leverage documentation for planning and reasoning about tool usage.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- Unlike most prior work that relies heavily on few-shot demonstrations for tool usage with large language models (LLMs), this paper advocates using tool documentation instead. It shows documentation alone can enable effective zero-shot tool usage.

- It provides empirical evidence across 6 diverse tasks that tool documentation reduces the need for demonstrations. For example, on ScienceQA and TabMWP, zero-shot performance with docs matches or exceeds few-shot performance without docs.

- The paper demonstrates tool documentation enables efficiently scaling up tool usage to hundreds of tools, which few-shot demonstrations struggle to cover. It shows this on a new dataset of 200 renamed Google Cloud CLI tools.

- It highlights the ability to seamlessly integrate new state-of-the-art vision tools like SAM and GroundingDINO in a plug-and-play manner using just documentation. This allows reinventing recent innovations like Grounded-SAM and Track Anything.

- Compared to concurrent works like ViperGPT and AutoGPT that also leverage documentation, this paper examines a broader range of tasks and focuses more on systematically studying the impact of documentation versus demonstrations.

- Overall, this paper provides one of the most extensive empirical studies on the benefits of documentation over demonstrations for tool usage. It sheds light on reducing the reliance on careful demo selection and engineering when equipping LLMs with more tools.

In summary, this paper explores an understudied but important direction of utilizing documentation, rather than demonstrations, to unlock more scalable and flexibile tool usage with LLMs. The empirical findings across diverse tasks highlight the viability of this documentation-focused approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating alternatives to TF-IDF for selecting relevant documentations when the toolset is very large. The authors acknowledge that TF-IDF is not optimal and more advanced retrieval methods could help select the most pertinent documentation to fit within the prompt length constraints.

- Exploring solutions to handle long document inputs. The authors observe performance degradation when document length exceeds 600 words, likely due to challenges for LLMs in comprehending lengthy text. They suggest continuing advancements in handling long inputs could address this limitation.

- Studying the relationship between demonstration quality/quantity and performance. The authors highlight the difficulty in selecting effective demonstrations and their possible detrimental effects. More research is needed on how to best leverage demonstrations together with documentation.

- Extending the findings to additional modalities beyond language and vision. The authors focused their empirical study on textual and visual tasks. Testing the effectiveness of documentation on other modalities like audio, video, etc. is an interesting direction.

- Leveraging the automatic knowledge discovery potential showcased to invent new architectures and models. The authors highlight the possibility for LLMs to automatically combine tools in novel ways using just documentation. This could be harnessed for more automated discovery.

- Exploring safety and alignment considerations when expanding the tools accessible to LLMs. The authors acknowledge the need to carefully consider which tools are provided to ensure intended usage.

In summary, the authors point to several interesting avenues for better understanding and improving tool usage with LLMs through documentation across multiple dimensions.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes using tool documentation instead of demonstrations to guide large language models (LLMs) in learning to use tools and accomplish tasks. The key ideas are:

The authors argue that current approaches rely heavily on providing LLMs with demonstrations, which are examples of how to use tools to solve tasks. However, demonstrations require manual effort to create and may not generalize well. 

Instead, the authors propose leveraging tool documentation, which describes what tools can do without being tied to specific tasks. Documentation is readily available for many tools.

Through experiments on 6 diverse tasks, the authors show that with documentation, LLMs can accomplish tasks without any demonstrations. Providing documentation enables zero-shot tool usage that matches or outperforms few-shot learning with demonstrations. 

On a new dataset with 200 tools, documentation significantly boosts performance over few-shot learning. The authors also showcase seamlessly adding new tools by just providing their docs and using them for image editing and video tracking.

Overall, the work advocates using documentation over demonstrations for tool usage. Documentation provides a more scalable way to expand the tools LLMs can leverage in a zero-shot, plug-and-play manner.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using tool documentation instead of demonstrations for enabling tool usage in large language models. What are some potential advantages and disadvantages of using documentation over demonstrations? How might the tradeoffs change as the number and complexity of tools scales up?

2. The paper shows that with documentation, zero-shot tool usage can match or exceed few-shot usage with demonstrations. Why might this be the case? Does the language model's pre-training play a role in its ability to leverage documentation effectively? 

3. The authors state that documentation provides "relatively neutral instruction" compared to demonstrations. What types of biases or constraints could demonstrations potentially impose on tool usage, and how might documentation mitigate those issues?

4. For the image editing and video tracking tasks, the language model was able to "re-invent" complex pipelines like Grounded-SAM and Track Anything solely from documentation of the building blocks. What capabilities of the language model allow this kind of creative composition, and why is it significant?

5. The paper focuses on unilateral documentation for individual tools. How might bidirectional documentation, describing interactions between tools, further enhance the language model's planning and reasoning abilities? What are the challenges in obtaining such bidirectional documentation?

6. The language models struggle with long document lengths. The authors propose using retrieval to select relevant subsets of documentation. What other techniques could help language models handle long documentation inputs more effectively?

7. The authors use a simple TF-IDF retrieval approach for documentation. How could more sophisticated retrieval methods like dense retrieval improve documentation selection, and consequently, task performance?

8. For new tools like SAM and Grounded DINO, the authors wrote the documentation themselves. In practice, how can we ensure high-quality documentation is available for new tools, especially for proprietary or commercial tools with limited public documentation?

9. The paper focuses on goal-oriented tasks with clear correctness metrics. How well might tool documentation transfer to more open-ended applications like dialog and storytelling? What new evaluation challenges may arise?

10. The paper studies giving documentation to the language model at inference time. Could tool documentation also be leveraged during pre-training, and if so, how might that impact the model's tool usage abilities?
