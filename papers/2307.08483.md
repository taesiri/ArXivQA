# [Differentiable Transportation Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08483)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to develop an accurate and efficient pruning technique to compress deep neural networks for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel pruning method called Differentiable Transportation Pruning that allows precise control over the output network size while achieving high accuracy. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. Posing the pruning problem as an optimal transport problem, where importance scores are aligned to a target distribution defined by the desired sparsity level, will allow jointly learning soft masks and network parameters in an end-to-end differentiable manner.

2. Making the transportation problem efficient and differentiable using entropic regularization and approximate bilevel optimization will enable precise control over the sparsity level while retaining accuracy.

3. The temperature parameter of the entropic regularization can be automatically annealed during training to transition soft masks into discrete masks.

4. The proposed Differentiable Transportation Pruning method will achieve state-of-the-art pruning performance across different models, datasets and sparsity levels compared to prior techniques.

In summary, the paper hypothesizes that their proposed optimal transport based pruning formulation, made computationally tractable through approximations, will enable highly accurate and adjustable network pruning critical for edge deployment. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses across diverse settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a differentiable pruning method based on entropy regularized optimal transportation that allows precise control over the output network size. 

2. Formulating an efficient optimal transportation algorithm that reduces the computational complexity compared to prior work using optimal transport for pruning. 

3. Introducing an automatic temperature annealing mechanism that gradually turns soft masks into discrete masks, instead of needing to manually choose a decay schedule.

4. Demonstrating state-of-the-art pruning results on 3 datasets using 5 different models, across a range of pruning ratios and with different types of pruning granularity (structured and unstructured).

In summary, the key ideas seem to be making optimal transport more computationally feasible for pruning by using only a single Sinkhorn iteration per update, and increasing the ease-of-use by automatically annealing the temperature instead of needing to tune a schedule. The experimental results then show these contributions lead to improved accuracy compared to prior pruning techniques.
