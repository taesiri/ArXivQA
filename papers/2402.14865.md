# [DyVal 2: Dynamic Evaluation of Large Language Models by Meta Probing   Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14865)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is crucial but faces two key challenges - data contamination in static benchmarks which can be easily gamed by models, and the lack of multifaceted analysis to provide insights into different abilities of models. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes Meta Probing Agents (MPA), a dynamic evaluation protocol inspired by psychometrics. MPA uses LLM-based "probing agents" to automatically transform existing problems into new ones by applying different principles related to language understanding, problem solving and domain knowledge abilities. The transformed problems are validated by LLM-based "judge agents" to ensure relevance and consistency. This allows dynamic generation of new test samples to mitigate data contamination. Furthermore, the modular design combining principles helps analyze correlations between different abilities.

Key Contributions:
1) A general, flexible protocol for dynamic evaluation and data augmentation of LLMs, using LLMs themselves as agents. Mitigates data contamination.
2) Support for multifaceted analysis by dynamic combination of principles related to key cognitive abilities, providing insights into models. 
3) Analysis revealing poorer performance of LLMs on dynamic benchmarks, strong correlations between abilities especially language understanding and problem solving, implicit Matthew effect relating model size and ability correlations.
4) Demonstration of the potential for using MPA-generated data to improve LLM performance.

In summary, the psychometrics-inspired, agent-based MPA framework enables robust dynamic evaluation of LLMs, while also providing the flexibility for in-depth analysis of different abilities, making it a valuable protocol going forward. The findings reveal gaps in existing models while highlighting paths for progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a dynamic evaluation protocol called Meta Probing Agents, inspired by psychometric theory, that uses AI agents to automatically transform evaluation questions to reduce data contamination and enable multifaceted analysis of language models' abilities in understanding, reasoning, and knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A psychometrics-inspired dynamic evaluation protocol called Meta Probing Agents (MPA) to mitigate data contamination and enable multifaceted analysis of large language models (LLMs). MPA uses LLM-based agents to automatically transform evaluation samples.

2. Comprehensive analysis of the basic cognitive abilities (language understanding, problem solving, and domain knowledge) of LLMs using the modular design of MPA. This allows flexible combination of different principles for systematic evaluation. 

3. Key findings from extensive experiments and analysis showing degraded performance of LLMs on dynamic benchmarks, strong correlations between abilities, an implicit "Matthew effect" relating model size and ability correlations, and various error patterns.

4. Demonstration that MPA can also serve as a data augmentation approach to enhance LLMs when its generated samples are used for fine-tuning.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing MPA as a general, psychometrics-inspired dynamic evaluation protocol that enables mitigating data contamination and conducting multifaceted analysis of LLMs' abilities. The modular design also allows using MPA for data augmentation.
