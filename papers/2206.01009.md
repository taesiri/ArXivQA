# [Unified Recurrence Modeling for Video Action Anticipation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01009)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the key research focus of this paper is on developing a unified recurrent modeling approach for video action anticipation. The main hypothesis seems to be that generalizing recurrence through a message passing framework on graph-structured representations can lead to better performance on the video action anticipation task. Specifically, the paper proposes modeling video action anticipation by transferring sequence learning into a graph representation learning problem using message passing neural networks. The key ideas are:- Representing video frames as a graph with vertices and edges, where vertices represent frame features and edges represent relationships between frames. - Using self-attention as a universal building block for routing information between vertices (frames) to implement the core message, update and readout functions in message passing.- Learning edge connections explicitly using strategies like template banks and class token projections, instead of just relying on implicit edge estimations based on vertex similarity.The central hypothesis is that this proposed unified recurrent modeling approach with explicit edge learning will be more effective for video action anticipation compared to prior sequence modeling methods like LSTM or vanilla self-attention models. The experimental results on a large-scale egocentric video dataset seem to confirm this hypothesis.In summary, the key novelty is in reformulating video action anticipation as a graph representation learning problem and using message passing with explicit edge learning to model the temporal relationships. The paper aims to show this is an effective modeling approach for the video anticipation task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a unified recurrent modeling approach for video action anticipation using a message passing framework. Specifically:- They generalize the recurrence mechanism by transferring sequence learning into a graph representation realized via message passing. - They use self-attention as the universal building block to extract information from vertices and edges in the graph. Vertices represent spatial regions and edges describe connectivity.- Self-attention performs implicit edge estimation via scaled dot-product attention.

The graph connectivity can be implicitly estimated or explicitly modeled.In summary, the key contribution seems to be introducing a unified recurrence framework for video action anticipation based on message passing on graphs with self-attention, along with strategies for learning edge connectivity. The proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art results.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper on unified recurrence modeling for video action anticipation relates to other research in the field:- It proposes a new recurrent modeling approach based on message passing on graphs and self-attention. Many other methods use RNNs or temporal convolutions for modeling temporal relationships. Treating video as a graph and using self-attention for message passing is a novel approach.- It focuses on the task of action anticipation, predicting actions before they occur, rather than action recognition. Other recent work has also focused on anticipation, but this paper provides a new modeling approach tailored for this task.- It incorporates explicit edge learning strategies into the model, going beyond just using self-attention for implicit edge learning. This allows learning more flexible graph connectivity patterns. Other graph neural nets for video also learn edges, but not in the context of a recurrence model.- It achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging EPIC-Kitchens egocentric video dataset for anticipation. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to prior recurrent and transformer models for this task. - The model is flexible and lightweight, using only self-attention layers rather than a full transformer architecture. This contrasts with some other work adapting transformers for video understanding tasks.- It connects ideas from self-attention, message passing neural networks, and recurrence to provide a unified modeling framework. This builds upon a range of related research areas in a novel way tailored for video anticipation.In summary, the key novelties are proposing a new recurrent modeling approach for video built on graphs and self-attention, with a focus on action anticipation, and showing its effectiveness empirically on a challenging egocentric video dataset. The paper relates closely to work on graph modeling, recurrence, self-attention, and action anticipation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring multi-modality with the proposed model. The current work focused only on RGB video, but the authors plan to integrate other modalities like optical flow and audio in the future. - Leveraging the rich annotations in the EPIC-Kitchens dataset more, such as object detections and interactions. The current model architecture could be extended to incorporate this additional contextual information.- Applying the proposed unified recurrent modeling framework to other video understanding tasks beyond just action anticipation. The flexibility of the message passing scheme could make it useful for related problems like early action prediction, action detection, etc.- Investigating how to make the model more scalable, as the self-attention operations become costly for very long videos/sequences. Approaches like sparsity or attention pooling could help improve computational efficiency. - Extending the model to online settings where frames are observed sequentially over time, rather than processing fixed length clips. This could require modifying the message passing scheme for online updating.- Exploring different variants of the proposed edge learning strategies, which currently rely on template banks or class token projections. Other techniques for learning dynamic edge representations could be developed.- Leveraging more advanced self-attention designs instead of standard multi-head self-attention, to further improve information routing between vertices.So in summary, the authors point to multi-modality, leveraging richer annotations, applying the framework to new tasks, improving scalability, online processing, and enhancing the self-attention components as interesting directions for the future. Advancing the representation learning for both vertices and edges seems like a key opportunity.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a unified recurrent modeling approach for video action anticipation. The key idea is to transfer sequence learning into a graph representation by using a message passing framework. Vertices in the graph correspond to spatial regions in the video frames. Edges describe the connectivity between vertices. Self-attention is used as the building block to route information between vertices, implementing the message, update, and readout functions in the graph. By default, the connectivity is estimated implicitly based on similarity of vertex features. The paper also proposes two explicit edge learning strategies: 1) Template Bank: learns a bank of adjacency matrix templates that are combined based on the input. 2) Class Token Projection: projects verb and noun class tokens into an embedding space and uses their outer product to construct the adjacency matrix. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens show the proposed unified modeling with edge learning outperforms prior state-of-the-art for egocentric action anticipation. Key benefits are the flexible graph representation and the ability to learn explicit edge connectivity end-to-end, in addition to leveraging self-attention.In summary, this paper presents a new recurrent modeling approach for video action anticipation based on a graph neural network framework. The key contributions are: (1) transferring sequence modeling to graph-structured representation using message passing; (2) using self-attention for routing information between graph vertices; (3) learning explicit edge connectivity in the graph via proposed template bank and class token projection strategies. Experiments demonstrate improved performance on egocentric anticipation benchmarks.
