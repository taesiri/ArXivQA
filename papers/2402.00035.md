# [Robustness Assessment of a Runway Object Classifier for Safe Aircraft   Taxiing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00035)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being explored for use in safety-critical aviation systems to reduce pilot workload and improve operational safety. However, DNNs are prone to errors like adversarial inputs which could lead to incorrect and unsafe outputs. 
- Thorough certification is required before integrating DNNs into such systems. Formal verification provides rigorous assurances of DNN correctness, for example by proving the absence of certain mispredictions.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors formally verify an image-classifier DNN developed by Airbus for object classification during aircraft taxiing. 
- They assess the DNN's robustness to common image perturbations - noise, brightness and contrast changes.
- They propose a method to leverage the monotonicity of robustness properties and past verification results to reduce the number of expensive verification queries needed.

Use Case and DNN:
- The DNN classifies runway objects into 4 classes - Aircraft, Vehicle, Person and Negative (no object). 
- It has ~8000 ReLU neurons and 85.3% test accuracy on 32x32 grayscale images from taxiing videos.

Verification Process: 
- The authors encode brightness and contrast perturbations into the verification queries by adding new input neurons to the DNN.
- They use an incremental algorithm that exploits the monotonicity of robustness to efficiently deduce many verification query results instead of invoking the verifier. This reduced queries by ~60%.
- The Marabou DNN verifier was used as the backend verification engine. 

Results:
- The DNN has similar robustness to contrast and brightness changes which model real-world unpredictable conditions.
- But it is much more vulnerable to noise perturbations.
- The method assessed the classifier's robustness and highlighted its vulnerability to noise for the designers.

Main Contributions:
- Case study demonstrating formal verification for aviation-relevant DNNs.
- Method to encode brightness/contrast perturbations for verification. 
- Incremental verification algorithm leveraging monotonicity.
- Quantified robustness for an Airbus runway object classifier.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper demonstrates the applicability of formal verification methods to assess the robustness of an image classifier intended for aircraft taxiing, using an Airbus prototype model as a case study.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Applying formal verification to assess the robustness of a runway object classification DNN developed by Airbus. Specifically, they formally verify the network's robustness to three types of common image perturbations - noise, brightness, and contrast.

2) Proposing a method to encode brightness and contrast perturbations into verification queries, by adding an extra input layer to the network. This allows leveraging existing tools that support noise robustness verification.

3) Developing an incremental verification algorithm that reduces the number of expensive verification queries needed by exploiting the monotonicity of robustness w.r.t. the perturbation parameters. This optimization reduced the number of queries by nearly 60%.

4) Evaluating their methods on the Airbus DNN, providing an analysis of its robustness to different levels of noise, brightness and contrast perturbations. The results indicate the network is more sensitive to noise compared to brightness/contrast changes.

In summary, the main contributions are applying formal verification to a real-world aviation DNN, proposing encodings and optimizations to make this feasible, and providing an robustness analysis case study useful for certifying the network.
