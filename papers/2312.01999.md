# [SRTransGAN: Image Super-Resolution using Transformer based Generative   Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01999)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel image super-resolution method called SRTransGAN, which utilizes a transformer-based generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture. The generator network is a transformer encoder-decoder model with skip connections that learns hierarchical representations and cross-scale relationships between low and high-resolution images. This allows it to effectively reconstruct high-frequency details during upsampling. The discriminator applies a vision transformer on image patches to distinguish real versus reconstructed images and provides strong adversarial training to the generator. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance, with average PSNR/SSIM gains of 7.12%/2.14% for 2x scaling and 4.76%/3.51% for 4x over previous methods on benchmark datasets. Visualizations demonstrate enhanced detail on edge and blurry regions. The multi-level transformer encoder-decoder enables robust learning of features at different scales. Further ablation studies suggest potential improvements by increasing training data complexity and model capacity. In summary, the proposed SRTransGAN sets a new state-of-the-art for single image super-resolution, demonstrating the promise of transformers coupled with GAN training.
