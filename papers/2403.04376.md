# [Computational Modelling of Plurality and Definiteness in Chinese Noun   Phrases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04376)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Some languages like Chinese are considered "cooler" than others because understanding sentences often requires more contextual inference by the listener. Speakers of such languages frequently omit information like plurality, definiteness etc. 
- This paper investigates the predictability of plurality and definiteness in Chinese noun phrases (NPs) given the surrounding context.

Dataset:
- Built a corpus of 124K Chinese NPs from an English-Chinese parallel corpus of TV subtitles. 
- Matched NPs using word alignments and annotated Chinese NPs for plurality and definiteness based on corresponding English NPs.
- Two human assessments showed the dataset to be of good quality.

Analyses:
- Only 12.4% NPs expressed plurality explicitly, 15.9% expressed definiteness explicitly. Confirms frequent omission.
- Suffix "们" is not a conclusive plural marker. Most NPs with "们" were still indefinite contrary to some linguistic theories.

Models:
- Classical ML models like LR and SVM as well as Transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa etc. for plurality/definiteness prediction.

Experiments & Results:  
- BERT models achieved best performance, especially BERT-wwm. Contextual PLMs help in pragmatic tasks involving contextual inference.
- Predicting plurality and definiteness together in a 4-way classification task improves performance over separate binary classification.

Analyses:
- Increasing context size decreased performance due to added confusion and difficulty in extracting useful signal.  
- Models found explicit expressions easier to handle compared to implicit ones.

In summary, the plurality and definiteness of Chinese NPs can be computationally predicted fairly well from surrounding contexts using contextual language models. The predictions can potentially be improved further by enhancing context modelling.
