# [SHAP-EDITOR: Instruction-guided Latent 3D Editing in Seconds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09246)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Shap-Editor, a novel framework for fast 3D asset editing based on learning feed-forward mappings in the latent space of a 3D autoencoder. Specifically, the method leverages the pre-trained Shap-E model which encodes 3D objects into a 1024x1024 latent vector that can be decoded into various 3D representations. The key idea is to learn a neural editor network that directly maps a source 3D latent code and text instruction to an edited latent code, which after decoding results in the edited 3D asset. This avoids slow test-time optimization approaches in prior work that take minutes to hours. The editor network is trained via distillation losses from complementary 2D diffusion image editors in a student-teacher framework, transferring their manipulation capabilities to 3D assets. Both global style edits and local structural edits are handled effectively. The method demonstrates strong qualitative and quantitative performance compared to optimization-based approaches while requiring just 1 second per edit at test time. Key benefits include the ability to edit unseen objects, combine multiple edits, and handle more complex instructions than the original 3D generator. Limitations include reliance on the capabilities of the 2D and 3D pretrained models. Overall, Shap-Editor shows promise for extremely fast semantic editing applied to large 3D asset libraries.
