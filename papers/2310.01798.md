# [Large Language Models Cannot Self-Correct Reasoning Yet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01798)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can large language models intrinsically self-correct their reasoning and improve their performance on reasoning tasks without external feedback?

The key points related to this question are:

- The paper focuses on "intrinsic self-correction", where the model tries to correct its initial responses solely based on its own capabilities, without any external feedback. This setting is important to understand the inherent capabilities of LLMs.

- The paper tests the efficacy of self-correction on reasoning tasks like math word problems, commonsense reasoning, and question answering. 

- Experiments indicate that without external feedback, LLMs struggle to self-correct and improve their reasoning performance. The accuracy often decreases after self-correction compared to just doing standard prompting.

- The paper analyzes why self-correction fails to improve reasoning, and provides explanations like the initial prompt already eliciting the optimal response, and the self-correction prompt potentially biasing the model away from that optimal response.

- The paper also examines multi-agent debate as a self-correction approach, but finds it comparable or worse than just using self-consistency without debate.

- For tasks where self-correction helps, like making responses safer, the paper argues it provides instructions that standard prompting misses. But for reasoning, self-correction prompts do not give tangible benefits.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that large language models cannot reliably self-correct their own reasoning without external feedback, which the paper aims to validate through experiments and analysis. Examining the limitations of self-correction for reasoning is the key focus.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is critically examining the concept of "self-correction" in large language models (LLMs), particularly for reasoning tasks. The key findings are:

- LLMs struggle to intrinsically self-correct their reasoning without external feedback. In many cases, the performance deteriorates after self-correction attempts compared to just doing standard prompting.

- The improvements attributed to self-correction in prior works often stem from using oracle feedback to guide the process. When oracle labels are not available, the benefits diminish. 

- Methods like multi-agent debate do not show significant gains over simply prompting the model multiple times and taking the majority vote (self-consistency). The gains are not from any inherent "self-correction" capability.

- While self-correction can help align model responses with certain preferences (e.g. making them safer), it does not reliably enhance reasoning capabilities. The paper urges a nuanced understanding of what self-correction can and cannot achieve.

In summary, the paper advocates a more skeptical perspective on the idea of self-correction in LLMs, highlighting its limitations for reasoning tasks in the absence of high-quality external feedback. It aims to steer research towards developing methods that can genuinely improve reasoning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper argues that large language models do not currently have the capability to intrinsically self-correct reasoning mistakes in their outputs without external feedback. The main findings are that performance on reasoning tasks tends to degrade rather than improve when models attempt to self-correct, and that purported self-correction techniques often rely on carefully engineered prompts and external information rather than inherent model capabilities. The key takeaway is that more research is needed to develop methods that can genuinely enhance reasoning through self-correction.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other related research:

- Focus on intrinsic self-correction in LLMs: The paper focuses specifically on the ability of large language models (LLMs) to self-correct their responses without any external feedback or guidance. This is an important distinction from some other work that looks at self-correction with the help of external tools, human feedback, etc. The intrinsic self-correction setting allows for a clearer assessment of the unaided capabilities of LLMs.

- Reasoning as main application area: The paper centers its investigation on LLMs' ability to self-correct reasoning, as opposed to style, safety, etc. This is relevant given the importance of reasoning ability for reliable LLM performance. Other work has shown more promise for self-correction in areas besides reasoning. 

- Highlights limitations: A key finding is that current LLMs struggle to effectively self-correct reasoning without external guidance. This tempers some of the optimism around self-correction in recent literature. The paper urges careful assessment of self-correction capabilities.

- Proposes post-hoc prompting view: An insightful conceptual framing is to view self-correction as a form of post-hoc prompting. This lens helps explain when self-correction is beneficial and guides comparison to pre-hoc prompting.

- Suggests multi-faceted approach: Given limitations of sole reliance on self-correction, the paper advocates for a multi-pronged strategy when deploying LLMs, rather than expecting autonomous self-improvement.

- Encourages further research: While reasoned about intrinsic limitations, the paper does not rule out self-correction entirely. It highlights promising future directions like leveraging high-quality external feedback.

In summary, the nuanced perspective and tempering of self-correction enthusiasm distinguishes this paper from some other recent work. The conceptual framing, practical guidelines, and directions for future research are valuable contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Explore methods that can genuinely correct reasoning in LLMs, rather than just altering responses to align with preferences. The authors suggest incorporating external feedback could be beneficial for this.

- Focus research efforts on understanding when self-correction provides tangible benefits, such as for improving safety/appropriateness, rather than trying to use it to correct reasoning where it has limited efficacy.

- Investigate the use of self-consistency during inference as a method of self-verification that could potentially enhance reasoning. The authors highlight the Tree of Thought system as an example of this approach.

- Place greater emphasis on optimizing pre-hoc prompts rather than relying heavily on post-hoc prompting/self-correction, since pre-hoc prompting is more efficient. However, post-hoc prompting still has usefulness when external feedback is necessary.

- Develop guidelines for fair comparison of self-correction techniques, such as reporting inference cost, comparing to self-consistency baselines, and avoiding ill-designed pre-hoc prompts.

- Be mindful of exaggerating capabilities and avoid using ambiguous terminology like "self-correction" when external feedback is incorporated.

In summary, the key suggestions are to explore alternative methods to improve reasoning, focus self-correction on suitable applications, optimize pre-hoc prompting, establish fair comparison practices, and approach claims about capabilities with nuance and clarity. The overarching theme is encouraging research that leads to genuine enhancements in LLMs' reasoning and transparency about techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper examines the concept of self-correction in large language models (LLMs), focusing specifically on their ability to self-correct their reasoning. The authors define intrinsic self-correction as when an LLM attempts to correct its initial responses solely based on its inherent capabilities, without external feedback. Through experiments on reasoning benchmarks like GSM8K, CommonSenseQA, and HotpotQA, they find that LLMs struggle to improve their performance through intrinsic self-correction, and the performance often deteriorates after self-correction. The paper argues that self-correction should not be viewed as a reliable method for enhancing reasoning capabilities of LLMs in their current state. They suggest that improvements attributed to self-correction may actually result from well-crafted feedback prompts rather than the model's inherent correction abilities. The authors conclude that the community should approach self-correction realistically, acknowledging its limitations for reasoning tasks, while continuing to explore ways to genuinely improve reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating human-like text. However, there are concerns about the accuracy and appropriateness of their outputs. Self-correction, where the model refines its own responses, has emerged as a potential solution. This paper investigates the ability of LLMs to intrinsically self-correct, without external feedback. It focuses on mathematical reasoning tasks. Experiments with models like GPT-3.5 show that performance declines after self-correction rounds, as the model struggles to identify and fix errors. Analysis indicates the model is more likely to incorrectly alter a right response than rectify a wrong one. Even with perfect feedback, the gains seem illusory. Multi-agent debate between model instances also does not meaningfully enhance reasoning over simple self-consistency.  

The paper argues self-correction is essentially post-hoc prompting on model outputs. It is beneficial when the feedback provides useful instructions beyond the initial prompt. For reasoning, it does not offer tangible advantages. The improvements shown on some tasks may stem from better engineered feedback prompts versus initial prompts. Overall, the findings indicate current LLMs cannot intrinsically self-correct reasoning. This suggests a measured perspective is needed regarding their capabilities. It highlights the value of incorporating high-quality external feedback. The results underscore the need for further research to develop methods that can genuinely enhance reasoning in LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper focuses on evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to self-correct their reasoning without external feedback, termed "intrinsic self-correction". The key methods are:

- Evaluating existing self-correction techniques that utilize oracle labels to guide the process, on benchmarks like GSM8K, CommonSenseQA, and HotpotQA. Results show improvements in performance, consistent with prior work. 

- Testing intrinsic self-correction, where models attempt to correct themselves without any external feedback. Models are prompted to generate an initial response, review and provide feedback on their own response, and then improve their answer based on that feedback. Results on reasoning tasks show that performance decreases compared to standard prompting, instead of improving. Analysis indicates models often change correct answers to incorrect ones during self-correction.

- Comparing multi-agent debate to self-consistency with the same number of responses as a way to potentially improve reasoning. Findings show debate performs similarly or worse than self-consistency, suggesting the improvement is more attributable to consistency rather than any "self-correction".

- Framing self-correction as a form of post-hoc prompting and analyzing cases where it provides useful feedback vs. where equivalent instructions could be incorporated into the initial prompt. Experiments on constrained text generation find directly encoding requirements in the initial prompt can perform better than self-correction.

Overall, the key method is rigorously evaluating various forms of intrinsic self-correction on diverse reasoning tasks to assess whether LLMs can reliably improve their own responses. Results generally indicate current LLMs struggle to self-correct reasoning without external feedback or consistency techniques.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem or question the paper is addressing is:

Can large language models intrinsically self-correct their own reasoning without external feedback? 

The paper investigates whether large language models have the inherent capability to recognize errors or inaccuracies in their own reasoning and outputs, and then refine or "self-correct" those outputs to improve reasoning, purely based on their own knowledge and skills rather than any external feedback. 

The paper notes that the idea of "self-correction" has gained attention recently as a potential way for large language models to improve their accuracy and reasoning abilities. However, the paper aims to critically examine whether self-correction can truly enhance reasoning performance without any external guidance or feedback.

So in summary, the core question is evaluating whether large language models can effectively self-improve their reasoning and problem-solving solely based on their own capabilities, which the paper refers to as "intrinsic self-correction." The paper conducts experiments and analysis to shed light on the limitations of self-correction for reasoning tasks.
