# [WikiTableEdit: A Benchmark for Table Editing by Natural Language   Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02962)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing research on table editing has focused on regular-shaped tables and implementing edits via generating code in programming languages like SQL and Python. However, editing irregular tables with merged cells poses challenges when using code. 
- Directly editing tables by natural language instructions can make the process more accessible for non-professional users.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce WikiTableEdit dataset with over 200,000 instances of triplets: (instruction, source table, target table).
- Includes editing operations on both regular and irregular tables extracted from WikiSQL dataset.
- Automatically generate instructions and edited tables for 6 types of basic operations: adding/removing rows/columns, swapping rows, reordering by a column, merging/splitting cells.
- Irregular tables involve merging cells across rows. Editing them requires properly updating merged cell information.
- Evaluate language models on dataset and design new metric "Table Edit Distance" to assess structural and content differences between tables.

Main Contributions:
- Construct high-quality WikiTableEdit benchmark for table editing by natural language instructions, covering both regular and irregular tables.
- Extensive experiments and analysis to explore capabilities of language models on this task using new automated evaluation metric. 
- Findings show existing models still struggle with certain operations like swap and reorder. Editing irregular tables poses a greater challenge.
- Dataset and benchmark can help models better comprehend and manipulate real-world tabular data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces WikiTableEdit, a dataset for evaluating the ability of large language models to edit tables guided by natural language instructions, covering both regular and irregular tables across six different operations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing the task of table editing and constructing a high-quality dataset WikiTableEdit to support this research area. The dataset includes both regular and irregular table editing, covering six different types of operations.

2. Designing a new automated evaluation metric called Table Edit Distance (TED) to measure the differences and similarities between the source table, edited table, and reference table. 

3. Conducting extensive experiments and analyses on the dataset with popular large language models to explore their capabilities on the table editing task. The results indicate existing models still have difficulties with certain operations like swapping and reordering.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing the table editing task, constructing a dataset for it, designing a specialized evaluation metric, and benchmarking various language models on this dataset.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called WikiTableEdit for table editing tasks. What are some key considerations and challenges in automatically generating high-quality training data for this task? How might the data generation process be improved?

2. The paper proposes a new evaluation metric called Table Edit Distance (TED) that considers both structural and content differences between tables. What are some potential limitations of this metric? How might it be refined or augmented to better capture quality? 

3. The paper finds that swap and reorder operations are the most challenging for models. What intrinsic difficulties do these operations present? How might models be adapted to better handle them?

4. The paper shows a significant performance gap between editing regular and irregular tables. What additional capabilities would models need to reliably edit irregular tables with merged cells? 

5. The few-shot prompting experiments yield little improvement over zero-shot for table editing. Why might this be the case? What changes to the prompting methodology could better leverage examples?

6. The paper conducts experiments primarily on smaller pretrained models. How might scaling model size impact performance on this challenging task? What optimizations would be needed?

7. The paper establishes baseline results, but performance remains far from human-level across models. What key next steps could drive substantially better results on this dataset?

8. The data instances have a simple one-sentence instruction format. How might performance differ with longer, more complex instructions? Would models learn to identify key edits?

9. The paper focuses on structural edits. How might an extension to more semantic edits involving cell content changes differ in complexity? Would models struggle more?

10. The dataset contains only English language data. How would the task complexity change for other languages with different grammatical structures? Would new challenges emerge?
