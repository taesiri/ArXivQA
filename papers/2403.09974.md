# [GET: Unlocking the Multi-modal Potential of CLIP for Generalized   Category Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09974)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of generalized category discovery (GCD). GCD aims to accurately discover new classes while correctly classifying known classes in an unlabeled dataset, with the help of some labeled data. Current GCD methods rely solely on visual features and struggle to distinguish visually similar categories. However, even visually similar categories may have distinct text descriptions. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a method called GET to introduce text information to enhance GCD. Since unlabeled data lacks text, the method includes:

1) A Text Embedding Synthesizer (TES) module that generates pseudo text embeddings from visual features, by converting visual features to input tokens for CLIP's text encoder. TES aligns pseudo text to real text on labeled data.

2) A dual-branch framework with two branches focusing on visual and text features separately. It employs joint training with a cross-modal consistency loss to make the two modalities enhance each other.

Main Contributions:

- Extensive experiments showing current GCD methods are constrained by backbone model and reliance on single visual modality, performing poorly on visually similar classes. 

- Proposal of TES module to generate pseudo text embeddings from images, unlocking the multi-modal potential of CLIP for GCD.

- Dual-branch training strategy and cross-modal consistency loss to enable collaborative learning between visual and text branches.

- State-of-the-art GCD accuracy on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of using multi-modal features for distinguishing visually similar categories.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called GET that introduces text information into the generalized category discovery task by generating pseudo text embeddings for unlabeled data through a text embedding synthesizer module and employs a dual-branch framework with cross-modal instance consistency to fully leverage the multi-modal features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to unlock the multi-modal potential of CLIP for the generalized category discovery (GCD) task. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes a Text Embedding Synthesizer (TES) module to generate pseudo text embeddings for unlabeled data by converting visual features to tokens that can be passed into CLIP's text encoder. This allows utilizing CLIP's text encoder without having the actual text labels.

2) A dual-branch framework with visual and text branches is introduced to make full use of the aligned multi-modal features from CLIP. The two branches use the same parameterized training strategy and focus on visual vs. text information respectively. 

3) A cross-modal instance consistency objective is proposed to enable the two branches to exchange information and learn from each other. This promotes interaction and fusion between the visual and text embedding spaces.

4) Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method over previous single-modal GCD methods, demonstrating the benefits of unlocking CLIP's multi-modal potential for this task.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling GCD methods to leverage both visual and textual information in a multi-modal manner via pseudo text embedding generation and an appropriate training strategy, significantly boosting previous visual-only methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Text Embedding Synthesizer (TES) module to generate pseudo text embeddings. How does TES work? What objectives and losses are used to train it? 

2. The paper mentions that TES can be seen as a special fine-tuned text encoder that takes images as input and generates text embeddings. How is this text encoder fine-tuned and what makes it special compared to a normal text encoder?

3. In the dual-branch framework, what is the motivation behind using a visual branch and a text branch separately? Why not simply concatenate the features before the classifier? 

4. Explain the cross-modal instance consistency objective proposed in the paper. How does it encourage the two branches to learn from each other?

5. The paper conducts extensive experiments on different pre-trained models. What are the key observations and insights gained regarding how different models influence GCD performance?

6. What is the intuition behind introducing CLIP into the GCD task? Does CLIP have potential drawbacks regarding seen/unseen classes and how does the method address this? 

7. Analyze the various components of the TES objective function - the alignment loss and distillation loss. What is the effect of using each one independently versus together?

8. The method sets the number of pseudo text tokens in TES to 7. Analyze the impact of this hyperparameter by discussing the tradeoffs of using more or fewer tokens. 

9. Compare the attention maps and t-SNE visualizations of the proposed method versus baseline. What indicates improved discriminative ability and multimodal alignment? 

10. Discuss a limitation of equally weighting the visual and text modalities. How could the model adaptively determine which modality provides more discriminative information?
