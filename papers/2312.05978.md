# [Neural Architecture Codesign for Fast Bragg Peak Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05978)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Locating diffraction peak positions from X-ray diffraction data is important for material science research, but current methods like pseudo-Voigt fitting are computationally expensive.  
- Recent work has developed deep learning models called BraggNNs to approximate peak locations faster, but these models still have inefficiencies.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop an automated pipeline that performs neural architecture search to find more efficient BraggNN architectures. 
- The search optimizes for both accuracy and computational efficiency, measured in bit operations (BOPs).
- Additional optimizations like pruning and quantization further improve efficiency.

Key Contributions:
- The discovered architecture matches BraggNN accuracy while using 13x less BOPs for inference. After compression, this is reduced to 200x less BOPs.
- The architecture uses 3 convolutional blocks without attention, showing attention is not needed to match performance. Batch norm and layer norm are strategically added.
- The hierarchical search space enables optimization flexibility and can be adapted for other scientific domains.
- The open-source automated pipeline democratizes efficient edge AI optimization for non-experts. It can streamline model development from search to hardware deployment.

In summary, the authors develop an automated pipeline leveraging neural architecture search to find highly efficient BraggNN models for diffraction microscopy. The optimized models match previous accuracy with over an order of magnitude inference speedup and computational savings. The modular pipeline aims to make complex edge AI optimization accessible for science domains.
