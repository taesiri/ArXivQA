# [COLON: The largest COlonoscopy LONg sequence public database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00663)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common and 2nd deadliest cancer globally. Detecting and characterizing polyps during colonoscopies is critical for early diagnosis and treatment. 
- However, 6-25% of polyps are missed in colonoscopies due to challenges like camera movements, lighting changes, and visual similarity of polyps and intestinal folds.
- Existing polyp datasets have enabled advances in computational methods, but operate on cropped, expert-selected frames always containing polyps. This is far from real clinical scenarios where polyps represent <1% of colonoscopy frames.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the COLON dataset - the largest colonoscopy video dataset with 30,000+ labeled polyp frames and 400,000 background frames over 30 complete procedures and 10 control videos.
- It has polyps at different stages, variations in preparation procedures, and some surgical instrumentation. Labeled by an expert gastroenterologist.
- Defined tasks are polyp segmentation on all frames and localization across long sequences to bring computational methods closer to real clinical workflows.

Main Contributions:
- Released the largest and most realistic public polyp video dataset to date that captures clinical challenges not seen in existing datasets. 
- Showed current state-of-the-art methods achieve much lower performance on COLON compared to existing datasets, demonstrating need for new techniques.
- Established tasks, baseline evaluations and an evaluation server to enable the community to develop and measure computational methods on complex clinical colonoscopy workflows.

In summary, the paper makes a significant contribution towards advancing polyp characterization research by releasing a large-scale, realistic dataset capturing the challenges of clinical environments. This can enable the community to develop more robust techniques that can translate to improved outcomes in clinical practice.
