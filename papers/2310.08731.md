# [A Simple Way to Incorporate Novelty Detection in World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08731)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can novelty detection be incorporated into world model reinforcement learning agents in order to improve their safety and robustness when deployed in environments that may differ from their training environments?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Using the misalignment between a world model RL agent's predicted states and actual observed states as an anomaly score can enable effective novelty detection.

2) Leveraging the latent space of the world model can allow for detecting unexpected transitions in the environment's dynamics. 

3) Bounding reconstruction error between the world model's prior and posterior can also detect novelty, especially in visual observations.

4) These proposed methods will outperform traditional novelty detection techniques and current RL-focused approaches when evaluated on environments designed to introduce various novelties.

So in summary, the central research question is how to do effective novelty detection for world model RL agents, and the key hypotheses are that the proposed techniques using the world model's properties directly will succeed at this task. The experiments then aim to evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques compared to baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing methods to incorporate novelty detection into world model-based reinforcement learning agents. The paper focuses on two types of methods:

1) Observation-based methods that use reconstruction error between predicted and actual observations to detect novelties. This includes a multi-threshold reconstruction error method and a method comparing prior and posterior reconstructions.

2) Latent-based methods that analyze the latent space encoding learned by the world model to detect novel transitions. This includes bounding the KL divergence of the transition model distributions and adding an optional Mahalanobis distance measure.

- Providing an ontology and precise problem formulation for novelty detection in sequential decision making settings relevant to RL.

- Evaluating the proposed methods on custom MiniGrid environments designed to introduce different types of novelties like changes to visuals or dynamics.

- Comparing against existing RL-focused novelty detection methods like RIQN and showing improved detection performance.

- Analyzing detection delay, false positives/negatives, AUC, etc. to provide insights on the tradeoffs and usefulness of different proposed methods.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing and evaluating techniques to enable world model RL agents to detect unexpected changes in observations or dynamics using the world model itself. This is framed as an important capability for improving robustness and safety when deploying RL agents in real-world settings.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes straightforward bounding approaches to incorporate novelty detection into world model RL agents by utilizing the misalignment between the predicted and observed states as an anomaly score.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of reinforcement learning and novelty detection:

- The paper focuses on detecting novelties and anomalies in reinforcement learning environments using world models. This is an important area of research as RL agents can fail catastrophically when deployed in environments with novel or unexpected changes. Other papers have explored RL novelty detection, but world models provide a useful approach.

- The paper proposes straightforward bounding methods to detect novelties by looking at the mismatch between predicted and true states in a world model framework. This is a simple and intuitive approach compared to some other more complex RL novelty detection methods.

- The paper evaluates the methods on a range of custom MiniGrid environments designed to introduce different types of novelties. Using these customizable environments allows systematic testing of different novelty types, compared to using just a few standard benchmarks.

- The paper compares against an existing RL-focused novelty detection method, RIQN. Showing improved performance over this baseline demonstrates the advantage of the proposed techniques. Other papers have not always benchmarked against other RL novelty detection methods.

- The evaluation metrics used, like average delay error and false positives/negatives, are standard and appropriate for this problem setting. Other papers have used different sets of metrics which makes direct comparison difficult.

- The techniques rely solely on the agent's experience and world model, without needing extra human knowledge or labeling. Some other techniques require additional information or hyperparameter tuning.

Overall, the paper makes solid contributions through the intuitive bounding approaches, using customizable environments for systematic testing, comparisons to an established baseline, and the autonomous nature of the methods. The experiments seem sufficiently thorough to demonstrate the value of the techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key future research directions the authors suggest:

- Developing more sophisticated methods for novelty detection in RL agents. The authors propose some straightforward bounding methods in this paper, but suggest more advanced techniques could be developed.

- Exploring different agent responses to detected novelties beyond just halting execution. The paper focuses on novelty detection, but the authors note that deciding how an agent should respond to a detected novelty is an important area for future work.

- Applying the techniques to more complex environments beyond Minigrid. The authors show results on Minigrid but suggest testing the methods in more complex domains like autonomous driving.

- Improving the observation-based methods like PP-MARE by using better metrics for comparing observations. The authors note PP-MARE relies on a simple reconstruction error metric and could be improved with a better similarity metric.

- Studying the interplay between novelty detection and exploration in RL. The authors suggest future work on how novelty detection could encourage better exploration.

- Developing a more formal ontology of novelty types in RL. The authors provide a basic ontology but suggest more formal characterization could be useful.

- Combining latent and observation methods to minimize false positives/negatives. The authors recommend future work on optimally combining different detection methods.

- Further theoretical analysis of the proposed bounding methods and their properties. The paper empirically evaluates the methods but theoretical analysis could provide more insights.

In summary, the main directions are developing more advanced techniques, testing on more complex domains, improving the observation-based methods, studying the connections to exploration, developing the formal foundations, and combining methods to improve reliability. The authors position their work as an initial investigation that can motivate and enable lots of future research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a simple method for incorporating novelty detection into world model reinforcement learning agents. It focuses on detecting two types of novelties - visual novelties where the observations change, and functional novelties where the transition dynamics change. 

The proposed methods involve computing bounds on reconstruction error and latent state divergence to detect when observations and transitions are out-of-distribution compared to the training environment. Specifically, they compute the difference between prior and posterior observation reconstruction errors, and bound the divergence between the latent state predictions with and without the observation input. Violations of these bounds indicate likely novelty.

Experiments in custom MiniGrid environments demonstrate that these surprise-based techniques can effectively detect visual and functional novelties with low latency and few false positives compared to existing RL novelty detection methods. The results show the utility of leveraging world models for novelty detection in RL agents.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes methods to incorporate novelty detection into world model-based reinforcement learning agents. World models predict future states in a learned environment model. When deployed in the real world, changes to the environment may occur that the agent's world model does not account for. The authors refer to these changes as "novelties" which can be visual changes to the environment or changes in the transition dynamics. Without detecting these novelties, the agent's world model and decisions may become unreliable and unsafe. 

The authors propose bounding approaches to novelty detection based on 1) observations - using reconstruction error between predicted and actual observations and 2) the latent space - comparing learned state transition distributions before and after observing the true next state. Experiments in MiniGrid environments show these methods can quickly detect injected novelties with few false positives compared to common RL novelty detection methods. The methods leverage the agent's world model without relying on additional environment-specific information. The authors conclude that novelty detection is an important ability for safe deployment of world model RL agents in uncontrolled real world environments.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes methods for incorporating novelty detection into world model reinforcement learning agents. The world model predicts the next state given the current state and action. When a novelty or unexpected change occurs in the environment, it can cause the world model predictions to diverge from the true states. The paper introduces two approaches for detecting when such novelties occur by monitoring the world model - an observation-based method using reconstruction error between predicted and actual observations, and a latent-based method using bounds on the KL divergence between the world model's prior and posterior over the latent state space. Specifically, the observation method looks at the difference in reconstruction error between sampling the prior and posterior, while the latent method looks at whether the KL divergence between prior and posterior violates an expected bound. Exceeding these bounds indicates the world model is no longer accurately predicting states, likely due to a novelty. These methods aim to detect novelties and halt the agent policy to avoid catastrophic mistakes in the changed environment.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper appears to address the challenge of detecting novel or unexpected changes in the environment when using reinforcement learning (RL) with world models. Specifically, it focuses on detecting "visual novelties" like changes to objects or colors, and "functional novelties" like changes to state transition dynamics. 

The key problems it aims to address are:

- When novelties occur in the environment, the RL agent's performance can dramatically decline since its policy is no longer reliable. This can lead to catastrophic mistakes or dangerous behaviors.

- Traditional novelty/anomaly detection methods from machine learning don't work well in an online RL setting. New approaches are needed.

- Current RL-focused novelty detection methods have limitations like reliance on reward signal deterioration, high sample complexity, or inability to generalize well.

To address these issues, the paper proposes new methods for novelty detection that leverage the world model's components like its latent space and learned distributions. The key intuition is that when novelties occur, it will create misalignment between the world model's predictions and the true observations. This misalignment can be measured and used as an anomaly score to detect novelties with low lag time.

The main contributions appear to be:

- A taxonomy of novelty types relevant to RL.

- New observation-based methods using reconstruction error thresholds. 

- New latent space methods based on bounding the divergence between predicted and observed latent states.

- Experiments showing these methods can effectively detect novelties in RL environments compared to prior techniques.

In summary, the key focus is on developing better novelty detection techniques to make world model-based RL agents safer and more robust when deployed in environments where unexpected changes can happen.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using the misalignment between the world model's hallucinated states and the true observed states as an anomaly score for detecting novelties. However, how can we ensure that the world model is accurately modeling the true environment dynamics and not just memorizing the training data? Is there a way to quantitatively evaluate the generalization capability of the learned world model?

2. For the Bayesian surprise approach, how was the prior distribution initialized and updated during training? Does the choice of prior distribution significantly impact the novelty detection performance? 

3. When comparing the post-prior mean absolute reconstruction error (PP-MARE), why is the mean reconstruction error not an optimized measure for computing differences between observations? What other similarity/difference metrics could be used instead to improve the AUC for PP-MARE?

4. For the dynamic KL divergence bounding method, what are some ways to improve or relax the assumptions made about the latent space model dynamics? Could learned bounds or meta-learning approaches help make this method more robust?

5. The Mahalanobis extension for low-variance transitions seems very promising. However, how was the relaxing hyperparameter λ determined? Is there a principled way to set this automatically based on environment dynamics?

6. For the OCC model training, could the poor performance be attributed to mode collapse or overfitting issues? What regularization techniques could help the OCC model generalize better to unseen novelty distributions? 

7. The paper focuses on detecting novelty during evaluation/deployment after the world model is fully trained. Could these methods be adapted for online novelty detection during world model training as well? What modifications would be needed?

8. How sensitive are these methods to the choice of world model architecture? Could they be applied to other types of learned dynamics models besides DreamerV2? What are the requirements?

9. For real-world applications like autonomous driving, is the detection speed fast enough for safety-critical decisions? How could the latency/throughput be improved?

10. The paper assumes the agent halts when novelty is detected. However, how could these methods be extended to enable some model or policy adaptation after novelty is detected rather than just halting?

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes two types of bounding approaches for novelty detection in model-based reinforcement learning: latent-based methods using the agent's learned latent space, and observation-based methods bounding reconstruction error between the agent's prior and posterior. The methods are evaluated in Minigrid environments designed to introduce novel visual stimuli or changes in transition dynamics that would confound a trained agent. The results demonstrate that both latent and observation-based approaches successfully detect novelties faster and more accurately compared to traditional machine learning and RL anomaly detection techniques. Specifically, the latent methods utilizing the surprise of the world model's predicted latent state distribution relative to the observed state perform the best across metrics like average delay, false positives/negatives, and AUC. The observation methods struggle more with false positives but provide complementary visual novelty detection. Overall, the proposed techniques advance novelty detection for RL agents in non-stationary environments where unexpected changes can lead to unreliable policies and catastrophic failures if undetected.
