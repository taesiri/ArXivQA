# [AutoMathText: Autonomous Data Selection with Language Models for   Mathematical Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07625)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need for high-quality, domain-specific datasets to enhance language models' capabilities in mathematical reasoning and problem-solving. However, collecting and curating such datasets is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a novel strategy that leverages base language models equipped with zero-shot meta-prompts to autonomously evaluate and select mathematical content. 
- Formulate a scoring function based on model logits to quantify content quality without human annotations or classifier training.
- Apply this approach to create the open-source AutoMathText dataset from diverse sources like Common Crawl, arXiv and GitHub.

Key Contributions:
1. Demonstrate the efficacy of using meta-prompted base LMs for zero-shot verification and autonomous data selection.
2. Release the 200GB+ AutoMathText dataset to enrich model training with mathematical content.
3. Show substantial improvements in a 7B Mistral LM's downstream math performance after continual pretraining on AutoMathText, underscoring 2x higher token efficiency.

The key insight is to tap into base LMs' capabilities for autonomous assessment, circumventing traditional alignment approaches like SFT or RLHF. This self-supervised evaluation technique is applied to efficiently create the AutoMathText dataset. Experiments highlight the efficacy of this method in enhancing mathematical reasoning skills with higher data efficiency.
