# [Agents meet OKR: An Object and Key Results Driven Agent System with   Hierarchical Self-Collaboration and Self-Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16542)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces OKR-Agent, a novel hierarchical framework to enhance the task-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Motivated by the success of Objectives and Key Results (OKR) systems in corporations, OKR-Agent recursively decomposes complex input tasks into multiple layers of OKRs and dynamically assigns specialized agents to work on each element. Additionally, a multi-level self-evaluation module leverages criteria generation and reviews from related agents to refine outputs iteratively. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in producing detailed and coherent solutions for intricate creative tasks like storyboarding and trip planning. The hierarchical self-collaborative structure of OKR-Agent effectively coordinates the problem-solving process from strategic planning to nuanced execution details, addressing the limitations of LLMs and advancing their practical applicability. Key highlights include outperforming state-of-the-art methods in maintaining correctness while improving detail quality and depth for creative content generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes OKR-Agent, a hierarchical agent system with self-collaboration and self-evaluation mechanisms for complex task solving.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new hierarchical and self-collaborative approach for complex task solving called OKR-Agent. This approach decomposes tasks into distinct objectives and key results, assigns agents to each objective and key result, and allows agents to recursively break down objectives and key results into more detailed ones. 

2. It proposes a novel multi-level self-evaluation mechanism that allows each agent to evaluate the solution from all relevant perspectives, ensuring the evaluations cover both high-level strategic aspects and low-level detailed aspects. This aims to improve the accuracy and quality of the final solution.

3. It demonstrates the efficacy of OKR-Agent on diverse complex tasks like short video storyboard generation, multi-day trip planning, and trivia creative writing. Experiments show it can produce superior overall planning and richer details compared to previous LLM-based methods for task solving.

In summary, the main contribution is a new agent-based framework called OKR-Agent that utilizes hierarchical decomposition, role-based self-collaboration, and multi-level self-evaluation to enhance the performance of LLMs on complex task solving.
