# [Glow-TTS: A Generative Flow for Text-to-Speech via Monotonic Alignment   Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11129)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we develop a text-to-speech (TTS) model that does not require an external aligner and can synthesize speech quickly and robustly?

The key hypotheses of the paper appear to be:

1) By combining flows and dynamic programming for alignment, a TTS model can learn to align text and speech representations internally without needing a pre-trained autoregressive TTS model as an external aligner.

2) Enforcing hard monotonic alignments between text and latent speech representations enables robust TTS that generalizes to long utterances. 

3) Using flows for the decoder enables fast, diverse, and controllable speech synthesis.

So in summary, the central goal is to develop a standalone parallel TTS model that does not rely on external aligners, can synthesize speech robustly and quickly, and allows control over factors like pitch and speaking rate. The key ideas are using flows and monotonic alignment search to achieve these properties.
