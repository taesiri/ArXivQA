# [CBOW Is Not All You Need: Combining CBOW with the Compositional Matrix   Space Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06423)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we enhance simple word embedding-based sentence encoders with word order awareness in an efficient way?

Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates a method to add word order sensitivity to the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model by combining it with the Compositional Matrix Space Model (CMSM) via matrix multiplication. 

The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:

1) The CMSM, when trained properly, can capture word order information better than the commutative, order-insensitive CBOW model. 

2) CBOW and CMSM learn complementary types of linguistic information from text.

3) A hybrid CBOW-CMSM model can combine their strengths to create a sentence encoder that is both efficient and encodes useful linguistic properties like word order.

4) This hybrid model will outperform both CBOW and CMSM alone on relevant downstream tasks.

So in summary, the central research question is about efficiently injecting word order awareness into simple word embedding-based encoders like CBOW, with the key hypothesis being that a hybrid CBOW-CMSM model can achieve this. The paper provides empirical support for this hypothesis through comparative evaluations on probing and downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting an efficient, unsupervised learning scheme for training the Compositional Matrix Space Model (CMSM) of language. Specifically:

- They propose an efficient training algorithm called Continual Multiplication Of Words (CMOW) that adapts the CBOW algorithm from word2vec to train CMSMs on large unlabeled corpora. 

- They introduce two key modifications to make CBOW suitable for training CMSMs: a novel initialization strategy and modifying the training objective.

- They empirically show that CMOW and CBOW learn complementary linguistic properties. CBOW is better at word content memorization while CMOW better captures other linguistic properties like word order.

- They propose a hybrid CBOW-CMOW model that combines the strengths of both approaches, outperforming them individually on downstream tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting the first unsupervised training scheme for CMSMs and showing it can be effectively combined with CBOW in a hybrid model to improve performance on downstream NLP tasks. This helps narrow the gap between simple word embedding models and more complex recurrent encoders in terms of representational power.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new hybrid model called CBOW-CMOW that combines Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Continual Multiplication of Words (CMOW) to create sentence embeddings that retain CBOW's ability to memorize word content while improving the encoding of other linguistic properties.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other aggregation functions besides summation and multiplication for composing word embeddings into sentence embeddings. The paper focuses on comparing summation (used in CBOW) and multiplication (used in CMOW), but mentions there may be other useful functions to consider.

- Applying the CMOW model and training approach to other embedding techniques besides CBOW, such as fastText. The authors propose their hybrid CBOW-CMOW model could serve as a blueprint for incorporating CMOW into other existing embedding methods.

- Investigating dynamic programming techniques to further optimize computation of the matrix multiplications in CMOW. The associativity of matrix multiplication means techniques like caching frequent bigrams could help reduce sequential steps needed for encoding.

- Evaluating the CMOW model on a wider range of downstream tasks beyond what is included in the SentEval framework used in the paper. The authors note most of the SentEval tasks focus on word content memorization, which favors CBOW, so testing on more tasks requiring word order information could be beneficial.

- Comparing CMOW to more recent benchmark sentence encoding techniques like BERT rather than just CBOW/fastText. The authors acknowledge their models are not state-of-the-art but focus on analyzing CBOW vs CMOW.

- Exploring unsupervised objectives beyond the word2vec-style prediction task used in the paper. The authors suggest their training scheme could incentivize better learning of semantic properties.

- Analyzing what linguistic properties and features are captured by CMOW vs. CBOW embeddings using techniques like probing classifiers. The authors empirically demonstrate complementary strengths but do not deeply analyze what causes them.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called Continual Multiplication Of Words (CMOW) for training the Compositional Matrix Space Model (CMSM) on large unlabeled datasets. CMSM represents words as matrices rather than vectors, allowing it to capture word order information unlike previous approaches like CBOW that use vector addition. The key contributions are: 1) An efficient unsupervised training scheme for CMSM using modifications to the word2vec CBOW objective and initialization strategy. 2) Empirical analysis showing CMOW better captures linguistic properties while CBOW is better at word content memorization. 3) A hybrid CBOW-CMOW model combining their complementary strengths, which improves performance on downstream tasks requiring word order information by 1.2% on average over CBOW. The proposed methods offer a computationally efficient way to make simple word aggregation models like CBOW more expressive in capturing word order and other linguistic properties.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new learning algorithm called Continual Multiplication Of Words (CMOW) for training the Compositional Matrix Space Model (CMSM). CMSM represents each word as a matrix rather than a vector, allowing it to capture word order information through matrix multiplication. However, previous CMSM training algorithms required complex initialization strategies. The key contribution is that CMOW adapts the CBOW algorithm from word2vec to effectively train CMSMs on large unlabeled datasets. CMOW makes two main changes: initializing word matrices near the identity, and randomly sampling context words as prediction targets. 

Experiments show CMOW and CBOW capture complementary linguistic properties. CBOW performs better at word content memorization while CMOW is superior at other probing tasks involving word order. A hybrid CBOW-CMOW model is proposed to leverage both approaches, which improves upon CBOW at probing tasks by 8% and downstream tasks by 1.2% on average. The results demonstrate CMOW provides a computationally efficient way to make simple word embedding models like CBOW more order-aware, narrowing the gap with costly RNN encoders. Overall, the paper makes CMSMs viable for large-scale text encoding.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on compositional models for learning sentence embeddings:

- It proposes CMOW (Continual Multiplication of Words), which is the first unsupervised training method for learning parameters of the Compositional Matrix Space Model (CMSM) on large unlabeled corpora. Previous work on CMSMs focused on supervised training for sentiment analysis.

- The paper shows CMOW better captures certain linguistic properties like word order compared to CBOW, while CBOW is better at word content memorization. This demonstrates complementary strengths. 

- It proposes a novel hybrid CBOW-CMOW model that combines the strengths of both approaches, outperforming them individually on several downstream tasks. Most prior work on compositional models did not explore hybrids.

- The hybrid CBOW-CMOW model is still simple and efficient compared to more complex recurrent or attention-based models for sentences. But it incorporates order information unlike traditional CBOW.

- The performance of CMOW and the hybrid model is comparable to fastSent and not state-of-the-art. The focus is on analyzing differences between vector addition vs matrix multiplication for composition.

So in summary, the key novelties are proposing an unsupervised training method for CMSMs, demonstrating complementary strengths versus CBOW, and showing improvements from a simple hybrid model. The tradeoffs between different composition functions are analyzed in more depth compared to prior work.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Continual Multiplication Of Words (CMOW) to train the Compositional Matrix Space Model (CMSM) of language on large amounts of unlabeled text data. CMOW is adapted from the continuous bag of words (CBOW) method in word2vec by making two key changes to the initialization strategy and training objective. The CMSM represents each word as a matrix rather than a vector, allowing it to capture word order information through matrix multiplication. CMOW initializes the word matrices close to the identity matrix rather than small random values to prevent vanishing values. It also randomly samples the target word for the training objective rather than using the center word to force learning richer sentence semantics. Experiments show CMOW better captures linguistic properties while CBOW memorizes word content better. A hybrid CBOW-CMOW model is proposed to combine their complementary strengths.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the limitation of Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) word embeddings in capturing word order information. The key points are:

- CBOW embeddings perform addition to aggregate word vectors into a sentence embedding. Addition is commutative, so CBOW embeddings cannot capture word order. 

- The paper proposes training the Compositional Matrix Space Model (CMSM) using an approach adapted from word2vec's CBOW. In CMSM, words are represented as matrices and composed via multiplication rather than addition. Matrix multiplication is non-commutative so it can capture word order.

- They present the first unsupervised training scheme for CMSM called Continual Multiplication of Words (CMOW). Key elements are a new initialization strategy and modified training objective.

- Empirically, they show CBOW and CMOW learn complementary strengths: CBOW is better at memorizing word content while CMOW better captures other linguistic properties like word order. 

- They propose a hybrid CBOW-CMOW model to combine the strengths of both. The hybrid model outperforms both individual models on downstream tasks, improving over CBOW on tasks needing word order information.

In summary, the paper aims to address CBOW's limitation in encoding word order by proposing an efficient training scheme for the order-aware CMSM, and showing a hybrid CBOW-CMSM model can improve over CBOW alone.
