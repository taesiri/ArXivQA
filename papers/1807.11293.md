# [Improving Spatiotemporal Self-Supervision by Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11293)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can reinforcement learning be used to improve spatiotemporal self-supervision for learning powerful visual representations?

More specifically, the paper proposes using deep reinforcement learning to learn an adaptive policy for sampling permutations during self-supervised training. The goal is to sample permutations that are most useful for the network to learn good representations at each stage of training. This allows the permutations to adapt to the evolving state of the network.

The key hypothesis is that sampling permutations in an adaptive, non-random way during self-supervised training will lead to improved visual representations compared to using random permutations.

In summary, the paper presents a reinforcement learning framework for adaptive permutation sampling to improve self-supervised visual representation learning in both the spatial and temporal domains. The central hypothesis is that this adaptive approach will outperform standard random permutation sampling.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a reinforcement learning-based approach to improve spatiotemporal self-supervision for learning convolutional neural network (CNN) feature representations. 

Specifically, the key ideas/contributions are:

- Proposing a method to jointly learn from spatial and temporal shuffling as complementary self-supervision tasks for unsupervised representation learning. 

- Using a policy network based on reinforcement learning to dynamically propose permutations (shufflings) for training the main CNN network. The policy adapts the permutations based on the state of the CNN being trained.

- Showing improved performance on benchmark tasks compared to prior self-supervision methods that use fixed random permutations. The learned features transfer better to tasks like image classification, object detection, segmentation, etc.

- Analyzing the effect of the proposed approach through ablations and visualizations. Combining spatial and temporal tasks improves over individual tasks. The policy helps select useful permutations leading to faster improvement.

So in summary, the main contribution is developing an adaptive reinforcement learning-based approach for sampling permutations to improve self-supervision from spatial and temporal ordering tasks. This leads to learning better general visual representations in an unsupervised manner.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using deep reinforcement learning to train a policy network that adaptively selects spatiotemporal permutations for self-supervised learning of convolutional neural network representations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in self-supervised learning:

- Combines spatial and temporal ordering tasks into a joint spatiotemporal self-supervision framework. Most prior work has focused on either spatial or temporal ordering tasks separately. Jointly training on both provides complementary signals.

- Introduces a reinforcement learning policy to adaptively sample permutations during training based on the model's current state. Other self-supervision methods use fixed random permutations. The policy allows more informative permutations to be selected as the model evolves.

- Achieves competitive results on standard benchmarks like ImageNet classification and Pascal VOC transfer tasks compared to prior self-supervision methods. The joint spatiotemporal training and adaptive permutation sampling appear to provide better representations.

- Uses a relatively simple backbone architecture (CaffeNet) compared to some other recent self-supervision papers that use deeper ResNet models. This suggests the approach itself provides gains above just model size.

- Provides ablation studies and analysis to isolate the improvements from the joint training and adaptive permutations. This demonstrates the value of the key components.

- The method does require some extra computation for the policy network and validation, but analysis shows it is relatively small compared to the base self-supervised training.

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in adapting self-supervision for ordering tasks by training jointly over space and time and learning a adaptive permutation policy. The results demonstrate this provides better representations than prior work while still using a simple base architecture. The approach seems promising for further exploration.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other reinforcement learning algorithms besides policy gradient, such as Q-learning, to optimize the permutation selection policy. The authors used policy gradient but mention Q-learning as another option.

- Trying more complex and deeper network architectures beyond CaffeNet. The authors used a relatively simple CNN architecture and suggest experimenting with more advanced and deeper models.

- Evaluating the approach on larger datasets beyond Imagenet and UCF101/HMDB51. The authors demonstrate results on standard benchmarks but suggest applying the method to larger-scale datasets.

- Combining the spatiotemporal self-supervision approach with other self-supervised tasks like colorization, context prediction, etc. The authors propose jointly training spatial and temporal shuffle tasks, but suggest combining with other tasks too.

- Exploring curriculum learning schedules predicted by the policy, rather than randomly sampled permutations. The policy currently does not follow a curriculum, but learning one is suggested. 

- Reducing the computational overhead of the policy training, which currently requires additional validation. More efficient approximations to compute the policy's state and reward are suggested.

- Applying the reinforcement learning framework to other computer vision problems besides self-supervision. The authors propose it for optimizing permutations here but suggest it may benefit other vision tasks.

In summary, the main future directions are exploring other algorithms, network architectures, datasets, task combinations, curriculum learning, efficiency improvements, and applications of deep reinforcement learning to vision.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an approach for improving spatiotemporal self-supervision of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by using deep reinforcement learning. The key ideas are:

- Self-supervision based on ordering tasks like spatial image shuffling or temporal video frame shuffling provide a rich training signal for CNNs. Previous works have randomly sampled permutations for shuffling, but optimal permutations likely depend on the state of the network being trained. 

- A reinforcement learning agent is proposed to learn a policy for adaptively selecting permutations based on the network state. The policy receives the validation error of permutations as state, and improvement in validation error over a baseline as reward. 

- Experiments show the learned adaptive permutation selection improves unsupervised feature learning on standard benchmarks like image classification, retrieval, detection and segmentation. Combining spatial and temporal shuffling tasks also improves over individual tasks. The approach is computationally efficient, with only 40% overhead compared to basic self-supervised training.

In summary, this paper introduces an elegant method to make self-supervision by shuffling more adaptive and learn even better visual features, by using reinforcement learning to optimize the core shuffling permutations based on the network's state during training.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to improve self-supervised learning of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for visual representation learning. Self-supervised learning uses surrogate tasks with automatically obtained labels to train feature representations from unlabeled data. The paper focuses on the tasks of spatial and temporal ordering, where the model must determine the original order of shuffled image patches or video frames. Previous methods randomly sample permutations of the data for these tasks. The key idea in this work is to use deep reinforcement learning to learn an adaptive policy for proposing better permutations based on the current state of the CNN being trained. 

Specifically, they formulate the problem as a Markov decision process where the policy network learns to select permutation groups for a sampled image or video clip based on a state representation. The state captures the model's current accuracy on a validation set with different permutations. The policy aims to maximize a reward signal based on the reduction in validation error after training the CNN with the proposed permutations. Experiments demonstrate improved unsupervised learning and transfer performance to tasks like classification, detection and segmentation versus random permutations. The policy enables more efficient training without hand-designing a curriculum.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach to improve self-supervised learning of convolutional neural networks. The self-supervised task involves predicting the correct spatial and temporal order of shuffled image tiles or video frames. Rather than randomly sampling permutations for this task, the authors train a policy network to propose good permutations based on the current state of the main network being trained. The policy network takes as input a state representation based on validation set performance, and outputs an action corresponding to a set of related permutations to apply. It is trained via policy gradient to maximize the reward, which is the improvement over a baseline error. This allows the permutations to be adaptively selected according to their utility for the current network state. The policy network is trained simultaneously with the main self-supervised convolutional network, with sparse updates to minimize added computational cost. Experiments demonstrate improved unsupervised feature learning and transfer performance on tasks like classification and detection.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method to improve self-supervised learning of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by jointly addressing ordering of visual data in both the spatial and temporal domain. The core idea is to use deep reinforcement learning to learn an adaptive policy for sampling permutations of the training data. Previous self-supervised methods based on predicting permutations have used a fixed, random set of permutations. Instead, this paper trains a policy network with reinforcement learning to select permutations according to their expected utility for improving the CNN representation at each stage of training. The policy models action probabilities to avoid overfitting to a small subset of permutations. It takes the state of the CNN as input, quantified by validation performance on a held-out set. A policy gradient algorithm is used to train the policy by maximizing a reward signal based on improved validation error over a baseline. Experiments demonstrate that combining spatial and temporal shuffle tasks improves representations compared to each individually. Further, the adaptive permutation sampling provides significant gains over random permutation selection for self-supervised pretraining. When transferred to tasks like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and action recognition, the method achieves competitive performance, highlighting the generality of the learned features. Overall, this work presents a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for permutation selection in self-supervised learning that improves feature learning.
