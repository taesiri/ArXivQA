# [Improving Spatiotemporal Self-Supervision by Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11293)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can reinforcement learning be used to improve spatiotemporal self-supervision for learning powerful visual representations?More specifically, the paper proposes using deep reinforcement learning to learn an adaptive policy for sampling permutations during self-supervised training. The goal is to sample permutations that are most useful for the network to learn good representations at each stage of training. This allows the permutations to adapt to the evolving state of the network.The key hypothesis is that sampling permutations in an adaptive, non-random way during self-supervised training will lead to improved visual representations compared to using random permutations.In summary, the paper presents a reinforcement learning framework for adaptive permutation sampling to improve self-supervised visual representation learning in both the spatial and temporal domains. The central hypothesis is that this adaptive approach will outperform standard random permutation sampling.
