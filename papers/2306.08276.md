# [TryOnDiffusion: A Tale of Two UNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08276)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we generate high-resolution photorealistic virtual try-on results that preserve garment details and warp/deform the garment naturally for significant changes in body pose and shape between the person and the garment image?The key hypothesis is that a diffusion model architecture with two communicating UNet streams (dubbed Parallel-UNet) can effectively achieve garment warping and person blending in a single network, leading to better preservation of garment details compared to prior work. Specifically, the two key ideas this Parallel-UNet architecture explores are:1) Implicit garment warping via cross-attention between the garment and person streams, rather than relying on explicit flow estimation or thin-plate splines. 2) Combining garment warping and person blending in a single network pass rather than as separate sequential steps.The aim is to generate photorealistic 1024x1024 try-on results that can handle differences in body pose and shape while keeping intricate garment details intact, which has been a major limitation of previous virtual try-on methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. They propose a new method called TryOnDiffusion for virtual try-on that can handle large occlusions, pose changes, and body shape changes, while preserving garment details at high 1024x1024 resolution. 2. They introduce a novel architecture called Parallel-UNet, which can warp the garment implicitly using cross attention and combines garment warping and person-garment blending in one network pass.3. They achieve state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Their results were chosen as best 92.72% of the time compared to other recent methods in a user study.4. They generate photorealistic virtual try-on results at 1024x1024 resolution that accommodate significant body pose and shape modification, while preserving garment details like patterns, text, and labels.In summary, the key innovation is the Parallel-UNet architecture that allows implicit garment warping via cross attention and unifies garment warp and person blend in one network. This addresses limitations of prior methods that either fail to preserve details or cause artifacts when warping garments to fit new body shapes and poses.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new diffusion model architecture called Parallel-UNet for virtual try-on that can warp garments to fit diverse body poses and shapes while preserving garment details, through the use of cross-attention between two sub-networks to perform implicit warping and joint warping-blending in a unified process.
