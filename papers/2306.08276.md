# [TryOnDiffusion: A Tale of Two UNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08276)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we generate high-resolution photorealistic virtual try-on results that preserve garment details and warp/deform the garment naturally for significant changes in body pose and shape between the person and the garment image?The key hypothesis is that a diffusion model architecture with two communicating UNet streams (dubbed Parallel-UNet) can effectively achieve garment warping and person blending in a single network, leading to better preservation of garment details compared to prior work. Specifically, the two key ideas this Parallel-UNet architecture explores are:1) Implicit garment warping via cross-attention between the garment and person streams, rather than relying on explicit flow estimation or thin-plate splines. 2) Combining garment warping and person blending in a single network pass rather than as separate sequential steps.The aim is to generate photorealistic 1024x1024 try-on results that can handle differences in body pose and shape while keeping intricate garment details intact, which has been a major limitation of previous virtual try-on methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. They propose a new method called TryOnDiffusion for virtual try-on that can handle large occlusions, pose changes, and body shape changes, while preserving garment details at high 1024x1024 resolution. 2. They introduce a novel architecture called Parallel-UNet, which can warp the garment implicitly using cross attention and combines garment warping and person-garment blending in one network pass.3. They achieve state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Their results were chosen as best 92.72% of the time compared to other recent methods in a user study.4. They generate photorealistic virtual try-on results at 1024x1024 resolution that accommodate significant body pose and shape modification, while preserving garment details like patterns, text, and labels.In summary, the key innovation is the Parallel-UNet architecture that allows implicit garment warping via cross attention and unifies garment warp and person blend in one network. This addresses limitations of prior methods that either fail to preserve details or cause artifacts when warping garments to fit new body shapes and poses.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new diffusion model architecture called Parallel-UNet for virtual try-on that can warp garments to fit diverse body poses and shapes while preserving garment details, through the use of cross-attention between two sub-networks to perform implicit warping and joint warping-blending in a unified process.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in virtual try-on:- The paper focuses on synthesizing high-resolution (1024x1024) try-on results with complex body poses and shapes while preserving fine garment details. Many previous methods struggle with these challenging cases. - The proposed method TryOnDiffusion is based on diffusion models, which have become state-of-the-art for image generation. Diffusion models have not been extensively explored for virtual try-on before.- A novel neural architecture called Parallel-UNet is introduced. It allows implicit garment warping via cross attention and combines warping and image blending in one network. This is different from most works that perform explicit warping followed by a separate image blending step.- The paper demonstrates superior performance both quantitatively (lower FID/KID) and qualitatively compared to recent state-of-the-art methods like TryOnGAN, SDAFN, HR-VITON. An extensive user study with over 2000 samples also prefers their results over others.- The training data is based on 4 million image pairs of the same person in different poses. This is much larger than datasets used in other works, which allows modeling more variation.- Limitations are that the method focuses on upper body clothing and relies on separate pose/segmentation estimation steps. The clothing-agnostic representation may also lose some identity information.Overall, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in virtual try-on, especially for challenging cases with large pose/shape differences and garment details preservation. The proposed model architecture and training data are key factors behind the improved performance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring the applicability of the proposed Parallel-UNet architecture for general image editing tasks beyond just virtual try-on. The authors believe this architecture could be useful for other image-to-image translation problems that involve complex spatial transformations.- Extending the approach to video try-on by adapting the architecture to model temporal consistency across frames. The authors suggest the Parallel-UNet concept could potentially be extended to video.- Improving the representation of personal identity in the clothing-agnostic RGB image. Currently this representation only preserves partial identity information like face and hands. The authors note limitations in representing aspects like tattoos, muscle structure, and accessories. - Testing the method on more complex backgrounds beyond the relatively simple/clean backgrounds used in training and testing. It is unknown how the method generalizes to cluttered backgrounds.- Experimenting with full body try-on rather than just upper body clothing. The current work focuses on tops but the approach could be adapted to full body in future work.- Continuing to scale up the training data size to improve results. The experiments show benefit from increasing dataset size from 10K to 100K to 4M pairs.In summary, the main future directions are around extending the approach to new tasks/domains, improving identity representation, and scaling up the data and training. The Parallel-UNet architecture seems promising for other image editing tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a diffusion-based method called TryOnDiffusion for virtual apparel try-on at high resolution ($1024\times1024$), allowing large changes in body pose and shape while preserving garment details. The key contribution is a novel architecture consisting of two UNets communicating via cross attention, referred to as Parallel-UNet. One UNet handles the target person while the other handles the source garment. Implicit warping between the two is achieved by cross attention between their features, avoiding the need to explicitly compute flow or distortions. Parallel-UNet unifies garment warping and blending into a single network, enabling information exchange at the feature level. A cascade of Parallel-UNet diffusions and super-resolution diffusion generates the final high-res try-on result. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with successful garment warping even under heavy occlusion and shape change, and preservation of fine details like textures and text. An extensive user study indicates the method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents TryOnDiffusion, a diffusion model for apparel virtual try-on that can generate high-resolution ($1024\times1024$) photorealistic results while preserving garment details and handling significant changes in body pose and shape between the person and garment images. The key contribution is a novel \unet architecture with two main components: 1) Implicit garment warping is done via a cross-attention mechanism between the garment and person features, allowing long-range correspondences even with occlusions or pose differences. 2) Garment warping and person blending are combined in one network pass rather than sequentially, enabling better feature-level information exchange. TryOnDiffusion employs a cascade of diffusion models, with the \unet variants operating at lower resolutions before final super-resolution diffusion. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons to recent methods show state-of-the-art performance. The authors also conducted an extensive user study where non-experts overwhelmingly ranked TryOnDiffusion results as best compared to others. Limitations include sensitivity to segmentation and pose errors, identity information loss with the clothing-agnostic RGB representation, and primarily upper-body clothing synthesis. Overall, TryOnDiffusion's novel \unet architecture enables photorealistic virtual try-on while preserving details even with significant garment and body differences.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel diffusion model architecture called Parallel-UNet for high-quality virtual try-on image synthesis. The key ideas are: 1) The garment is warped implicitly using cross-attention between the target person features and the garment features, avoiding artifacts from explicit flow estimation. 2) Garment warping and blending the garment onto the person are performed together in one pass using two Parallel UNets, rather than sequentially. This allows better exchange of information between warping and blending stages. The overall pipeline uses cascaded diffusion models, with the Parallel-UNet for low-resolution generation followed by super-resolution diffusion for high-resolution 1024x1024 output. Experiments show this method achieves state-of-the-art results in preserving garment details and generating realistic wrinkles/folds even with large pose/shape differences between the person and garment images.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the problem of virtual try-on, where the goal is to visualize how a garment might look when worn by a person, given an image of the person and an image of the garment worn by someone else. The key challenges are:1) Warping the garment image to fit the shape and pose of the target person, while preserving garment details like patterns and textures. Previous methods using explicit warping like thin-plate splines or optical flow can distort details when there are large pose/shape differences.2) Blending the warped garment with the target person image. Even if a powerful generative model is used, it can be hard to remove artifacts from the warped garment.3) Generating high-resolution photorealistic try-on visualizations that capture garment details.So in summary, the main question is how to synthesize realistic virtual try-on results that can handle significant changes in body shape/pose across the person and garment images, while preserving intricate garment details, patterns, and textures at high resolution.
