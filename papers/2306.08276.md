# [TryOnDiffusion: A Tale of Two UNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08276)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we generate high-resolution photorealistic virtual try-on results that preserve garment details and warp/deform the garment naturally for significant changes in body pose and shape between the person and the garment image?The key hypothesis is that a diffusion model architecture with two communicating UNet streams (dubbed Parallel-UNet) can effectively achieve garment warping and person blending in a single network, leading to better preservation of garment details compared to prior work. Specifically, the two key ideas this Parallel-UNet architecture explores are:1) Implicit garment warping via cross-attention between the garment and person streams, rather than relying on explicit flow estimation or thin-plate splines. 2) Combining garment warping and person blending in a single network pass rather than as separate sequential steps.The aim is to generate photorealistic 1024x1024 try-on results that can handle differences in body pose and shape while keeping intricate garment details intact, which has been a major limitation of previous virtual try-on methods.
