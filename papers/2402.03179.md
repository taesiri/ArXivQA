# [Cool-chic video: Learned video coding with 800 parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03179)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conventional video codecs like AVC, HEVC have high complexity encoders that optimize encoding but simple decoders.
- Neural video codecs achieve good rate-distortion performance but have very high decoding complexity (millions of multiplications per pixel).
- Existing learned "overfitted" codecs like NeRV and HNeRV compress the entire video as a single neural network, preventing low-delay coding.

Proposed Solution:
- Extend the Cool-chic overfitted image codec with an inter-coding module for video. 
- Cool-chic relies on overfitted latent feature maps instead of a full neural network, enabling low decoding complexity.
- The inter coding module performs motion compensation from reference frames and residual coding to remove temporal redundancies. 
- This allows low-delay and random access configurations, with encoding done per-frame instead of jointly.

Main Contributions:
- Decoder complexity of only 900 multiplications per pixel.
- Frame-level encoding enabling low-delay and random access configurations.  
- Rate-distortion performance close to AVC and better than prior overfitted codec FFNeRV.
- Entire system made open source to enable further research into low-complexity learned video compression.

In summary, this paper proposes a video extension to the Cool-chic image codec with very low decoding complexity. By relying on compact latent representations instead of full neural networks, it can perform inter-frame prediction while retaining 900 multiply complexity. This also allows frame-level optimization, supporting low-delay coding unlike other overfitted approaches. The overall rate-distortion results are strong, outperforming AVC at low bitrates and offering substantial gains over FFNeRV. By opensourcing the entire codec, the paper aims to spur further research into practical, low-complexity learned video compression.
