# [Fractional Deep Reinforcement Learning for Age-Minimal Mobile Edge   Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10418)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the timeliness of computational task updates in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, measured by Age of Information (AoI). It studies how to jointly optimize the task updating (i.e., when to generate the next task) and offloading (i.e., whether to offload the task and where) policies to minimize the AoI. The challenges come from the unknown edge load dynamics, the fractional form of AoI objective, and the hybrid continuous-discrete action space due to joint optimization.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a fractional reinforcement learning (RL) framework to address the challenges. It first reformulates the problem by leveraging Dinkelbach's method to handle the fractional objective. Based on this, a fractional Q-learning algorithm is proposed with linear convergence guarantee. To further deal with unknown dynamics and hybrid action space, the paper designs a model-free fractional deep RL algorithm, extending dueling double DQN and DDPG into the proposed fractional RL framework. Specifically, it enables distributed learning of task updating policy (by DDPG) and offloading policy (by DQN) simultaneously. 

Main Contributions:
1) Formulates the joint task updating and offloading problem for age-minimal MEC under unknown dynamics.
2) Proposes a novel fractional RL framework and algorithms to handle fractional AoI objective.
3) Overcomes hybrid action space challenge by integrating DQN and DDPG under the proposed fractional RL framework.
4) Designs a distributed fractional DRL algorithm for each device to learn age-minimal policies without knowing others.
5) Experimental results demonstrate significant AoI reduction of the proposed algorithms compared to benchmarks. The joint updating and offloading optimization further improves the performance.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in enabling age-minimal MEC system design through a new fractional RL/DRL approach. The results showcase great promise of using learning for tackling new networking challenges with unfamiliar mathematical properties.
