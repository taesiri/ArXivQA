# [ProTrix: Building Models for Planning and Reasoning over Tables with   Sentence Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02177)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Tables play a crucial role in conveying information across domains, but answering complex queries over tables is challenging and time-consuming for humans. 
- Existing methods for tabular reasoning have limitations in generalizability, needing task-specific fine-tuning, or interpretability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a "Plan-then-Reason" framework to answer different types of queries over tables with sentence context.  
- The framework first plans the reasoning path by analyzing the query and filling gaps using commonsense knowledge. 
- It then assigns each reasoning step to either program-based reasoning (writing SQL or code) for precision or textual reasoning to understand concepts and combine information.
- The framework is designed to enhance planning, reasoning and blending abilities.

- The authors construct an instruction tuning set "TrixInstruct" following this framework to train the model "ProTrix".
- TrixInstruct has queries that require commonsense knowledge or combining tables and texts. 

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel Plan-then-Reason framework to blend program-based and textual reasoning for answering complex table queries.
- Builds TrixInstruct dataset and ProTrix model with strong generalizability. 
- Shows ProTrix matches GPT-3.5-turbo on tabular QA, achieves state-of-the-art on WikiTQ and generates accurate explanations.
- Underscores importance of planning, reasoning and blending abilities for interpretable and generalizable tabular reasoning.

In summary, the key innovation is in the Plan-then-Reason framework that strategically plans and blends programming and language for tabular reasoning, enhancing generalizability, accuracy and interpretability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Plan-then-Reason framework to build interpretable models that can understand queries, plan reasoning paths, and answer questions over tables with sentence context through integrating program-based and textual reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a "Plan-then-Reason" framework to answer different types of user queries over tables with sentence context. The key ideas are:

1) The framework first plans the reasoning paths by ingesting the query and context, then assigns each step to program-based or textual reasoning to reach the final answer. This allows leveraging the strengths of both reasoning approaches.

2) An instruction tuning set called TrixInstruct is constructed to train models with the required planning and reasoning abilities. It includes queries that are program-unsolvable or need combining table and sentence context.

3) Models called ProTrix and ProTrix-Coder are presented, which are fined-tuned on TrixInstruct. Experiments show they generalize well to diverse tabular tasks and achieve performance comparable to GPT-3.5-turbo.

4) The models can generate accurate and faithful explanations even for complex free-form questions, demonstrating interpretability.

In summary, the main contribution is the Plan-then-Reason framework and TrixInstruct dataset to train more capable and interpretable models for answering queries over tables with sentence context.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the Plan-then-Reason framework fill the gap between user queries and table context by utilizing commonsense knowledge and general concepts? Can you provide some examples?

2. Why does the paper claim that both planning and reasoning abilities contribute significantly to the overall generalizability and interpretability of models for tabular reasoning? Explain with examples.  

3. How does the paper address the limitations of purely program-based and purely textual reasoning for tabular tasks? What are some examples provided that underscore the need for integrating both?

4. What novel strategies does the TrixInstruct dataset employ to impart planning and reasoning abilities? Analyze some of the complex query types included and how they achieve this objective.   

5. How does the framework dynamically assign steps of the reasoning process to either program-based or textual reasoning? What factors determine this assignment?

6. In what ways does the Plan-then-Reason framework go beyond merely generating answers to impart greater transparency and faithfulness? Substantiate with case studies and examples.

7. Analyze and explain how the model architecture handles queries involving common concepts and real-world knowledge that require understanding broader context and connections.

8. Critically evaluate the claim that the model generalizes well to out-of-domain tabular tasks. What evidence presented supports or contradicts this?  

9. Discuss the trade-offs between the ProTrix and ProTrix-Coder models. When would one be preferred over the other for tabular reasoning tasks?

10. What are some limitations of the current work? How can the framework and datasets be extended to handle more complex real-world scenarios involving tables?
