# High-Resolution Image Inpainting with Iterative Confidence Feedback and   Guided Upsampling

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to generate high-quality inpainting results for images with large missing regions, especially for high-resolution images. The key aspects addressed are:- How to fill large missing regions in images where existing methods often fail and produce artifacts. They propose an iterative inpainting method with confidence feedback to progressively improve the results.- How to generate visually realistic and detailed results for high-resolution images. They propose a guided upsampling network to reconstruct high-res results using patches from the input image. - How to create more realistic training data that better matches real object removal use cases. They collect a large dataset of object masks and use them to synthesize image samples with object-shaped holes.So in summary, the main goal is to develop an effective image inpainting method that can fill large holes in high-resolution images for applications like object removal, by addressing the limitations of existing learning-based inpainting methods through iterative prediction, guided upsampling, and more realistic training data.
