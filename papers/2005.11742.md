# [High-Resolution Image Inpainting with Iterative Confidence Feedback and   Guided Upsampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11742)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to generate high-quality inpainting results for images with large missing regions, especially for high-resolution images. The key aspects addressed are:- How to fill large missing regions in images where existing methods often fail and produce artifacts. They propose an iterative inpainting method with confidence feedback to progressively improve the results.- How to generate visually realistic and detailed results for high-resolution images. They propose a guided upsampling network to reconstruct high-res results using patches from the input image. - How to create more realistic training data that better matches real object removal use cases. They collect a large dataset of object masks and use them to synthesize image samples with object-shaped holes.So in summary, the main goal is to develop an effective image inpainting method that can fill large holes in high-resolution images for applications like object removal, by addressing the limitations of existing learning-based inpainting methods through iterative prediction, guided upsampling, and more realistic training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:1. An iterative image inpainting method with confidence feedback. The model predicts an inpainting result as well as a confidence map indicating the reliability of each generated pixel. The confidence map is used to iteratively revise unsatisfactory regions and gradually improve the inpainting result.2. A guided upsampling network that takes a low-resolution inpainting result and upsamples it to high-resolution using patches from the high-resolution input image. This allows generating high-resolution results that are visually realistic. 3. A new procedure to synthesize training data with object-shaped holes to better match real-world object removal use cases.In summary, the key ideas are:- Iterative inpainting with confidence feedback to progressively fill large holes.- Guided upsampling to obtain high-resolution results.- Realistic training data synthesis for object removal applications.The proposed method outperforms previous approaches, especially for large holes and high-resolution images, and generates visually more appealing results for real object removal requests.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in image inpainting:- The paper focuses on inpainting large holes in high-resolution images, which is a challenging problem that existing methods struggle with. Many previous approaches are designed for smaller or lower-resolution holes.- The iterative inpainting method with confidence feedback is novel. It allows the model to progressively improve the inpainting result by focusing on uncertain regions iteratively. Previous progressive/multi-stage inpainting methods fill holes in a predefined order.- The guided upsampling network is a new approach to generate high-resolution results by transferring details from the input image. Most prior deep learning methods operate on downsampled images and struggle to recover fine details when upsampling.- The paper introduces a new data synthesis procedure to create training data with object-shaped holes, better mimicking real use cases like object removal. Previous datasets use more simplistic holes like squares or random strokes.- The proposed method is shown to outperform recent state-of-the-art methods, especially on large holes and high-resolution images, using both quantitative metrics and user studies.- The confidence prediction idea and guided upsampling approach could potentially be integrated into other deep inpainting frameworks to improve their performance.Overall, this paper makes nice contributions on generating high-quality inpainting results for large holes in high-resolution images. The key novelty lies in the iterative approach with confidence feedback and guided upsampling network. The data synthesis procedure and experiments on realistic use cases are also valuable additions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Improving the high-resolution inpainting results. The authors propose a guided upsampling network to generate high-resolution results, but note there are still some limitations when trying to perfectly reconstruct the original high-resolution content in the missing regions. Further research could explore better ways to generate high-quality high-resolution inpainting results.- Exploring iterative inpainting for video completion. The iterative inpainting method is currently applied on single images. The authors suggest it could be extended for video hole filling.- Applying the confidence prediction scheme to other inpainting models. The confidence prediction approach is proposed as a general mechanism that could potentially be integrated into other deep generative inpainting models. More exploration could be done on attaching the confidence prediction to various inpainting models.- Improving training data synthesis. The authors collect object masks and propose a procedure to synthesize more realistic training data. But there is still room for improvement to make the training data better match real object removal cases. - User interaction. The guided upsampling network allows some user control by specifying regions to avoid/include. More research could be done to make the inpainting interactive and controllable.In summary, the main future directions are aimed at improving the inpainting results, especially for high-resolution images and videos, generalizing the confidence prediction scheme, creating better training data, and incorporating more user interaction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a high-resolution image inpainting method for large object removal. The method consists of two models: an iterative inpainting model with confidence feedback and a guided upsampling network. The iterative inpainting model generates an inpainting result and a corresponding confidence map indicating prediction reliability. It then iteratively revises low-confidence regions using the confidence map as feedback. This allows it to progressively improve results when filling large holes. The guided upsampling network takes a low-resolution inpainting result and reconstructs it at the original high resolution by matching and transforming high-res patches from known areas. By separating high-level understanding and texture reconstruction, the method produces semantically reasonable results with realistic details. For training data, the authors collect a large dataset of object masks and use them to synthesize realistic holes mimicking object removal requests. Experiments demonstrate the method's ability to handle large holes and generate photo-realistic results at high resolution, outperforming previous approaches.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new image inpainting method to address the challenge of filling large missing regions in high resolution images. The method consists of two main components: an iterative inpainting model with confidence feedback and a guided upsampling network. The iterative inpainting model is a deep generative model that predicts both the inpainted image and a confidence map indicating the model's confidence in each generated pixel. Using this confidence map as feedback, the model iteratively revises low confidence regions by re-inpainting them while keeping high confidence pixels fixed. This allows it to progressively improve the inpainting result. The guided upsampling network takes a low-resolution inpainting result from the iterative model and upsamples it to the original high resolution. It achieves this by using features from the known regions of the high-res input image to reconstruct the unknown regions. By separating high-level understanding and low-level texture reconstruction, the two components together enable generating high-quality semantically plausible and visually realistic inpainting results. Experiments demonstrate superiority over existing methods, especially for large holes. The paper also introduces a new procedure for synthesizing training data with object-shaped holes to better match real use cases.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:This paper proposes an iterative image inpainting method with confidence feedback for filling large holes, especially for high resolution image inpainting. The method uses a deep generative model that outputs both an inpainting result and a corresponding confidence map. The confidence map indicates the model's confidence in each generated pixel. Using this confidence map as feedback, the model iteratively revises the inpainting result by only trusting high confidence pixels from the previous iteration as known pixels. After each iteration, the remaining low confidence pixels are updated in the next iteration. To enable high quality results for high resolution images, the paper also proposes a guided upsampling network. It upsamples a low resolution inpainting result by replacing feature patches inside the hole with similar valid feature patches from the high resolution input image. This separation of high-level structure generation on downsampled images and texture reconstruction from high resolution patches allows generating semantically coherent and visually realistic results.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of image inpainting, specifically for the challenging cases of filling large holes in high resolution images. The key problems and questions it aims to tackle are:- Existing deep learning based inpainting methods often produce unsatisfactory results with artifacts when filling large holes, especially for high resolution images. - How can we improve inpainting results for large holes where there is significant ambiguity?- How can we generate high quality inpainting results for high resolution images that are both semantically reasonable and visually realistic?To summarize, the main focus is on improving inpainting quality for the difficult cases of large holes in high resolution images, which is a very common scenario in real applications like object removal but not well addressed by prior works.The key contributions to address these issues are:- An iterative inpainting approach with confidence feedback to progressively improve results by identifying and correcting low confidence regions.- A guided upsampling network to lift low resolution inpainted results to high resolution by borrowing patches from the original high res input image.  - Introduction of a new procedure to synthesize more realistic training data with object shaped holes.So in essence, the paper aims to push the envelope of deep generative inpainting, especially for challenging cases closer to real image editing applications.
