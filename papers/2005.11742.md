# High-Resolution Image Inpainting with Iterative Confidence Feedback and   Guided Upsampling

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to generate high-quality inpainting results for images with large missing regions, especially for high-resolution images. The key aspects addressed are:- How to fill large missing regions in images where existing methods often fail and produce artifacts. They propose an iterative inpainting method with confidence feedback to progressively improve the results.- How to generate visually realistic and detailed results for high-resolution images. They propose a guided upsampling network to reconstruct high-res results using patches from the input image. - How to create more realistic training data that better matches real object removal use cases. They collect a large dataset of object masks and use them to synthesize image samples with object-shaped holes.So in summary, the main goal is to develop an effective image inpainting method that can fill large holes in high-resolution images for applications like object removal, by addressing the limitations of existing learning-based inpainting methods through iterative prediction, guided upsampling, and more realistic training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. An iterative image inpainting method with confidence feedback. The model predicts an inpainting result as well as a confidence map indicating the reliability of each generated pixel. The confidence map is used to iteratively revise unsatisfactory regions and gradually improve the inpainting result.2. A guided upsampling network that takes a low-resolution inpainting result and upsamples it to high-resolution using patches from the high-resolution input image. This allows generating high-resolution results that are visually realistic. 3. A new procedure to synthesize training data with object-shaped holes to better match real-world object removal use cases.In summary, the key ideas are:- Iterative inpainting with confidence feedback to progressively fill large holes.- Guided upsampling to obtain high-resolution results.- Realistic training data synthesis for object removal applications.The proposed method outperforms previous approaches, especially for large holes and high-resolution images, and generates visually more appealing results for real object removal requests.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes an iterative image inpainting method with confidence feedback and guided upsampling to fill large holes in high-resolution images for object removal.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in image inpainting:- The paper focuses on inpainting large holes in high-resolution images, which is a challenging problem that existing methods struggle with. Many previous approaches are designed for smaller or lower-resolution holes.- The iterative inpainting method with confidence feedback is novel. It allows the model to progressively improve the inpainting result by focusing on uncertain regions iteratively. Previous progressive/multi-stage inpainting methods fill holes in a predefined order.- The guided upsampling network is a new approach to generate high-resolution results by transferring details from the input image. Most prior deep learning methods operate on downsampled images and struggle to recover fine details when upsampling.- The paper introduces a new data synthesis procedure to create training data with object-shaped holes, better mimicking real use cases like object removal. Previous datasets use more simplistic holes like squares or random strokes.- The proposed method is shown to outperform recent state-of-the-art methods, especially on large holes and high-resolution images, using both quantitative metrics and user studies.- The confidence prediction idea and guided upsampling approach could potentially be integrated into other deep inpainting frameworks to improve their performance.Overall, this paper makes nice contributions on generating high-quality inpainting results for large holes in high-resolution images. The key novelty lies in the iterative approach with confidence feedback and guided upsampling network. The data synthesis procedure and experiments on realistic use cases are also valuable additions.
