# [Automated Statistical Model Discovery with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17879)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Statistical model discovery involves searching over a large space of models to find one that provides the best explanation for a dataset, while satisfying domain-specific constraints. This is challenging as it requires both modeling expertise to construct candidate models, and domain expertise to ensure the models are reasonable. The paper aims to automate this process using language models (LMs).

Method:
The authors propose having LMs play the roles of both the modeler and domain expert in an automated model discovery loop based on Box's loop:

1) A proposal LM proposes candidate statistical models represented as probabilistic programs based on the dataset, optional metadata, previous model code, and natural language feedback.

2) The programs are automatically fitted to data using inference methods from probabilistic programming. 

3) Model criticism statistics are computed to assess the model limitations.

4) A critic LM reviews the programs and statistics and provides natural language feedback to guide future proposals. 

5) The best programs, statistics, and feedback are provided back to the proposal LM to inform the next round.

By leveraging LMs that can reliably write code and leverage broad domain knowledge, the authors avoid needing to pre-define a restricted space of models or handcrafted search procedures.

Key Results:
The method is evaluated in three settings:
1) Searching within a restricted space of Gaussian process kernels, where it matches a state-of-the-art automated statistician system.
2) Discovering models for real-world datasets, where it identifies programs on par with human expert models. 
3) Improving classic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey models by incorporating natural language constraints to balance flexibility and interpretability.

The results demonstrate that LMs can reliably play the roles of both modeler and domain expert to automatically discover statistical models competitive with traditional modeling approaches. The use of critic LMs and natural language constraints provides interpretability and a unique way to inject domain knowledge.
