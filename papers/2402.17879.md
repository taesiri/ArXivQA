# [Automated Statistical Model Discovery with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17879)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Statistical model discovery involves searching over a large space of models to find one that provides the best explanation for a dataset, while satisfying domain-specific constraints. This is challenging as it requires both modeling expertise to construct candidate models, and domain expertise to ensure the models are reasonable. The paper aims to automate this process using language models (LMs).

Method:
The authors propose having LMs play the roles of both the modeler and domain expert in an automated model discovery loop based on Box's loop:

1) A proposal LM proposes candidate statistical models represented as probabilistic programs based on the dataset, optional metadata, previous model code, and natural language feedback.

2) The programs are automatically fitted to data using inference methods from probabilistic programming. 

3) Model criticism statistics are computed to assess the model limitations.

4) A critic LM reviews the programs and statistics and provides natural language feedback to guide future proposals. 

5) The best programs, statistics, and feedback are provided back to the proposal LM to inform the next round.

By leveraging LMs that can reliably write code and leverage broad domain knowledge, the authors avoid needing to pre-define a restricted space of models or handcrafted search procedures.

Key Results:
The method is evaluated in three settings:
1) Searching within a restricted space of Gaussian process kernels, where it matches a state-of-the-art automated statistician system.
2) Discovering models for real-world datasets, where it identifies programs on par with human expert models. 
3) Improving classic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey models by incorporating natural language constraints to balance flexibility and interpretability.

The results demonstrate that LMs can reliably play the roles of both modeler and domain expert to automatically discover statistical models competitive with traditional modeling approaches. The use of critic LMs and natural language constraints provides interpretability and a unique way to inject domain knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a method for automated statistical model discovery by having language models propose probabilistic programs as models, fit them to data, evaluate them, and provide natural language feedback to guide further proposals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is introducing a method for automated statistical model discovery that leverages large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- They propose having LLMs propose statistical models expressed as probabilistic programs, which provides flexibility in representing many types of models. The LLM acts as the "modeler".

- They introduce a framework where the LLM iterates between proposing models and critiquing/providing feedback on those models to guide further proposals. This mirrors the human process of model building and criticism. 

- They demonstrate their approach on several modeling case studies, showing it can match or exceed performance of previous automated methods and human-designed models. 

- A key advantage is reducing the need for domain-specific languages or hand-crafted search procedures. The LLM's knowledge and code generation abilities remove some limitations of prior automated modeling systems.

- Their framework allows expressing modeling constraints and goals in natural language (e.g. improving interpretability), which can guide the LLM to balance flexibility and constraints.

In summary, the main contribution is using LLMs within an iterative build-criticize loop to automate statistical model discovery in a more flexible way than prior systems. The results highlight the promise of LLM-driven model discovery.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Automated model discovery - The paper focuses on using language models to automatically discover good statistical models for datasets without requiring extensive human expertise.

- Probabilistic programs - The models are represented as probabilistic programs which provide a flexible way to represent statistical models and enable automated inference.

- Box's loop - The automated procedure is cast within the framework of Box's loop, iterating between model proposal, fitting, criticism, and using criticism to guide future proposals.

- Language models - Large language models like GPT-3 are used to propose model structures based on the data and feedback. Their knowledge and code generation abilities are leveraged.

- Model criticism - Statistics like posterior predictive checks are used to critique the limitations of proposed models and provide feedback to guide the language model.

- Interpretability constraints - The paper shows language models can be guided to improve classic models in interpretable ways by imposing textual constraints.

- Probabilistic modeling - The overall goal is automated discovery of good statistical models of real-world noisy data by searching over model structures.

In summary, the key ideas revolve around using language models' own capabilities in probabilistic modeling, code generation, and inductive reasoning to drive an automated statistical model discovery loop, with model criticism playing an important role. The representations used and the iterative process allow this to happen without extensive human involvement.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 suggested in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using language models for automated model discovery. What are the key advantages and limitations of this approach compared to more traditional automated model discovery methods?

2. The method relies on language models being able to reliably write valid probabilistic programs. How might the performance degrade if the language models struggle with writing syntactically valid programs?

3. The paper highlights inductive reasoning capabilities as one reason language models may be promising for this task. However, recent work has shown inductive biases in LMs. How might inductive biases affect the kinds of models proposed? 

4. The critic LM provides natural language feedback to guide future proposals. What other types of feedback could complement or replace natural language feedback? How might they change the search process?

5. The Gaussian process experiment searches over a restricted space of kernels. What modifications would be needed to allow searching over a completely open-ended space of kernel constructions?

6. For the real-world datasets, how does the choice of inference technique impact the kinds of models proposed and the overall effectiveness? Does relying on generic inference limit model expressivity?  

7. The paper emphasizes separating modeling and inference but acknowledges approximate inference is still needed. What pathologies might emerge from the mismatch between the model class and approximation family?

8. The Lotka-Volterra experiment shows incorporating interpretability constraints via natural language. What other types of domain knowledge could be incorporated through natural language prompts?

9. The paper focuses on the static data setting. How would the method extend to sequential experiments where new data is actively acquired based on model predictions?

10. The candidate models are evaluated based on a statistical criterion. When might optimizing such a criterion fail to find useful models compared to human judgment?
