# [SchurVINS: Schur Complement-Based Lightweight Visual Inertial Navigation   System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01616)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes SchurVINS, a novel visual inertial navigation system (VINS) that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency for 6-degree-of-freedom pose estimation. It formulates an equivalent residual model consisting of the Hessian, gradient, and observation covariance to jointly estimate poses and landmarks. Using Schur complement, this model is decomposed into separate pose and landmark residual models on which efficient extended Kalman filter updates are performed. This allows leveraging the sparsity in the problem for acceleration. Experiments on standard datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy among filter-based methods, comparable accuracy to recent optimization-based methods, and less than 50% the computation of top optimization-based techniques. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed efficient extended Kalman filter-based landmark estimator which provides accuracy on par with traditional Gauss-Newton optimization approaches. Overall, SchurVINS advances the state-of-the-art in achievable accuracy and efficiency for VINS algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel EKF-based VINS framework called SchurVINS that achieves high accuracy and efficiency by formulating an equivalent residual model with Hessian, Gradient and observation covariance to estimate poses and landmarks jointly, and using Schur complement to decompose the model into smaller models for efficient EKF updates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an equivalent residual model consisting of Hessian, Gradient and observation covariance to estimate poses and landmarks jointly in an EKF framework. This allows achieving high precision localization.

2. It employs Schur complement to decompose the equivalent residual model into a pose residual model and a landmark residual model. This allows conducting efficient EKF updates on the two smaller models separately. 

3. It further splits the landmark residual model into small independent residual models for each landmark. This significantly reduces the computational complexity of landmark estimation.

4. The proposed method, called SchurVINS, achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. It outperforms other state-of-the-art EKF-based methods in accuracy while requiring less than 50% of the computational resources of top optimization-based methods.

5. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EKF-based landmark solver in ensuring high precision with very low overhead.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel EKF-based VINS framework that achieves highly accurate and efficient 6-DOF state estimation by judiciously leveraging equivalent residual modeling, Schur complement, and independent landmark updating.
