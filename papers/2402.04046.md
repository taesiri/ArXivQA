# [Generative Modeling of Graphs via Joint Diffusion of Node and Edge   Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04046)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing graph generation methods tend to overlook modeling edge attributes. However, there are critical applications where edge features are essential, making current approaches unsuitable. Trivial adaptations to include edges exist but have limited efficacy as they fail to properly capture the interdependencies between graph components. 

Solution:
The authors propose a joint score-based model to generate node and edge attributes together, while considering their interplay. The key novelties are:

1) Node and edge attributes are combined in an attention module to generate samples based on both. This allows information flow between nodes and edges. 

2) The node, edge, and adjacency matrices have mutual dependencies during the graph diffusion sampling process. This better captures their interactions.

The proposed stochastic diffusion process is based on a jointly modeled score function for nodes and edges. The neural architecture also facilitates edge feature propagation to improve score estimation.

Contributions:

- Formulation of a joint node-edge generative model with a unified score-based sampling procedure 

- Introduction of architectural biases (attention module, information flow) to leverage edge features

- Establishing new links between graph generation and MDPs/traffic scenes

- Thorough evaluation on diverse benchmarks, introduction of new datasets and tasks, and ablation studies

The method consistently outperforms baselines, especially on edge-focused metrics and applications where edges are crucial (new MDP and traffic scene tasks). This demonstrates the capability to effectively model edge attributes along with nodes and adjacency.
