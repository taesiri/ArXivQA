# [HumanCoser: Layered 3D Human Generation via Semantic-Aware Diffusion   Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05804)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for generating 3D clothed humans fail to produce high-quality results with consistent body structures. They typically generate the human as a single surface, with the body and clothing coupled together. This prevents separately editing or reusing the body and clothing. 

Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework called "HumanCoser" to generate layered 3D humans using a physically-decoupled, semantic-aware diffusion model. 

Key ideas:
1) Decoupled generation of body and clothing: Separate neural radiance fields with shape priors are used to generate the body and clothing layers. This allows changing clothes between different bodies.

2) Matching clothing to body: A semantic-confidence strategy eliminates non-clothing content from the clothing layer. An implicit deformation network based on SMPL vertices matches the clothing layer to different body shapes.

3) Structural consistency: Uniform shape priors for the body and clothing ensure diversity without sacrificing structural consistency. Normal prediction and lighting optimization enhance geometric and texture details.

Main Contributions:
- Physically-decoupled framework for layered generation of 3D human bodies and clothing
- Semantic-confidence strategy to improve clothing generation and make it reusable
- SMPL-driven implicit deformation network to match clothing with different body shapes  
- Layered shape priors and optimization techniques to improve structural consistency and detail 
  
In summary, the key innovation is the physically-decoupled representation combined with semantic guidance and implicit deformation to enable high-quality, reusable generation of 3D human bodies and clothing in layers. This supports flexible editing and transfer of clothing between bodies.
