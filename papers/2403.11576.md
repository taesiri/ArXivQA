# [MISS: Memory-efficient Instance Segmentation Framework By Visual   Inductive Priors Flow Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11576)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Instance segmentation is critical for many applications but training effective models is challenging, especially with limited data and compute resources. Data annotation is expensive and complex models require significant compute.

- Strategically integrating visual priors into the training data can reduce dependency on large datasets and complex models. However, effectively embedding priors during learning remains difficult. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes MISS, a memory-efficient instance segmentation framework that propagates visual inductive prior flows. It integrates intrinsic prior knowledge from the Synergy basketball dataset into data preprocessing, augmentation, training and inference.

- A Canny-Hough operator adaptively detects the basketball court to crop images and reduce compute. Class-level priors identify identities to guide style transforms during augmentation. Location-based priors further enhance augmentation. 

- Inference focuses only on detected court regions to optimize memory and efficiency.

Key Contributions:
- First framework to incorporate visual inductive priors across pipeline to enable memory-efficient instance segmentation with limited data.

- Comprehensively applies prior knowledge during offline data preprocessing/augmentation and online training/inference. 

- Outperforms prior deep instance segmentation models on Synergy basketball with reduced memory and complexity, without sacrificing performance.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative approach to integrate visual priors throughout the learning pipeline to achieve strong instance segmentation performance under data and compute constraints. The MISS framework and its use of inductive prior flows reduces reliance on large datasets and complex models.
