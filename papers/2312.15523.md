# [The Persuasive Power of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15523)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates two main problems: 1) whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective arguments to persuade people to change opinions; 2) whether LLM agents interacting with each other can reproduce dynamics of persuasion in human social systems, to serve as proxies for studying opinion dynamics.

Proposed Solution: 
To address these problems, the authors designed a synthetic persuasion dialogue on climate change, where a "Convincer" agent tries to persuade a "Skeptic" agent. The Skeptic then evaluates if its opinion changed. Different argument types were tested, incorporating linguistic dimensions linked to theories of opinion change. The persuasiveness of LLM arguments was also evaluated by human judges.

Key Contributions:
- Showed that interactions between LLM agents resemble some characteristics of human persuasion dynamics. The probability of opinion change decreases with the Skepticâ€™s stubbornness.
- Certain argument types are more effective in persuading both LLM agents and humans, namely those conveying trust, knowledge, status and support.  
- Humans strongly prefer knowledge-based arguments compared to LLMs.
- There are still discrepancies between artificial vs. human persuasion dynamics, presenting opportunities for future work.
- Overall, the capability of LLMs to emulate opinion dynamics suggests they could play an important role in online opinion formation. The framework also enables in-silico studies of collective opinion dynamics.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the potential of LLMs to model dynamics of persuasion and opinion change typical of human systems. The experimental framework and findings lay groundwork for simulating online opinion dynamics using interacting LLM agents.
