## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Facial expression spotting, which aims to locate the onset and offset frames of macro- and micro-expression clips in long videos, is challenging due to the difficulty in perceiving micro-expressions and the presence of irrelevant motions like head movements. Existing methods have limitations in feature extraction and model representation capability. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SpoT-GCN) to address the limitations. The key ideas are:

1) Design a receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy to compute short- and long-term optical flows as input. This magnifies subtle motions in micro-expressions while avoiding large head movement problems. 

2) Propose a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (SpoT-GCN) to capture spatial relationships and temporal variations of facial parts across frames. A facial local graph pooling strategy is introduced for multi-scale facial graph feature learning.

3) Introduce supervised contrastive learning into the model to learn more discriminative features to distinguish macro-expressions, micro-expressions and normal frames.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose a graph convolutional network with facial-structure-specific graph pooling for comprehensive spatio-temporal modeling of facial expressions.

2) Design a receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy to address limitations in existing optical flow computation methods.

3) Introduce supervised contrastive learning for facial expression spotting to learn discriminative feature representations.

Experiments on SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in micro-expression spotting. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multi-scale spatio-temporal graph convolutional network with supervised contrastive learning for facial expression spotting in videos, which effectively captures subtle motions and spatial-temporal relationships to spot macro- and micro-expressions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel graph convolutional network (GCN) to comprehensively capture the spatial relationships and temporal variations among different facial parts across frames. A graph pooling strategy suitable for facial structure is proposed for multi-scale feature learning.

2. Designing a receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy to compute short- and long-term optical flows for frame-level apex or boundary probability estimation. This strategy not only magnifies the motion information but also avoids large head movement problems. 

3. Introducing supervised contrastive loss to the model for discriminative feature representation learning. This is the first work to study contrastive learning for facial expression spotting, achieving the recognition of boundaries between different types of expressions.

In summary, the key contributions are around proposing new strategies/techniques for facial expression spotting, including a novel GCN architecture, an adaptive sliding window strategy, and using supervised contrastive learning. The experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, especially for micro-expression spotting.
