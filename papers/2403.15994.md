## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Facial expression spotting, which aims to locate the onset and offset frames of macro- and micro-expression clips in long videos, is challenging due to the difficulty in perceiving micro-expressions and the presence of irrelevant motions like head movements. Existing methods have limitations in feature extraction and model representation capability. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SpoT-GCN) to address the limitations. The key ideas are:

1) Design a receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy to compute short- and long-term optical flows as input. This magnifies subtle motions in micro-expressions while avoiding large head movement problems. 

2) Propose a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (SpoT-GCN) to capture spatial relationships and temporal variations of facial parts across frames. A facial local graph pooling strategy is introduced for multi-scale facial graph feature learning.

3) Introduce supervised contrastive learning into the model to learn more discriminative features to distinguish macro-expressions, micro-expressions and normal frames.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose a graph convolutional network with facial-structure-specific graph pooling for comprehensive spatio-temporal modeling of facial expressions.

2) Design a receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy to address limitations in existing optical flow computation methods.

3) Introduce supervised contrastive learning for facial expression spotting to learn discriminative feature representations.

Experiments on SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in micro-expression spotting. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.
