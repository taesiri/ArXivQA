# [Federated Linear Contextual Bandits with Heterogeneous Clients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00116)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "Federated Linear Contextual Bandits with Heterogeneous Clients":

Problem:
- Federated bandit learning allows multiple clients to collaboratively learn bandit models under coordination of a central server, without exposing raw data. 
- Existing approaches rely on strong assumption of client homogeneity and single global model, which is unrealistic. Heterogeneous clients with different objectives can easily lead to linear regret for all clients.
- Goal is to develop federated bandit learning algorithms that can serve heterogeneous clients and ensure sub-linear regret for all participating clients.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a two-stage federated clustered bandit algorithm called HetoFedBandit 
- Stage 1: All clients conduct exploration. Server clusters clients based on statistical homogeneity test. Estimated clusters are maximal cliques in client similarity graph.
- Stage 2: Employ event-triggered communication and queue at server to facilitate collaboration within each cluster. Only one global model update served at a time.
- Rigorously analyze regret bound and communication cost. Identify key dependence on number of clusters and clients.
- Propose enhancements: dynamic re-clustering using adaptive criterion, priority queue based on determinant ratio. 

Main Contributions:  
- First work to enable beneficial federated bandit learning among heterogeneous clients
- Novel two-stage approach combining strengths of federated learning and collaborative bandits  
- Theoretical analysis on regret bound and communication cost
- Empirical evaluation on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrating effectiveness
- Open up new possibilities for practical federated bandit applications in distributed systems with diverse objectives

Key strengths are the rigor in analysis for heterogeneous setting and empirical demonstrations of viability. Main limitation is reliance on server for coordination. Extending to decentralized peer-to-peer model is noted as important future work.
