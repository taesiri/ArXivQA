# [QUEST: A Retrieval Dataset of Entity-Seeking Queries with Implicit Set   Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11694)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How well can current information retrieval systems handle queries that contain implicit set operations, such as intersection, union and difference?The authors construct a new dataset called Quest to analyze the ability of retrieval systems to meet information needs expressed through queries with implicit set operations. The dataset maps natural language queries to sets of Wikipedia entity documents. The key hypothesis appears to be that queries with set operations will be challenging for current retrieval systems to process correctly. In particular, the authors hypothesize that "queries involving negation and conjunction are particularly challenging."To test this, they evaluate several modern retrieval systems on Quest and analyze their performance. A core part of their investigation is analyzing how well systems can match constraints in the queries to evidence in the documents and perform set operations like intersection and difference to determine document relevance.In summary, the central research question is assessing how current systems handle queries with implicit set operations, with a hypothesis that such queries will prove difficult based on the need to make inferences about set constraints. The Quest dataset is constructed to facilitate analyzing this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the construction of Quest, a new dataset for evaluating retrieval systems on queries with implicit set operations. Specifically:- They introduce Quest, a dataset of 3357 natural language queries that contain implicit set operations like intersection, union, and difference. The queries are paired with sets of relevant Wikipedia entity documents. - The queries are semi-automatically constructed from Wikipedia category names, then paraphrased and validated by crowdworkers.- For a subset of the data, they collect relevance labels and fine-grained textual attribution of query constraints to evidence in documents.- They evaluate several retrieval systems on Quest and find that queries with conjunctions and negations are challenging for current models. Error analysis reveals systems often ignore negated or conjunctive constraints.- The paper discusses the challenges in constructing such a dataset, including issues with recall of the Wikipedia category taxonomy and naturalness of the queries.So in summary, the main contribution is the introduction and analysis of this new challenging dataset for retrieval that requires handling queries with implicit set operations. The authors demonstrate existing systems struggle on such combinatorial queries, motivating future work.
