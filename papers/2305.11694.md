# [QUEST: A Retrieval Dataset of Entity-Seeking Queries with Implicit Set   Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11694)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How well can current information retrieval systems handle queries that contain implicit set operations, such as intersection, union and difference?The authors construct a new dataset called Quest to analyze the ability of retrieval systems to meet information needs expressed through queries with implicit set operations. The dataset maps natural language queries to sets of Wikipedia entity documents. The key hypothesis appears to be that queries with set operations will be challenging for current retrieval systems to process correctly. In particular, the authors hypothesize that "queries involving negation and conjunction are particularly challenging."To test this, they evaluate several modern retrieval systems on Quest and analyze their performance. A core part of their investigation is analyzing how well systems can match constraints in the queries to evidence in the documents and perform set operations like intersection and difference to determine document relevance.In summary, the central research question is assessing how current systems handle queries with implicit set operations, with a hypothesis that such queries will prove difficult based on the need to make inferences about set constraints. The Quest dataset is constructed to facilitate analyzing this question.
