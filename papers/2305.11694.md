# [QUEST: A Retrieval Dataset of Entity-Seeking Queries with Implicit Set   Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11694)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How well can current information retrieval systems handle queries that contain implicit set operations, such as intersection, union and difference?

The authors construct a new dataset called Quest to analyze the ability of retrieval systems to meet information needs expressed through queries with implicit set operations. The dataset maps natural language queries to sets of Wikipedia entity documents. 

The key hypothesis appears to be that queries with set operations will be challenging for current retrieval systems to process correctly. In particular, the authors hypothesize that "queries involving negation and conjunction are particularly challenging."

To test this, they evaluate several modern retrieval systems on Quest and analyze their performance. A core part of their investigation is analyzing how well systems can match constraints in the queries to evidence in the documents and perform set operations like intersection and difference to determine document relevance.

In summary, the central research question is assessing how current systems handle queries with implicit set operations, with a hypothesis that such queries will prove difficult based on the need to make inferences about set constraints. The Quest dataset is constructed to facilitate analyzing this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the construction of Quest, a new dataset for evaluating retrieval systems on queries with implicit set operations. Specifically:

- They introduce Quest, a dataset of 3357 natural language queries that contain implicit set operations like intersection, union, and difference. The queries are paired with sets of relevant Wikipedia entity documents. 

- The queries are semi-automatically constructed from Wikipedia category names, then paraphrased and validated by crowdworkers.

- For a subset of the data, they collect relevance labels and fine-grained textual attribution of query constraints to evidence in documents.

- They evaluate several retrieval systems on Quest and find that queries with conjunctions and negations are challenging for current models. Error analysis reveals systems often ignore negated or conjunctive constraints.

- The paper discusses the challenges in constructing such a dataset, including issues with recall of the Wikipedia category taxonomy and naturalness of the queries.

So in summary, the main contribution is the introduction and analysis of this new challenging dataset for retrieval that requires handling queries with implicit set operations. The authors demonstrate existing systems struggle on such combinatorial queries, motivating future work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main points made in this paper:

The paper introduces Quest, a new dataset of 3357 natural language queries that implicitly specify set operations like intersection and difference, along with sets of relevant Wikipedia entity documents; it analyzes the performance of several modern retrieval systems on this dataset, finding that queries involving negation and conjunction are particularly challenging.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in retrieval for complex queries:

- This paper focuses on a new benchmark dataset, Quest, for evaluating retrieval systems on queries with implicit set operations like intersection, union, and difference. Other datasets like WebQuestionsSP and ComplexWebQuestions have also studied complex queries, but don't focus specifically on set operations or exhaustively retrieving multi-document sets.

- The queries in Quest are somewhat artificially constructed using Wikipedia categories as a starting point. Other benchmarks like Natural Questions and MS Marco are based on real user search queries. However, Quest helps address the lack of complex set queries in natural distributions. 

- For attribution, Quest leverages human annotation to map query constraints to evidence spans in documents. Other recent work like RomQA relies more on distant supervision for attribution, which can have lower recall.

- Quest considers retrieving from a corpus of entity documents. This is similar to work on open QA over entity collections like WebQuestions and GraphQuestions. Retrieval over large text corpora is also related but currently not evaluated by Quest.

- The paper finds current retrieval systems still struggle on Quest, especially for queries with conjunction and negation. Other work has also identified issues handling compositionality. However, Quest provides a more focused benchmark for analyzing performance on set operations.

- The paper only evaluates standard dual encoder models. Other related work has proposed more specialized models for handling compositionality like Probabilistic Soft Logic networks. Applying such methods to Quest could be interesting future work.

Overall, Quest provides a valuable, focused benchmark for analyzing retrieval systems on complex queries with set constraints, complementing other existing datasets and motivating new methods to handle compositional queries.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Further model scaling: The authors find that performance on the quest dataset improves for larger T5 model sizes, for both the retriever and classifier components. They suggest further scaling could lead to additional gains.

- Efficient transformers for long documents: The authors use truncation to handle long documents, but suggest evaluating efficient transformer variants like LongT5 and Longformer that can process longer contexts.

- Improved inductive biases for set operations: The authors note models struggle with queries involving conjunction and negation. They suggest developing models with better inductive biases for handling set operations expressed in natural language could help. 

- Generative models and multi-evidence aggregation: The authors suggest investigating generative language models and methods that can aggregate evidence across multiple documents as ways to leverage the fine-grained attributions in the dataset.

- Continual learning to improve recall: To address the issue of missing relevant documents, the authors suggest using pooling methods to continually grow the dataset by adding new relevant documents found at inference time.

- Analysis on more natural distributions of queries: The authors acknowledge the limitations of the semi-automatic way queries were constructed. They suggest evaluating systems on more natural distributions of queries with set operations.

In summary, the main directions are leveraging larger models, specialized model architectures, better inductive biases, generative modeling and aggregation, expanding the dataset iteratively, and evaluating on more natural queries.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Quest, a new dataset for evaluating retrieval systems on queries that implicitly specify set operations like intersection, union, and difference. The queries map to sets of relevant Wikipedia entity documents. The dataset was constructed semi-automatically - queries were composed from Wikipedia category names using templates, then paraphrased and validated by crowdworkers. Relevance labels and textual attributions were also collected. The dataset challenges models to match query constraints to evidence in documents and perform implicit set operations correctly. Experiments with several retrieval systems, including dual encoders and cross-attention models, show current methods struggle on such queries. Especially challenging are queries with conjunctions and negations. Error analysis reveals systems often ignore negated or conjunctive constraints. The dataset could enable development of models with better inductive biases for set operations and attribution.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Quest, a new dataset for evaluating information retrieval systems on queries with implicit set operations. The dataset consists of 3357 natural language queries mapped to sets of Wikipedia entity documents. The queries are composed from Wikipedia category names to represent common constraints like intersection, union, and negation. To make the queries natural, they are paraphrased and validated by crowdworkers. Relevance labels and textual evidence are also collected to verify entity relevance based on documents. 

The paper analyzes several retrieval systems on Quest, finding they struggle with queries involving conjunction and negation. A pipeline with a dual encoder retriever and classifier performs the best, but still only achieves 0.192 F1 score. Error analysis reveals models often ignore negated constraints or only satisfy one conjunct. The paper concludes that queries with implicit set operations remain challenging for current systems. The dataset could enable developing models with better inductive biases for set operations and using fine-grained evidence to explain predictions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new dataset, Quest, for studying retrieval systems' ability to handle queries with implicit set operations. The dataset is constructed semi-automatically using Wikipedia category names as a starting point. Individual category names are sampled and composed into more complex queries by applying pre-defined templates involving set operations like intersection, union, and difference. These templatically generated queries are then paraphrased by crowdworkers to improve fluency and naturalness. The crowdworkers also provide relevance judgments for entities based on their Wikipedia documents, marking relevant spans of text that support the relevance decision. This results in a dataset of 3357 natural language queries mapped to sets of Wikipedia entity documents, where systems must match constraints in the queries to evidence in the documents and perform the correct set operations to retrieve the complete relevant set. The paper analyzes several retrieval systems on this dataset, finding that queries with negation and conjunction are particularly challenging.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is addressing is developing retrieval systems that can effectively handle queries with implicit set operations like intersection, union, and difference. 

Specifically, the paper notes that many real-world information needs involve combining multiple constraints or preferences, resulting in queries with implicit set operations. However, such queries are not well represented in existing retrieval benchmarks. 

To study system performance on such queries, the authors construct a new dataset called Quest. Quest consists of natural language queries mapped to sets of Wikipedia entity documents. The queries combine constraints in different ways, like "science fiction films from the 90s without aliens" or "trees native to the Pacific Northwest not found in Canada."

To do well on Quest, systems need to be able to:

- Match the multiple query constraints to evidence in the entity documents
- Correctly perform implicit set operations like intersection and difference 
- Efficiently retrieve from a large collection of entities

The paper analyzes several retrieval systems on Quest and finds they struggle with queries involving conjunction and negation. The authors perform error analysis revealing common causes like models ignoring negated constraints. 

In summary, the key problem is developing retrieval systems that can effectively process real-world queries with implicit set operations, which involves making inferences to match constraints and properly handle intersections, unions, and differences. The Quest dataset provides a way to study this problem.
