# [Exploiting Label Skews in Federated Learning with Model Concatenation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06290)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes FedConcat, a novel federated learning framework to address the challenge of non-IID data distribution among clients. The key idea is to first cluster clients based on their label distributions, then train specialized models within each cluster which capture unique local features. These cluster-specific models are concatenated into a single global model to combine their strengths. Experiments demonstrate that FedConcat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy under various non-IID settings on CIFAR-10, SVHN and FMNIST datasets compared to existing methods like FedAvg, FedProx and MOON. The framework provides flexibility in model selection for each cluster and is shown to be robust to partial client participation. An extension called FedConcat-ID removes the need for clients to upload precise label distributions by inferring them solely from the trained local models, enhancing privacy. Overall, FedConcat offers an effective federated learning solution for the ubiquitous non-IID data distribution problem in real-world scenarios.
