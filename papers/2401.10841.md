# [Using LLMs to discover emerging coded antisemitic hate-speech in   extremist social media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10841)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Online hate speech is proliferating rapidly. A particular challenge is the use of coded language by extremist groups to evade detection while spreading antisemitic ideology. 
- Coded terminology evolves quickly over time and fixed hate speech glossaries become outdated. Manual monitoring at scale is infeasible.  
- There is a need for automated methods to discover emerging coded antisemitic terminology in extremist social media posts.

Proposed Solution:
- A pipeline to extract potentially coded antisemitic terms from social media posts. Terms are evaluated for emergence, trendiness, semantic similarity to known antisemitic discourse, and lack of overt Jewish references.

- Two phase approach:
   - Phase 1 extracts trending bigrams and trigrams using TF-IDF and frequency filtering. Non-emerging and overtly Jewish terms are removed.
   - Phase 2 compares embeddings of candidate terms to embeddings of known antisemitic seed terms using cosine similarity. Terms not semantically similar to antisemitism are filtered out.

- Pipeline is instantiated with standard and advanced solutions for each phase. Four pipeline versions are evaluated.

Contributions:
- Novel problem formulation and proposed solution methodology for discovering emerging coded hate terminology using computational semantics.

- Practical pipeline integrating NLP and contextual embedding techniques to operationalize the methodology. 

- Promising quantitative results from best pipeline version: 80% accuracy, 83% recall in labeling terms as antisemitic or not based on gold standard.

- Qualitative analysis provides insights into sources of errors and ideas for improvement.

- Practical utility for assisting human monitors by surfacing potentially problematic emerging terminology.

- Extensible approach to study other minority groups targeted by coded hate speech.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a methodology using NLP techniques to automatically discover emerging coded antisemitic terminology from extremist social media posts, with the goal of assisting efforts to detect and moderate harmful online content.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

"a methodology for the novel problem of extracting {\it emerging coded hate-laden terminology} (antisemitism, in this paper) from extremist social posts, along with a practical pipeline to demonstrate its effectiveness."

In other words, the key contribution is proposing a methodology and pipeline for automatically discovering new coded antisemitic terminology emerging in extremist social media posts. The methodology is based on the hypothesis that "coded antisemitic terminology begets coded antisemitic terminology" - i.e. that those using coded language will invent new coded terms when unable to express new ideas with existing ones. 

The paper details the full pipeline, involving extracting trending terms, removing non-emerging and non-coded terms, generating embeddings using a fine-tuned BERT model, comparing term embeddings to known antisemitic seed terms, and filtering out terms that are too dissimilar. Both standard and advanced solutions are proposed and tested for the various pipeline components.

So in summary, the main contribution is the novel methodology and pipeline for surfacing emergent, coded hate speech terminology in an automated fashion. Both the approach and its practical instantiation are presented.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper hypothesizes that "coded antisemitic terminology begets coded antisemitic terminology." What is the rationale behind this hypothesis? How is it core to the proposed methodology?

2. The paper extracts both bigrams and trigrams as candidate coded terms. What is the motivation behind considering both? Does the inclusion of trigrams provide any additional benefit over just bigrams? 

3. The paper uses TF-IDF scoring for extracting trending terms. What are the pros and cons of TF-IDF over other weighting schemes like BM25 or semantic similarity? How does TF-IDF capture “trendiness” effectively?

4. The pre-truncate embedding uses context windows of sizes 5-14 words. What is the intuition behind using this range? How was the optimal window size determined? 

5. The post-truncate embedding approach builds more informed embeddings using the complete context. How does this help compared to just using a fixed window? What changes were needed in the algorithm to leverage these embeddings?

6. The paper determines optimal values for the labeling threshold m as 7 and 9 for pre and post-truncate approaches respectively. What procedure was followed to arrive at these values? How can they be further tuned?

7. Table 2 shows some false positives in labeling. What could be potential reasons for these errors? How can false positives be reduced?

8. The paper discovers some "neutral" terms used in antisemitic contexts. What is the significance of finding such terms? How are they different from false positives?

9. The paper conducts a qualitative sanity check by examining sample posts. What additional insights do these checks provide over just quantitative evaluation? How are they used to improve the approach?

10. The proposed approach relies on similarity of context between candidate and seed terms. What other signals can supplement context similarity to determine if a term is potentially coded hate speech?
