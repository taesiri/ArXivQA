# [Orthogonal Annotation Benefits Barely-supervised Medical Image   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13090)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is:Can we develop a novel annotation method and semi-supervised model that effectively exploits the complementary information from different directions in 3D medical images to achieve efficient and accurate segmentation with minimal annotation effort?Specifically, the paper proposes and investigates:1) A new annotation method called "orthogonal annotation" that only labels two orthogonal slices in each 3D medical image volume. This aims to greatly reduce annotation effort while preserving disparity and complementary information.2) A coupled segmentation method named "Dense-Sparse Co-Training (DeSCO)" framework that utilizes the proposed orthogonal annotation. It first generates dense pseudo-labels through registration, then trains dual networks that leverage both dense pseudo-labels and sparse labels in a co-training manner. The goal is to steadily utilize the sparse orthogonal annotation and achieve performance close to fully-supervised methods.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by utilizing the proposed orthogonal annotation method and DeSCO framework, it's possible to achieve highly efficient and accurate 3D medical image segmentation with minimal annotation effort. The experiments conducted in the paper aim to validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
