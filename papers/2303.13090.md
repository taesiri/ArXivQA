# [Orthogonal Annotation Benefits Barely-supervised Medical Image   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13090)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is:

Can we develop a novel annotation method and semi-supervised model that effectively exploits the complementary information from different directions in 3D medical images to achieve efficient and accurate segmentation with minimal annotation effort?

Specifically, the paper proposes and investigates:

1) A new annotation method called "orthogonal annotation" that only labels two orthogonal slices in each 3D medical image volume. This aims to greatly reduce annotation effort while preserving disparity and complementary information.

2) A coupled segmentation method named "Dense-Sparse Co-Training (DeSCO)" framework that utilizes the proposed orthogonal annotation. It first generates dense pseudo-labels through registration, then trains dual networks that leverage both dense pseudo-labels and sparse labels in a co-training manner. The goal is to steadily utilize the sparse orthogonal annotation and achieve performance close to fully-supervised methods.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by utilizing the proposed orthogonal annotation method and DeSCO framework, it's possible to achieve highly efficient and accurate 3D medical image segmentation with minimal annotation effort. The experiments conducted in the paper aim to validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a novel annotation method called "orthogonal annotation" that only labels two orthogonal slices in a 3D medical image volume. This greatly reduces the annotation burden compared to labeling every slice.

2. Developing a barely-supervised 3D medical image segmentation framework that can effectively utilize the proposed sparse orthogonal annotation. This includes:

- Using registration to propagate the sparse labels to generate dense pseudo labels.

- Proposing a Dense-Sparse Co-Training (DeSCO) framework with two networks that exploits dense pseudo labels first and then relies more on sparse labels, while using unlabeled volumes for cross-supervision.

3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed orthogonal annotation and DeSCO framework through experiments on 3 public datasets. Using only 10 annotated slices, the method achieves comparable or better performance than semi-supervised methods using the full volumetric annotation. For example, on the KiTS19 dataset, the method reaches 86.93% Dice using 10 slices, compared to 84.98% for a semi-supervised approach using 320 fully labeled slices.

In summary, the key contribution is developing an efficient annotation strategy and coupled segmentation framework to enable high-quality 3D medical image segmentation using only sparse annotation of two orthogonal slices per volume. This greatly reduces the annotation burden while still achieving strong performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel barely-supervised 3D medical image segmentation method that uses a highly efficient orthogonal annotation to label only two slices per volume coupled with a Dense-Sparse Co-training framework that leverages dense pseudo labels and sparse labels to effectively utilize both labeled and unlabeled data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The focus on using orthogonal annotation and barely-supervised learning for 3D medical image segmentation is relatively novel. Most prior work has focused on semi-supervised or weakly-supervised methods that still require more complete labeling of the training data. The use of just two orthogonal labeled slices is an extreme form of sparse annotation that can greatly reduce labeling effort.

- The idea of using registration to propagate labels from the sparse annotations to generate pseudo-labels for model training has been explored before, but combining it with a dense-to-sparse training approach in a dual-network co-training framework is new. The dense-to-sparse scheduling and emphasis on consensus via co-training helps address issues with noise in the pseudo-labels.

- The dual-network co-training framework draws on ideas from prior semi-supervised learning methods, like Mean Teacher and co-training, but modifies them to work well with sparse orthogonal annotation and dense-to-sparse training. The modifications like uncertainty-guided cross-supervision are novel.

- The experiments comprehensively compare with current state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods adapted for this sparse setting. The results demonstrate sizable improvements in accuracy over these methods when using just the sparse orthogonal annotation. This supports the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- The work does not require complex modeling or architectures. The methods primarily provide a novel annotation approach and training procedure to make extremely sparse annotation viable. This could make adoption more practical.

- The sensitivity analysis provides useful insight into the impact of key hyper-parameters. Monitoring of accuracy over training iterations also gives valuable perspective into the model convergence behaviors.

Overall, this paper introduces a unique annotation strategy and training framework tailored to learning effectively from sparse annotation. The comparisons and analysis provide evidence of its capabilities and benefits over existing approaches. The methods could help reduce annotation effort in 3D medical image analysis.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing semi-supervised learning methods that can work with even less annotation, such as with only one or a few annotated slices per volume. The authors suggest exploring ways to maximize information extracted from limited annotation.

- Exploring different complementary views and relationships between views, beyond just orthogonal planes, that could provide useful signals for semi-supervised learning. The authors suggest there may be other complementary perspectives to leverage.

- Applying the proposed framework to other 3D medical image analysis tasks beyond segmentation, such as detection, registration, and synthesis. The authors suggest the framework could generalize.

- Evaluating the proposed approach on larger-scale 3D medical datasets with more annotated volumes, to further demonstrate its advantages. The authors used relatively small datasets in this work.

- Investigating whether the registration module could be jointly optimized or learned within the framework rather than just using off-the-shelf registration. This could potentially improve results.

- Developing better evaluation metrics and protocols specifically for the barely-supervised setting, since traditional metrics may not fully capture performance.

In summary, the main directions are around exploring the barely-supervised setting further, finding new complementary signals, generalizing the approach to other tasks and datasets, and improving components like the registration module. Overall the authors aim to reduce annotation needs for 3D medical image analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel annotation approach called orthogonal annotation for 3D medical image segmentation. In this approach, only two orthogonal slices from each 3D volume are annotated, which greatly reduces the annotation burden. To effectively utilize the sparsely annotated volumes, the authors first perform registration to propagate the labels and obtain dense pseudo labels. Then they propose a Dense-Sparse Co-training (DeSCO) framework with two networks that initially relies on the dense pseudo labels, but gradually transitions to only using the sparse annotation. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the orthogonal annotation, and show that with only 10 annotated slices, the method achieves comparable or better performance than semi-supervised methods trained on fully annotated volumes. The key ideas are the orthogonal annotation to reduce labeling effort, registration to obtain pseudo labels, and the DeSCO framework to effectively leverage both dense pseudo labels and sparse annotations in a coarse-to-fine manner.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel barely-supervised 3D medical image segmentation framework that utilizes a new annotation method called orthogonal annotation. In orthogonal annotation, only two orthogonal slices in each 3D volume are labeled, which greatly reduces annotation effort. To leverage the sparsely labeled volumes, the proposed method first uses registration to propagate labels and generate dense pseudo labels. Then a Dense-Sparse Co-Training (DeSCO) paradigm is introduced that initially relies on dense pseudo labels, but gradually transitions to only using the original sparse labels to reduce noise. Specifically, DeSCO consists of two segmentation networks that are trained to be consistent on unlabeled volumes through cross-supervision. In the early stages, the networks mainly learn from dense pseudo labels, but the influence of the noisy pseudo labels is gradually removed. In the later stages, sparse annotation and cross-supervision play a bigger role. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the proposed framework achieves comparable or higher performance than semi-supervised methods using full volume annotation. For instance, on the KiTS19 dataset, the proposed method utilizing only 10 annotated slices reaches 86.93% Dice, compared to 84.98% for a semi-supervised approach using 32 times more annotation.

In summary, the key contributions of this work are 1) an efficient orthogonal annotation approach that labels just two slices per volume, 2) a barely-supervised segmentation framework to leverage the sparse annotation through registration and a Dense-Sparse Co-Training paradigm, and 3) strong experimental results demonstrating the high performance and annotation efficiency of the proposed approach. The work significantly reduces annotation requirements for 3D medical image segmentation while achieving accuracy on par with or exceeding traditional semi-supervised methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel barely-supervised 3D medical image segmentation method that requires annotating only two orthogonal slices per volume for a small fraction of volumes in the dataset. The key ideas are:

1. They propose an efficient annotation method called orthogonal annotation, where only two orthogonal slices (e.g. one axial and one sagittal slice) are annotated for each sparsely labeled volume. This significantly reduces annotation effort while preserving complementary information from orthogonal views.

2. To utilize the sparsely labeled volumes, they first propagate the labels to the entire volume using registration to obtain dense pseudo-labels. 

3. They then propose a Dense-Sparse Co-Training (DeSCO) framework with two networks that exploits the dense pseudo-labels initially but gradually shifts reliance to the original sparse labels, while leveraging unlabeled volumes through consistency-based cross-supervision between networks.

4. Experiments on three public datasets show the proposed method performs comparably or even better than semi-supervised methods using fully annotated volumes, while requiring only 2-3% annotated slices. For instance, with 10 annotated slices, it achieves 86.9% Dice on KiTS19 compared to 85.0% for a semi-supervised baseline with full volume annotation.

In summary, the key idea is to use a very efficient orthogonal slice annotation strategy coupled with a co-training framework that propagates pseudo-labels initially but eventually relies on the sparse annotation, thereby achieving strong performance with minimal annotation effort.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of reducing the need for dense pixel-wise annotations in 3D medical image segmentation. The key questions it aims to tackle are:

1) How to design an efficient annotation method that requires labeling only a small portion of slices in 3D volumes? 

2) How to develop a coupled segmentation method that can effectively leverage the proposed sparse annotation?

Specifically, the paper proposes a new annotation method called "orthogonal annotation" where only two orthogonal slices are labeled in each 3D volume. This aims to significantly reduce annotation costs while preserving complementary information from different viewing directions. 

To utilize the sparse orthogonal annotation, the paper develops a segmentation framework called Dense-Sparse Co-training (DeSCO). It first generates dense pseudo labels using registration, then trains two networks using a co-training strategy - relying more on pseudo labels initially but gradually emphasizing the sparse annotation. This allows exploiting both dense and sparse supervision signals in a principled manner.

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient annotation strategy and a tailored segmentation method to address the problem of reducing annotation costs in 3D medical image segmentation. The core ideas are utilizing orthogonal slices to preserve complementarity and using co-training with dense-sparse supervision transition.
