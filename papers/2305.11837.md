# [Comparing Software Developers with ChatGPT: An Empirical Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11837)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:"How do software engineers compare with AI solutions like ChatGPT with respect to performance and memory efficiency in solving coding problems?"The authors conduct an empirical study to compare the performance and memory efficiency of code solutions generated by ChatGPT versus solutions provided by human software engineers for coding problems at different difficulty levels. The key aspects are:- The authors select coding problems from a recent LeetCode contest and use them as prompts for ChatGPT to generate code solutions. - They then upload the ChatGPT-generated solutions to LeetCode to compare them against solutions previously submitted by human programmers.- The human programmers are categorized into experienced contest programmers and novice programmers based on their LeetCode ranking and contest participation. - The solutions are evaluated and compared based on runtime performance and memory efficiency metrics provided by LeetCode.So in essence, the central research question is how ChatGPT's automated coding solutions compare to human-written code by programmers of different skill levels, using quantitative performance metrics like runtime and memory usage. The goal is to empirically evaluate the relative strengths of AI versus human coding.
