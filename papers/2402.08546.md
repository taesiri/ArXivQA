# [Grounding LLMs For Robot Task Planning Using Closed-loop State Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08546)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Grounding LLMs for robotic task planning is challenging. LLMs can decompose high-level tasks but the generated steps may not be directly executable due to physical constraints of the environment. 
- Existing methods have difficulty adapting plans to changing environments and recovering from execution errors.

Proposed Solution: 
- A novel planning algorithm using two LLMs in a hierarchical architecture inspired by the human brain, called Brain-BodyLLM
- Brain-LLM generates step-by-step plans from task descriptions which are translated to commands by Body-LLM 
- Closed-loop feedback mechanism provides real-time state updates and error messages to iteratively refine plans for successful execution

Key Contributions:
- Improves average task success rate by 35% over state-of-the-art methods in VirtualHome simulation across 80 tasks
- Achieves 85% execution score, nearing 94% human benchmark and surpassing competing approaches  
- Tested algorithm on Franka Research 3 arm using physics simulator and real robot, successfully executing tasks of varying difficulties requiring spatial reasoning and error resolution
- Simple yet effective methodology integrating dual LLMs with environmental feedback for enhanced adaptability and robustness in robotic planning

In summary, this paper introduces a novel hierarchical dual-LLM architecture that leverages closed-loop feedback to iteratively refine plans for robotic task execution. By emulating human brain-body mechanisms, the algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in success rates across simulated and real robot experiments involving manipulation tasks.
