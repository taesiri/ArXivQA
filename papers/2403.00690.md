# [Playing NetHack with LLMs: Potential &amp; Limitations as Zero-Shot Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00690)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Playing NetHack with LLMs: Potential & Limitations as Zero-Shot Agents":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for zero-shot game playing agents, but evaluations are limited to predictable tasks like mining diamonds in Minecraft. Performance in more dynamic environments with complex interactions is unknown.  
- NetHack is proposed as a challenging testbed for LLMs given its procedural generation, vast state space, complex mechanics, and ambiguity.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present NetPlay, an LLM-powered zero-shot agent for NetHack built using GPT-4. 
- NetPlay uses an architecture designed for dynamic robot environments, with closed-loop planning. The LLM prompts choose skills to execute, and tracks past interactions to inform future decisions.
- Game events interrupt skill execution to enable reacting to unpredictable situations.
- NetPlay is compared to a handcrafted agent and autoascend, the top agent in the 2021 NetHack Challenge.

Contributions:
- NetPlay demonstrates an ability to utilize most of NetHack's mechanics and excels at following detailed instructions. When focused on specific problems, it exhibits creative problem solving.
- However, its performance degrades significantly with ambiguous tasks lacking explicit feedback. A handcrafted agent achieves comparable performance.
- The results highlight the need for methods to dynamically supply relevant context information in complex, unpredictable environments.
- This is the first work rigorously evaluating and characterizing the strengths and limitations of LLM game playing agents in NetHack's vast state space.

In summary, the paper presents NetPlay, an LLM-powered zero-shot agent for NetHack that succeeds at well-defined tasks but struggles with ambiguity. The analysis reveals the necessity for techniques that provide dynamic, relevant context to enable complex planning.
