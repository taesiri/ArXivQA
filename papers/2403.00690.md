# [Playing NetHack with LLMs: Potential &amp; Limitations as Zero-Shot Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00690)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Playing NetHack with LLMs: Potential & Limitations as Zero-Shot Agents":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for zero-shot game playing agents, but evaluations are limited to predictable tasks like mining diamonds in Minecraft. Performance in more dynamic environments with complex interactions is unknown.  
- NetHack is proposed as a challenging testbed for LLMs given its procedural generation, vast state space, complex mechanics, and ambiguity.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present NetPlay, an LLM-powered zero-shot agent for NetHack built using GPT-4. 
- NetPlay uses an architecture designed for dynamic robot environments, with closed-loop planning. The LLM prompts choose skills to execute, and tracks past interactions to inform future decisions.
- Game events interrupt skill execution to enable reacting to unpredictable situations.
- NetPlay is compared to a handcrafted agent and autoascend, the top agent in the 2021 NetHack Challenge.

Contributions:
- NetPlay demonstrates an ability to utilize most of NetHack's mechanics and excels at following detailed instructions. When focused on specific problems, it exhibits creative problem solving.
- However, its performance degrades significantly with ambiguous tasks lacking explicit feedback. A handcrafted agent achieves comparable performance.
- The results highlight the need for methods to dynamically supply relevant context information in complex, unpredictable environments.
- This is the first work rigorously evaluating and characterizing the strengths and limitations of LLM game playing agents in NetHack's vast state space.

In summary, the paper presents NetPlay, an LLM-powered zero-shot agent for NetHack that succeeds at well-defined tasks but struggles with ambiguity. The analysis reveals the necessity for techniques that provide dynamic, relevant context to enable complex planning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents NetPlay, the first LLM-powered zero-shot agent for the complex roguelike game NetHack, which demonstrates flexibility in executing detailed instructions but struggles with more ambiguous tasks like winning the game autonomously.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The introduction of NetPlay, the first LLM-powered zero-shot agent for the challenging roguelike game NetHack. The paper evaluates NetPlay's performance on playing the full NetHack game and also analyzes its behavior in detail using various isolated scenarios. The key findings are that NetPlay demonstrates considerable flexibility and creativity in executing detailed instructions across a wide range of tasks, but struggles with more ambiguous objectives like trying to win the entire game. The paper also discusses the potential and limitations of using LLMs for developing game agents. Overall, it provides an in-depth analysis of how an LLM-based zero-shot agent can handle the complexity of a game like NetHack.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- NetHack - The complex roguelike game that is used as the testbed environment for the agent.

- Large Language Models (LLMs) - The type of model that powers the agent, specifically GPT-4.

- Zero-shot agent - The agent is not pre-trained and instead relies on the knowledge and planning capabilities of the LLM. 

- Skills - The predefined behaviors and actions the agent can take, which are selected by the LLM.

- autoascend - The top symbolic agent from the 2021 NeurIPS NetHack challenge, which the authors compare their agent against. 

- Architecture - The paper proposes and evaluates a specific agent architecture involving skills, memory, chaining prompts, etc.

- Flexibility - A strength of the agent is its ability to handle a wide variety of tasks when given enough context.

- Creativity - Another strength where the agent explores solutions, but struggles due to lack of feedback.

- Limitations - The agent has issues with ambiguous tasks, confusing observations, and lack of feedback.

In summary, key terms cover the agent itself, the environment, the model powering it, aspects of the architecture, strengths and limitations. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using GPT-4 as the underlying LLM. How might the performance and behavior of the agent differ if a more advanced model like GPT-5 was used instead? What new capabilities might emerge?

2. The skill set of the agent seems fairly limited. What additional skills could be beneficial to add? How might more advanced skills that combine multiple actions help the agent handle more complex situations?

3. The paper identifies providing additional context as one way to potentially improve performance. What methods could be used to automatically retrieve relevant context information from the vast amount of data available in NetHack?

4. The agent architecture separates navigation into a special "explore_level" skill. Could a more integrated approach where navigation is handled dynamically in each skill improve flexibility? What challenges would this introduce?

5. Much of the agent's limitations seem to arise from deficiencies in the handcrafted components like skills and observations. How could machine learning be utilized to learn these components instead? What risks and benefits would this introduce?

6. The paper identifies using the agent for regression testing during development as a promising application. What additional capabilities would need to be added to the agent to make it proficient for this use case? How could the agent automatically adapt as the game changes?

7. The guided agent utilizes some strategies from the autoascend agent. What other high-level strategies from autoascend could be incorporated and how might they be represented? Could the agent learn such strategies automatically through self-play?

8. The paper identifies providing continual human feedback as another potential extension. What methods could enable efficient communication of human feedback? How to ensure the agent can properly incorporate and act on this feedback? 

9. The scenarios showcase limitations in providing explicit feedback to the agent. How could the architecture be changed to enable better tracking of progress on sub-tasks and goals? What external mechanisms could augment the agent's internal representation?

10. The paper focuses on presenting strengths and limitations of the method. What kinds of quantitative experiments could better evaluate capabilities across different facets like planning, exploration, creativity etc? What metrics would be suitable?
