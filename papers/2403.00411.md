# [Cross-Lingual Learning vs. Low-Resource Fine-Tuning: A Case Study with   Fact-Checking in Turkish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00411)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Misinformation is prevalent across languages, but most research focuses on English. There is a lack of fact-checking datasets in other languages like Turkish.
- Large language models (LLMs) have limited knowledge in low-resource languages. It's expensive to create large annotated datasets in these languages or pretrain LLMs.
- So there is a need to test the viability of cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource fact-checking.

Proposed Solution:
- Created a new fact-checking dataset for Turkish (FCTR) with 3238 claims from 3 websites. Includes claims, evidence, summaries, labels, URLs and dates.
- Performed experiments to assess effectiveness of transfer learning from English to Turkish fact-checking:
  - Fine-tuned LLama-2 LLM on English Snopes dataset (6402 claims) 
  - Evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, machine translation approaches on FCTR 
  - Compared to fine-tuning LLama-2 on Turkish FCTR

Main Contributions:
- Released new richer FCTR dataset for Turkish fact-checking
- Showed superior performance from fine-tuning on Turkish vs zero/few-shot cross-lingual transfer
- Provided analysis of topics in datasets and surface feature differences
- Demonstrated some small gains from transfer learning prompting and translation
- Highlighted need for collecting native low-resource language data over reliance on high-resource transfer

The results indicate feasibility but limitations of cross-lingual transfer learning for fact-checking in Turkish. The FCTR dataset can facilitate related research in Turkish language. Fine-tuning on native Turkish data is still crucial for better performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new Turkish fact-checking dataset, evaluates cross-lingual transfer learning approaches using English resources, and shows that while transfer learning provides small gains, collecting native Turkish data and fine-tuning yields substantially better performance for automated fact-checking in Turkish.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. Releasing a new Turkish fact-checking dataset (FCTR) obtained by crawling three Turkish fact-checking websites. The dataset contains 3238 claims with additional metadata such as evidence statements, summaries, veracity labels, etc.

2. Assessing the efficiency of cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource languages, with a specific emphasis on Turkish. Experiments are conducted using the FCTR dataset and the English Snopes dataset.

3. Presenting experimental results comparing zero-shot and few-shot prompt learning and fine-tuning on large language models. The results underscore the need to utilize at least a small amount of native Turkish data to achieve good performance on the Turkish fact-checking task.

4. Providing an analysis of the datasets using topic modeling and content-based features. This explores the potential differences between true and fake claims.

In summary, the main contribution is releasing a new fact-checking dataset for Turkish and demonstrating the viability of cross-lingual transfer learning approaches, while also showing the need for at least a small amount of native Turkish data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes fine-tuning the Llama-2 model for the fact-checking task. What are the key advantages of using the Llama-2 model over other language models for this task? How does the size and pre-training data of Llama-2 contribute to its effectiveness?

2. The paper utilizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA and QLoRA to fit Llama-2 into GPU memory constraints. Can you explain how these methods work and why they are important for deploying large language models? 

3. Instruction tuning using prompt templates is utilized in the paper. Why is instruction tuning useful and how does it allow models to better understand the desired task? What is the difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompting?

4. When using only the claim statement as input, the SVM model achieves the best results on the FCTR datasets. What does this suggest about the type of features that are useful for fact-checking in Turkish?

5. Providing summary statements along with claims significantly improves Llama-2's performance on FCTR data. Why do you think additional contextual information benefits the model? Should fact-checking models rely solely on claims?

6. The number of training instances is varied in one experiment. What trend do you notice about model performance vs quantity of training data? When does increasing data stop helping? What explanations can you provide?

7. The paper examines both zero-shot and few-shot transfer learning. Compare and contrast the effectiveness of these approaches. When is each one preferable?

8. How does fine-tuning Llama-2 on translated Snopes data and testing on FCTR data perform compared to other transfer learning experiments? What factors could influence this? 

9. The paper categorizes claims as local and global. What differences do you notice in model performance on these two categories when using the Llama models? What could explain this?

10. If you wanted to expand on the work in this paper, what additional experiments would you propose to gain more insight into cross-lingual transfer learning for automated fact checking?
