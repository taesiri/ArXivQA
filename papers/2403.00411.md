# [Cross-Lingual Learning vs. Low-Resource Fine-Tuning: A Case Study with   Fact-Checking in Turkish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00411)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Misinformation is prevalent across languages, but most research focuses on English. There is a lack of fact-checking datasets in other languages like Turkish.
- Large language models (LLMs) have limited knowledge in low-resource languages. It's expensive to create large annotated datasets in these languages or pretrain LLMs.
- So there is a need to test the viability of cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource fact-checking.

Proposed Solution:
- Created a new fact-checking dataset for Turkish (FCTR) with 3238 claims from 3 websites. Includes claims, evidence, summaries, labels, URLs and dates.
- Performed experiments to assess effectiveness of transfer learning from English to Turkish fact-checking:
  - Fine-tuned LLama-2 LLM on English Snopes dataset (6402 claims) 
  - Evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, machine translation approaches on FCTR 
  - Compared to fine-tuning LLama-2 on Turkish FCTR

Main Contributions:
- Released new richer FCTR dataset for Turkish fact-checking
- Showed superior performance from fine-tuning on Turkish vs zero/few-shot cross-lingual transfer
- Provided analysis of topics in datasets and surface feature differences
- Demonstrated some small gains from transfer learning prompting and translation
- Highlighted need for collecting native low-resource language data over reliance on high-resource transfer

The results indicate feasibility but limitations of cross-lingual transfer learning for fact-checking in Turkish. The FCTR dataset can facilitate related research in Turkish language. Fine-tuning on native Turkish data is still crucial for better performance.
