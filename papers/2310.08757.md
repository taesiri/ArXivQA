# [Detection and prediction of clopidogrel treatment failures using   longitudinal structured electronic health records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08757)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and treatment failures (TFs) from inadequate drug concentrations significantly impact patients and the healthcare system. There is a need to better predict ADRs/TFs.
- The paper focuses on building models to automatically detect and predict treatment failures with clopidogrel, a commonly prescribed blood thinner. Clopidogrel responses vary between patients and can lead to recurrent thrombosis or bleeding emergencies if concentrations are too low or high.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage structured EHR data, including diagnoses, procedures and prescriptions records over time. Model the longitudinal records as clinical timelines. 
- Apply natural language processing techniques used on textual data to the structured timeline data. Compare recurrent networks (GRU, LSTM) and contextual models like BERT.
- Frame the problem as both a detection task (predicting failures in the year after first prescription) and prediction task (predicting failures from data before first prescription).

Main Contributions:
- Novel application of NLP timeseries techniques like BERT to structured EHR data to model patient clinical timelines. 
- Comparison of different model architectures (recurrent networks, BERT, bag-of-words baselines) over two problem formulations.
- Ablation studies quantifying the impact of different input modalities. Combining diagnoses, procedures and prescriptions data improves performance.
- Analysis showing pre-trained BERT models are beneficial when labeled training data is small. BERT leverages unlabeled pre-training.
- New labeled dataset for clopidogrel treatment failures annotated from UK Biobank using rule-based cohort identification from structured diagnosis and prescription codes.

The paper demonstrates structured EHR data can be effectively modeled using timeline approaches from NLP for clinical predictions tasks. Both problem formulation and model architecture impact overall performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using natural language processing techniques like recurrent neural networks and BERT on structured longitudinal electronic health records to detect and predict clopidogrel treatment failures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and predict clopidogrel treatment failure using longitudinal structured electronic health records (EHR). Specifically:

- The authors introduce various machine learning algorithms used in natural language processing (NLP) to build models for clopidogrel treatment failure detection and prediction using structured EHR data. 

- They generate a dataset from UK Biobank of patients with clopidogrel prescriptions and annotate treatment failure events.

- They organize the diagnosis, procedure, and prescription records per patient into longitudinal timelines of visits. 

- They build and compare models for treatment failure detection (looking back from 1 year after first prescription) and prediction (looking forward from first prescription).

- The results show that time series models like BERT, LSTM, and GRU outperform bag-of-words models, and that using multiple modalities of EHR data improves performance.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating the utility of NLP time series modeling approaches on structured EHR data for detecting and predicting clopidogrel treatment failures.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using machine learning algorithms from natural language processing (NLP) for modeling longitudinal structured EHR data. What is the analogy they draw between NLP data and structured EHR data to justify this approach?

2. The paper evaluates both recurrent neural networks like LSTM/GRU and Transformer models like BERT. What are the key differences in these architectures and what might make one better suited for this application than the other?

3. The paper uses a clopidogrel treatment failure dataset from UK Biobank. What criteria do they use to define treatment failure cases and control cases? How many samples of each do they identify?

5. The paper experiments with both treatment failure detection and prediction tasks. What is the key difference in the data seen by the model between these two tasks? 

6. For the BERT model, what pretraining procedure does the paper utilize before fine-tuning on the treatment failure dataset? What is the motivation for using pretraining here?

7. The GRU model performs the best on the detection task while BERT performs the best on the prediction task with smaller datasets. What explanations are provided in the paper for these results?

8. The paper performs ablation experiments using different combinations of data modalities. What modalities does the structured EHR data contain and what is the impact of using them together vs individually?

9. The sequential models outperform bag-of-words models consistently. What explanation is provided in the paper for why temporal dynamics are important for this task?
