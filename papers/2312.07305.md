# [SCCA: Shifted Cross Chunk Attention for long contextual semantic   expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07305)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Shifted Cross Chunk Attention (SCCA) and Shifted Dilated Attention (SDA), two novel sparse attention patterns that enable extending the context length of large language models (LLMs) during efficient fine-tuning. SCCA shifts the key-value vectors in different heads to enable queries to attend outside their local window, accumulating results to approximate full attention. Two SCCA variants are presented: SCCA_fixed shifts half the heads, while SCCA_flow shifts each head differently to enable global coverage. SDA combines dilated attention and neighborhood attention, selecting tokens in a dilated pattern across the full context. Experiments using LLaMA-7B show SCCA variants combined with positional interpolation can extend the model to 8k context with lower perplexity than prior sparse attention methods. A LongMixed combination of SCCA and SDA achieves the best perplexity. The proposed attention patterns enable efficient LLM context extension as plug-and-play fine-tuning techniques, without changing model architectures. They accumulate local attention results to approximate global context, balancing efficiency and global modeling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Shifted Cross Chunk Attention (SCCA) and Shifted Dilated Attention (SDA), efficient attention patterns that accumulate results across multiple heads to approximate full attention, enabling effective context length extension of large language models up to 8k tokens with reduced computation compared to prior work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes two shifted cross chunk attention (SCCA) patterns - SCCA_fixed and SCCA_flow - that allow queries to attend outside their local window to enable better global information flow compared to existing sparse attention methods. 

2. It combines dilated attention (DA) and dilated neighborhood attention (DNA) into a proposed shifted dilated attention (SDA) that also allows approximating full attention.

3. It shows how SCCA and SDA can be combined into a LongMixed attention pattern for more efficient context length extension of large language models.

4. It conducts language modeling experiments that demonstrate SCCA patterns combined with positional interpolation and LoRA can more efficiently extend the context length of models like LLaMA compared to prior S^2 attention, while retaining performance.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing shifted attention mechanisms that enable more efficient context extension for large language models while retaining performance compared to prior sparse attention methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Sparse attention - Methods like local attention, sliding window attention, dilated attention that use sparse patterns to reduce the quadratic computation complexity of self-attention in transformers.

- Length extrapolation - Extending the context length that language models can process during inference beyond the length they were trained on.

- Shifted cross chunk attention (SCCA) - The proposed attention mechanism that shifts keys and values to enable attention across non-overlapping local windows to improve information flow. Two patterns are introduced - fixed shifting and flow shifting.

- Shifted dilated attention (SDA) - Proposed combination of dilated attention and dilated neighborhood attention with shifting to simulate full attention.

- Positional interpolation (PI) - Methods like NTK-aware scaled RoPE and YaRN that extend context length of models like LLaMA by modifying the positional encodings.

- Long context language modeling - Language modeling over long text sequences of thousands of tokens, enabled by techniques like SCCA and SDA.

- Fine-tuning for context extension - Using sparse attention patterns during fine-tuning to extend pre-trained LMs to longer contexts more efficiently than full fine-tuning.

- LongBench - A benchmark with long text tasks for evaluating long context understanding.

- RedPajama dataset - Open source recipe to reproduce LLaMA training data. Used for experiments in this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two key components: Shifted Cross Chunk Attention (SCCA) and Shifted Dilated Attention (SDA). Can you explain in detail how each of these components works and what problem they aim to solve compared to previous sparse attention mechanisms? 

2. The paper evaluates SCCA and SDA on the language modeling task for context extension. What are the specific limitations of previous methods like S2 attention that SCCA and SDA try to address? How do the proposed methods perform better?

3. The paper introduces two variants of SCCA - SCCA_fixed and SCCA_flow. Can you outline the key differences between them and explain when one might be preferred over the other? 

4. The LongMixed combination is proposed in the paper which combines SCCA_fixed and SDA. What is the intuition behind this combination? How do the strengths of the two attention mechanisms complement each other here?

5. The experiments are conducted by extending the context length of the LLaMA model to 8192 tokens. What modifications need to be made to the model architecture and training methodology to enable such long context modeling? 

6. Positional Interpolation (PI) techniques are used along with SCCA and SDA to extend the context. How exactly does PI complement these attention mechanisms? What role does each component play in the overall context extension pipeline?

7. The comparison is made to S2 attention on the same language modeling task. Under what contexts or model architectures do you think SCCA/SDA would have a clear advantage over S2 attention for context extension?

8. The paper claims linear complexity for accumulating attention results with SCCA to obtain approximate full attention. Can you explain this claim and outline the analysis on computational complexity?

9. How suitable do you think the proposed techniques are for extending context in other modalities like images or speech compared to language? Would there need to be any modifications to make it work effectively?

10. The techniques are analyzed in the context of autoregressive language modeling here. Do you foresee any challenges in using them for other language tasks like generation, translation etc? How could the methods be adapted for such cases?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have limited input context lengths they can model well. Directly extrapolating the context leads to poor performance. 
- Current sparse attention patterns for extending context length lack global information flow between tokens.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce two types of Shifted Cross Chunk Attention (SCCA):
    - SCCA_fixed: Shifts half the attention heads to enable cross-chunk attention.
    - SCCA_flow: Shifts different heads by different amounts to enable approximating full attention.
- Also propose Shifted Dilated Attention (SDA) that selects dilated tokens in global space.
- Combine SCCA and SDA in a LongMixed pattern for context extension.
- Use positional interpolation to extend model and then fine-tune with SCCA patterns.

Experiments:
- Evaluate language modeling perplexity after extending 7B parameter LLaMA to 8k context.
- Compare SCCA, SDA and LongMixed to baseline S^2 attention.
- Find that SCCA patterns outperform S^2 baseline, with best result from LongMixed.

Main Contributions:
- Propose SCCA attention patterns that increase global information flow for context extension.
- Show strong language modeling results when using SCCA for efficient context extension compared to prior work.
- SCCA enables extending large models to longer contexts with modest compute requirements.
- The patterns are plug-and-play and compatible with existing techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces shifted attention patterns that efficiently extend model context length while retaining global token interactions, outperforming prior sparse attention approaches.
