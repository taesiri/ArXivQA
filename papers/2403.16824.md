# [On Policy Reuse: An Expressive Language for Representing and Executing   General Policies that Call Other Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16824)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing languages for representing general policies and problem decompositions (sketches) do not support reuse and composition of policies/sketches. This limits the ability to learn policies in a hierarchical, bottom-up manner.
- Existing policy languages also do not allow mapping states directly to ground actions, relying instead on transitions. This requires a model even at execution time.
- Representing goals and relations between objects with non-indexical features can be complex.

Proposed Solutions:
- Extend policy/sketch language with finite state machine style memory to sequence behaviors.
- Introduce registers that can store objects and be referenced by indexical features. This reduces representational complexity.
- Introduce modules that encapsulate policies/sketches and allow them to call each other, including recursively. Modules can pass parameters based on state, registers, and goals.
- Allow rules that map states to ground actions directly, avoiding the need for a model at execution time.

Main Contributions:
- An expressive language for reusable, hierarchical policies/sketches that can call other policies/sketches.
- Indexical features based on registers reduce representational complexity.
- Rules for directly executing ground actions enable model-free execution.
- Promotes learning hierarchical policies bottom-up by reusing simpler policies.
- Examples demonstrate representing complex policies like recursively building block towers.
- Basis for future work on learning these policy structures.

In summary, the paper introduces an extended policy/sketch language that supports reuse, hierarchy, indexical features for simplicity, and model-free execution, aiming to enable bottom-up learning of complex policies. Examples show representing complex blocks world policies.
