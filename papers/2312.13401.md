# [Time is Encoded in the Weights of Finetuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13401)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Language models suffer from temporal misalignment, where performance degrades significantly when the model is evaluated on text from a different time period than what it was trained on. This occurs across tasks, domains, and time scales (yearly and monthly).

- Adapting models to new time periods is difficult due to lack of data and the multitude of time scales involved.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce "time vectors" which capture temporal variation by taking the difference between a model finetuned on data from a specific time period and the original pretrained model. 

- Show time vectors from adjacent time periods are positioned closer together in weight space, and similarity correlates with temporal misalignment.

- Use interpolation between time vectors to adapt models to intervening time periods without additional finetuning. Also show this can generalize models to future unlabeled time periods using task analogies.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis showing linear yearly decay and seasonal monthly patterns in temporal misalignment across tasks/models
- Time vectors that encode temporal variation in model weight space
- Techniques to leverage time vector structure and interpolation to cheaply adapt models to new time periods without additional data
- Public release of code, data, and 500+ time-specific finetuned models

In summary, this paper demonstrates that time is encoded in the weights of finetuned language models, and that weight space arithmetic can help adapt models to new time periods to combat temporal misalignment. The main techniques are time vectors and interpolation to generalize to unseen times.
