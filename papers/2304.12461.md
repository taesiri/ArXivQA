# [TensoIR: Tensorial Inverse Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12461)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we perform inverse rendering to estimate scene geometry, materials, and unknown natural illumination from multi-view images in an efficient and accurate manner using neural representations? 

Specifically, the key hypotheses are:

1. By extending the TensoRF representation to jointly model both a radiance field and a physically-based rendering model, we can achieve high-quality reconstruction of scene properties like geometry, reflectance, and lighting for inverse rendering.

2. The efficiency of the tensor factorization-based representation allows accurate online computation of visibility and indirect lighting during optimization, leading to better accuracy compared to distilling them into separate networks. 

3. Modeling an additional lighting dimension in the tensor representation supports efficient multi-light capture and provides useful cues to resolve ambiguities and improve reconstruction.

In summary, the central goal is developing an efficient neural inverse rendering approach that can estimate high-fidelity scene properties from multi-view images under unknown natural illumination. The key hypotheses are using a joint radiance field and physical model representation based on tensor factorization, computing accurate light transport effects online, and supporting multi-light capture in the framework.
