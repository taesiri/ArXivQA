# [TensoIR: Tensorial Inverse Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12461)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we perform inverse rendering to estimate scene geometry, materials, and unknown natural illumination from multi-view images in an efficient and accurate manner using neural representations? 

Specifically, the key hypotheses are:

1. By extending the TensoRF representation to jointly model both a radiance field and a physically-based rendering model, we can achieve high-quality reconstruction of scene properties like geometry, reflectance, and lighting for inverse rendering.

2. The efficiency of the tensor factorization-based representation allows accurate online computation of visibility and indirect lighting during optimization, leading to better accuracy compared to distilling them into separate networks. 

3. Modeling an additional lighting dimension in the tensor representation supports efficient multi-light capture and provides useful cues to resolve ambiguities and improve reconstruction.

In summary, the central goal is developing an efficient neural inverse rendering approach that can estimate high-fidelity scene properties from multi-view images under unknown natural illumination. The key hypotheses are using a joint radiance field and physical model representation based on tensor factorization, computing accurate light transport effects online, and supporting multi-light capture in the framework.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Extending the framework to enable video-based reconstruction and general dynamic scene modeling. The current framework focuses on static scene reconstruction from multi-view images. Modeling dynamic scenes and using video input could be an interesting extension.

- Investigating alternatives to the tensor representation to further improve efficiency. While the tensor representation already leads to great efficiency gains compared to pure MLP models like NeRF, exploring other structured representations could potentially lead to further speedups.

- Applying the framework to model scenes with complex lighting effects like reflections, refractions, caustics etc. The current lighting model focuses on diffuse and direct lighting. Handling more complex light transport could broaden the applicability.

- Incorporating stronger shape priors and exploiting scene semantics to enable robust reconstruction from sparse views or to guide the optimization. The current approach does reconstruction from scratch. Leveraging priors about object categories, typical shapes etc. could help the reconstruction. 

- Extending to model non-Lambertian surface properties beyond the microfacet BRDF model used currently. Using more complex analytical BRDF models or even data-driven reflectance representations could allow capturing a broader range of materials.

- Applying the inverse rendering framework for material editing and manipulation applications, since it disentangles shape and reflectance. The current focus is on novel view synthesis and relighting.

In summary, some key directions are improving efficiency further, expanding modeling capabilities, incorporating stronger priors and semantics, and applying the inverse rendering results for manipulation applications. The proposed approach opens up many exciting avenues for future work.
