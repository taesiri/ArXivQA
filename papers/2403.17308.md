# [Neural Multimodal Topic Modeling: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17308)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Topic modeling algorithms designed to process textual data have limited performance on multimodal corpora containing information in other formats like images. 
- It is unclear which multimodal topic modeling method works better on which dataset and what evaluation metrics are appropriate.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop two new neural multimodal topic models by adapting state-of-the-art solutions - Multimodal-ZeroShotTM and Multimodal-Contrast.
- Propose two new evaluation metrics - Image Embedding-based Coherence (IEC) and Image Embedding-based Pairwise Similarity (IEPS) to assess topic image descriptors.
- Compile six diverse multimodal datasets varying in document size, source, task/domain and data collection process.

- Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the two proposed models against strong textual baselines over the six datasets using textual and newly proposed image coherence/diversity metrics.

Main Contributions:
- First systematic and comprehensive evaluation of neural multimodal topic modeling using diverse datasets and metrics.
- Two new neural multimodal topic models - Multimodal-ZeroShotTM and Multimodal-Contrast.
- Two new evaluation metrics for multimodal topics - IEC and IEPS, validated through a user study.
- Findings indicate both models generate coherent and diverse topics but performance depends on metrics and datasets, warranting further exploration of hybrid solutions.

In summary, the paper performs an extensive assessment of multimodal topic modeling algorithms over diverse datasets using traditional and newly proposed evaluation metrics. The introduced models and metrics advance multimodal topic modeling research.
