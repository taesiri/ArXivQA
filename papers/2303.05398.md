# MathPrompter: Mathematical Reasoning using Large Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we improve the performance and accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on mathematical reasoning tasks, while also increasing reliability and user trust in their predictions?The key hypotheses of the paper appear to be:1) Using a zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting technique to generate multiple algebraic expressions or Python functions that solve the same math problem in different ways can increase accuracy and confidence in LLM predictions. 2) Incorporating compute verification of the intermediate steps taken by the CoT prompts can further validate the logical correctness of the reasoning process. 3) Obtaining the final solution to a math problem through multiple algebraically valid approaches provides statistical significance that builds user trust in the results.So in summary, the central research question revolves around leveraging ideas like multi-verification, cross-checking, and compute verification to improve LLMs' performance on math reasoning tasks, while also addressing the issue of reliability and trust in their outputs. The proposed method, MathPrompter, aims to test these hypotheses through its novel prompting and validation techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of a technique called "MathPrompter" to improve the performance and reliability of large language models (LLMs) on mathematical reasoning tasks. Specifically, the key aspects of the MathPrompter technique seem to be:- Using zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting to generate multiple algebraic expressions or Python functions that solve a given math problem in different ways. This allows for cross-verification of the results.- Ensuring the validity of the intermediate reasoning steps taken by the LLM, rather than just outputting a solution. This is done by evaluating the algebraic expressions or Python functions.- Obtaining a consensus solution from the different valid approaches to increase confidence. This allows statistical significance testing. - Demonstrating improved accuracy over prior state-of-the-art methods on the MultiArith dataset (increasing from 78.7% to 92.5% accuracy) using a 175B parameter LLM.So in summary, the main contribution appears to be presenting MathPrompter as a novel technique to enhance LLM performance and reliability on mathematical reasoning via multi-step verification, ensuring validity of reasoning chains, and consensus solutions. The gains on the MultiArith benchmark showcase the capabilities.
