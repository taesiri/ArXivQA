# [Monotonic Representation of Numeric Properties in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10381)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper investigates how factual knowledge involving numeric properties, such as an entity's birth year, is represented in the internal activations of large language models (LMs). Prior work has mainly focused on analyzing representations of entity-entity relations rather than numeric attributes. It is unclear if LMs represent the natural monotonic structure of numeric properties like dates and geographic coordinates. 

Methodology
The authors hypothesize that numeric properties are encoded linearly in low-dimensional subspaces of the LM's activation space. They use partial least squares (PLS) regression to identify directions in activation space that strongly correlate with the numeric quantities expressed by the LM. For example, they query the LM for Karl Popper's birth year and correlate the output 1902 with his entity's representation.

They find between 2-6 dimensional PLS components that capture up to 95% of the maximum predictive power for various numeric properties. This indicates compact linear encoding. The projections of entities onto these components exhibit visible monotonic structure aligned with the properties.

To establish that these representations have a causal influence, they perturb activations along the PLS directions and measure effects on model output. Patching along identified "birth year" directions causes the LM to express different years monotonically, confirming fine-grained control.

Main Contributions
- Finding low-dimensional subspaces of LM activations that encode numeric attributes in a compact, predictable and monotonically editable way. 
- Demonstrating the causal effect of interventions along directions in these subspaces on numeric quantities expressed by the LM.
- Suggesting numeric properties are consistently represented monotonically in LMs as a byproduct of pretraining, likely reflecting distributional patterns.
- Introducing quantitative analysis of representation editing effects and side effects.

The work leaves open questions around the specificity of the identified directions and relationship between quality of encoding and model performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a method to find and edit low-dimensional subspaces in language model activations that monotonically encode numeric properties like an entity's birth year, enabling controllable and interpretable manipulation of the model's knowledge expression.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is introducing a simple method for finding and editing representations of numeric properties such as an entity's birth year in language models. Specifically, the paper:

- Finds low-dimensional subspaces in language models that strongly correlate with numeric properties across models and properties. This confirms and extends prior observations that language models represent numeric properties in low-dimensional subspaces.

- Formally defines the notion of monotonic representation of numeric properties in language models. 

- Shows through causal interventions (directed activation patching) that there is a monotonic relationship between interventions along directions in the found subspaces and changes in the quantities expressed by the language model. For example, interventions along a "birthyear" direction causes the model to output increasingly earlier or later years of birth.

- Suggests, based on the findings, that language models represent numeric properties in a way that reflects their natural structure and that such monotonic representations consistently emerge during language model pretraining.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing an analysis method and providing evidence that numeric properties like birth years are monotonically represented in a low-dimensional subspace of language model activation spaces.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Language models (LMs)
- Factual knowledge
- Numeric properties (e.g. birth year, population, elevation, coordinates)
- Representational analysis
- Linear representations
- Monotonic representations
- Partial least squares (PLS) regression  
- Activation patching 
- Causality
- Editability of representations
- Effects and side-effects of interventions

The paper analyzes how factual knowledge involving numeric properties like birth years and geographic coordinates is represented in language models. It introduces the concepts of linear and monotonic representations of such numeric properties, and uses methods like PLS regression and activation patching to identify and edit directions in activation space that encode this knowledge in an interpretable way. The analysis establishes a causal link between these representations and model output.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper hypothesizes that numeric properties are encoded in low-dimensional linear subspaces of activation space. What is the rationale behind this hypothesis and what arguments support it?

2. Partial least squares (PLS) regression is used to identify directions in activation space that correlate with numeric attributes. How exactly does PLS work and why was it chosen over other dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA? 

3. The paper finds that 2-6 PLS components are sufficient to account for 95% of the maximum goodness of fit. What does this imply about the dimensionality of the encoding of numeric properties? How does it compare to estimates of the intrinsic dimensionality of LMs?

4. Activation patching is used to establish a causal, monotonic relationship between interventions along PLS directions and changes in model output. What is the intuition behind this method and how is monotonicity quantified?

5. Results show both targeted effects and side-effects of activation patching. What could account for numeric properties sharing subspaces in some models but not others? How might side-effects be minimized?  

6. The analysis focuses on popular entities and frequent numeric properties queried in English. How might the choice of entities, properties and language impact the findings? What biases might this introduce?

7. How well do the identified representations capture the natural structure and relationships between different numeric properties? For example, are birth and death years appropriately ordered and separated?

8. The paper analyzes readouts from a single layer and token. How might probing and editing other parts of the model alter the results? Is there an optimal locus?

9. To what extent do the findings depend on model architecture, pretraining objective and dataset? Would different models learn similar monotonic representations?

10. The work focuses on observational analysis of emergent representations. Could techniques like prompting or fine-tuning encourage LMs to develop more structured, editable representations of numeric properties?
