## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- General purpose large language models (LLMs) have limitations when applied to specialized domains due to lack of domain-specific data. Obtaining quality private/sensitive datasets for specialized domains is challenging.  
- Low-resource problems suffer from insufficient data. Long-tail distributions further exacerbate the issue.

Proposed Solution - Synthetic Data Generation:
- Recent advancements allow LLMs to generate synthetic datasets that can match performance of real datasets, providing a solution for data scarcity issues.

Key Methods:
- Prompt engineering using label-specific, attribute-based prompts to constrain LLM. Enhanced with verbalizers for greater diversity.  
- Parameter-efficient tuning of LLMs with small task-specific datasets to specialize generation.
- Novel training procedures for models using synthetic data - weight tuning, temporal ensembling etc.
- Quality estimation via diversity, correctness and naturalness metrics. 

Applications:
- Synthetic datasets enable training of lighter yet still robust models, facilitating easier deployment and faster inference.
- In medical domains, synthetic data improves performance in tasks ranging from data augmentation to missing value imputation.

Challenges:
- Ensuring factual accuracy and mitigating hallucination risks in synthetic data.
- Overcoming inherent biases in underlying LLMs.
- Managing data privacy and consent issues involved in disseminating synthetic datasets.   

Future Work: 
- Developing enhanced strategies to improve reliability of synthetic datasets.
- Establishing robust policy frameworks for responsible and ethical usage of synthetic data.

In summary, recent synergistic advancements in LLMs and synthetic data generation offer solutions to long-standing data scarcity problems and low-resource challenges across domains. The paper discusses the current capabilities and limitations of this approach, along with highlighting promising pathways for future progress.
