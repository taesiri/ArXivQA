# [Mocap Everyone Everywhere: Lightweight Motion Capture With Smartwatches   and a Head-Mounted Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00847)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional motion capture systems require specialized equipment only available in lab settings, limiting accessibility and scalability. Existing wearable solutions still rely on multiple expert-level IMU sensors attached to the body. The paper aims to develop an affordable and easy-to-use motion capture system accessible to the general public without location constraints.

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents a lightweight motion capture method using only two smartwatches on the wrists and a head-mounted monocular camera. To overcome the sparsity and ambiguity of the sensor inputs, the method integrates head 6DoF poses from the camera into the motion estimation pipeline. A key contribution is an algorithm to track and update floor levels to accurately define head heights in large indoor/outdoor environments with varying terrains. 

A multi-stage Transformer regression network is proposed to estimate full-body pose from the wrist IMU and head cues. Further, a motion optimization method leverages occasional visual observations of body parts from the egocentric view to enhance accuracy. The optimization searches the latent space of a learned motion manifold to fulfill visual cues while maintaining motion quality.

Main Contributions:
1) First lightweight motion capture system using two smartwatches and a head-mounted camera, demonstrating high-quality full-body motion estimation.

2) Novel floor level tracking algorithm coupled with Transformer regression network, enabling capture in expansive and challenging outdoor environments.  

3) Motion optimization technique exploiting visual cues from egocentric observations and third-person views in multi-person capture, enhancing subtle hand and leg motions.

The method is extensively evaluated, outperforming state-of-the-arts. Qualitative results in diverse real-world scenarios highlight the accessibility, convenience and quality of the proposed solution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a lightweight and affordable motion capture method using two smartwatches and a head-mounted camera that can robustly estimate full-body pose in expansive indoor and outdoor environments by tracking floor levels and leveraging visual cues.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution can be summarized as follows:
