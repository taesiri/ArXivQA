# [Federated Learning with Instance-Dependent Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10324)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Federated Learning with Instance-Dependent Noisy Labels":

Problem Statement:
- Federated learning (FL) enables training a shared model using decentralized data from clients while preserving data privacy. However, ensuring label quality is challenging in FL compared to centralized learning where expert labels are available. 
- Existing FL methods addressing noisy labels primarily focus on class-conditional noise. But real-world noise is often instance-dependent, where a sample is mislabeled based on its content rather than class. 
- Addressing instance-dependent noise (IDN) in FL is an open challenge. Directly applying centralized IDN methods is ineffective due to small client datasets and heterogeneity.

Proposed Solution: FedBeat
- Key idea: Construct an instance-dependent noise transition matrix (IDNTM) to map clean labels to noisy labels. This allows training a statistically consistent classifier. 
- Has 3 synergistic federated steps:
   1) Extract high-confidence pseudo-labeled data using Bayesian model ensembles
   2) Collaboratively train an IDNTM estimation network on the extracted dataset
   3) Enhance global model by correcting loss using estimated IDNTM
- The IDNTM network generates a transition matrix for each instance, representing probability of transition from ground-truth labels to noisy labels.
- Using IDNTM in reverse adjusts output distribution to approximate clean labels and improves model accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- First work to address the practical issue of IDN in federated learning
- Propose FedBeat method with 3 novel components tailored for IDN in FL 
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets
- Provides insights on impact of key hyperparameters like model ensembles and thresholds

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in addressing the open challenge of instance-dependent label noise in federated learning by proposing an innovative three-step federated solution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of FedBeat over existing methods.
