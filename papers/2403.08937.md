# [Bugs in Large Language Models Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08937)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) for code generation like GitHub Copilot are gaining popularity, but the bugs in the code they generate have not been thoroughly examined. 
- It is important to understand the characteristics and prevalence of bugs in LLM-generated code as these models are increasingly used to assist developers.
- Prior work has not systematically analyzed the bug patterns occurring in code generated by LLMs for real-world programming tasks.

Methodology:
- The authors empirically studied 333 buggy code samples generated by 3 leading LLMs (CodeGen, PanGu-Coder, Codex) using 230 Python programming tasks from real-world GitHub projects.
- They manually analyzed the samples to identify distinctive bug patterns using an open coding methodology with multiple raters. 
- They organized the identified bug patterns into a taxonomy with 10 categories like "Misinterpretations", "Missing Corner Cases", "Hallucinated Object".
- They validated the taxonomy using a survey of 34 LLM practitioners and researchers.

Key Findings:
- Identified 10 major bug pattern categories occurring in LLM code with different prevalence. Misinterpretations of prompts and Missing Corner Cases are most common.  
- Some categories like Hallucinated Objects are less common in human code.
- Bug patterns are evenly distributed across tasks and runnable dependency levels.
- Survey validated taxonomy - respondents encountered and acknowledged all 10 patterns. Patterns are different than human developer bugs.
- Misinterpretations and Missing Corner Cases are harder to diagnose/fix and most similar to human bugs.

Contributions:
- First taxonomy of bug patterns in LLM code based on real-world tasks
- Insights into prevalence and characteristics of bugs in LLM code
- Validation via practitioner survey
- Replication package with all data and artifacts

The paper sheds light on properties of bugs in LLM code to guide developing quality assurance techniques tailored for LLM code.
