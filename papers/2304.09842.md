# [Chameleon: Plug-and-Play Compositional Reasoning with Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09842)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we augment large language models (LLMs) with the capability to automatically compose external tools in a flexible, plug-and-play manner in order to tackle complex reasoning tasks? The key hypothesis appears to be: By prompting an LLM-based natural language planner with descriptions and examples of various tools, the LLM will be able to generate programs that select and sequence appropriate tools to effectively solve complex reasoning problems across different domains and modalities.Specifically, the paper introduces a framework called Chameleon that integrates tools like additional LLM models, vision models, search engines, Python functions, etc. into a modular inventory. An LLM then acts as a natural language planner to generate tool sequences/programs based on the task instructions and examples. The central premise is that this approach will enhance the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4 in a generalizable way.The paper tests this hypothesis by evaluating Chameleon on two diverse reasoning tasks - ScienceQA (multimodal question answering) and TabMWP (mathematical reasoning with tables). The results demonstrate that Chameleon with GPT-4 significantly outperforms prior published approaches on both benchmarks, supporting the potential of their method for augmenting LLMs via flexible tool composition.In summary, the key research question is how to effectively augment LLMs by prompting them to integrate tools in a plug-and-play and automatic way, with the hypothesis that this will enhance complex reasoning across tasks. The paper introduces Chameleon to test this hypothesis, with promising results on two benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new framework called \model~that augments large language models (LLMs) with the ability to perform compositional reasoning by integrating external tools in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, the key aspects of the contribution are:- Developing a plug-and-play compositional reasoning framework called \model~that addresses limitations of current LLMs like the inability to access real-time information or perform mathematical reasoning. - \model~synthesizes programs to compose various tools including other LLMs, vision models, web search, Python functions, and rule-based modules. This allows it to tackle a diverse range of reasoning tasks.- At the core of \model~is an LLM-based natural language planner that determines the appropriate sequence of tools to execute to generate the final response to a given query.- Showcasing the effectiveness of \model~by significantly improving performance over prior methods on two challenging multi-modal QA datasets - ScienceQA and TabMWP.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a comparison of this paper with other related work in natural language processing:- This work proposes a novel framework called Chameleon for plug-and-play compositional reasoning using large language models (LLMs). It allows composing multiple external tools such as search engines, knowledge bases, and vision models in a seamless way to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. - Most prior work on incorporating external knowledge into LLMs has focused on using a single tool like a knowledge base (e.g., WebGPT) or computer vision models (e.g., VisualGPT). Chameleon is more comprehensive in the diversity of tools it can leverage.- Some recent papers have explored compositional reasoning frameworks but have relied on task-specific prompts or program synthesis methods that require training. Chameleon uses a natural language planner based on an LLM that can generalize across tasks without training.- Chameleon demonstrates strong performance on two challenging reasoning benchmarks - ScienceQA and TabMWP. On ScienceQA, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among few-shot models, surpassing prior work by over 10%. This showcases its ability to effectively compose tools for multi-modal reasoning.- The plug-and-play nature of Chameleon makes it more flexible and extensible than prior work. New tools and capabilities can be readily incorporated by updating the module inventory and natural language prompts.- Overall, Chameleon represents an important step towards developing more adaptive and capable LLMs by combining their strengths with external tools in a dynamic way. The principle of compositional reasoning is likely to be increasingly important as LLMs are deployed in real-world applications.In summary, Chameleon distinguishes itself by its plug-and-play design, lack of training, strong benchmark performance, and potential for integrating diverse reasoning skills into LLMs. It points the way towards more flexible, capable, and human-like reasoning with artificial intelligence systems.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces Chameleon, a plug-and-play compositional reasoning framework that augments large language models (LLMs) with the ability to effectively compose external tools to address their inherent limitations. Chameleon consists of two key components: a module inventory containing various tools like LLMs, vision models, web search engines, Python functions, and rule-based modules; and an LLM-based natural language planner that generates programs by sequencing tools from the inventory to solve complex reasoning tasks.

During execution, each module processes the input, returns an output, and updates the context for subsequent modules.
