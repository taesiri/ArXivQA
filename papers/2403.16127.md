# [WangchanLion and WangchanX MRC Eval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16127)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces WangchanLion, an open-source Thai language model for question answering. It is based on the SEA-LION model and fine-tuned on Thai instruction following datasets to enhance its capabilities for machine reading comprehension (MRC).

The motivation is to address gaps in existing models like limited knowledge transferability to low-resource languages like Thai and lack of data transparency. SEA-LION was chosen as the base model as it has a good-sized Thai vocabulary and was pretrained on open datasets.

WangchanLion is tuned using supervised fine-tuning on Thai and English instruction datasets totaling over 130 million tokens. The data sources are clearly documented for reproducibility. Optimization uses parameter-efficient tuning via QLoRa.

The evaluation focuses on MRC capabilities. It proposes an enhanced scheme beyond the traditional extractive QA metrics like F1 score. The new method has 4 yes/no questions to judge correctness, helpfulness, conciseness and contextuality of answers.

Experiments on XQuAD and other datasets first benchmark WangchanLion using F1, showing superior results over baselines. Further human evaluation and automated LLM-based evaluation provide a more holistic assessment. Comparisons are done with OpenThaiGPT, SeaLLMs and other models.

Key conclusions are around the tradeoffs between concise, correct responses and helpful, contextual ones. Future work will focus on improving relevance while minimizing extraneous information. The code and model are publicly released to enable reproducibility.
