# [Unknown Sample Discovery for Source Free Open Set Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03767)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Open set domain adaptation (OSDA) aims to adapt a model trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. The target domain has both classes from the source domain (known classes) and novel classes not present in the source (unknown classes). 
- Existing methods require access to the source data during adaptation or the entire target data to separate known/unknown samples. 
- The goal is to develop a source-free OSDA (SF-OSDA) method that can identify unknown samples in the target domain without requiring the source data or access to the full target data during inference.

Proposed Solution: Unknown Sample Discovery (USD)
- Uses a teacher-student framework with dual models for co-training and temporal ensembling.
- Conducts multi-view augmentation to generate reliable pseudolabels for target data using ensemble of weak & strong augmentations.  
- Separates known and unknown samples using Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) between pseudolabels and teacher predictions. Models JSD distribution with 2-component GMM.
- Adapts student model to target domain over all classes using co-training losses (consistency loss, triplet loss), curriculum learning, and information maximization.
- Adds an unknown class output node to classify samples as known or unknown. Does not require full target set access during inference.

Main Contributions:
- First SF-OSDA method to utilize co-training for known-unknown split to mitigate error accumulation 
- Uses curriculum guidance to focus adaptation on known classes first and then expand to unknown space
- Novel use of JSD to model separation between clean and noisy (unknown) target samples
- Competitive with state-of-the-art OSDA methods that have access to source data
- Reduced need for access to full target dataset during post-adaptation inference phase

In summary, USD is the first source-free open set domain adaptation technique to use co-training to reliably conduct known versus unknown sample discovery in the target domain for robust adaptation. It expands the model with an unknown class output and does not require access to the full target data during inference. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over existing methods.
