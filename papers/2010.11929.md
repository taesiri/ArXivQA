# [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at   Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that pure vision transformers (ViTs) can match or exceed the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on image recognition tasks when pre-trained at sufficient scale and transferred to downstream tasks. 

The key claims are:

- ViTs, despite having less built-in inductive bias for images compared to CNNs, can learn to perform very well on image recognition through large-scale pre-training.

- With large datasets (14M-300M images), ViTs can overcome the limitations from lack of translation equivariance and locality that are inherent in CNNs.

- When pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet-21k and JFT-300M and transferred to smaller benchmarks, ViTs can match or exceed state-of-the-art CNNs on tasks like ImageNet, CIFAR, and VTAB.

- ViTs have excellent computational efficiency and scalability compared to CNNs, achieving strong performance with substantially lower training cost.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that pure transformers can excel at image recognition through large-scale pre-training, despite their lack of inductive biases inherent in CNNs. The key innovation is showing that this works empirically across various datasets and model scales.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a vision transformer (ViT) model that applies transformers directly to sequences of image patches for image recognition. The key findings are:

- ViT models attain excellent results when pre-trained at sufficient scale and transferred to image recognition tasks with fewer data points.

- When pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet-21k or JFT-300M, ViT achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple image classification benchmarks, outperforming convolutional neural networks. 

- ViT requires substantially fewer computational resources for pre-training compared to CNN models like EfficientNet and ResNets.

- ViT lacks inductive biases inherent in CNNs like translation equivariance and locality. But with large-scale pre-training, ViT can learn the relevant patterns directly from data without relying much on these inductive biases.

- Analysis shows ViT uses self-attention to integrate information globally across the image in the early layers. The pre-trained positional embeddings also capture the 2D image structure.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that pure transformers applied directly on image patches can achieve excellent image recognition performance with efficient pre-training, if trained at sufficient scale. This opens up new directions for applying self-attention models in computer vision.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Vision Transformer (ViT), a pure transformer model applied directly to image patches, which achieves excellent performance on image classification tasks when pre-trained at large scale, matching or exceeding state-of-the-art convolutional networks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel approach to image recognition using Vision Transformers (ViT). Here are some key points comparing it to prior work:

- Most prior work on applying transformers to computer vision uses them in conjunction with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). For example, adding transformer layers on top of a CNN backbone, or replacing certain components of a CNN with self-attention. This paper shows transformers can work well on images even without any CNN components.

- Previous work exploring pure transformers for images relied on complex modified attention mechanisms like sparse attention or axial attention. This was done to reduce the quadratic complexity of full self-attention. This paper shows a standard transformer with regular full self-attention can work well when applied to a sequence of image patches. 

- The paper shows transformers can match or exceed state-of-the-art ResNets on image classification tasks when pretrained on large datasets like ImageNet-21k or JFT-300M. Prior work found transformers generally underperformed CNNs when trained from scratch on datasets like ImageNet.

- The paper demonstrates excellent transfer learning performance from large pretrained ViTs to multiple mid-sized image classification benchmarks. This shows ViT can serve as a general purpose feature extractor competitive with CNNs.

- The paper shows transformers have more favorable scaling properties compared to CNNs, allowing training very large models (e.g. ViT-Huge) efficiently. Most prior work focused on scaling up CNN architectures.

In summary, this paper pushes the boundaries on directly applying transformers to images without specialized modifications or CNN components. The key innovation is showing standard transformers can work extremely well given large-scale pretraining data. It opens up a new promising direction for image recognition compared to established CNN architectures.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying Vision Transformers to other computer vision tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection and segmentation. The authors note that their results, along with those in the DETR paper, indicate the promise of this approach.

- Exploring self-supervised pre-training methods for Vision Transformers. The authors show some initial experiments with masked patch prediction that demonstrate improvements over training from scratch, but there is still a large gap compared to supervised pre-training. Methods like contrastive learning may help close this gap.

- Continued scaling of Vision Transformers to even larger models and datasets. The authors note their models do not seem to be saturating yet within the range explored, indicating there are likely gains from further scaling.

- Analysis of the low-data fine-tuning properties of Vision Transformers. The authors show promising results on the low-data VTAB tasks, suggesting Vision Transformers may have advantages in few-shot transfer scenarios that warrant further study.

- Applying axial attention mechanisms to Vision Transformers. The authors show some initial experiments indicating benefits, but note efficient implementations are needed to scale this approach.

- Analysis and visualization of attention patterns to better understand how Vision Transformers process images internally. The authors provide some initial analysis but further work is needed.

In summary, the main directions are 1) applying Vision Transformers to other vision tasks, 2) exploring self-supervised pre-training, 3) scaling models to even larger sizes, 4) analyzing few-shot learning properties, 5) incorporating axial attention, and 6) further analysis of internal representations. The authors lay out an exciting research agenda for building on this work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores using Transformer architectures, which have become standard in natural language processing tasks, for image recognition. They apply a standard Transformer directly to sequences of image patches, with minimal modifications, and show it performs well on image classification when pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet-21K or JFT-300M and then fine-tuned on smaller benchmarks. The Vision Transformer (ViT) matches or exceeds state-of-the-art convolutional networks on tasks like ImageNet, CIFAR, and VTAB, while requiring substantially less compute resources for pre-training. The pure transformer lacks many CNN inductive biases like translation equivariance and locality, but large-scale training enables it to learn the patterns directly from data. Analyses show ViT progressively integrates information across broader spatial regions, and attention maps correlate with image semantics. The results demonstrate the power of Transformer architectures coupled with pre-training for computer vision, opening promising directions for self-supervised pre-training, transferring to other vision tasks, and further model scaling.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Vision Transformer (ViT), a model that applies the transformer architecture commonly used in natural language processing directly to image recognition tasks. Unlike prior work, ViT does not use convolutional neural networks and thus lacks many of the typical inductive biases used in computer vision models. The authors split an image into fixed-size patches which are treated like tokens in an NLP application. These patch embeddings are combined with position embeddings and fed into a standard transformer encoder. Pre-training on large datasets like ImageNet-21K and JFT-300M enables ViT to match or exceed state-of-the-art convolutional networks on image classification benchmarks like ImageNet and CIFAR while using substantially less compute to train. Without large-scale pre-training, ViT generally underperforms convolutional models, indicating the importance of large datasets to learning appropriate visual representations without built-in inductive biases. However, with sufficient pre-training data, ViT models beat convolutional models of comparable size. The best ViT model achieves 88.55% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, outperforming a similarly sized ResNet baseline by over 1%.

In summary, this work shows that Transformers can achieve excellent performance on image recognition tasks when trained at sufficient scale, demonstrating that a pure transformer applied to image patches can match or beat convolutional models. The results highlight the potential of Transformers to unify computer vision and natural language processing using a single algorithmic approach. Further work is needed to determine if the same holds for other vision tasks and to develop improved self-supervised pre-training methods akin to BERT.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a Transformer-based model called Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification. The key aspects of the method are:

- Images are split into fixed-size patches, which are linearly embedded. The resulting sequence of patch embeddings is treated similar to a sentence in language modeling. 

- A standard Transformer encoder architecture is applied on top of the patch embeddings. This consists of alternating multi-head self-attention and MLP blocks, with residual connections, layer normalization and positional embeddings.

- The model is trained on large datasets like JFT-300M or ImageNet-21k via supervised pre-training on image classification. The pre-trained model can then be transferred to smaller datasets by replacing the head.

- Without substantial dataset-specific tuning, ViT matches or exceeds state-of-the-art convolutional networks on many image recognition benchmarks, whilst requiring less compute to train. This suggests the Transformer is a promising architecture for computer vision.

In summary, the core innovation is applying a standard Transformer directly on image patches in a straightforward way, showing strong performance when pre-trained at sufficient scale. The model makes minimal assumptions about the 2D image structure.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of how to effectively apply Transformer models to computer vision tasks. Specifically, it investigates using a standard Transformer architecture directly on image patches for image recognition, rather than relying on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are currently dominant in computer vision. 

The key questions the paper seeks to address are:

- Can a pure Transformer architecture work well for image recognition when applied directly to image patches, without CNN components or task-specific inductive biases?

- How does Transformer performance compare to CNNs as model size and pre-training data scale up?

- Do Transformers require more pre-training data than CNNs to overcome their lack of built-in inductive biases?

- Can Transformers match or exceed state-of-the-art CNN performance on image recognition benchmarks when pre-trained at sufficient scale?

In summary, the paper examines if the power of large scale pre-training can allow Transformers to overcome their lack of CNN-like inductive biases and effectively learn visual representations directly from image patches. The results demonstrate Transformers are highly competitive or better than CNNs given sufficient pre-training data.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Vision Transformer (ViT), a pure transformer model directly applied to image patches for image recognition. Unlike prior works that combined convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers, ViT relies only on standard transformers with minimal modifications for computer vision tasks. The image is split into patches which are flattened and linearly embedded. These patch embeddings along with positional embeddings are then fed into a standard transformer encoder. For image classification, a classification token is added to the sequence.

The key finding is that while CNNs have inherent inductive biases useful for image recognition like translation equivariance, ViT can match or exceed state-of-the-art convolutional models when trained at sufficient scale with large datasets like ImageNet-21k and JFT-300M. Without the inductive biases, ViT requires more data than CNNs to generalize well. But with large-scale pre-training, the pure transformer model surpasses ResNets of comparable size on image classification benchmarks like ImageNet and CIFAR. 

The paper demonstrates the power of transformers for computer vision when applied directly at scale. With model sizes up to 632M parameters and pre-training data up to 300M images, ViT attains excellent transfer learning performance. The global connectivity of the self-attention layers allows ViT models to build useful representations from images. With further scaling and more advanced pre-training methods like contrastive learning, direct application of transformers to images remains a promising approach for computer vision.
