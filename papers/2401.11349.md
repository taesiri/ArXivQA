## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Controlling flexible fish fins and optimizing their propulsive performance remains challenging due to the highly nonlinear fluid-structure interaction (FSI) dynamics and high-dimensional actuation parameter spaces.  
- Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) shows promise for handling such complexity but faces barriers due to the computational expense of simulating FSI dynamics for every trial-and-error iteration.

Proposed Solution
- The authors develop an Asynchronous Parallel Training (APT) strategy to enhance DRL training efficiency by fully decoupling environment simulation from neural network optimization and allowing them to run asynchronously.  
- APT optimizes heterogeneous hardware utilization by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks between CPUs (running simulations) and GPUs (updating networks).

Contributions
- APT is applied to learn optimal control policies for fish fin-ray actuation targeted at maximizing thrust and propulsive efficiency using DRL.
- For maximizing efficiency, a "Global Search and Local Fine-tuning" reward formulation is introduced to approximate the non-additive nature of efficiency.
- Results show APT yields 86.6% better thrust compared to the best parametric control baseline and matches the peak efficiency, validating its ability to discover complex optimal policies from scratch.
- Comprehensive analyses benchmarking APT against conventional DRL training demonstrates over an order of magnitude speedup, highlighting the significantly enhanced sample efficiency and parallelizability.

In summary, this paper makes key contributions in accelerating DRL for complex FSI control problems by proposing an asynchronous parallel training strategy to optimize heterogeneous hardware usage. The techniques enable DRL, for the first time, to learn non-trivial control policies on flexible fish fin-ray actuation directly from high-fidelity physics simulations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces an asynchronous parallel training strategy for deep reinforcement learning to efficiently optimize intricate control policies for fin-ray actuation in fish propulsion by fully decoupling fluid-structure interaction simulations from neural network optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes two key contributions:

1. It proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) training strategy called "Asynchronous Parallel Training" (APT) that is designed to accelerate off-policy DRL in computationally demanding environments like fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations. APT enables asynchronous and parallelized operations between CPUs (for environment simulation) and GPUs (for network training) to improve training efficiency and leverage heterogeneous computing resources. 

2. The paper demonstrates the application of APT for optimizing control strategies of fin-ray actuation in fish to maximize thrust and propulsion efficiency. It combines APT with a "Global Searching and Local Fine-tuning" technique to handle the challenge of non-additive efficiency objectives. Results show APT can find better control policies than baseline methods, achieving 86.6% higher thrust and comparable efficiency to the best sinusoidal actuation pattern found through grid search.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) a new APT strategy to accelerate DRL training by asynchronous parallelization, and (2) application of APT+GSLF for optimizing bioinspired fin-ray propulsion, demonstrating performance improvements over baselines. The proposed methods help tackle challenges in using DRL for complex FSI control problems.
