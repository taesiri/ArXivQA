# [Regret Analysis of Policy Optimization over Submanifolds for Linearly   Constrained Online LQG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08553)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of online linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control with a linear constraint imposed on the controller. In online LQG problems, the cost matrices (Q_t, R_t) are unknown beforehand and revealed sequentially over time. Existing approaches parameterize the control policy as a linear function of states, which results in dense control gains that may violate practical constraints like sparsity. This work aims to develop an online adaptive controller that satisfies a given linear constraint while achieving low regret compared to a sequence of greedy constrained policies.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an optimistic online Newton method on manifold (OONM) for this problem. The key ideas are:

1) Formulate it as online optimization over a manifold of stable controllers. Equip this manifold with a Riemannian metric that captures the geometry of the optimal control problem. 

2) Perform optimistic updates - both a correction step using the current cost, and an optimistic step using predicted next cost. The Hessian operators are defined using the Riemannian connection to respect the geometry.

3) Measure performance by regret against a changing sequence of locally optimal constrained controllers. 

Main Contributions:

- Formulates linearly constrained online LQG as optimization over manifold and introduces appropriate Riemannian metric and connections.

- Develops an optimistic online Newton method that leverages predictions and corrects based on true costs received.

- Provides dynamic regret analysis against a sequence of greedy optimizers. Regret scales with the path-length of optimizers and prediction errors.

- Demonstrates the benefit of using manifold geometry via simulations, compared to Euclidean methods like gradient descent.

In summary, the paper develops a geometrically principled optimistic online control algorithm for handling practical constraints in time-varying LQG problems, with strong dynamic regret guarantees.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an online control algorithm called optimistic online Newton on manifold (OONM) for linearly constrained online LQG problems, leveraging predictions on cost functions and exploiting the underlying geometry of the control policy space to achieve sublinear dynamic regret bounds.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. For linearly constrained online LQG control problems, the authors propose an online second order method called "optimistic online Newton on manifold" (OONM) which makes predictions on the cost functions and uses a Riemannian metric derived from the optimal control problem to better capture the geometry.

2. Instead of comparing to a fixed controller, the regret is defined against a sequence of locally minimizing linear controllers. A dynamic regret bound is presented for OONM in terms of the path length of the minimizer sequence and the prediction mismatch. 

3. Simulation results are provided that demonstrate the superiority of OONM compared to using the Euclidean metric and projected gradient descent.

In summary, the main novelty is in developing an online optimization algorithm that can handle linear constraints on the controllers by leveraging techniques from Riemannian optimization and predictions to achieve a sublinear dynamic regret bound. The constrained online LQG setup and analysis seem to be novel contributions.

In summary, this paper proposes an online control algorithm called "optimistic online Newton on manifold" (OONM) for linearly constrained online LQG problems. It uses predictions on cost functions and a Riemannian metric approach adapted from recent offline LQR research. The performance of OONM is analyzed through dynamic regret bounds quantified in terms of the path-length of the comparator controller sequence.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an "optimistic" online Newton method on manifolds (OONM) for linearly constrained online LQG problems. How is the "optimism" incorporated and why is it helpful for the regret bound? 

2. The OONM method leverages predictions of the cost function sequence. What specific predictions are made and how are they utilized in the algorithm? How does the accuracy of these predictions affect the regret bound?

3. The regret bound for OONM involves a term for the path length of the comparator sequence. Intuitively, why does this path length matter for a dynamic regret analysis? 

4. The paper defines the regret against a sequence of locally minimizing linear policies. What are the advantages/disadvantages of this definition compared to using a fixed comparator policy?

5. How is the Riemannian metric defined in this paper and why is it suitable for capturing the geometry of the policy optimization problem? How does this metric affect the Hessian computations?

6. Explain the stability conditions that are required for the regret analysis. How do these impact the selection of step sizes in the algorithm? 

7. One of the assumptions requires the initial policy to be close to the first minimizer. Why is this assumption needed and how does it limit the general applicability of the method?

8. How do the smoothness assumptions on the cost functions and system dynamics affect the regret rates derived in the paper? What happens if these assumptions are violated?

9. The regret bound has terms involving prediction errors on the first and second-order information. How do these errors propagate as the algorithm runs and affect the overall performance?

10. How amenable is the proposed method to distributed implementation across multiple agents? What modifications would be needed?
