# [Regret Analysis of Policy Optimization over Submanifolds for Linearly   Constrained Online LQG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08553)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of online linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control with a linear constraint imposed on the controller. In online LQG problems, the cost matrices (Q_t, R_t) are unknown beforehand and revealed sequentially over time. Existing approaches parameterize the control policy as a linear function of states, which results in dense control gains that may violate practical constraints like sparsity. This work aims to develop an online adaptive controller that satisfies a given linear constraint while achieving low regret compared to a sequence of greedy constrained policies.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an optimistic online Newton method on manifold (OONM) for this problem. The key ideas are:

1) Formulate it as online optimization over a manifold of stable controllers. Equip this manifold with a Riemannian metric that captures the geometry of the optimal control problem. 

2) Perform optimistic updates - both a correction step using the current cost, and an optimistic step using predicted next cost. The Hessian operators are defined using the Riemannian connection to respect the geometry.

3) Measure performance by regret against a changing sequence of locally optimal constrained controllers. 

Main Contributions:

- Formulates linearly constrained online LQG as optimization over manifold and introduces appropriate Riemannian metric and connections.

- Develops an optimistic online Newton method that leverages predictions and corrects based on true costs received.

- Provides dynamic regret analysis against a sequence of greedy optimizers. Regret scales with the path-length of optimizers and prediction errors.

- Demonstrates the benefit of using manifold geometry via simulations, compared to Euclidean methods like gradient descent.

In summary, the paper develops a geometrically principled optimistic online control algorithm for handling practical constraints in time-varying LQG problems, with strong dynamic regret guarantees.
