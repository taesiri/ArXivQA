# [A Data-Driven Autopilot for Fixed-Wing Aircraft Based on Model   Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00352)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Autopilots for fixed-wing aircraft typically rely on linearized aerodynamic models obtained from wind-tunnel testing. This requires extensive modeling and testing.
- In cases where the aerodynamics are unknown or changing, e.g. due to icing or damage, these model-based autopilots may not perform well.
- Hence, there is a need for an adaptive autopilot that can handle unmodeled aerodynamics and learn in-flight.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an autopilot based on Predictive Cost Adaptive Control (PCAC), which combines model predictive control (MPC) with online system identification.
- PCAC uses Recursive Least Squares (RLS) with variable-rate forgetting for online identification of an input-output model representing the aircraft dynamics.
- The identified model is used within a receding-horizon MPC optimization to calculate the control inputs. 
- No prior aerodynamic modeling or offline data collection is required.

Contributions:
- The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of PCAC as an adaptive autopilot using numerical simulations of (a) a linear 6DOF aircraft model and (b) a nonlinear 3DOF model.
- For both models, PCAC is able to achieve command following of altitude, bank angle, azimuth angle, and airspeed signals, without any modeling or gain scheduling.
- This shows the potential of PCAC to accelerate aircraft/autopilot design by avoiding extensive wind tunnel tests.
- The paper also highlights the ability of PCAC to handle changing/unmodeled conditions during flight.

In summary, the paper proposes PCAC as a novel model-based adaptive autopilot for fixed-wing aircraft that can potentially simplify aircraft design and enable adaptation to changing conditions. The lack of reliance on aerodynamic modeling is the main distinction from typical autopilot designs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an adaptive autopilot for fixed-wing aircraft based on predictive cost adaptive control, which combines recursive least squares-based system identification with model predictive control to achieve command following without reliance on aerodynamic modeling or wind tunnel testing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and demonstrating a novel adaptive autopilot for fixed-wing aircraft based on predictive cost adaptive control (PCAC). Specifically:

- PCAC combines online system identification using recursive least squares (RLS) with variable-rate forgetting and model predictive control (MPC) for receding-horizon optimization. This allows the autopilot to learn and adapt to unknown or changing aircraft dynamics.

- The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of PCAC numerically by controlling both a 6DOF linearized aircraft model and a 3DOF nonlinear aircraft model without any prior aerodynamic modeling or offline data collection. PCAC is able to achieve command following for altitude, bank angle, azimuth angle, and airspeed.

- The adaptive nature of PCAC has useful practical implications, including reducing the need for extensive wind tunnel testing, gain scheduling, dynamic inversion, and mitigating the time-consuming aircraft/autopilot design cycle.

- This is the first study to investigate PCAC as a completely data-driven adaptive autopilot. The results showcase the potential of PCAC to enable embedded control of fixed-wing autonomous aircraft under significant uncertainty.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and initial feasibility study of PCAC as an adaptive learning autopilot for fixed-wing aircraft that does not rely on any prior modeling.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Predictive cost adaptive control (PCAC): The adaptive model predictive control method proposed in the paper for aircraft autopilots. It combines recursive least squares system identification with model predictive control.

- Recursive least squares (RLS): The online system identification method used in PCAC to estimate an input-output model of the aircraft dynamics. Uses variable forgetting factors.

- Model predictive control (MPC): The underlying model-based control method used in PCAC. Performs receding horizon optimization based on a model.

- Fixed-wing aircraft: The type of aircraft considered in the case studies. The autopilot must control attitudes, altitudes etc.

- Longitudinal/lateral dynamics: The aircraft dynamics are divided into longitudinal (pitch) and lateral (roll/yaw) modes. Separate PCAC loops control each one.

- Linearized model: A linear 6 DOF aircraft model from Athena Vortex Lattice software is used in one case study.

- Nonlinear model: A nonlinear 3 DOF aircraft model from the MATLAB aerospace toolbox is used in another case study.

- Cold-start: The PCAC autopilots are initialized with no prior model information, demonstrating a "cold-start" adaptive control capability.
