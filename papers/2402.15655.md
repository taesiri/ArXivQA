# [Contact Complexity in Customer Service](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15655)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Routing customer service contacts to agents of appropriate seniority level is challenging. Sending complex issues to junior agents leads to poor experiences, while sending simple issues to senior agents is costly.
- Defining the "complexity" of a contact is difficult as there is no standard method. Getting humans to annotate thousands of examples is time-consuming and expensive.  

Proposed Solution:
- Train an "AI expert" model to mimic senior agents by predicting standardized issue codes (SIC) for contacts. 
- Define contact complexity based on the AI expert's uncertainty, length of contact, and skill required. High complexity has high uncertainty, length and skill; low complexity has the opposite.
- Formalize the concepts of uncertainty, length and skill into mathematical definitions of entropy, sentence count, and a "skillfulness" metric based on model ensemble boosting.
- Combine the metrics into a single "complexity score" that ranges from 0 to 1 after normalization and transformations.

Main Contributions:
- A novel unsupervised method to define contact complexity without need for human annotation
- Mathematical formalization to convert conceptual complexity attributes into defined metrics 
- Demonstration that intermediate steps in model boosting can provide insights into data complexity
- Approach validated both indirectly (resolution/transfer rates) and directly (human labeling)

Proposed Application:
- Use complexity score to route incoming contacts - low scores to junior agents, high scores to seniors. Medium scores use existing product-based routing.
