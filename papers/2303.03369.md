# [Multimodal Prompting with Missing Modalities for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03369)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we make multimodal transformers robust to missing modalities during training and testing, while avoiding the need to finetune the entire heavy model?

The key points related to this question appear to be:

- Multimodal transformers require complete multimodal data during both training and testing for optimal performance. However, in real-world scenarios, some modalities may be missing due to various constraints. 

- Finetuning the entire heavy pretrained transformer model on new datasets is computationally expensive and often infeasible.

- The paper proposes using "missing-aware prompts" that can be plugged into a pretrained multimodal transformer to make it robust to missing modalities, without needing to finetune the entire model.

- The prompts can provide conditioning for different missing modality cases and require training only a very small fraction of the model's parameters.

- Experiments show the proposed prompting method improves performance on tasks with missing modalities, while requiring less than 1% of the model parameters to be trained.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that missing-aware prompts can efficiently adapt multimodal transformers to handle missing modalities during training and inference, avoiding costly finetuning of the full model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes a framework to handle two key challenges in multimodal learning: dealing with missing modalities during training and/or testing, and avoiding the need to finetune the entire heavyweight pre-trained model. 

- It introduces the concept of "missing-aware prompts" that can be plugged into pretrained multimodal transformers like ViLT to make them robust to missing modalities. Only the prompts need to be trained, not the entire model, making this approach very efficient.

- It explores two designs for integrating the missing-aware prompts: input-level and attention-level prompting. It analyzes the trade-offs between these two approaches.

- It conducts extensive experiments on three multimodal classification tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the missing-aware prompts can substantially improve performance under various missing modality conditions, while only requiring less than 1% of the full model's parameters.

In summary, the key contribution is a simple yet effective prompting-based method to make multimodal transformers robust to missing modalities during training or inference, without the computational burden of full model fine-tuning. The concept of conditional missing-aware prompts is novel.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on handling missing modalities in multimodal learning, which is an important practical issue but has been less explored compared to multimodal fusion techniques. Many prior works assume complete multimodal data is available. 

- The paper proposes a simple yet effective approach of using prompt learning to make multimodal models robust to missing modalities, without finetuning the full model. This makes it more computationally efficient than methods requiring full model finetuning.

- The experiments show the approach works well across different missing modality scenarios during training and testing. Many prior works only consider missing modalities at test time. Evaluating on missing data in both phases is a more realistic and challenging problem setting.

- The ablation studies provide useful insights on how prompt design choices like location and length impact robustness. The input-level vs attention-level prompt attachments demonstrate interesting tradeoffs between performance and stability.

- Compared to the concurrent work of Ma et al. (MMIN, 2022) which also handles missing modalities, this paper's approach and problem scope are different. MMIN focuses on learning joint multimodal representations to predict missing modalities, while this work uses prompts to make predictions robust to missing modalities without regenerating them.

- For limitations, the method doesn't actually recover the missing modal information, and may not scale as well to settings with many modalities due to the quadratic growth in prompts. Future work on generative modeling or prompt pooling could help address these limitations.

Overall, the simple prompting approach, thorough experiments, and analysis in this paper provide a nice contribution and comparison point to literature on handling missing modalities in multimodal learning. The results demonstrate prompts are a promising technique for this problem.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from this paper:

This paper proposes using modality-missing-aware prompts that can be plugged into multimodal transformers to handle general missing-modality cases during training or testing, requiring only a small fraction of trainable parameters compared to finetuning the entire model.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing cross-modal generative models to help recover missing information from incomplete multimodal inputs. The authors note that their prompt-based approach does not actually generate or fill in missing modalities, so generative modeling could be a promising direction.

- Exploring prompt learning techniques to handle scenarios with more than two modalities. The authors mention that naively extending their approach could lead to a quadratic growth in the number of prompts needed. They suggest ideas like prompt pooling could help alleviate this issue.

- Studying how to adapt the prompting mechanisms to new datasets and tasks more efficiently. The authors currently learn separate prompts per dataset/task, but transferring prompts or more generalizable prompting approaches could be investigated. 

- Scaling up the evaluations to larger pretrained models and datasets. The authors use ViLT as the pretrained model, but evaluating with models with billions of parameters could better showcase the efficiency benefits of prompt tuning.

- Analyzing how the design of prompts affects what is being learned by the model. The authors empirically study prompt configurations but do not deeply analyze what is being encoded in the prompts.

- Adding capabilities for online/continual learning with missing modalities over time. The current work focuses on static training sets, but prompting may lend itself well to incremental learning scenarios.

In summary, the main future directions are improving missing modality handling, scaling up prompts, analyzing prompt learning, and extending to more complex training scenarios. The authors lay good groundwork and provide results motivating these research avenues.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a method to improve the robustness of multimodal transformers to missing modalities during training and testing, without requiring heavy model finetuning. The authors introduce "missing-aware prompts" that can be plugged into pretrained transformers to handle different missing modality cases (e.g. missing text or missing image). The prompts are assigned based on the missing modality pattern and attached to multiple layers in the transformer. Only the prompts, pooler layer, and classifier layers need to be trained, keeping the pretrained transformer frozen. Two prompt designs are explored - input-level and attention-level prompting. Experiments on multimodal classification tasks show the method improves performance over baselines substantially when modalities are missing, using only 0.2% additional parameters. The input-level prompting generally works better but attention-level prompting is less sensitive in some cases. Overall, the proposed prompting framework provides an efficient way to make multimodal transformers more robust to missing modalities without expensive model finetuning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to make multimodal transformers more robust to missing modalities during training or testing, without requiring heavy finetuning of the entire model. The key idea is to use "missing-aware prompts" that provide conditioning instructions to the transformer based on which modalities are present or missing in the input data. The prompts are only attached to a subset of the transformer layers near the input, requiring less than 1% of the model parameters to be trainable. Experiments on multimodal classification datasets show that this prompting approach improves performance over just training the output layers, especially when modalities are missing in the test data. The method also reduces compute requirements compared to full model finetuning.

The authors explore prompt designs at the input embedding level versus the self-attention level, finding tradeoffs between performance and stability. Attachment to early transformer layers is most effective since modality distinctions are stronger there. Prompt length must be balanced, with longer prompts improving results but also increasing sensitivity. Overall, this prompting approach effectively handles missing modalities in multimodal transformers, adapting them to various incomplete data scenarios with minimal training. The method alleviates performance degradation from missing inputs without expensive model finetuning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a modality-missing-aware prompting method to tackle two challenges in multimodal learning: 1) handling missing modalities during training or testing, and 2) avoiding heavy computation for finetuning large pretrained models. 

The key idea is to use prompt learning to adapt pretrained multimodal transformers (e.g. ViLT) to be robust to missing modalities, by attaching small learnable "missing-aware prompts" to the model conditioned on different missing modality cases. This allows handling general missing modality situations with only training the small prompt parameters (<1% of the full model size), instead of expensive finetuning. 

Specifically, the missing-aware prompts are prepended to either the input or attention modules of the transformer encoder layers. Two designs are explored: 1) input-level prompting concatenates prompts to the input sequence of each layer, and 2) attention-level prompting splits prompts into key/value vectors for the self-attention computation. Experiments show input-level prompting works better overall, but attention-level is more robust when prompt lengths are not tuned well. In summary, this simple yet effective prompting approach improves missing modality robustness while being computationally efficient.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing two main challenges in multimodal learning:

1. Dealing with missing modalities, which can occur during both training and testing in real-world scenarios. Multimodal models typically assume complete input data, but in practice some modalities may be missing due to various constraints. This can degrade model performance.

2. The heavy computational requirements of training and finetuning large transformer models. As transformer models scale up in size, finetuning them on new datasets becomes very expensive and often infeasible. This limits their applicability and reuse for downstream tasks.

To address these issues, the authors propose a "missing-aware prompting" method that adapts pretrained multimodal transformers to handle missing modalities, while only training a very small fraction of the model parameters (the "prompts"). 

Specifically, they design prompts that provide conditioning on the missing modality cases, and attach them to the transformer model at either the input or attention levels. This allows prompting the model for different missing modality situations without finetuning the full model.

The key novelty is using prompts to make multimodal transformers robust to missing modalities in a very parameter-efficient way, avoiding the computational costs of full finetuning. The prompts act as an instruction mechanism that adapts the model for different input distributions caused by missing modalities.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an efficient method to improve the robustness of multimodal transformers against missing modalities during training or inference. The authors introduce a challenging scenario where different modalities (e.g. image, text) can be missing in any combination for each data sample.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a missing-aware prompting method to handle two key challenges in multimodal learning: robustness to missing modalities during training or testing, and avoiding expensive fine-tuning of large pretrained transformers. The method attaches a small set of learnable "missing-aware prompts" to the input or attention layers of a frozen pretrained multimodal transformer.
