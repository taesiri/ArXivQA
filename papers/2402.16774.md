# [Video-Based Autism Detection with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16774)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis requires early and accurate detection to enable proper treatment and care. However, diagnosis is challenging and there is a need for automated deep learning based tools to assist doctors. Many existing works rely on expensive MRI data. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a deep learning model that analyzes video reactions of children to sensory stimuli to detect ASD. The model has two CNN branches - one for learning ASD-related motion features and one for facial expressions. These spatial features are fed into a temporal transformer to model temporal relationships. Video slices are sampled as input.

Data: The data consists of videos of child reactions to taste and smell stimuli collected at two universities. There are 30 and 36 subjects respectively, with equal numbers of ASD and neurotypical (NT) patients. Video durations are ~650 frames on average.  

Technical Details: 
- Input is short 16 frame video slices, sampled twice per video 
- Main branch uses EfficientNet B0 to extract motion features
- Second branch uses ResNet-18 pretrained on facial expressions  
- Temporal transformer connects spatial CNN outputs
- Trained on 4 folds, tested on 1 fold of data

Results: Achieves 81.48% test accuracy in classifying ASD vs NT with good generalization. Shows the ability to capture differences in reactions despite limited data.

Main Contributions:
- Novel video-based deep learning approach to detect ASD, unlike works relying on expensive MRI
- Demonstrates good accuracy from only visual reactions to stimuli
- Handles limitations like small data, limited context per video

The summary covers the key details of the problem being addressed, the proposed video analysis solution, the dataset and experiments performed, results showing effective generalization, and the main contributions of the work towards video-based ASD diagnosis.
