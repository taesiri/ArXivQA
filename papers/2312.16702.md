# [Rethinking Tabular Data Understanding with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16702)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding text, but their ability to interpret and reason over tabular data is less explored. Tables pose unique challenges due to their structural nature which requires precise localization and complex statistical reasoning. 
- Additionally, variations in table structure, such as transposition between rows and columns, can significantly impact LLM performance and robustness.

Proposed Solutions:
- Investigate LLM robustness to structural table perturbations and propose a table normalization method to enhance resilience. 
- Compare textual reasoning (via direct prompting) and symbolic reasoning (via Python code interactions) in LLMs for table understanding. Identify strengths and weaknesses of each approach through error analysis.
- Aggregate multiple reasoning pathways, including both textual and symbolic strategies, using a mix self-consistency technique that selects among outputs and applies majority voting for higher accuracy.

Key Results:
- Structural table variations, especially transposition, lead to substantial declines in accuracy. A table normalization strategy is proposed to standardize structure.
- Textual reasoning slightly outperforms symbolic reasoning, but each has complementary strengths. Textual reasoning struggles with precise localization while symbolic reasoning shows coding instability.  
- Combining textual and symbolic reasoning via mix self-consistency attains state-of-the-art accuracy of 73.6% on WikiTableQuestions, demonstrating the synergistic effects of reasoning aggregation.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of LLM robustness to structural table perturbations and proposal of normalization technique
- In-depth comparison of textual vs. symbolic reasoning, including error analysis
- Novel mix self-consistency method that fuses multiple reasoning pathways for higher accuracy

The key insight is that combining complementary reasoning strategies can significantly boost LLM performance on tasks requiring tabular understanding and reasoning. The proposed innovations help advance the capabilities of LLMs for interpreting and leveraging tabular data.
