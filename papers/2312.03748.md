# [Applying Large Language Models and Chain-of-Thought for Automatic   Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03748)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Automatic scoring systems are needed in science education to efficiently evaluate students' written explanations and provide timely feedback. However, developing robust automatic scoring models is time/effort-intensive and requires technical expertise.  
- Existing models also lack transparency and explainability of scoring outcomes, limiting adoption. Recent studies using few-shot learning with large language models (LLMs) show potential but yield lower accuracy.

Solutions Proposed:
- Apply prompt engineering strategies to improve LLM accuracy in few-shot learning for automatic scoring. Specifically, test zero-shot vs few-shot learning, and integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.
- Evaluate scoring performance of GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4 under different conditions (voting vs single-call, greedy vs nucleus sampling).
- Develop a novel prompt engineering approach called PPEAS to iteratively create high-quality prompts for automatic scoring.

Key Findings:  
- Few-shot learning significantly outperforms zero-shot in scoring accuracy (12.6% increase). CoT further improves accuracy when paired with rubrics (13.4% zero-shot, 3.7% few-shot).
- GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 by 8.64% overall in scoring accuracy. Single-call greedy sampling achieves the highest reliability.  
- PPEAS balancing accuracy across proficiency levels, highlighting domain-specific reasoning with CoT and rubrics in enhancing LLM effectiveness.

Contributions:
- Demonstrate feasibility of using LLMs to provide efficient, explainable automatic scoring outcomes. Enables wider adoption by educators.
- Establish few-shot learning with CoT and scoring rubrics as a promising approach to develop accurate automatic scoring systems with less human effort.
- Provide novel insights into optimizing LLM performance for automatic scoring via strategies like PPEAS and comparing GPT variants. Advances research on prompt engineering.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This study investigates the application of large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for automatic scoring of student responses to science assessments, using chain-of-thought prompting to enhance scoring accuracy and explainability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is examining the application of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for automatic scoring of student responses to science assessment items. Key findings include:

1) GPT models can provide explainable automatic scoring by generating natural language rationales. This enhances transparency compared to previous "black box" models.

2) Few-shot learning with GPT models significantly outperforms zero-shot learning for automatic scoring accuracy, reducing the need for large labeled datasets.  

3) Incorporating CoT prompting alongside item stems and rubrics markedly improves GPT scoring accuracy compared to CoT alone. This highlights the importance of domain-specific reasoning.

4) GPT-4 demonstrates superior performance to GPT-3.5 for automatic scoring, and single-call greedy sampling proved most effective compared to ensemble voting strategies. 

In summary, this study shows the promise of advanced LLMs like GPT-4 with CoT prompting to facilitate automatic scoring while emphasizing the need for careful prompt engineering considering problem context and rubrics. Explainability is also enhanced using this approach.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel approach called PPEAS for prompt engineering. Can you explain in detail the iterative procedure involved in PPEAS and how it can lead to improved prompts for automatic scoring? 

2. The study found that few-shot learning prompts showed higher accuracy than zero-shot prompts. What are some possible reasons for this? Does the structure-coercing effect of few-shot learning play a role?

3. The addition of CoT alone did not significantly improve scoring accuracy but CoT paired with context and rubrics did. Why do you think providing context is crucial for CoT prompting to be effective in automatic scoring tasks?

4. Table 3 shows that adding CoT and context/rubrics leads to more balanced accuracy across proficiency categories. What might explain this effect? Does it have to do with enhancing domain-specific reasoning?

5. The single-call greedy sampling strategy with GPT-4 outperformed other approaches including voting strategies. Does this highlight the advanced reasoning capacity of GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5? What might explain why voting is not as effective?

6. Do you think advances in model capacity can further improve automatic scoring performance in the future following this method? What aspects need improvement?

7. The study used secondary dataset comprising six assessment tasks. Do you think results would generalize to other science assessment items? What precautions need to be taken?  

8. Can this method of prompt engineering with CoT be applied to scoring complex responses beyond science such as essays? Would the PPEAS procedure work or need modification?

9. The study demonstrates high machine-human agreement but does not compare machine scoring time vs human scoring time. How do you think they would compare? What are the implications?

10. Beyond automatic scoring, can you envision other applications in education where this PPEAS approach could be beneficial for prompt engineering with LLMs? Explain with examples.
