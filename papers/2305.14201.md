# [Goat: Fine-tuned LLaMA Outperforms GPT-4 on Arithmetic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14201)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: Can a large language model be fine-tuned to excel at basic arithmetic tasks through supervised training alone, without needing to apply special techniques like chain-of-thought prompting?The key hypotheses seem to be:1) LLaMA's consistent tokenization of numbers enables it to learn to perform addition and subtraction of large integers with near perfect accuracy simply through end-to-end supervised fine-tuning.2) For more complex tasks like large integer multiplication and division, decomposition into simpler subtasks guided by basic arithmetic principles can enable the model to learn these tasks more effectively. 3) The proposed decomposition results in a chain-of-thought that is easily interpretable by humans.4) The fine-tuned model, dubbed Goat, can match or surpass the performance of powerful models like GPT-4 on arithmetic reasoning, even in a zero-shot setting.In summary, the central research question is whether supervised tuning alone is sufficient for LLaMA to master arithmetic tasks, with the key hypothesis being that leveraging its consistent number tokenization and proposing an interpretable decomposition scheme enables this. Evaluating Goat's performance verifies these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a fine-tuned LLaMA model called Goat that achieves state-of-the-art performance on elementary arithmetic tasks, including addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of integers. The key highlights are:- Goat can perform large number addition and subtraction with near perfect accuracy through supervised fine-tuning alone, without needing complex chain-of-thought (CoT) methods. This is attributed to LLaMA's consistent tokenization of numbers.- For challenging tasks like large number multiplication and division, the authors propose a novel CoT approach to decompose them into simpler learnable sub-tasks based on basic arithmetic principles. This ensures human interpretability.- Goat significantly outperforms GPT-4 on a range of arithmetic tasks evaluated using BIG-bench. The zero-shot Goat-7B matches or exceeds the accuracy of few-shot PaLM-540B.- The authors provide a comprehensive analysis and ablation studies on the proposed decomposition steps to demonstrate their effectiveness. The model learns the underlying patterns instead of purely memorizing.- Goat-7B can be easily trained using LoRA on a 24GB VRAM GPU, making it easily reproducible. The model, dataset and training code are released.In summary, the key contribution is developing an interpretable and reproducible approach to enhance LLMs' arithmetic skills using supervised fine-tuning and novel CoT methods, with results surpassing powerful models like GPT-4. The work offers useful insights into facilitating arithmetic reasoning in LLMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces Goat, a fine-tuned LLaMA model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on arithmetic tasks like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division through end-to-end supervised instruction tuning on a synthetically generated dataset; it demonstrates the feasibility of training LLMs to accurately solve certain basic arithmetic operations directly just through supervised fine-tuning, and proposes a novel chain-of-thought method to decompose more complex arithmetic tasks into simpler learnable subtasks leveraging basic arithmetic principles to enhance model performance and human interpretability.
