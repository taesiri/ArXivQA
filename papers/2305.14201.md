# [Goat: Fine-tuned LLaMA Outperforms GPT-4 on Arithmetic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14201)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: Can a large language model be fine-tuned to excel at basic arithmetic tasks through supervised training alone, without needing to apply special techniques like chain-of-thought prompting?The key hypotheses seem to be:1) LLaMA's consistent tokenization of numbers enables it to learn to perform addition and subtraction of large integers with near perfect accuracy simply through end-to-end supervised fine-tuning.2) For more complex tasks like large integer multiplication and division, decomposition into simpler subtasks guided by basic arithmetic principles can enable the model to learn these tasks more effectively. 3) The proposed decomposition results in a chain-of-thought that is easily interpretable by humans.4) The fine-tuned model, dubbed Goat, can match or surpass the performance of powerful models like GPT-4 on arithmetic reasoning, even in a zero-shot setting.In summary, the central research question is whether supervised tuning alone is sufficient for LLaMA to master arithmetic tasks, with the key hypothesis being that leveraging its consistent number tokenization and proposing an interpretable decomposition scheme enables this. Evaluating Goat's performance verifies these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a fine-tuned LLaMA model called Goat that achieves state-of-the-art performance on elementary arithmetic tasks, including addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of integers. The key highlights are:- Goat can perform large number addition and subtraction with near perfect accuracy through supervised fine-tuning alone, without needing complex chain-of-thought (CoT) methods. This is attributed to LLaMA's consistent tokenization of numbers.- For challenging tasks like large number multiplication and division, the authors propose a novel CoT approach to decompose them into simpler learnable sub-tasks based on basic arithmetic principles. This ensures human interpretability.- Goat significantly outperforms GPT-4 on a range of arithmetic tasks evaluated using BIG-bench. The zero-shot Goat-7B matches or exceeds the accuracy of few-shot PaLM-540B.- The authors provide a comprehensive analysis and ablation studies on the proposed decomposition steps to demonstrate their effectiveness. The model learns the underlying patterns instead of purely memorizing.- Goat-7B can be easily trained using LoRA on a 24GB VRAM GPU, making it easily reproducible. The model, dataset and training code are released.In summary, the key contribution is developing an interpretable and reproducible approach to enhance LLMs' arithmetic skills using supervised fine-tuning and novel CoT methods, with results surpassing powerful models like GPT-4. The work offers useful insights into facilitating arithmetic reasoning in LLMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces Goat, a fine-tuned LLaMA model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on arithmetic tasks like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division through end-to-end supervised instruction tuning on a synthetically generated dataset; it demonstrates the feasibility of training LLMs to accurately solve certain basic arithmetic operations directly just through supervised fine-tuning, and proposes a novel chain-of-thought method to decompose more complex arithmetic tasks into simpler learnable subtasks leveraging basic arithmetic principles to enhance model performance and human interpretability.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other related work on training language models for arithmetic reasoning:- Unlike some prior work that uses rule-based or symbolic methods, this paper takes a fully end-to-end neural approach via supervised fine-tuning alone. They demonstrate that this simpler method can achieve strong results on basic arithmetic without relying on more complex techniques.- The paper shows very strong performance on addition/subtraction just via fine-tuning, without needing explicit chain-of-thought prompting like in prior work (e.g. Sketchpad, LM Tutor). This suggests improved number representation in LLaMA makes these tasks more directly learnable.- For harder tasks like multiplication/division, the paper does leverage chain-of-thought prompting similar to Sketchpad. However, the proposed decomposition method is tailored and interpretable, rather than just falling back on conventional long multiplication/division.- Compared to studies analyzing model limitations (e.g. Nogueira et al. on addition), this work shows more evidence that large models can learn strong arithmetic skills with the right training approach. The ablation studies provide insights on what chain-of-thought helps.- Unlike Toolformer/PAL which rely on calling external modules for computation, this keeps arithmetic reasoning within the core LM, arguably more aligned with how humans solve math problems mentally.- By focusing specifically on integer arithmetic, this provides a simpler testbed compared to more complex symbolic math in recent work like MathCoder or SMArT.- Compared to very large models like PaLM and GPT-4, the results suggest carefully tailored training can allow smaller models like 7B parameters to reach very competitive performance on arithmetic.In summary, this paper provides a thorough investigation that pushes the boundary on training LMs for core arithmetic skills using simple and interpretable methods. The analyses offer insights into number representation learning and benefits of intermediate supervision.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Testing the model on arithmetic with decimal numbers and fractions. The current work focuses only on integer arithmetic operations. The authors suggest extending the approach to handle decimals and fractions as well.- Exploring more efficient and suitable multiplication and division algorithms for the model to learn. The chain-of-thought (CoT) method proposed in this paper aims to enhance human interpretability, but may not be the most efficient way for the model to learn. The authors suggest investigating alternative algorithms that could facilitate answer generation.- Applying the method to math word problems and integrating it with existing instruction-tuned models. The end-to-end instruction tuning pipeline developed in this work can potentially enhance the arithmetic reasoning abilities of models designed for solving math word problems. - Training and evaluating larger models. The authors use the 7B parameter LLaMA model in their experiments, but suggest training and testing larger models as well.- Further analysis on the learnability of tasks. The authors categorize tasks as "learnable" or "unlearnable" based on experiments, but suggest further theoretical analysis into the reasons behind task learnability.- Studying extrapolation capabilities. The evaluation reveals limited extrapolation abilities, highlighting the need for more research on how to enhance generalization.- Ablation studies on the impact of CoT and intermediate supervision. The experimental setup provides an ideal platform for ablation studies to further analyze the influence of chain-of-thought and intermediate steps.In summary, the key future directions are: testing on broader arithmetic tasks, integrating the method into downstream applications like math word problems, training larger models, theoretical analysis on task learnability, improving extrapolation abilities, and more rigorous ablation studies.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces Goat, a fine-tuned LLaMA model that significantly outperforms GPT-4 on a range of arithmetic tasks. Goat is trained on a synthetically generated dataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BIG-bench arithmetic subtask, with the zero-shot Goat-7B matching or exceeding the accuracy of the few-shot PaLM-540B. Surprisingly, through supervised fine-tuning alone, Goat can achieve near perfect accuracy on large number addition and subtraction, which is almost impossible for previous pretrained language models. This exceptional performance is attributed to LLaMA's consistent tokenization of numbers. To tackle more challenging tasks like large number multiplication and division, the authors propose decomposing them into a series of learnable subtasks by leveraging basic arithmetic principles, and show this gives much better performance than GPT-4's methods. They thoroughly examine the effectiveness of the proposed decomposition and find the model is able to learn patterns and generalize rather than purely memorizing computations. Additionally, Goat-7B can be easily trained using 24GB GPUs. The authors release their model, dataset and code.
