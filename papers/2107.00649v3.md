# [On the Practicality of Deterministic Epistemic Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00649v3)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, the main research question this paper addresses is how to improve the robustness and reliability of deep neural networks against common image corruptions. Specifically, the authors propose a new method called Deep Universal Marginalization (DUM) to make neural network predictions more robust and reliable in the presence of common image corruptions. The key ideas are:

- Standard deep neural networks tend to make unreliable predictions when tested on images with common corruptions like blur, noise, weather effects etc. that are different from the training distribution. This highlights issues with out-of-distribution generalization.

- Prior work has tried to improve robustness using ensembling, Monte Carlo dropout, or modifying the training objective. But these have limitations in improving robustness across diverse corruptions. 

- The authors propose Deep Universal Marginalization (DUM), which trains the network to marginalize the predictions over a universal corruption distribution that covers diverse corruption types and severities. 

- DUM improves robustness by making the model explicitly account for and marginalize over possible corruptions during training. This makes the predictions more reliable and calibrated compared to standard training or other baselines.

- Experiments on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, Cityscapes-C and Carla-C benchmarks show DUM significantly improves robustness over baselines for various corruption types while maintaining accuracy on clean data.

So in summary, the main research question is how to improve model robustness against common image corruptions by training the model to marginalize predictions over a universal corruption distribution. DUM is proposed to address this question.

What problem/task(s) does it focus on (e.g., classification, regression, reinforcement learning)? At what granularity (sample-level, batch-level, model-level)? Does it employ any other techniques like transfer/multi-task learning, semi-supervised learning?


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, the main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a new method for unsupervised anomaly detection called Deep SAD (Deep Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection). The key ideas include:

- Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) as the base model for anomaly detection. VAEs can learn rich representations of normal data in an unsupervised manner.

- Introducing a new loss function called composite reconstruction error that encourages the VAE to learn a representation that can accurately reconstruct in-distribution examples but not out-of-distribution examples. This provides a way to detect anomalies during inference.

- Proposing a semi-supervised training procedure where the VAE is first pre-trained on just normal data, then fine-tuned on a small set of labeled anomalies to further improve the representation.

- Demonstrating strong anomaly detection performance on image datasets compared to prior VAE-based methods and other baselines.

So in summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing Deep SAD, a semi-supervised anomaly detection approach based on variational autoencoders and a new composite reconstruction error training objective. The method achieves state-of-the-art results by effectively learning representations that capture in-distribution data while rejecting outliers.
