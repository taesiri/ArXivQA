# [HAIFIT: Human-Centered AI for Fashion Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08651)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing sketch-to-image translation methods struggle to preserve intricate details from input sketches when generating realistic images. This limitation severely impacts a designer's ability to preview refinements and modifications within their sketches. 

Proposed Solution: The authors propose HAIFIT, a GAN-based network for sketch-to-image translation in fashion design. HAIFIT focuses on converting clothing sketches to high-quality, realistic images using two key components:

1) Multi-scale Feature Fusion Encoder (MFFE): Captures both global contour features and long-range dependencies between different sketch regions from multiple views using a shallow CNN and LSTM. This improves feature representation.  

2) Pyramid Generator with Cross-level Skip Connections (CSC): Employs a pyramid of generators to capture multi-scale features. CSC combines feature maps from different pyramid levels to focus attention on sketch details.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes an innovative network architecture specialized for handling intricacies in clothing fashion sketches during image translation

- Introduces the first professional clothing sketch-image dataset compiled from drawings by fashion designers 

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic and detailed clothing images that preserve original sketch styles

- Reduces computational costs for training and inference compared to recent diffusion models, benefiting design workflows

In summary, HAIFIT allows fashion designers to effectively translate their sketches into photorealistic renderings while maintaining creative style and details through tailored network components and a new clothing dataset. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HAIFIT over existing approaches.
