# [FastSpeech: Fast, Robust and Controllable Text to Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09263)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a text-to-speech (TTS) system that generates mel-spectrograms from text quickly and in parallel (non-autoregressively), while also improving the robustness and controllability of the synthesized speech output?

The key hypotheses/claims appear to be:

- Using a feed-forward network based on self-attention and 1D convolutions can generate mel-spectrograms in parallel, avoiding the slow sequential generation of autoregressive TTS models.

- Explicitly modeling alignments between phonemes and mel-spectrograms with a duration predictor can improve robustness by avoiding word skipping/repeating issues faced by autoregressive attention-based TTS models. 

- A length regulator module can control speed and prosody by expanding the phoneme sequence according to predicted durations.

So in summary, the central research direction seems to be developing a non-autoregressive TTS approach called FastSpeech that is faster, more robust, and more controllable than previous autoregressive neural TTS models. The core hypotheses are around the architectural design choices and modeling phoneme/mel alignment enabling these advantages over autoregressive models.
