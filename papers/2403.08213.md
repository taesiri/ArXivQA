# [Can Large Language Models Identify Authorship?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08213)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional authorship analysis methods rely on handcrafted features or domain-specific fine-tuning, limiting their performance in cross-domain scenarios with scarce labeled data. They also lack explainability.

- Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional reasoning abilities, but their potential in authorship analysis tasks remains underexplored. Identifying authorship accurately is crucial for verifying content, mitigating misinformation, and cybersecurity.

Solution:
- The paper proposes using LLMs with a novel linguistically informed prompting (LIP) technique for authorship verification and attribution without needing additional labeled data or fine-tuning. 

- LIP leverages the linguistic knowledge within LLMs by guiding them to focus analysis on key stylistic features like punctuation, errors, humor etc. that indicate individual authorship.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates LLMs can perform end-to-end authorship analysis effectively, outperforming BERT models in a zero-shot setting across domains.

- Develops an LLM-based pipeline for authorship tasks encompassing data preparation, benchmark implementation and evaluation with LIP prompting.

- Enhances explainability by eliciting linguistic evidence and reasoning behind LLM predictions, shedding light on their decision process. 

- Sets a new benchmark for leveraging inherent stylometric knowledge within LLMs for authorship analysis without needing additional resources.

In summary, the paper shows LLMs, combined with linguistically guided prompting, achieve state-of-the-art performance in authorship verification and attribution tasks while improving explainability. This establishes their proficiency in zero-shot cross-domain authorship analysis.
