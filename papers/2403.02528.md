# [DACO: Towards Application-Driven and Comprehensive Data Analysis via   Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02528)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Data analysis is a crucial process to gain insights from tabular data to answer user queries. However, it requires extensive labor to perform rigorous quantitative analysis and derive conclusions. 
- Existing question answering systems focus on factual lookups rather than comprehensive analysis needed for real-world applications.
- Constructing a dataset for this task with expert annotations is prohibitively expensive. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new dataset called DACO for data analysis via code generation. It contains 440 real-world databases and 1942 associated queries requiring analytical reasoning.
- Use GPT-4's code generation capabilities to automatically construct analysis annotations. A multi-turn prompting technique is designed to generate python code interleaved with interpretations. 
- Curate a high-quality test set with human refinement for 100 query-answer pairs.
- Propose DACO-RL algorithm to further improve the analysis quality using reward learning, with a contribution reward model and a regularization model.

Main Contributions:
- Construct a large-scale dataset DACO to facilitate research on application-driven and comprehensive data analysis.
- Demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging LLMs to automatically generate analytical reasoning chains. 
- Provide a reliable benchmark with a human-refined test set to evaluate model performance.
- Design an effective RLHF algorithm DACO-RL that optimizes towards human preferences of helpful analyses. The algorithm improves over supervised baseline by 8.5 points in human evaluation.
