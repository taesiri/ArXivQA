# [DO3D: Self-supervised Learning of Decomposed Object-aware 3D Motion and   Depth from Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05895)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods make an oversimplified assumption that the scene is static. However, real-world scenes contain dynamic objects, violating this assumption. As a result, current methods fail on dynamic scenes, producing inaccurate depth values and motion predictions. 

The paper provides both empirical analysis and mathematical proofs to demonstrate that optimizing the photometric loss used in current frameworks will lead to erroneous supervision signals for dynamic regions. Specifically, assigning an infinite depth value will incur lower photometric loss for dynamic pixels. Hence, the model gets encouraged to predict incorrect infinite depth values.

Proposed Solution:
To address this issue, the authors propose a new self-supervised learning framework to jointly estimate dense scene depth and decomposed object-wise 3D motion from monocular videos. 

The key idea is to disentangle the scene geometry, camera ego-motion, and object motion based on the underlying 3D geometric model, where a real-world dynamic scene consists of static background and moving objects in 3D space.

Specifically, the proposed model contains:
(1) A DepthNet to predict per-pixel depth map
(2) A PoseNet for camera ego-motion estimation
(3) A MotionNet to explicitly model complex object motions via:
   - Object-wise 6-DoF rigid motion 
   - Pixel-wise non-rigid motion deformation

By combining depth, ego-motion, and object motions, a novel target view can be rendered for self-supervised training.

Main Contributions:

- Provides analysis on limitations of existing self-supervised depth learning formulations 

- Develops a new disentangled representation to model both rigid and non-rigid object motions in 3D space

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on monocular depth estimation, optical flow estimation and scene flow estimation. The model delivers substantial improvements in dynamic regions.

- Demonstrates the framework can generalize to diverse datasets and serve as a plug-and-play module to improve existing methods  

In summary, the paper presents an in-depth analysis of current frameworks and proposes a principled approach to model real-world dynamic scenes for self-supervised dense prediction tasks. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the effectiveness of disentangling geometry and motions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a self-supervised framework to jointly estimate object-wise 3D motion and monocular dense scene depth from videos by disentangling geometry, camera motion, and object motion in a decomposed object-aware 3D motion prediction module along with a hybrid transformer and CNN architecture for depth estimation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors present an analysis of existing formulations for self-supervised depth estimation, demonstrate the root causes of their failure modes in dynamic scenes, and propose a new self-supervised framework to jointly learn decomposed object-wise 3D motion and dense scene depth from monocular videos, attempting to model the underlying geometric model.

2) They contribute a better baseline backbone network with a hybrid transformer and CNN architecture for depth estimation. The transformer component effectively captures global information and spatial correlations between regions within a frame, which achieves significantly better performance than previous works.  

3) They develop a new 3D motion estimation method with disentanglement, namely DO3D, to predict camera ego-motion, object-wise rigid motion, and non-rigid deformation. This exploits real-world motion constraints to regularize motion predictions. DO3D is a generic module that can be incorporated into existing state-of-the-art self-supervised depth estimation methods for better motion and depth estimation.

4) They evaluate the proposed model on depth, optical flow, and scene flow estimation tasks. Quantitative and qualitative results on three driving datasets show the superiority of the approach, especially in highly dynamic scenarios.

In summary, the main contribution is the analysis, the new formulation and framework, the hybrid depth network architecture, and the disentangled 3D motion prediction module DO3D. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple tasks over several datasets.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

2. The core of the proposed method is the MotionNet module for 3D motion estimation. Explain the key ideas behind the motion decomposition strategy used in MotionNet to model both rigid and non-rigid object motions.

3. The MotionNet contains two main sub-modules - one for estimating object-wise rigid motion and another for non-rigid deformation. Elaborate on the detailed workings of each of these sub-modules. 

4. The paper claims the proposed motion decomposition strategy is more effective than prior works like optical flow or direct prediction of pixel-wise motion. Justify this claim by analyzing the limitations of these other motion modeling techniques.

7. The overall self-supervised loss function contains photometric, smoothness and mask terms. Explain the motivation and impact of each of these loss terms on training the model. 

8. The paper evaluates the method on optical flow, depth and scene flow estimation. Analyze these results to discuss which task sees the most gains from the proposed technique and why.

9. Qualitative results reveal the method still struggles in some areas like object edges. Speculate on the potential reasons behind these failure cases. 

10. The paper states the pose network has a tendency to just predict forward motion. Suggest ways to alleviate this issue to improve optical flow predictions.
