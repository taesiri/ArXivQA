# [(Un)paired signal-to-signal translation with 1D conditional GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04800)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores using a one-dimensional (1D) conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) for unpaired signal-to-signal translation. The key problem being addressed is whether machine learning models designed for image-to-image translation can be adapted to translate between different one-dimensional signal domains. 

The proposed solution is a simplified CycleGAN model that has been adapted from the two-dimensional (2D) CycleGAN used for image-to-image translation. The modifications include using 1D convolutional layers instead of 2D, and widening the convolutional kernels to capture more temporal context from the signals. This 1D CycleGAN is trained on unpaired signals from two different synthetic signal domains.

The model is evaluated on its ability to translate between bandlimited signals with different noise and phase properties. Results show the 1D CycleGAN is able to transform unpaired test signals from one domain to signals with similar frequencies as the paired training data in the target domain. Both time-domain and frequency-domain similarity metrics are used to quantify the performance.

The main contributions of the paper are:

- Demonstrating that the CycleGAN architecture can be adapted to 1D signal translation tasks by substituting 1D convolutional layers and widening kernels.

- Providing an existence proof that methods developed for 2D image translation may generalize effectively to other signal domains like 1D audio.

- Showing unpaired signal translation is possible with 1D CycleGANs while approximately preserving frequency content between domains.

- Introducing a tunable synthetic 1D signal dataset for evaluating signal translation models.

In summary, the paper introduces a simplified 1D CycleGAN method and demonstrates its potential for unpaired signal-to-signal translation across different 1D signal domains. Key results help establish the generalization of image translation techniques to 1D signals.
