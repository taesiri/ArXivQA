# [Semi-Supervised 2D Human Pose Estimation Driven by Position   Inconsistency Pseudo Label Correction Module](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04346)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation by using a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. Introducing an additional auxiliary teacher model and using the consistency between the outputs of the two teacher models on the same image to correct pseudo labels can improve performance.

2. A semi-supervised occlusion simulation augmentation method called "Cut-Occlude" based on pseudo keypoint perception can generate more effective hard samples to boost performance.

3. The proposed semi-supervised framework with the two key components (position inconsistency pseudo label correction and Cut-Occlude data augmentation) can significantly improve the performance of 2D human pose estimators trained with limited labeled data.

In summary, the paper hypothesizes that by correcting noisy pseudo labels using output consistency between two teacher models and generating hard occlusion samples based on pseudo keypoint locations, the proposed semi-supervised framework can better utilize unlabeled data and achieve state-of-the-art results with limited labeled data for 2D human pose estimation. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses.
