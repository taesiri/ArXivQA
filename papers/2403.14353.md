# [DaCapo: Accelerating Continuous Learning in Autonomous Systems for Video   Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14353)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Modern video analytics relies heavily on deep neural networks (DNNs) which have high computational demands. Using lightweight DNN models on resource-constrained autonomous systems leads to the problem of "data drift", where the live data diverges from the training data, reducing model accuracy over time. Existing continuous learning systems address this by retraining models on new data, but have limitations: 
(1) They focus only on retraining computations, overlooking the compute needs for inference and labeling.  
(2) They rely on power-hungry GPUs, unsuitable for battery-operated autonomous systems.
(3) They run on remote centralized servers, less applicable for autonomous systems due to privacy, networking and latency concerns.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes "DaCapo", a hardware-algorithm co-designed solution for continuous learning that enables autonomous systems to perform concurrent execution of inference, labeling and retraining. DaCapo has two main components:

1. Spatially-partitionable and precision-flexible accelerator: The accelerator has a systolic array architecture that can be dynamically partitioned into sub-accelerators. The processing elements use precision-flexible "dot product engines" that support different MX precisions for higher performance and efficiency.

2. Spatiotemporal resource allocation algorithm: This algorithm makes static spatial resource allocation decisions to partition the accelerator, and dynamic temporal decisions to allocate more time for labeling when data drifts are detected, in order to quickly update the training data.  

Main Contributions:
- Architects a flexible accelerator that can be composed into sub-accelerators to enable concurrent execution of the three continuous learning kernels.
- Devises a resource allocation algorithm that captures the resource-accuracy tradeoffs and navigates the space to maximize accuracy. 
- Achieves 6.5% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art GPU-based systems while consuming 254Ã— less power.
- Enables practical deployment of continuous learning video analytics on autonomous systems without reliance on remote servers.

In summary, DaCapo is a specialized acceleration solution enabling state-of-the-art continuous learning algorithms to be effectively deployed on resource-constrained autonomous systems. The joint hardware-algorithm approach unlocks the full potential of continuous learning for video analytics on such systems.
