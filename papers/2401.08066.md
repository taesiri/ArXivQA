# [Achieve Fairness without Demographics for Dermatological Disease   Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08066)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Biases can occur in skin disease image classification models due to imbalanced demographics in the training data, leading to unfair and inaccurate predictions. 
- Most existing debiasing methods require sensitive attributes (e.g. gender, skin tone) during training, which is often infeasible due to privacy concerns.
- Methods without sensitive attributes often compromise too much on accuracy or have limited understanding of feature fairness.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel module called "AttEN" that can be inserted into CNNs to improve fairness without any sensitive attributes.

- AttEN uses an attention module to capture diseased features and skin features from the input image. It then regularizes these features using a soft nearest neighbor loss (SNNL).

- For diseased features, SNNL increases entanglement within same disease classes and reduces it across classes. This enhances classification using disease-relevant features.

- For skin features, SNNL increases entanglement across disease classes. This prevents discrimination based on skin features within a disease class.

- Further improve attention quality using segmentation masks from Segment Anything Model (SAM).

Main Contributions:

- Achieve state-of-the-art fairness without demographics by promoting feature entanglement that aligns with classification objectives

- Demonstrate effectiveness over baselines on two dermatology datasets (ISIC 2019 and Fitzpatrick-17k) using multiple CNN backbones

- Provide theoretical analysis on how method mitigates biased shortcuts in predictions 

- Show quantitative and qualitative results that guided masks from SAM improve attention quality and fairness

The key insight is to regularize feature learning itself to prevent shortcut learning based on biases while retaining accuracy. This provides an effective and practical approach to fairness in medical imaging.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called AttEN that improves fairness in skin disease diagnosis by using attention modules and regularization of feature entanglement across sensitive groups to enable classification based solely on disease-related features without relying on sensitive attributes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called "AttEN" to improve predictive fairness in dermatological disease classification without using sensitive attribute information. Specifically:

1) They propose an "AttEN" module that can capture features related to the diseased part and skin part of an image using an attention mechanism. It then regularizes these features using soft nearest neighbor loss (SNNL) to ensure the model classifies diseases based on features of the diseased part, not sensitive skin features.

2) They incorporate guided masks from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to further enhance the quality of the learned attention maps in the "AttEN" module during training. 

3) Through extensive experiments on two dermatological disease datasets, they demonstrate their method can improve fairness with competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, including those that use sensitive attributes. It also shows robust performance across different model backbones like ResNet and VGG.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a method that can mitigate bias and improve fairness in dermatological disease diagnosis without needing sensitive attributes, overcoming limitations around privacy and availability of demographic information. The "AttEN" module and incorporation of SAM are the main technical innovations enabling this.

The paper proposes an attention-based method called AttEN to improve fairness in dermatological disease diagnosis without needing demographic/sensitive attributes during training. It uses an attention module and SNNL regularization to learn features related to the diseased parts and prevent shortcut learning based on skin features. It also incorporates guidance from segmentation masks generated by SAM. The method is evaluated using equalized opportunity and odds metrics, and shown to improve fairness over state-of-the-art methods on two dermatology datasets. Key goals are improving fairness and avoiding shortcuts based on sensitive attributes by regulating feature entanglement across groups.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key motivation behind designing the AttEN module to capture features related to the disease and skin parts separately? How does this design help improve fairness?

2. How does the soft nearest neighbor loss (SNNL) quantitatively measure the degree of feature entanglement? Explain the formulation and how maximizing or minimizing it helps achieve the desired goals.  

3. Explain the workflow of how guided masks from SAM are incorporated into the AttEN module along with attention maps to improve feature quality. What results demonstrate this improvement?

4. In Section 3.2, equations are provided detailing how the AttEN framework can reduce shortcut learning biases. Walk through the mathematical logic and intuition behind these derivations.  

5. What modifications were made to the standard SNNL loss calculation (excluding same class samples) and why was this done? How does it mathematically ensure maximization?

6. How many AttEN modules are inserted in the ResNet18 and VGG11 backbones? What is the motivation behind inserting modules at these specific positions?

7. Analyze the fairness results on the ISIC 2019 dataset in Tables 1 and 3. Why does AttEN outperform methods with sensitive attributes on some metrics?

8. Compare the accuracy and fairness ablation study results with and without guided masks in Table 5. What conclusions can be drawn about the impact?

9. What metrics quantitatively demonstrate the efficacy of entanglement regularization in Table 6? Analyze the improvements.  

10. How does Figure 3 showing consistent high FATE scores across different λ values demonstrate the robustness of AttEN’s accuracy-fairness trade-off?
