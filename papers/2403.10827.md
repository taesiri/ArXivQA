# [Multi-party Response Generation with Relation Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10827)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most existing neural response generation models focus on two-party conversations and assume a sequential structure, but real-world multi-party conversations involve utterances from multiple speakers that do not follow a strict sequence. Capturing the relations among utterances is important for understanding the context and generating good responses. However, existing methods rely on provided relation graphs, which are often unavailable in practice. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new model called Multi-RG that can automatically infer utterance relations and leverage them to guide response generation. The key ideas are:

1) Apply a deep graph random process to model all possible relations as probabilistic graphs without using any labels. This realizes "relational thinking" to uncover subtle clues about utterance relations. 

2) Pass messages along the inferred graph to obtain structure-aware context representations that emphasize relevant utterances.

3) Integrate the graph-based context encoding with a VAE-GAN decoder to generate high-quality and diverse responses.

Main Contributions:

- Introduce unsupervised relational thinking to reason utterance relations in multi-party conversations instead of relying on provided structures.

- Propose a graph-based context encoder guided by inferred relations and integrate it with a VAE-GAN decoder.

- Achieve new state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets - Movie Dialogue and Ubuntu IRC in both response generation and relation disentanglement.

- Demonstrate the importance of automatically inferring utterance relations instead of using ground truth graphs. Detailed analysis also validates the usefulness of key model components.
