# [Memory-and-Anticipation Transformer for Online Action Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07893)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a more effective approach for online action detection and anticipation that better models the full temporal context, including past, present and future actions/events?The key hypothesis is that modeling the circular interdependence between memory (past events) and anticipation (future events) will lead to improved performance on online action detection and anticipation tasks compared to prior memory-based approaches. The paper proposes a new memory-anticipation-based paradigm and model architecture called Memory-and-Anticipation Transformer (MAT) to address this question. MAT aims to capture the complete temporal structure spanning history, present and future through circular interaction between memory and anticipation.In summary, the paper hypothesizes that:- Modeling anticipation can enhance memory representations and vice versa due to their circular dependence. - A memory-anticipation based approach will outperform memory-only based methods on online action detection and anticipation benchmarks.The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses by evaluating MAT on several datasets across both tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a new memory-anticipation-based paradigm for online action detection and anticipation. The key idea is to model the circular dependencies between memory (past) and anticipation (future) to capture the entire temporal structure.2. Presenting a unified architecture called Memory-and-Anticipation Transformer (MAT) that can process online action detection and anticipation in a unified manner, spanning both training and inference.3. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of MAT on four challenging benchmarks for online action detection and anticipation tasks (TVSeries, THUMOS'14, HDD, and EPIC-Kitchens-100).In summary, the key novelty seems to be introducing the concept of memory-anticipation circular dependence and implementing it in a unified transformer architecture that can handle both online action detection and anticipation effectively. The experimental results validate the benefits of the proposed approach over previous memory-based methods that only model limited historical context.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key points comparing it to other research in online action detection and anticipation:- It proposes a new memory-anticipation-based paradigm for modeling the temporal structure of videos. This differs from most prior work which uses memory-based models focused on capturing historical dependencies. - The proposed MAT model implements this paradigm using a novel memory-anticipation circular decoder to model interactions between memory and future anticipation. This allows going beyond just historical context to make predictions.- MAT is designed as a unified framework that can handle both online action detection and anticipation in an end-to-end manner. Many previous methods treat these as separate tasks and train/test models independently.- Experiments on 4 datasets (TVSeries, THUMOS, HDD, Epic Kitchens) show MAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both online detection and anticipation tasks. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.- MAT obtains strong performance while balancing model efficiency. It has fewer parameters than some transformer baselines while achieving better accuracy.- The use of techniques like segment-based memory compression, conditional circular interaction, and MixClip+ augmentation seem to provide benefits over prior work.Overall, the key novelties are the memory-anticipation paradigm, unified detection/anticipation framework, and model design choices that appear to advance state-of-the-art in this field. The experiments demonstrate impressive gains over existing approaches on standard benchmarks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Validating the MAT model on more benchmarks and datasets. The authors tested MAT on four datasets for online action detection and anticipation, but suggest it could be evaluated on more datasets to further demonstrate its effectiveness.- Extending MAT to long-term anticipation tasks. The current work focused on short-term anticipation, but the authors suggest extending it to make longer-term forecasts.- Continuing to explore the intrinsic association between memory and anticipation. The key idea in MAT is the circular interaction between memory and anticipation. The authors suggest further uncovering this relationship to develop more effective forecasting models. - Applying the memory-anticipation paradigm to other tasks and modalities. The authors propose MAT provides a general paradigm for any AI system analyzing video online and predicting the future. They suggest applying it to other vision tasks beyond action detection/anticipation.- Exploring spatial dependencies along with temporal. MAT focuses on temporal modeling but incorporating spatial dependencies could further improve performance.- Leveraging large-scale pretraining. The authors show benefits of pretraining on large ego-centric video datasets. More pretraining could further improve the model.- Balancing efficiency and performance. The authors balanced model size, speed and performance but suggest continuing work on finding the right tradeoffs.In summary, the main directions are: applying MAT more broadly, further exploring memory-anticipation connections, incorporating spatial modeling, leveraging pretraining, and improving efficiency. The core idea of memory-anticipation interaction seems very promising for future video forecasting models.
