# [ViTGAN: Training GANs with Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04589v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper presents ViTGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture based on Vision Transformers (ViTs) for image synthesis. The central hypothesis is that Transformer architectures like ViTs can rival convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in building GAN models for image generation tasks. Specifically, the paper investigates if competitive image generation performance can be achieved using ViT components without relying on convolutions or pooling operations commonly used in CNN-based GANs.The key research questions addressed are:- Can Vision Transformers be integrated into the GAN framework to synthesize realistic images? - What architectural modifications and training techniques are necessary to stabilize GAN training when ViT components are used?- Can a pure ViT-based GAN model, without convolutional components, achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art CNN-based GANs on benchmark image datasets?To address these questions, the paper proposes a ViT-based generator and discriminator architecture for GANs. It introduces several techniques like improved spectral normalization and self-modulated layer normalization to stabilize the notoriously difficult training dynamics of GANs when coupled with ViTs. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA, and LSUN bedroom datasets, the paper demonstrates ViTGAN can generate images with quality comparable to leading CNN-based GANs like StyleGAN2. This provides an initial evidence for the potential of Transformers in generative adversarial learning for images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents ViTGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework that uses Vision Transformers (ViTs) for both the generator and discriminator, instead of convolutional neural networks which are typically used in GANs. The main contributions are:- Proposing techniques to stabilize the training of ViT-based GANs, including using L2 attention in the discriminator to enforce Lipschitz continuity, improved spectral normalization, and overlapping image patches to mitigate overfitting.- Introducing a ViT-based generator design with self-modulated layernorm and an implicit neural representation to map patch embeddings to pixel values. - Demonstrating that the proposed ViTGAN framework achieves comparable or better performance compared to state-of-the-art convolutional GANs like StyleGAN2 on image generation benchmarks like CIFAR-10, CelebA, and LSUN bedrooms.- Providing the first pure transformer-based GAN model that matches the performance of convolutional GANs for image generation. This shows the potential of transformers as a promising alternative to CNNs for generative tasks.In summary, the main contribution is designing a GAN framework based purely on Vision Transformers and showing its effectiveness compared to CNN-based GANs, opening up a new direction for exploring transformer architectures for generative modeling.
