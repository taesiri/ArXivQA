# [Look Before You Leap: Towards Decision-Aware and Generalizable   Tool-Usage for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16696)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for tool usage with large language models (LLMs) like template-driven approaches limit flexibility in handling diverse queries, while token-triggered approaches have limited generalizability to new tools. 
- LLMs lack decision-making awareness about when tool usage is needed and if a suitable tool exists.

Proposed Solution:
- A new decision-aware and generalizable tool usage framework (DEER) for LLMs.
- Constructs tool usage samples with multiple decision branches (search for tool or not, call tool or not) to inspire decision-making awareness. 
- Proposes a novel tool sampling strategy during training to enhance generalization to unseen tools. Uses a mixture of random, inter-class and intra-class sampling.

Key Contributions:
- Designs multi-decision branches for diverse scenarios to make models "look before you leap" regarding tool usage. 
- Tool sampling strategy that balances accuracy on seen tools and generalization to unseen tools.
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets. Significantly outperforms baselines like GPT-4, ToolLLaMA, ToolAlpaca.
- Maintains strong general dialog capability compared to constrained template-driven approaches.
- Provides an effective and generalizable tool usage capability for open-source LLMs.

In summary, the key innovation is enhancing LLMs with more flexible and generalizable tool usage capabilities via decision modeling and tool sampling strategies. The results demonstrate strong improvements over prior state-of-the-art methods.
