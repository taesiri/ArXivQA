# [Dank Learning: Generating Memes Using Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04510)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a system to automatically generate humorous and relevant captions (memes) for images?

The authors propose an encoder-decoder neural network model inspired by the Show and Tell model for image captioning to generate memes. The key aspects of their approach include:

- Using a pre-trained Inception-v3 CNN as an encoder to extract image features. 

- Experimenting with different encoder architectures to condition meme generation on both the image and a user-provided label.

- Using an LSTM decoder for language modeling and caption generation.

- Incorporating pretrained GloVe word embeddings in the model.

- Modifying the beam search algorithm during inference to promote caption diversity.

The overarching goal is to develop a novel meme generation system that can produce captions that are funny, relevant to the image, and difficult to distinguish from real human-generated memes. The authors evaluate their models quantitatively using perplexity and qualitatively using human evaluations.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that an attention-based encoder-decoder neural network can be trained to automatically generate high-quality humorous image captions i.e. memes. The paper presents an implementation and evaluation of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing a novel meme generation system that can generate humorous and relevant captions for any given image. The system is conditioned not only on the image but also on a user-defined label relating to the meme template.

- Using an attention-based deep LSTM model for caption generation, inspired by the widely recognized Show and Tell image captioning model. 

- Implementing a modified beam search to encourage diversity in the generated captions.

- Evaluating the quality of the generated memes using perplexity and human evaluations. Showing that the model can produce original memes that are generally indistinguishable from real memes.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an end-to-end neural network-based system for generating novel, humorous, and relevant meme captions conditioned on both an image and a label. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel meme generation system that uses deep neural networks to automatically generate humorous and relevant captions for images, which can be conditioned on user-defined labels to give more control over the meme content.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper on meme generation compares to other related research:

- Most prior work on image captioning focuses on generating factual, literal descriptions of images. This paper specifically tackles generating humorous and non-literal captions for memes. Humor generation is a challenging problem that requires higher-level understanding.

- The authors build on standard encoder-decoder image captioning models like Show and Tell. Their main innovations are using beam search with a temperature parameter to increase caption diversity, and conditioning on meme template labels. 

- Their dataset of meme image-label-caption triplets is unique. Most image captioning datasets pair single images with single factual captions. This meme dataset has the same images paired with multiple humorous captions.

- Evaluation is difficult for this task. The authors use both automatic metrics like perplexity and human evaluations of how funny and indistinguishable from real memes the generations are. Most prior work evaluates generations directly against ground truth captions.

- Compared to other humor generation research, this paper focuses specifically on visual humor in memes. Other work looks at humor in text only. The multimodal aspect here increases the difficulty.

- The results demonstrate an ability to generate captions that humans find funny and cannot reliably distinguish from real memes. State-of-the-art performance is hard to judge though given the novelty of this task.

In summary, this paper pushes image captioning capabilities in a more challenging but culturally relevant direction focused on humor and virality rather than factual accuracy. The models, training techniques, and evaluations address the unique requirements of meme generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Incorporating methods to better capture humor, which the authors acknowledge is challenging and an active area of research itself. They suggest ideas like learning the text breakpoints between the upper and lower parts of the image, which are important for the humor impact.

- Exploring visual attention mechanisms operating on the images, instead of just encoding the whole image. This could help attend to the most relevant parts of the image for generating a humorous caption. The authors cite some relevant papers on visual attention for image captioning.

- Addressing bias in the training dataset, as the authors note there was a bias towards expletive, racist, and sexist content. Future work could look at ways to mitigate this bias.

- Experimenting with more diverse and extensive label sets. The training labels were limited in the dataset, so the authors suggest using more unique labels could encourage more original and variable meme generation.

- Evaluating other encoder-decoder architectures beyond the LSTM RNN they implemented. The authors note the model backbone was similar to the Show and Tell image captioning model, but other more recent variants could be explored.

- Developing more advanced automatic evaluation metrics for humor and meme quality beyond perplexity. The authors had to rely on human evaluations, so better automated metrics could be useful.

In summary, the main future directions are improving humor modeling, leveraging visual attention, mitigating data bias, expanding the labeling, trying other model architectures, and developing better evaluation metrics. The authors lay out some good ideas for advancing meme generation using neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel meme generation system that can produce humorous and relevant captions for any given image. The system uses a pretrained Inception-v3 network to encode images into embeddings, which are input to an attention-based LSTM decoder that generates captions, inspired by the Show and Tell model. Several variants of the encoder-decoder framework are implemented, including using just images or images plus labels. Beam search with a temperature parameter is used during inference to generate diverse captions. The models are evaluated quantitatively using perplexity and qualitatively by having humans rate generated memes on humor and differentiate them from real memes. Results show the models can produce original memes that are generally indistinguishable from real ones. Overall, the paper demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for automated meme generation using deep learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper "Dank Learning: Generating Memes Using Deep Neural Networks":

The paper introduces a new system for automatically generating humorous and relevant captions for images, with a focus on creating internet memes. The system uses an encoder-decoder model, with a pretrained Inception-v3 convolutional neural network encoding the image into a vector representation. This is passed to an LSTM decoder which generates the caption one word at a time. The model is conditioned not just on the image but also on a user-defined label relating to the meme template, allowing control over meme content. Three variants of the encoder are tested, including using just the image, averaging the label word embeddings, and using an attention mechanism over the labels. The captions are generated using a modified beam search to encourage diversity. The quality of the memes is evaluated by perplexity on an evaluation set, checking for copied captions, and having humans rate the hilarity and differentiate from real memes. The results show the generated memes are mostly indistinguishable from real ones and rated as comparably funny. The labels don't provide as much control over content as hoped, suggesting future work on attention over the image itself.

In summary, this paper presents a novel deep learning system for automatic meme generation using CNN image features and an LSTM caption generator. The models can produce memes that humans find funny and difficult to differentiate from real memes, demonstrating the capability of modern neural networks for humor and creative tasks. Limitations around conditioning on labels suggest avenues for future work like visual attention.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a novel meme generation system that can produce humorous and relevant captions for any given image. The core of the system is an encoder-decoder neural network architecture similar to the widely recognized Show and Tell model for image captioning. The encoder uses a pretrained Inception-v3 CNN to extract an image embedding. The decoder is an LSTM RNN that takes this embedding as input and generates a caption word-by-word. The authors experiment with different encoder variants that optionally incorporate the meme's label and attention mechanisms. Beam search with a temperature parameter is used during inference to generate varied and original captions. The models are evaluated quantitatively using perplexity and qualitatively by having humans rate the humor and realism of generated memes. The results show the models can produce novel memes that are generally indistinguishable from real ones.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of generating humorous and relevant captions (memes) for images. Specifically, it focuses on the image-with-caption class of memes. The authors aim to build a system that can automatically generate amusing captions that are appropriate for a given image.

The key questions/goals of the paper are:

- How can we build a neural network model that can generate funny and relevant captions for images, to produce memes automatically?

- How can the model generate captions that are diverse and original for a given image, rather than generic factual descriptions? 

- How can the model be conditioned not just on the image but also on a user-defined label to give more control over meme content?

- How can the quality of generated memes be evaluated, given that humor is subjective?

So in summary, the main problem is automatically generating humorous and relevant captions for images to produce memes. The key questions relate to building and conditioning the neural network architecture, encouraging diversity in the captions, and evaluating subjective qualities like humor.
