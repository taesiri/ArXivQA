# [M2ORT: Many-To-One Regression Transformer for Spatial Transcriptomics   Prediction from Histopathology Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10608)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies can profile gene expressions in a spatially-aware manner within tissue slides. However, acquiring ST data is expensive. 
- An alternative is to predict ST maps directly from digitized histopathology slides (WSIs) using deep learning. 
- WSIs have a hierarchical pyramid structure with multi-scale images scanned at different magnifications.
- Existing methods treat this as a standard regression problem using one-to-one mapping between single-level image patches and ST spot labels. They fail to exploit the multi-scale hierarchical structure of WSIs.

Proposed Solution:
- Conceptualize the problem as a many-to-one regression problem by using multiple WSI patches from different levels to jointly predict gene expressions for their common corresponding ST spot.
- Propose M2ORT, a many-to-one regression Transformer to model this.
- M2ORT takes WSI patches from 3 levels as input and predicts the ST spot label. 
- It has a Multi-Scale Feature Extractor with two modules:
   - Intra-Level Token Mixing Module (ITMM): Learns representations within each level
   - Inter-Level Channel Mixing Module (ICMM): Allows cross-level interactions
- These two modules decouple the feature extraction pipeline to improve efficiency.

Contributions:
- Conceptualize ST prediction from WSIs as a many-to-one regression problem to exploit WSI's multi-scale hierarchical structure.
- Propose M2ORT, a tailored many-to-one regression Transformer for this problem.
- M2ORT outperforms previous methods with fewer parameters and computations. 
- Propose ITMM and ICMM to decouple multi-scale feature extraction, improving efficiency significantly without performance drop.
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art results on three public ST datasets.

In summary, the paper proposes a new perspective for predicting ST maps from WSIs by formulating it as a many-to-one regression problem. A tailored Transformer, M2ORT, is designed to exploit the hierarchical multi-scale structure of WSIs for accurate and efficient ST prediction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes M2ORT, a many-to-one regression Transformer that leverages multi-scale pathology images to jointly predict spatial transcriptomics gene expressions within a common spot.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing M2ORT, a many-to-one regression Transformer that leverages pathology images at multiple levels/scales to jointly predict gene expressions at a common spatial transcriptomics (ST) spot. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Conceptualizing the ST prediction problem as a many-to-one modeling problem to take advantage of the multi-scale information in the hierarchically structured whole slide images (WSIs). 

2) Proposing the M2ORT model architecture that is uniquely designed to model many-to-one regression relationships for effective ST prediction from multi-level pathology images.

3) Introducing optimization techniques like Intra-Level Token Mixing Module (ITMM) and Inter-Level Channel Mixing Module (ICMM) to improve computational efficiency of multi-scale feature extraction in M2ORT without compromising performance.

4) Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of M2ORT variants on three public ST datasets with fewer parameters and FLOPs compared to previous methods.

In summary, the key contribution is conceptualizing and implementing an efficient many-to-one regression Transformer (M2ORT) that leverages multi-scale pathology images to predict gene expressions in ST spots.
