# [Koopman Ensembles for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06757)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most existing implementations of the Koopman operator theory for dynamical systems forecasting are deterministic and cannot provide uncertainty estimates. However, quantifying uncertainty is important for applications like weather forecasting. 
- Ensembles of independently trained models tend to be overconfident in their predictions. The variance between members is much lower than the error between their average prediction and the ground truth.

Proposed Solutions:
- Introduce a variance-promoting loss term when training an ensemble to encourage diversity between members. The loss term penalizes low variance between members. 
- Analyze choice of weight λ for variance term: 
    - λ <= 1 ensures the term doesn't completely dominate training. 
    - Increasing λ monotonically increases variance between members.
    - Optimal λ is close to 1.
- Also propose training with a loss function that proxies the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS).

Experiments:
- Train ensembles on time series of satellite images over forests in France. One dataset for training, one for testing.
- Test temporal extrapolation skill on training set and spatial generalization to new area.
- Independently trained ensemble is very overconfident. Increasing λ improves uncertainty quantification and metrics like CRPS.
- Best variants use λ close to 1 or train with proxy for CRPS.

Main Contributions:
- Identify overconfidence issues when training ensembles of Koopman operator networks independently.
- Propose and analyze a new loss term to promote variance between ensemble members.
- Demonstrate improved uncertainty quantification from this approach over independent training on real-world spatiotemporal forecasting tasks.

The summary covers the key points on the problem being addressed, the solutions proposed, analysis performed, experimental validation, and the main contributions made in the paper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
