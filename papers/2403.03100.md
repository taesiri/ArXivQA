 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "NaturalSpeech 3: Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis with Factorized Codec and Diffusion Models":

Problem: 
Recent large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models still fall short in terms of speech quality, similarity, and prosody. This is because speech intricately encompasses various attributes (e.g. content, prosody, timbre, acoustic details) that pose significant challenges for generation. 

Proposed Solution:
1) Propose a novel neural speech codec (FACodec) that disentangles speech waveform into distinct subspaces representing content, prosody, timbre and acoustic details. This is achieved using factorized vector quantization, information bottleneck, supervised losses and adversarial training.

2) Propose a factorized diffusion model that generates attributes in each subspace with a corresponding prompt. This allows controlling different speech attributes using different prompts.

3) The overall TTS system (NaturalSpeech 3) combines the FACodec and factorized diffusion model in a divide-and-conquer approach to effectively model intricate speech attributes.

Main Contributions:
- Achieves new state-of-the-art for zero-shot TTS on quality, similarity, prosody and intelligibility. Outperforms previous top systems on metrics like CMOS, SIM-O, SMOS, MCD and WER.

- Enables control over speech attributes like timbre, prosody and speed by using different prompts.

- Demonstrates scalability to 1B parameters and 200K hours of training data, showing further improvements.

In summary, the key ideas are to disentangle complex speech waveform into subspaces using a novel codec, and generate each subspace separately with diffusion models and prompts. This advanced approach sets new benchmarks for controllable and high-quality zero-shot speech synthesis.
