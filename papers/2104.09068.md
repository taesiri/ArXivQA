# Image Inpainting with External-internal Learning and Monochromic   Bottleneck

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can image inpainting models improve both structure preservation and color consistency, especially for large missing regions?The key points related to this question are:- Existing image inpainting methods, including learning-based and patch-based approaches, still suffer from artifacts like abrupt colors and blurry structures when filling large missing regions. - Learning-based methods trained on large datasets tend to introduce inconsistent colors that don't match the image's color distribution. Patch-based internal methods maintain color consistency but fail to generate semantic content.- The authors propose combining the strengths of external learning from datasets and internal learning from a single image via an external-internal inpainting scheme.- Their method uses a monochromic bottleneck to facilitate external structure reconstruction. It then propagates colors internally within the image for consistency.- This complementary approach aims to improve structure preservation and color harmonization compared to prior inpainting techniques.In summary, the main research question is how to improve inpainting quality in terms of both structure and color, especially for large missing regions, via a combination of external dataset learning and internal image learning. The proposed external-internal scheme with a monochromic bottleneck is their solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel external-internal learning scheme for image inpainting. This involves first completing the monochrome image via external learning on large datasets, then colorizing the completed monochrome via internal learning on the single test image. 2. Designing a progressive internal color restoration network that achieves good colorization performance by combining local and global color context.3. Demonstrating that the proposed method can be applied to improve several existing deep inpainting models, leading to higher visual quality and better generalization across datasets. 4. Conducting extensive experiments and model analysis to evaluate the proposed approach. The results show the method produces more structure-preserving and visually harmonized results compared to prior inpainting techniques.In summary, the key contribution is an external-internal learning framework with a monochromic bottleneck that helps existing deep inpainting models generate more coherent content with fewer color artifacts. The method combines the benefits of learning semantic information externally from large datasets and propagating color statistics internally from a single image.
