# [Image Inpainting with External-internal Learning and Monochromic   Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09068)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can image inpainting models improve both structure preservation and color consistency, especially for large missing regions?

The key points related to this question are:

- Existing image inpainting methods, including learning-based and patch-based approaches, still suffer from artifacts like abrupt colors and blurry structures when filling large missing regions. 

- Learning-based methods trained on large datasets tend to introduce inconsistent colors that don't match the image's color distribution. Patch-based internal methods maintain color consistency but fail to generate semantic content.

- The authors propose combining the strengths of external learning from datasets and internal learning from a single image via an external-internal inpainting scheme.

- Their method uses a monochromic bottleneck to facilitate external structure reconstruction. It then propagates colors internally within the image for consistency.

- This complementary approach aims to improve structure preservation and color harmonization compared to prior inpainting techniques.

In summary, the main research question is how to improve inpainting quality in terms of both structure and color, especially for large missing regions, via a combination of external dataset learning and internal image learning. The proposed external-internal scheme with a monochromic bottleneck is their solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a novel external-internal learning scheme for image inpainting. This involves first completing the monochrome image via external learning on large datasets, then colorizing the completed monochrome via internal learning on the single test image. 

2. Designing a progressive internal color restoration network that achieves good colorization performance by combining local and global color context.

3. Demonstrating that the proposed method can be applied to improve several existing deep inpainting models, leading to higher visual quality and better generalization across datasets. 

4. Conducting extensive experiments and model analysis to evaluate the proposed approach. The results show the method produces more structure-preserving and visually harmonized results compared to prior inpainting techniques.

In summary, the key contribution is an external-internal learning framework with a monochromic bottleneck that helps existing deep inpainting models generate more coherent content with fewer color artifacts. The method combines the benefits of learning semantic information externally from large datasets and propagating color statistics internally from a single image.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new image inpainting method that combines external learning on large datasets to reconstruct structures in monochrome space and internal learning on a single image to propagate colors from non-missing regions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points about how this paper on image inpainting with external-internal learning compares to other research in this field:

- It introduces a novel approach of using external-internal learning for image inpainting. Most prior work has focused on either purely external learning from large datasets or purely internal learning from a single image. Combining both external and internal learning is a new idea proposed in this paper.

- The external-internal framework uses a monochromic bottleneck, which first reconstructs a grayscale image externally and then propagates color internally. This coarser-to-finer approach helps improve both structural coherence and color consistency compared to prior methods.

- The paper shows the external monochromic reconstruction stage improves generalization - models trained this way perform better on cross-dataset evaluation compared to models trained on RGB images. This indicates the monochromic bottleneck helps narrow the domain gap.

- For internal color propagation, the paper proposes a novel progressive network tailored for this task. It outperforms previous user-guided colorization methods by making full use of dense guidance with accurate correspondence in non-missing regions.

- The approach is demonstrated to boost performance for several existing inpainting models like GatedConv, EdgeConnect, and HiFill. So it is a general framework that can build on top of prior art.

- Both qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate noticeable improvements over baseline methods in terms of visual quality, color consistency, and structure preservation.

- Limitations include slower inference due to the added colorization stage, and failure cases for very large missing regions or when color hints are insufficient.

In summary, the key novelty is in the external-internal learning idea and monochromic bottleneck. The framework is shown to be effective for improving several existing inpainting models and benchmarks. The approach helps advance inpainting research toward producing more coherent structures with better color harmonization.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Expanding the external-internal learning scheme to other low-level vision tasks like super-resolution. The authors suggest the proposed approach could be generalized to improve other image reconstruction problems beyond inpainting.

- Accelerating the colorization procedure. The authors note that a limitation of their method is the slower inference speed due to the extra colorization stage. They suggest further work to speed up the internal color propagation. 

- Exploring different backbone architectures for the external monochromic reconstruction network. The authors experimented with several inpainting models as the reconstruction network but suggest further exploration of other architectures.

- Applying user guidance in more advanced ways. The authors give an example of allowing user-guided control over the inpainted content color but suggest this could be expanded to guide other attributes like style.

- Evaluating performance on additional datasets. While results on multiple datasets are given, the authors suggest further benchmarking, especially on datasets with larger domain gaps.

- Conducting further ablation studies. The authors perform some model analysis but suggest more ablation experiments could help verify their design choices.

- Testing the generalization ability to real-world use cases. Beyond standard datasets, evaluating the method on real user-provided images with unwanted objects to remove could better validate practical applicability.

In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding the approach to new tasks/datasets, improving efficiency and interaction, testing new backbone architectures, and conducting more rigorous empirical analysis. The authors propose their method as a general framework amenable to much further work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel image inpainting method that combines external learning on large datasets with internal learning on a single image. The method has two stages. First, a monochrome image is reconstructed by training an inpainting model on a large dataset. This external learning stage focuses on generating semantically correct content. Second, an internal color propagation network restores color to the completed monochrome image in a way that is consistent with the color distribution of the non-missing regions in the original image. This colorization network uses a progressive strategy to combine local and global color statistics. By learning externally on datasets and internally on a single image, the proposed approach produces inpainting results with more coherent structures and visually harmonized colors compared to previous methods. Experiments show consistent improvements when applying this scheme on top of different baseline inpainting models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new image inpainting method based on an external-internal learning scheme with monochromic bottlenecks. The method consists of two stages. In the first external learning stage, the model is trained on large datasets to reconstruct the structures and details in the monochromic space, which reduces the learning dimension from RGB to grayscale. This allows the model to focus on completing shapes and edges without being distracted by color. In the second internal learning stage, the completed monochrome image is colorized using a novel color propagation approach. This approach utilizes the color statistics only from the non-missing region of the input image to predict colors for the reconstructed area. By combining external semantic knowledge and internal color hints, the proposed method produces sharper structure completion with more harmonized colors compared to previous approaches.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by applying it to improve several existing deep inpainting models including GatedConv, EdgeConnect, HiFill and GMCNN. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple datasets show that the external-internal scheme leads to consistent gains in inpainting quality. The method performs well in reconstructing complex structures and propagating colors naturally even when the missing region is very large. Limitations include slower inference speed compared to vanilla models, and failure cases when the hole is extremely large or lacks color hints. Overall, the external-internal learning framework provides a new perspective to deep image inpainting.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:

This paper proposes an external-internal inpainting scheme with monochromic bottlenecks for image inpainting. The method first reconstructs the monochrome image by training externally on large datasets to generate semantically correct structures. It then restores colors for the monochrome image through internal learning that propagates colors from the non-missing regions to the missing regions in a single test image. Specifically, the external learning stage uses existing deep inpainting models to complete the monochrome structure. The internal learning stage proposes a novel progressive color propagation network that combines both local and global color statistics from the non-missing regions to fill in missing colors. By learning externally to complete structures and internally to harmonize colors, this method improves inpainting quality with fewer artifacts compared to previous approaches.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the problem of artifacts such as abrupt colors and blunt structures in image inpainting results generated by current deep learning methods. The key questions or goals the paper is trying to address are:

1. How to improve the structure preservation and visual quality of deep image inpainting models? 

2. How to eliminate abrupt color artifacts and make the inpainting results more visually harmonized with the surrounding non-masked regions?

3. How to make deep inpainting models generalize better across different datasets beyond the training distribution?

To address these issues, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel external-internal learning scheme with a monochromic bottleneck for image inpainting. The key ideas include:

- Learning externally on large datasets to capture semantic knowledge and complete structures in the monochromic space. This helps improve structure preservation and generalization across datasets.

- Learning internally to propagate colors from non-masked regions to masked regions in a single test image. This helps eliminate abrupt color artifacts and achieve visually harmonized results. 

- Using monochromic images as an intermediate representation to bridge external and internal learning. This reduces learning complexity and facilitates structure reconstruction.

So in summary, the paper aims to improve deep inpainting through a combination of external learning for structures and internal learning for colors, with a monochromic bottleneck connecting the two. The goal is to achieve results with better structure coherence and color consistency.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel external-internal learning scheme with monochromic bottlenecks for image inpainting. The method first reconstructs missing regions in the monochrome space by training on large datasets externally, which helps improve structure preservation due to reduced color distraction. It then restores colors internally using the non-missing regions of a single test image for better color consistency. Specifically, the external stage utilizes existing inpainting networks like GatedConv and modifies them to output monochrome instead of RGB images. This is shown to enable sharper structure reconstruction thanks to the simpler 1D optimization space compared to 3D RGB space. The internal stage propagates colors from known regions to missing areas using a custom progressive network that combines both local and global color context. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent visual improvements over baseline inpainting networks, with reduced color bleeding artifacts and more coherent structures. Both quantitative metrics and user studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The method helps enhance generalization ability for cross-dataset testing and can be easily applied to boost different backbone networks. Limitations include slower inference due to the extra colorization stage. Overall, the external-internal learning approach provides an effective way to leverage both external semantic information and internal color statistics for higher quality image inpainting.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new image inpainting method that combines external and internal learning to reconstruct missing image regions. The method has two stages. First, an external learning stage trains a model on a large dataset to reconstruct missing structures and details in the grayscale (monochrome) space, which reduces the learning complexity.

This avoids color bleeding artifacts common in existing methods. The external monochrome reconstruction improves structure coherence and generalizability across datasets compared to directly generating color outputs.
