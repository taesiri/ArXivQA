# [Cumulative Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04371)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) Can a method that decomposes complex reasoning tasks into smaller, iterative steps and leverages the strengths of large language models lead to improved performance on logical inference and math word problems compared to prior approaches? 

The paper proposes a new method called "Cumulative Reasoning" (CR) that employs language models cumulatively and iteratively to emulate human thought processes. The key hypothesis seems to be that by breaking down complex tasks into more manageable components, the CR approach can outperform existing methods, including chain-of-thought prompting (CoT) and tree-of-thought (ToT), on challenging reasoning tasks.

2) How does the performance of CR compare to CoT and ToT on logical inference (FOLIO wiki, AutoTNLI), math word problems (MATH dataset), and combinatorial puzzles (Game of 24)?

The paper conducts experiments across these different tasks to test whether CR can consistently achieve superior results over CoT and ToT baselines. The central hypothesis appears to be that CR will surpass these prior methods on all tasks.

3) Can CR effectively handle higher-order logic and generate interpretable intermediate steps? 

The paper argues that CR is more general than CoT or ToT and can represent the full complexity of human reasoning as a directed acyclic graph. A component of the hypothesis seems to be that CR can produce interpretable reasoning chains for problems involving higher-order logic.

In summary, the central research questions focus on whether the proposed CR technique can advance the state-of-the-art in language model reasoning through its iterative, cumulative approach across a diverse set of logical and mathematical tasks. Comparisons to CoT and ToT form a key part of assessing this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new method called Cumulative Reasoning (CR) that improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3/GPT-4. 

The key ideas of CR are:

- Decomposing complex reasoning tasks into smaller, more manageable components. This makes it easier for LLMs to learn and solve each part.

- Using multiple LLMs in different roles: a "proposer" suggests steps, "verifier(s)" check correctness, and a "reporter" decides when to stop. This emulates human thought processes.

- Maintaining a context of all past correct reasoning steps, stored as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This is more general than a simple chain or tree of reasoning.

The authors show empirically that CR outperforms existing methods like chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought prompting on logical inference tasks, the Game of 24, and math word problems. For example, on the curated FOLIO dataset, CR achieves 98.04% accuracy with GPT-4, compared to 96.09% for the next best method.

In summary, the core contribution is presenting CR as a new technique to decompose and explicitly guide LLM reasoning in a cumulative, iterative manner, leading to state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning tasks. The results demonstrate CR's potential as a general approach for improving LLM reasoning abilities.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of using large language models for logical reasoning:

Overall Approach:
- This paper proposes a new method called Cumulative Reasoning (CR) that uses multiple large language models (LLMs) iteratively to solve complex reasoning tasks. Other related works like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) also aim to improve reasoning with LLMs but take slightly different approaches.

- CoT prompts the LLM to provide step-by-step reasoning in a linear chain. ToT models the reasoning process as a tree search. CR is more general in that the reasoning can form an arbitrary directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure rather than just a chain or tree.

- The multi-agent framework with separate proposer, verifier, and reporter roles is unique to CR. Other methods mainly rely on a single LLM.

Results:
- CR achieves state-of-the-art results on logical inference datasets like FOLIO and AutoTNLI, outperforming CoT and ToT.

- On the challenging MATH dataset, CR surpasses the previous best method, Complex CoT, by 4.2% overall accuracy. The gains are especially significant on the hardest problems.

- For the Game of 24 challenge, CR substantially boosts accuracy by 24% over ToT.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel CR approach that advances the state-of-the-art in logical reasoning with LLMs. The multi-agent framework and iterative DAG-based reasoning appear more powerful than prior CoT or ToT methods. The consistent accuracy improvements across experiments highlight the benefits of the CR technique.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions in the paper:

- Further combining \ourmethod (\ourname) with symbolic reasoning systems. The current implementation of \ourname uses language models for both the proposer and verifier roles. The authors suggest exploring hybrid systems where the verifier leverages symbolic reasoning like formal logic provers. This could further enhance the accuracy and explainability. 

- Applying \ourname to more complex mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. The paper demonstrates strong results on logical inference, the Game of 24 puzzles, and the MATH dataset. The authors suggest exploring more advanced mathematics, logic, and other complex reasoning domains.

- Pretraining the proposer model on task-specific corpora. The current implementation uses a generic LLM like GPT-3 for the proposer. Pretraining on step-by-step solutions could improve proposition generation.

- Scaling up the models and compute resources. Larger LLMs like GPT-4 have context length limitations. Scaling up model size, training data, and compute could remove these bottlenecks.

- Optimizing the prompting strategies. There are many prompt design choices like temperature, top-p sampling, etc. Further prompt engineering could boost performance.

- Exploring different search strategies. The current beam search could be replaced by more advanced search algorithms like Monte Carlo tree search.

- Analysis of failure cases and errors. More in-depth analysis of incorrect predictions could provide insight into limitations and guide improvements.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the reasoning capabilities through hybrid symbolic systems, applying \ourname to more complex tasks, optimizing the training and prompting strategies, exploring different search algorithms, and rigorous analysis of errors and failures.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Cumulative Reasoning (CR) that employs language models iteratively and cumulatively to solve complex reasoning tasks. CR decomposes tasks into smaller components by using three distinct language models - a proposer, verifier(s), and reporter. The proposer suggests the next step, the verifier(s) check its accuracy, and the reporter decides when to stop and give the final answer. This allows CR to emulate human thought processes in a more nuanced way compared to prior methods like chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought prompting. Empirical results on logical inference datasets, the Game of 24, and math word problems show CR achieves new state-of-the-art performance. On FOLIO wiki curated, CR attains 98.04% accuracy using GPT-4, almost doubling the accuracy of GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting. For the Game of 24, CR improves accuracy by 24% over tree-of-thought search. On the MATH dataset, CR establishes a new overall record of 58.0%, surpassing the prior best approach by 4.2% margin. The significant gains demonstrate CR's effectiveness in enhancing language models' reasoning and problem-solving abilities.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Cumulative Reasoning (CR) that employs language models iteratively to emulate human thought processes for solving complex reasoning tasks. CR uses three distinct language models - a proposer, verifier(s), and reporter - in an iterative loop. The proposer proposes potential steps, the verifier(s) check their validity, and the reporter decides when to conclude and output the final answer. By decomposing complex tasks into smaller, more manageable components, CR is able to effectively tackle problems that language models struggle with when approached directly. 

The paper demonstrates CR's effectiveness across three experiments spanning logical inference, math word problems, and the Game of 24. On logical inference tasks like FOLIO wiki and AutoTNLI, CR achieves state-of-the-art results, with up to 9.3% higher accuracy than existing methods. On a curated version of FOLIO wiki, CR attains 98.04% accuracy with GPT-4. For the Game of 24, CR boosts accuracy by 24% over the previous best method. Finally, on the challenging MATH dataset, CR establishes new state-of-the-art accuracy of 58.0%, exceeding the prior top approach by 4.2% overall and achieving substantial gains on the hardest problems. The results highlight CR's ability to enhance language models' reasoning capacities across diverse tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Cumulative Reasoning (CR) that employs large language models (LLMs) in an iterative and cumulative manner to emulate human thought processes for solving complex reasoning tasks. The key idea is to decompose complex tasks into smaller, more manageable components. The method uses three distinct LLMs - a proposer, verifier(s), and reporter. The proposer proposes potential intermediate reasoning steps based on the current context. The verifier(s) check the validity of the proposed steps and only add valid ones to the context. Finally, the reporter decides when to stop the reasoning process and provide the final answer. By maintaining a context of intermediate results and using the LLMs iteratively in complementary roles, the method is able to effectively tackle complex logical, mathematical, and commonsense reasoning problems that pose challenges for standard LLM prompting techniques. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on logical inference, Game of 24, and math word problems.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, this paper is addressing the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in solving complex reasoning tasks. Specifically:

- LLMs often struggle to provide accurate and stable answers for highly complex problems, even though they have shown impressive capabilities on various tasks. 

- The authors hypothesize this is because LLMs are trained to sequentially predict the next token without deliberate thinking, more akin to an instinctive "System 1" form of reasoning rather than a methodical "System 2".

- Existing methods to enhance reasoning, like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), have limitations in fully capturing the complexity of human reasoning.

To address these issues, the key question this paper tries to tackle is: 

How can we develop a reasoning framework to better mimic human thought processes for directing LLM reasoning on complex tasks?

The proposed approach is a new method called Cumulative Reasoning (CR) that decomposes complex problems into more manageable components and iteratively accumulates information through different LLMs playing specialized reasoning roles.

In summary, the paper aims to address the limitations of LLMs for complex reasoning via a more human-like approach of cumulative and iterative reasoning embodied in the CR framework. The core problems are the instability and inaccuracy of LLMs for complex tasks, and their misalignment with human reasoning.
