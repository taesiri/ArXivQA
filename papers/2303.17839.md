# [Learning Procedure-aware Video Representation from Instructional Videos   and Their Narrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17839)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is to learn video representations that encode both the concepts of individual action steps as well as their temporal ordering, for the task of understanding procedural activities. 

The central hypothesis is that jointly learning these two aspects - step concepts and their temporal dependencies - from unlabeled instructional videos and narrations can enable new capabilities like step classification, forecasting, and sequence modeling, without needing manual annotations.

Specifically, the key research questions addressed are:

- How to learn step concept representations from instructional videos and narrations in a self-supervised manner? The paper uses a video-text matching objective with CLIP.

- How to model temporal dependencies and orderings of steps? The paper proposes a novel deep probabilistic model based on diffusion processes. 

- What capabilities does this joint learningframework enable? The paper demonstrates strong performance on step classification, forecasting, zero-shot inference, and generating diverse predictions.

- How does modeling temporal order compare with learning individual steps? Ablations show modeling order reinforces step concept learning and enables forecasting.

In summary, the central focus is on developing and evaluating an approach to jointly learn step concepts and their temporal dynamics from unlabeled video-text pairs, to support new capabilities in understanding procedural activities. The paper presents strong empirical validation of this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is learning video representations that encode both action steps and their temporal ordering from instructional videos and narrations, without using human annotations. Specifically:

- They propose jointly learning a video representation to encode individual step concepts, and a deep probabilistic model to capture temporal dependencies and variations in step ordering. 

- The video representation is learned by matching video clips to narrations. The probabilistic model, built with a diffusion process, is tasked to predict the distribution of the video representation for a missing step given steps in its vicinity.

- The model is trained using only videos and narrations from automatic speech recognition, without requiring manual annotations. 

- Once trained, the model supports zero-shot inference for step classification and forecasting, and can sample multiple video representations when predicting a missing step to provide diverse, plausible options.

- They demonstrate the model achieves state-of-the-art results on step classification and forecasting on the COIN and EPIC-Kitchens datasets. It also enables promising zero-shot inference and generation of diverse step predictions.

In summary, the key innovation is a joint learning framework and probabilistic model for learning video representations that capture both individual step concepts as well as their temporal ordering from unlabeled instructional videos and narrations. This enables new capabilities for procedure understanding and reasoning.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper focuses on learning video representations that capture both action steps and their temporal ordering from instructional videos and narrations. Most prior work has focused just on recognizing individual action steps, not modeling the temporal dependencies. Modeling the ordering is a novel contribution.

- The method uses a joint learning framework with a video encoder to capture step concepts and a diffusion model to capture temporal ordering. Using a diffusion model to capture temporal dependencies is a new approach compared to prior work. 

- The paper demonstrates strong results on step classification and forecasting without needing any human annotations during training. It leverages narrations from ASR and a pre-trained image-text model. Not needing annotations is a benefit over supervised methods.

- It establishes new state-of-the-art results on the COIN and EPIC-Kitchens datasets for step classification and forecasting. The gains are significant over prior methods, highlighting the benefits of modeling temporal ordering.

- The method supports zero-shot inference for step classification and forecasting. It also allows sampling multiple predictions, providing access to diverse solutions. These capabilities are unique compared to other action recognition techniques.

- The approach is evaluated on a large-scale pre-training dataset (HowTo100M) and two challenging benchmarks (COIN, Epic-Kitchens). The breadth of evaluation is more extensive than most prior video representation learning papers.

Overall, by modeling temporal ordering and leveraging narrations without annotations, this paper presents important innovations over prior work on understanding procedural activities. The joint learning framework, diffusion probabilistic model, and strong empirical results clearly advance the state-of-the-art in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Explore other diffusion models and denoising schemes that can better capture the complex temporal dependencies and variations in procedural activities. The authors mention variational autoencoders as another probabilistic model worth exploring for this task.

- Investigate how to extend the model to support long-range temporal reasoning beyond just adjacent steps, potentially by incorporating external knowledge or multi-scale modeling. 

- Evaluate the model on a wider range of procedural activities and datasets beyond just instructional videos. The authors suggest applying it to domains like robotics and human-computer interaction.

- Improve video-language pre-training and alignment between videos and narrations, which is currently a bottleneck for learning from web instructional videos. Ideas include better handling of noisy ASR transcripts.

- Study the multimodality of the learned video representations and use it for controllable video generation and highlighting key moments. The authors demonstrate potential for this through their key frame generation experiments.

- Explore integrating user interactions for online adaptation and personalization of the model. The ability to sample multiple predictions makes the model suitable for interactive applications.

- Investigate social aspects like modeling multiple agents and their interactions in procedural activities, instead of just a single agent.

In summary, the main future directions are developing more advanced temporal reasoning capabilities, applying the model to new domains and tasks, improving video-language pre-training, leveraging the multimodality of the representations, and incorporating interactivity and multi-agent modeling. The authors lay out an extensive research agenda building on their work.
