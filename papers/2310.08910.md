# [Scalarization for Multi-Task and Multi-Domain Learning at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08910)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) How do model capacity and dataset size impact the effectiveness of multi-task and multi-domain learning with scalarization? The authors investigate how MTL/MDL performance with scalarization changes under different model capacities and dataset sizes.

2) How robust are optimal scalarization weights to changes in model capacity? The authors examine whether tuning scalarization weights on a smaller model can provide a good initialization for larger models. 

3) How do model capacity and scalarization weights impact conflicting gradients during MTL training? The authors analyze the dynamics of conflicting gradients under different model capacities and scalarization schemes.

4) Can population-based training provide an efficient way to tune scalarization weights as the number of tasks/domains grows? The authors propose using PBT to tackle the exponential growth of the scalarization weights search space.

In summary, the central goals seem to be: 1) Understanding how model capacity impacts MTL/MDL with scalarization, 2) Analyzing the robustness of scalarization weights across capacities, 3) Studying gradient conflicts during MTL training, and 4) Leveraging PBT for efficient hyperparameter tuning of scalarization weights. The overarching motivation appears to be gaining new insights into scalarization as a simple yet effective approach to MTL/MDL.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- A large-scale analysis investigating the effects of model capacity on multi-task learning (MTL) and multi-domain learning (MDL) performance. The key findings were that larger model capacities tend to benefit more from joint MTL/MDL training, and tuning scalarization weights is important for optimal performance.

- An analysis showing that conflicting gradients naturally emerge during MTL training, but their presence does not strongly correlate with final MTL performance. This challenges the view that reducing gradient conflicts is critical for MTL.  

- A proposal to use population-based training to efficiently search the large space of possible scalarization weights when training with many tasks/domains. Experiments showed this could find good weightings that outperform more complex optimization techniques.

- Overall, the work provides evidence that simple scalarization training can be highly effective for MTL/MDL if the scalarization weights are properly tuned. The authors advocate using scalable hyperparameter search methods like population-based training rather than more costly gradient-based multi-task optimization techniques.

In summary, the key contributions seem to be providing new insights into the dynamics and effectiveness of scalarization for MTL/MDL, challenging some common assumptions, and showing how to make scalarization more practical and scalable.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using population-based training to efficiently search the space of scalarization weights for multi-task and multi-domain learning, showing it can outperform more complex optimization methods and that tuning the scalarization weights is crucial for optimal performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in multi-task and multi-domain learning:

- The paper provides a large-scale empirical analysis of scalarization for both multi-task and multi-domain learning. Many prior works have focused on just one of these settings, so the side-by-side comparison on diverse datasets and model architectures provides useful insights.

- The authors investigate the impact of model capacity on the benefits of multi-task/multi-domain learning. Some prior works have hinted at this relationship, but this paper systematically analyzes it across multiple model sizes. The finding that benefits tend to increase with larger models is an important result.

- The analysis of gradient conflicts during training and their lack of correlation with final performance challenges assumptions in many prior multi-task optimization works. The authors provide evidence that reducing conflicts may not be as critical as previously thought.

- The use of population-based training to efficiently tune scalarization weights is novel. Most prior work has focused on hand-tuning these weights or using simple heuristics. Demonstrating a scalable hyperparameter search method is a valuable contribution.

- Compared to state-of-the-art multi-task optimization methods, the simplicity and efficiency of scalarization is appealing. By showing it can match or exceed performance when weights are properly tuned, this paper makes a strong case for scalarization as a practical baseline.

- One limitation shared with some other works is the focus on supervised multi-task learning benchmarks. Extending this analysis to semi-supervised, self-supervised, or reinforcement learning settings could provide additional insights.

Overall, the large-scale empirical analysis and insights around model capacity, gradient conflicts, and efficient hyperparameter tuning help advance our understanding of multi-task and multi-domain learning compared to prior works. The paper makes a compelling argument for the strength and practicality of scalarization.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring more advanced population-based hyperparameter optimization methods beyond PBT, such as Population Based Bandits, to efficiently search the space of scalarization weights as the number of tasks grows. The authors suggest PB2 may offer better performance and theoretical guarantees.

- Extending the analysis to settings with more than 2 tasks/domains. The authors mainly focus on the two task/domain case for their experiments and analysis. Scaling up the insights to more complex MTL/MDL settings is an important next step.

- Applying the insights on model capacity and scalarization weights to more diverse MTL architectures and benchmarks. The authors acknowledge their conclusions are based on an experimental study, so testing the generality across more architectures and datasets would be valuable.

- Further investigation into the relationship between model capacity, scalarization weights, gradient conflicts, and final MTL performance. While the authors provide interesting analysis, more work is needed to fully understand these dynamics.

- Developing multi-objective versions of PBT/PB2 for directly optimizing the Pareto front of MTL models. The authors note standard PBT may struggle with multiple competing objectives.

- Exploring whether insights on optimal scalarization weights transfer across model sizes in the same architecture family can be leveraged to make hyperparameter search more efficient.

- Analysis of MTL/MDL benefits for modern architectures like Transformers, which have a different capacity scaling compared to CNNs used in this work.

Overall, the main themes seem to be 1) scaling up the scalarization approach to more complex MTL settings, 2) more sophisticated hyperparameter search for scalarization weights, and 3) further analysis to strengthen the theoretical understanding of model capacity, scalarization and gradient conflicts in MTL.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using scalarization, which optimizes a weighted sum of task losses, for efficient multi-task and multi-domain learning. It analytically investigates the impact of model capacity on the benefits of multi-task/multi-domain learning and finds that larger models tend to gain more from joint training. The authors show the importance of tuning scalarization weights for optimal performance and analyze gradient conflicts during training, finding they are not well correlated with final performance. To efficiently search the large space of scalarization weights, the authors leverage population-based training. Key results are demonstrated on multi-domain learning benchmarks like DomainNet and CIFAR+STL as well as multi-task datasets including CelebA and Taskonomy. Overall, the work provides insights into training dynamics and presents scalarization as a simple yet strong baseline for multi-task and multi-domain learning compared to more complex state-of-the-art optimization techniques.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents an analysis of scalarization, a simple approach to multi-task and multi-domain learning that trains on a weighted sum of task losses. The authors perform large-scale experiments varying model capacity, dataset sizes, and task combinations. Their key conclusions are: (1) Larger models tend to benefit more from multi-task/multi-domain training compared to training on individual tasks. (2) Tuning scalarization weights is crucial for optimal performance, but relative rankings are consistent across model sizes. This suggests weights found on smaller models transfer well to full models. (3) Gradient conflicts naturally emerge during training but are minimally impacted by model capacity or scalarization weights. This questions whether explicitly avoiding conflicts is needed. (4) Population-based training can efficiently search the large space of scalarization weights. 

In detail, the authors first analyze multi-domain and multi-task performance with two tasks across various model sizes. They find joint training increasingly outperforms individual task training as model capacity grows. The optimal scalarization weights differ significantly from uniform and depend on the task combination, but relative rankings are stable across model sizes. Next, they measure conflicting gradients during training and find minimal correlation with model capacity or final performance. This suggests constant conflict avoidance may be unnecessary. Finally, they demonstrate population-based training can efficiently search the exponential space of scalarization weights. On DomainNet and CelebA benchmarks, it finds better weights than standard grid search. In summary, the work provides new insights into training dynamics and demonstrates scalarization as an effective baseline for multi-task/multi-domain learning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using population-based training (PBT) to efficiently search for optimal scalarization weights when training multi-task learning (MTL) and multi-domain learning (MDL) models. Scalarization refers to optimizing the weighted average of task/domain losses, where the weights determine each task/domain's importance. Tuning these weights is crucial but the search space grows exponentially with more tasks/domains. PBT allows efficient hyperparameter search by training a population of models in parallel, periodically replacing the worst ones with copies of the best (exploit), and perturbing the copies' weights (explore). After search, the best weight schedule found by PBT is used to train a model on the full dataset. Compared to standard grid/random search, PBT enables fast exploration of the large search space of possible scalarization weights. Experiments on DomainNet and CelebA benchmarks show PBT finding better-performing weights than default uniform averaging.

- The paper is investigating efficient and scalable training of multi-task learning (MTL) and multi-domain learning (MDL) models, where a single model is trained on multiple tasks or input domains. 

- In particular, it focuses on the simple but effective approach of "scalarization" where the model is trained by minimizing a weighted average of the task/domain losses. The key difficulty is selecting good weights for this loss averaging.

- The paper first performs a large-scale analysis of scalarization, investigating the impact of model capacity and scalarization weights on MTL/MDL performance. The key findings are:

  - Larger model capacities tend to benefit more from MTL/MDL compared to training only on individual tasks/domains.

  - Tuning the scalarization weights is crucial to get optimal MTL/MDL performance. The relative ranking of good weights is often consistent across model capacities.

  - Conflicting gradients naturally emerge during training but do not strongly correlate with final MTL performance.

- To efficiently search the large space of possible scalarization weights, the paper proposes using population-based training. Experiments on DomainNet and CelebA datasets demonstrate this is a promising approach.

- Overall, the paper aims to provide insights into training dynamics and performance trade-offs of scalarization for MTL/MDL. The goal is to motivate scalarization as a simple yet strong baseline, which can be further improved via techniques like population-based weight tuning.

In summary, the key question addressed is how to effectively and efficiently train multi-task models using the simple but often overlooked approach of scalarization. The paper provides analysis and techniques to make scalarization more competitive with more complex state-of-the-art MTL optimization methods.
