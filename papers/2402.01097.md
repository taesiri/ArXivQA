# [Let's Negotiate! A Survey of Negotiation Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01097)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Let's Negotiate! A Survey of Negotiation Dialogue Systems":

Problem Statement:
Negotiation is an important human ability for resolving conflicts and reaching mutually beneficial agreements. However, humans often lack necessary skills for effective negotiation. Recent advances in dialogue systems present an opportunity for developing intelligent agents that can assist humans in negotiation. Although there has been growing interest in this area, there has not been a systematic review of negotiation dialogue systems. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of negotiation dialogue systems. It first discusses limitations of human negotiations from a social sciences perspective, highlighting issues like cognitive biases and lack of skills. The paper argues that dialogue agents can help address these issues. It then categorizes existing research into:

(1) Strategy Modeling - Modeling negotiation strategies like win-win, win-lose, and multi-party strategies.

(2) Negotiator Modeling - Modeling characteristics of negotiators like preferences, emotions, behaviors. 

(3) Action Learning - Mapping strategies to actions using reinforcement learning, supervised learning or in-context learning.

The paper also summarizes datasets based on negotiation type (integrative vs. distributive). It discusses evaluation methods including goal-based metrics, game-based metrics and human evaluation.

Main Contributions:
- Provides first systematic review of negotiation dialogue systems covering methodology, datasets and evaluation
- Categorizes negotiation strategies, negotiator modeling techniques, and policy learning methods
- Summarizes 14 existing negotiation dialogue benchmarks 
- Discusses limitations of current systems and outlines promising future directions like multi-modal dialogues across cultures

In summary, this is a comprehensive survey that structures the growing research area of negotiation dialogue systems, analyzes the state-of-the-art, and offers insights to guide future work towards real-world applicable systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides a systematic review of negotiation dialogue systems, summarizing the motivation from social sciences, methodology, datasets, evaluation metrics, and future research directions in this field.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes three main contributions:

(i) It points out human limitations in negotiation and systematically summarizes existing AI solutions aiming to address those limitations.

(ii) It systematically categorizes current negotiation dialogue benchmarks from a distributive and integrative perspective, and provides an overview of evaluation methods. 

(iii) It points out current limitations and promising future research directions for negotiation dialogue systems, including multi-modal, multi-party and cross-cultural negotiation scenarios.

In summary, this paper provides a systematic review of contemporary research efforts in the field of negotiation dialogue systems, covering benchmarks, evaluation metrics and modeling approaches. The goal is to provide the community with an overview of this research area and inspire future work.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper on negotiation dialogue systems include:

- Negotiation dialogue systems - The paper provides a survey and review of research on intelligent agents and systems aimed at assisting with or directly participating in negotiations and resolving conflicts through multi-turn conversational interactions.

- Preferences - Modeling opponent preferences and priorities to infer their interests and goals.

- Emotions - Modeling the emotions and emotional transitions of negotiators. 

- Actions - Action learning methods like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and in-context learning to map negotiation strategies and preferences into system responses and behaviors.

- Benchmarks - Summary of existing datasets and testbeds for evaluating negotiation dialogue systems, covering domains like price bargaining, persuasion, and job interviews.

- Evaluations - Goal-based metrics, game-based metrics, and human evaluations used to assess performance of negotiation dialogue systems.

- Future directions - Multi-modal interactions, multi-party scenarios, cross-cultural dialogues, and real-world applications.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper on negotiation dialogue systems:

1. The paper discusses three main approaches for modeling negotiation dialogues: strategy modeling, negotiator modeling, and action learning. Can you explain the key differences and relationships between these three approaches? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?

2. The paper mentions several techniques for strategy modeling such as integrative strategies, distributive strategies, and multi-party strategies. Can you elaborate more on these different types of strategies? What kinds of real-world scenarios might they apply to and how do you model them computationally? 

3. When modeling a negotiator, the paper discusses preference modeling, emotion modeling, and opponent behavior modeling. Why is explicitly modeling these aspects of a negotiator important for negotiation dialogue systems? What are some challenges in computationally modeling these abstract concepts?

4. For action learning, the paper overviews reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and in-context learning techniques that have been applied. Can you explain these techniques in more detail, including algorithmic details? What are the comparative strengths and weaknesses?

5. The paper introduces several negotiation dialogue datasets across different scenarios like strategic games, job interviews, privacy protection etc. What makes collecting and annotating negotiation dialogue datasets inherently challenging? How can future datasets address some of these challenges?  

6. What evaluation metrics have been proposed for negotiation dialogue systems in the literature? Why is a combination of automated goal-based metrics, game-based metrics, and human evaluation ideal? What open problems exist in reliably evaluating these systems?

7. The paper proposes several promising future directions like multi-modal dialogues and cross-cultural dialogues. What unique research problems do these directions pose from a technical perspective? And what new datasets might need to be collected?

8. Can you think of any other promising future directions for advancing negotiation dialogue systems beyond what was discussed in the paper? What research problems would they entail?

9. How close do you believe existing negotiation dialogue systems are to being deployable in real-world applications? What key breakthroughs are still needed to make them reliably useful? 

10. What ethical concerns and biases need to be considered if deploying negotiation dialogue agents to interact with humans in high-stakes scenarios? How can we safeguard against potential harms?
