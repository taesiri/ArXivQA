# [Improving Vietnamese-English Medical Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19161)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- There is a growing need for high-quality Vietnamese-English machine translation in the medical domain to support medical education and healthcare in Vietnam. However, existing parallel datasets are small and lack coverage of the medical domain.

- This paper introduces MedEV - a new high-quality parallel corpus of 358,700 Vietnamese-English sentence pairs specifically for the medical domain, enabling research into improving translation for this domain.

Data Collection and Dataset
- The MedEV dataset was constructed from publicly available resources, consisting of abstracts, manuals, thesis summaries and article translations. Great care was taken in the alignment and processing of the sentences to ensure quality.

- The dataset contains 340k pairs for training, and around 9k pairs each for validation and testing. A manual examination found minimal misalignment, confirming the quality.

Experiments 
- The paper conducts comprehensive experiments comparing Google Translate, ChatGPT, pretrained models like mBART, and specialized Vietnamese-English models.

- Without domain-specific fine-tuning, Google Translate performs the best. Fine-tuning significantly improves performance, with vinai-translate achieving over 4 BLEU point gains over Google Translate.

- Analysis shows clear benefits from more in-domain training data. Performance also varies across genres and sentence lengths.

Conclusion
- The models and analysis demonstrate the utility of MedEV for advancing Vietnamese-English medical translation. The public release of MedEV provides an invaluable resource to spur further research.

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions through the development of MedEV and extensive experiments highlighting potential for improvements on this important translation task.
