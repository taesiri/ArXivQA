# [The pitfalls of next-token prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper challenges the effectiveness of next-token prediction frameworks like teacher-forcing for training language models that can plan ahead and solve complex reasoning tasks. 
- It argues that existing criticisms of next-token prediction focus on failures during autoregressive inference due to error compounding. However, these assume teacher-forcing has already learned an accurate next-token predictor, which may not be the case.

Proposed Failure Modes of Teacher-Forcing:
- The paper identifies two key issues that can arise during teacher-forcing training in "lookahead tasks" that require anticipating future tokens:
  1) Clever Hans Cheating: Model exploits ground truth tokens revealed by teacher to simplistically fit later tokens, without learning true task structure. This diminishes useful training signal.
  2) Indecipherable Token: Due to 1), model loses supervision signal to properly learn initial token(s), as information about later tokens is absorbed by the cheat. So the initial token(s) become impossible to fit.

- Together, these can cause in-distribution failure even if trained on infinite data.

Verifying Failure Modes:
- Paper designs a simple path-finding task on graphs that requires lookahead, and is straightforward to solve.
- Empirically demonstratescomplete in-distribution failure of Transformers and Mamba architecture due to above mechanisms, despite task simplicity.
- Additional experiments confirm and quantify extent of Clever Hans cheating and indecipherability of first token under standard training.

Alternatives to Circumvent Failure:
- Finds that "teacherless" training (no ground truth tokens revealed during training) prevents cheating and enables learning, verifying hypotheses.
- Reversing targets also removes indecipherable token by eliminating need for lookahead, enabling learning.

Contributions:
- Conceptually articulates and empirically demonstrates new failure modes stemming from teacher-forcing, beyond existing criticisms.
- Shows remarkably, teacher-forcing fails on simple tasks requiring lookahead.
- Provides initial evidence that teacherless training is a promising approach to mitigate issues.
- Lays precise groundwork to inspire research on limitations of and alternatives to next-token prediction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper argues that next-token prediction, a core technique in modern language models, can fail to learn accurate planning even on simple problems due to detrimental mechanisms that emerge during teacher-forced training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It crystallizes existing criticisms against next-token prediction, and articulates new core arguments, differentiating between failures due to autoregressive inference vs teacher-forcing.

2. It conceptually argues that in "lookahead tasks", teacher-forcing can give rise to problematic learning mechanisms like the Clever Hans cheat and the Indecipherable Token, that cause models to fail even on in-distribution data. 

3. It designs a minimal path-finding task that requires lookahead, where popular models like the Transformer and Mamba fail due to the above mechanisms, despite the task being straightforward.

4. It provides preliminary evidence that teacherless training to predict multiple future tokens can circumvent some of these failures in certain settings.

5. Overall, it sets the debate around next-token prediction on more solid conceptual and empirical ground, demonstrating limits of the paradigm even in a simple setting, and inspiring ideas like teacherless training to move forward.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Next-token prediction - The paper focuses on analyzing and critiquing this core technique used in modern language models where models are trained to predict the next token in a sequence. 

- Autoregressive models - Models that generate sequences token-by-token, with each token conditioned on previously generated tokens. Next-token prediction underlies autoregressive generation.

- Teacher-forcing - A technique used during training where the model is provided ground truth previous tokens as context to predict the next token. This is contrasted with autoregressive inference.

- Lookahead tasks - Tasks that require planning or predicting later tokens before earlier tokens. The paper argues these tasks are challenging for teacher-forced next-token prediction.

- Clever Hans cheat - A failure mode identified where teacher-forcing allows models to exploit ground truth prefixes to spuriously fit later tokens. 

- Indecipherable token - Another failure mode where after the Clever Hans cheat, early tokens lose supervision and become impossible to fit.

- Path-finding - A minimal planning task designed to demonstrate the pitfalls of next-token prediction.

- Teacherless training - An alternative training approach proposed where models predict multiple future tokens without ground truth prefixes.

The key high-level ideas are critically analyzing the next-token prediction paradigm and identifying potential pitfalls, especially on planning-related tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that the two often-conflated phases of next-token prediction --- autoregressive inference and teacher-forced training --- must be treated distinctly. Can you elaborate on the key differences between these two phases and why it's important to distinguish between them when analyzing the pitfalls of next-token prediction?

2. The paper introduces the concept of "Clever Hans cheating" that can emerge during teacher-forced training in certain types of tasks. Can you explain this concept in more detail and discuss how it can undermine learning the true mechanisms for solving problems that require lookahead? 

3. When discussing the Clever Hans cheating effect, the paper argues that "these shortcuts are unlike previously-identified shortcuts". How exactly are the Clever Hans cheats induced by teacher-forcing different from other types of shortcuts identified in prior work?

4. The Indecipherable Token failure is identified as another problematic effect stemming from teacher-forced training. Walk through the intuition provided in the paper for why and how the difficult, early tokens can become "indecipherable" as a result of the Clever Hans cheat absorbing away critical supervision signals.  

5. The paper empirically demonstrates total in-distribution failure on a path-finding task for both Transformer and Mamba models, despite the task being straightforward to solve. What does this remarkable failure tell us about the limits of next-token prediction during training?

6. Explain the effect of using "teacherless training" where the model is trained to predict multiple future tokens without ground truth prefixes revealed. How does this objective differ from standard teacher-forcing and why does it help mitigate some of the identified pitfalls?

7. The success of training the models on reversed targets is presented as evidence that teacher-forcing induces fundamental issues in learning to plan ahead. Unpack this argument and discuss how reversing the targets alleviates some of the key problems identified with the standard next-token prediction objective.  

8. The paper speculates that similar issues stemming from teacher-forcing could arise in more complex tasks like story generation that require creative lookahead planning. Walk through the informal illustration provided in Section 5.2 and relate it to the overall conceptual arguments made in the paper.  

9. What are some limitations of the conceptual arguments and empirical analyses provided in the paper? What are interesting open questions for future work to address regarding pitfalls of next-token prediction?

10. The positive results on teacherless training are presented as motivation for exploring alternatives to next-token prediction in practice. What other promising paradigms beyond teacher-forcing have been proposed in recent work that could mitigate some of the identified issues?
