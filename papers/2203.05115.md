# [Internet-augmented language models through few-shot prompting for   open-domain question answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05115)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we capitalize on the powerful few-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LSLMs) to overcome their limitations with respect to grounding predictions on factual and up-to-date information?

Specifically, the authors aim to use few-shot prompting to condition LSLMs on relevant evidence retrieved from the web, without needing to fine-tune the models. Their goal is to improve the factuality and reduce the hallucinations of LSLM predictions for open-domain question answering.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that retrieving external evidence from the web and using few-shot prompting to condition large language models on this evidence can improve their performance on open-domain QA by grounding them in factual information. The authors test this through experiments on several QA datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

- Proposing a method to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations in large language models (LSLMs) for open-domain question answering, by conditioning them on documents retrieved from the web using few-shot prompting. This allows incorporating external evidence without fine-tuning or adding parameters.

- Demonstrating that LSLMs conditioned on web search results (Google Search API) improve performance over closed-book LSLMs across a diverse set of question answering datasets and task formats (single-hop, multi-hop, generation, classification).

- Showing that smaller LSLMs conditioned on web search can match or exceed the performance of larger closed-book LSLMs, suggesting prompting and increased inference-time compute could be an alternative to endless model scaling.

- Introducing scoring functions based on probabilistic factorizations that allow reranking of multiple candidate answers to further improve performance, using probabilities derived via prompting the same LSLMs.

- Providing evidence that web search engines like Google Search can be effectively integrated with LSLMs in a zero-shot way, achieving strong retrieval performance compared to Wikipedia-based dense retrievers.

- Highlighting limitations of this approach on complex multi-hop questions, and discussing broader challenges and opportunities around using web search to keep LSLMs up-to-date.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a simple yet effective method for grounding LSLMs in external web documents retrieved at inference time, demonstrating improvements in factuality and potential for scalability via prompting and increased inference compute.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using few-shot prompting to condition large language models on documents retrieved from the web in order to improve their performance on open-domain question answering tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in open-domain question answering:

- Uses few-shot prompting to condition large language models (LLMs) on retrieved evidence, rather than fine-tuning or adding extra trainable parameters. This makes the approach lightweight and applicable to any pre-trained LLM. Other semi-parametric QA systems typically require some amount of training/fine-tuning.

- Leverages Google Search to retrieve evidence from the broader web, going beyond Wikipedia which is commonly used. Using web search for QA is an emerging trend, but most prior work focuses on fine-tuning or reinforcement learning to integrate the search results.

- Emphasizes establishing strong baselines via few-shot prompting before moving to more complex approaches. Provides analysis on a range of QA datasets rather than just open-ended dialog.

- Finds that increasing inference-time compute via answer reranking and multiple evidence can improve performance, rather than just scaling model size. Connects to recent interest in prompting and inference-time interventions instead of just bigger models.

- Shows that conditioning smaller LMs on web evidence via few-shot learning can match or beat larger closed-book LMs. This contrasts with the conventional wisdom that model scale is the primary driver of few-shot performance.

Overall, the paper provides useful insights on the utility of web search and targeted prompting for open-domain QA. The analysis on a diverse set of datasets and model sizes helps situate few-shot prompting as a strong baseline approach. The emphasis on inference-time improvements like reranking also connects to an important area of research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Improving retrieval for complex multi-hop questions, for example by using more sophisticated "learning to search" approaches that decompose questions into simpler sub-queries. 

- Further optimizing few-shot prompting, such as through better prompt design or in-context example selection based on similarity to the question.

- Using techniques like constrained decoding to better ground the model's answers in the conditioning evidence at inference time.

- Broadening the range of tasks and interactions studied beyond the question answering setup explored in this paper.

- Further analyzing the safety implications of using web search engines and developing techniques to mitigate risks like retrieving harmful content.

- Increasing reproducibility by releasing the retrieved documents to enable exact replication of results.

Overall, the main suggestions are to build on the basic approach explored here using few-shot prompting and search engines by improving retrieval, optimizing prompting, and increasing model grounding. The authors also highlight opportunities to extend this work to other tasks and interactions, while identifying the need to address the safety challenges that arise when leveraging the open web.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using few-shot prompting to condition large language models on documents retrieved from the web, in order to improve their performance on open-domain question answering tasks. By retrieving relevant documents using Google Search and prompting the model to answer questions based on those documents, without fine-tuning or adding parameters, the authors are able to achieve significant gains over closed-book models across a variety of QA datasets. The approach is particularly beneficial for smaller models, allowing them to match or exceed the performance of much larger closed-book models in some cases. Increasing inference-time compute by generating multiple candidate answers per document and reranking further improves results. The findings suggest that more targeted use of models' few-shot abilities combined with increased inference-time compute could reduce the need for ever-larger models, shifting focus to how models are applied. Limitations include lower performance on complex questions with retrieval errors, and broader challenges of using web data. Overall, the work demonstrates the potential for simple prompting to turn any language model into an open-domain QA system grounded in up-to-date online knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using few-shot prompting to condition large language models (LSLMs) on evidence retrieved from the web in order to improve their performance on open-domain question answering. The method uses Google Search to retrieve relevant documents for a given question. It then constructs a prompt containing question-evidence-answer triplets and uses this to few-shot condition the LSLM on the retrieved evidence. The prompts allow the models to ground their responses in external information without requiring fine-tuning. 

Experiments show that prompting the 280B parameter Gopher model with web evidence improves performance over its closed-book version across several QA datasets. The gains are especially large for extractive QA. Smaller 7B-1B models prompted with web evidence can even outperform the closed-book 280B model, suggesting inference-time interventions like prompting and reranking can substitute for some model scale gains. Limitations include lower quality retrieval for complex questions and potential safety issues when using web data. Overall, the work provides a strong baselines for web-augmented QA via few-shot prompting.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using few-shot prompting to condition large-scale language models (LSLMs) on external evidence retrieved from the internet in order to improve their performance on open-domain question answering. Specifically, given a question, they retrieve relevant documents using Google Search. They then create prompts consisting of question-answer pairs with retrieved evidence paragraphs and use these prompts in a k-shot learning framework (k=15) to adapt the LSLM to leverage the external evidence when generating answers. To further improve performance, they generate multiple candidate answers per evidence paragraph and rerank them using scoring functions based on probabilities obtained by prompting the LSLM itself. This allows increasing inference-time compute by searching over more candidate answers while avoiding the need to train specialized models. Overall, the method provides a way to ground the LSLM in external evidence and keep it up-to-date without fine-tuning or adding learnable parameters.
