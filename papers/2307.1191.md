# [Variational integrals on Hessian spaces: partial regularity for critical   points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.1191)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) Can the authors develop a regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals of the form $\int F(D^2u) dx$ under compactly supported variations? Here $F$ is assumed to be a smooth, uniformly convex (or concave) function of the Hessian. The associated Euler-Lagrange equation is a fully nonlinear fourth order PDE in double divergence form. 2) Under what conditions on the Hessian $D^2u$ can the authors obtain smoothness of critical points? In particular, can they relax the assumption of small $L^{\infty}$ oscillation of the Hessian used in previous works to small oscillation in a BMO sense?3) As a consequence of their regularity theory, can the authors obtain improved dimension estimates on the interior singular set of critical points compared to what is known for second order elliptic systems? The main results are:- An epsilon-regularity theorem showing that if the Hessian of a $W^{2,\infty}$ critical point has small BMO oscillation, then the critical point is smooth.- As a consequence, they obtain a dimension estimate of $n-p_0$ on the interior singular set, for some $p_0>2$, which improves upon analogous results for second order systems.- They demonstrate applications of their theory to establish regularity of solutions to the Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian equation in complex geometry. - They also use this geometric equation to illustrate the importance of the a priori $W^{2,\infty}$ regularity assumption, showing it likely cannot be easily relaxed without additional assumptions.So in summary, the main focus is on developing a regularity theory for a class of fourth order nonlinear PDE through imposing a small BMO oscillation condition on the Hessian of solutions. This gives improved dimension estimates on singular sets and applications to geometric PDE. The a priori $W^{2,\infty}$ regularity assumption is shown to be necessary in this setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It develops a regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals of the form $\int F(D^2u)$ defined on Hessian spaces, under compactly supported variations. The critical point $u$ satisfies a fourth order nonlinear equation in double divergence form. 2. The key result is an $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem (Theorem 1.1) which shows that if $u\in W^{2,\infty}$ is a critical point and its Hessian has small bounded mean oscillation (BMO), then $u$ is smooth. This is proved by first establishing uniform $C^{1,1}$ and then $C^{2,\alpha}$ estimates on $u$.3. As a consequence, the authors obtain a dimension estimate on the interior singular set of $u$ (Corollary 1.2), showing that it has Hausdorff dimension at most $n-p_0$ for some $p_0>2$. This relies on the higher integrability of $u$.4. The results are applied to variational problems arising in Lagrangian geometry, such as the Hamiltonian stationary equation. The importance of the a priori $W^{2,\infty}$ regularity assumption on $u$ is also demonstrated through this application.5. The paper develops some technical tools for establishing regularity of solutions with small BMO coefficients, adapting prior work of Han and Lin. A key ingredient is a Caccioppoli-type inequality exploiting higher integrability.In summary, the paper significantly advances the regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals on Hessian spaces by weakening the small oscillation hypothesis to small BMO and obtains a dimension estimate on the singular set. The results have implications for nonlinear PDEs arising in geometry and analysis.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper develops regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals defined on Hessian spaces of functions, under the assumptions of convexity/concavity and small bounded mean oscillation of the Hessian; as a consequence, the interior singular set of a critical point is shown to have dimension at most $n-p_0$ for some $p_0\in(2,3)$.
