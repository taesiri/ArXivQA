# [Run-time Introspection of 2D Object Detection in Automated Driving   Systems Using Learning Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01172)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reliable detection of objects in automated driving systems (ADS) is critical for safe operation. However, even highly accurate deep neural network (DNN) based object detectors can fail, leading to accidents. Therefore, ADS need a run-time monitoring mechanism, called "introspection", to detect errors in the perception system and trigger fail-safe actions. Most prior introspection methods rely only on confidence scores, which can be unreliable. This motivates exploring other representations like activation patterns within DNNs to enhance introspection.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces a novel introspection method that utilizes shaped activation patterns from the object detector's backbone as features to identify frame-level errors. Specifically, it sets lower-activation elements to zero, retaining more salient activations. Three shaping strategies are explored: pruning only (P), pruning + scaling (S) and pruning + binarization (B). To enable comparison, the paper adapts other state-of-the-art introspection techniques using statistical features (SF), cascaded features (CLF) and handcrafted features (HIMF). 

A 4-stage evaluation framework is devised encompassing detector training, error dataset creation, introspection model training and testing. Experiments are conducted using FCOS and Faster R-CNN detectors on KITTI and BDD driving datasets. Performance metrics include AUROC, F1 score and false negative rate. Computational analysis examines memory usage and inference times.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of a novel introspection method using shaped activation patterns to identify errors in 2D object detection 
- Devising a unified framework for comparative evaluation of multiple introspection techniques on different detectors and datasets
- Extensive analysis highlighting superior error detection capabilities of the proposed approach, especially in terms of minimizing false negatives
- Demonstrating trade-offs between performance vs. computational requirements for different learning representations
- Testing cross-dataset transferability revealing limitations in adapting to distribution shifts

The study provides useful practical guidelines for designing introspection systems and highlights key factors influencing their efficacy and resource needs in automated driving perception.
