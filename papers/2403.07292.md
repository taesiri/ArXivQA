# [Continual All-in-One Adverse Weather Removal with Knowledge Replay on a   Unified Network Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07292)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement: 
- Real-world image degradation caused by adverse weather conditions (e.g. haze, rain, snow) is complex and dynamically changing. Existing methods for removing a single weather type or multiple types have limitations - they assume all training data is available upfront and/or require specifying the weather type at test time. 

- This paper proposes the new task of continual learning for an all-in-one adverse weather removal model that can sequentially learn to handle different weather types in a unified architecture without retraining from scratch. This setting is more practical for real-world usage where weather conditions and available training data change over time.

Proposed Method:
- A continual learning framework to train a single network incrementally on data with different degradations (dehazing, deraining, desnowing). Uses a unified architecture and small memory buffer to replay previous samples.

- Tailored knowledge replay techniques that distill responses on previous samples into current model via i) prediction-level distillation loss ii) mid-level feature distillation with a principal component projection to consolidate and transfer core knowledge.

- Handles increased risk of catastrophic forgetting across different weather types relative to single degradation continual learning. Enables fully incremental learning without access to all data upfront.

Main Contributions:
- First investigation of continual learning for all-in-one multi-weather removal towards real-world requirements of sequential/alternative weather data and automatic handling without specifying degradation type. 

- Effective knowledge replay strategies customized for consolidation and transfer of essential knowledge for image restoration across different weather degradations.

- Competitive results to joint training methods and benchmarks for the new dynamic adverse weather removal task. Enables practical anytime learning as new weather data emerges.
