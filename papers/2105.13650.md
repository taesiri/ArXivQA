# Data Augmentation for Text Generation Without Any Augmented Data

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be:Data augmentation can improve the performance of neural text generation models without needing to explicitly construct augmented data samples using predefined mapping functions. The key questions seem to be:- Can we formulate an objective for data augmentation that does not require explicitly defining augmentation mapping functions?- Can this objective be optimized efficiently?- Will optimizing this objective lead to improvements similar to standard data augmentation techniques?The paper proposes an approach to approximate the effect of data augmentation by optimizing an expectation over distributions of perturbation distances and angles, rather than actually constructing augmented data. The goal is to show this can be done efficiently and achieve comparable benefits to common data augmentation techniques like backtranslation and masked language models. The experiments aim to validate whether the proposed approach can improve performance across different text generation tasks.In summary, the central hypothesis is that the benefits of data augmentation can be achieved without needing to use explicit augmentation mapping functions, by instead optimizing an objective that approximates the effect of augmentation. The research questions focus on formulating this objective, showing it can be efficiently optimized, and demonstrating its effectiveness empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- The authors propose a new objective to formulate the problem of data augmentation for text generation models without needing to use any actual augmented data. - They show that the loss from augmented samples can be reparameterized into a distribution of perturbation distance and angle. The expectation over this distribution can approximate the original augmented loss.- They prove this objective can be optimized efficiently using stochastic gradient descent, with a guaranteed convergence rate.- The proposed approach provides a unified way to model different types of text perturbation for data augmentation.- Experiments on machine translation and dialog tasks demonstrate their method can approximate or exceed the performance of popular data augmentation techniques like masked language modeling and backtranslation.In summary, the key contribution is deriving a principled objective for data augmentation that avoids the need to explicitly construct augmented samples. This sheds light on understanding data augmentation and enables efficient training without extra computation on augmented data.
