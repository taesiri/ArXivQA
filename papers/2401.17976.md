# [Circuit Partitioning for Multi-Core Quantum Architectures with Deep   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17976)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Scaling up quantum computers is challenging with single-core architectures due to issues like crosstalk and control complexity. Multi-core quantum architectures have been proposed to address the scalability issue.
- Executing quantum circuits across multiple cores introduces new challenges like partitioning and mapping the circuit. One key challenge is assigning qubits to different cores to minimize expensive inter-core qubit movements.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models to solve the circuit mapping problem for multi-core quantum architectures. 
- Different DRL approaches are explored, including an unconstrained model (PPO) and models with action masking to guide the agent.
- The observation and reward functions are designed to incentivize finding valid mappings that minimize inter-core qubit movements.

Key Contributions:
- First work to apply DRL to tackle the circuit mapping problem for multi-core quantum architectures.
- Comparison of different DRL models - unconstrained, soft masking and hard masking - for this problem.
- Hard mask model consistently outperforms existing algorithm by 20-30% in minimizing inter-core movements across different circuit types.
- Demonstrates potential of using DRL for optimizing mapping in quantum computing and invites further research to build on these results.

In summary, the key innovation is using DRL for the important problem of mapping quantum circuits to emerging multi-core architectures. Results show DRL can optimize circuit mapping better than state-of-the-art approaches, specifically with an appropriate action masking scheme. This paves the way for further DRL research to advance quantum computing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes and compares several deep reinforcement learning models to partition quantum circuits across multiple cores in modular quantum architectures, achieving better performance than existing algorithms in minimizing inter-core qubit movements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The proposal of several DRL models to approach the mapping problem for partitioning quantum circuits across multi-core architectures. Specifically, models based on PPO and MaskablePPO algorithms are explored.

2) A comparison between the proposed DRL approaches and a state-of-the-art solution (the FGP-rOEE algorithm). The results show that a DRL model with a hard mask consistently outperforms the FGP-rOEE algorithm in minimizing non-local communications across cores. 

In summary, the main contribution is using DRL to solve the quantum circuit mapping problem, opening the door to new solutions in this area. The authors show promising results comparing different DRL models, including outperforming a previous state-of-the-art algorithm. This demonstrates the potential of DRL for addressing challenges in compiling quantum circuits.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models for circuit partitioning in multi-core quantum architectures. What are the key challenges in circuit partitioning that make this a good candidate problem to apply DRL techniques?

2. The paper evaluates DRL models using the metric of average number of qubit movements across cores. What are some other metrics that could be relevant in assessing the performance of circuit partitioning algorithms? 

3. The observation array provided to the DRL agent includes components like lookahead weights and last assignment of qubits to cores. How do these components help guide the agent's decisions? What other information could be incorporated?

4. The paper experiments with different levels of action space restrictions for the DRL agent using masking. What are the tradeoffs of a more restricted vs less restricted action space? How can this inform designing the right level of flexibility?

5. The DRL models are assessed on different classes of quantum circuits like Cuccaro and QAOA circuits. What architectural properties of these circuit classes make partitioning non-trivial? Why is it important to evaluate on diverse circuits?

6. The Hard Mask model demonstrates superior performance over the baseline. What specifically about the imposed heuristics (like direct swap) contribute to this? How can we develop more intelligent heuristic guidance?  

7. What types of neural network architectures and hyperparameters could be explored to further optimize the DRL approaches? What challenges exist in scaling up the training to larger circuits?

8. How can the reward structure be adjusted to shape agent behavior towards more efficient partitioning solutions? What are other auxiliary rewards that could promote better learning?

9. The action space explored is restricted to qubit swap operations. What are other possible actions that can be incorporated to enhance the agent's control? How does expanding the action space impact learning?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on qubit movements for two-qubit interactions across cores. What are the tradeoffs if remote two-qubit gates are also allowed? How does support for remote gates change the formulation?
