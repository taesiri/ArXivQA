# [Counting Reward Automata: Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning   Through the Exploitation of Reward Function Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11364)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Reinforcement learning (RL) agents struggle with solving long-horizon, temporally extended tasks due to lack of access to task structure and reliance on end-to-end learning
- Hierarchical RL approaches face challenges with exploration and reward definition
- Existing state machine approaches like Reward Machines are limited to modelling regular languages, restricting the tasks they can represent

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Counting Reward Automata (CRAs), a novel state machine variant based on counter machines that can model tasks described by any formal language 
- CRAs augment agents with a state machine that tracks task progress and outputs symbolic rewards
- This allows solving tasks requiring counting or context-sensitive patterns unexpressible by regular languages
- CRA configurations combined with environment states create an Automaton-Augmented MDP (AAMDP) that standard RL algorithms can solve 

Main Contributions:
- Propose CRAs that expand expressiveness beyond regular languages and can represent any computable reward function
- Prove CRAs can emulate Reward Machines but are strictly more powerful in the tasks they can encode
- Introduce Counterfactual Q-Learning, an off-policy RL algorithm that exploits CRA structure for improved sample efficiency  
- Demonstrate empirically that CRAs outperform Reward Machines in terms of task completion rate, sample efficiency, and state machine complexity on context-free and context-sensitive tasks
- Show task domain knowledge can be naturally integrated into CRAs using natural language descriptions and large language models to automatically produce the automata

In summary, the paper introduces a novel state machine approach to injecting symbolic knowledge into RL agents to enhance their ability to solve complex, temporally extended tasks requiring long-horizon reasoning.
