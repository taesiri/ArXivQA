# [A Task is Worth One Word: Learning with Task Prompts for High-Quality   Versatile Image Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03594)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes PowerPaint, a versatile image inpainting model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple inpainting tasks, including text-guided object inpainting, context-aware image inpainting, object removal, and shape-guided object inpainting. The key idea is to incorporate learnable task prompts, such as Pinsert for object insertion and Premove for background filling, along with tailored fine-tuning strategies to guide the model explicitly. Experiments demonstrate PowerPaint's superior quantitative and qualitative performance. PowerPaint wins first place in user studies and shows excellent compatibility with existing control networks for conditional inpainting. The learned task prompts prove highly versatile, enabling object removal via negative guidance and controllable shape-guided insertion through prompt interpolation. By simultaneously addressing the challenges of both object hallucination and coherent background filling within a single framework, PowerPaint stands as a groundbreaking versatile inpainting model with extensive applications.
