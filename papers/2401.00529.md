# [GraphGPT: Graph Learning with Generative Pre-trained Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00529)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "GraphGPT: Graph Learning with Generative Pre-trained Transformers":

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have limitations in scaling up and generalizing across datasets. Recent graph transformers also have drawbacks like relying on handcrafted features to encode structure and not being compatible with self-supervised pre-training.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose GraphGPT, which transforms graphs into sequences using Eulerian paths, pre-trains a transformer decoder with next token prediction, and fine-tunes on downstream tasks.

- Transform graphs reversibly into sequences using semi-Eulerian paths, which visit each edge once. Handle node attributes, edge attributes, disconnected components.

- Pre-train transformer decoder using next token prediction self-supervised task, which models both structure and attributes. Scales up to 400M parameters.

- Fine-tune on graph, edge, and node classification by formatting tasks to be compatible with decoder.

Main Contributions:

- Novel graph serialization with Eulerian paths to create reversible sequences preserving all structure and attribute information.

- First adoption of self-supervised pre-training for graph transformer, enabling scaling up and consistently improving performance.

- Flexible formatting of different graph learning tasks to exploit pre-training and transformer architecture.

- State-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks including molecular property prediction, protein association prediction, protein function prediction.

- Opens up promise for foundation graph models by showing viability of scaling up transformers for graphs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing GraphGPT, a novel model for graph learning that transforms graphs into sequences using Eulerian paths, pre-trains a transformer decoder with the next-token prediction task in a self-supervised manner, and then fine-tunes on downstream supervised graph tasks.

2) Demonstrating that GraphGPT achieves state-of-the-art or close to state-of-the-art performance on graph-, edge-, and node-level tasks on several public benchmarks. 

3) Showing that generative pre-training allows GraphGPT to scale up to 400M+ parameters with consistently improving performance, overcoming limitations like oversmoothing that affect other graph neural networks.

4) Enabling the training of large graph transformer models on tasks like link prediction and node classification where previous graph transformers have not been competitive.

5) Providing a framework to pave the way for further research into graph foundation models and assist scientific discovery in domains like chemistry, biology, and materials science.
