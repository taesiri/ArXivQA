# [Rethinking Surgical Instrument Segmentation: A Background Image Can Be   All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11804)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether it is possible to achieve decent surgical instrument segmentation performance by training only on synthetic data generated from a single background image and a small set of foreground instrument images, without the need for extensive real surgical data collection and annotation. The key hypothesis is that through applying various augmentation and blending techniques to the minimal source images, it is possible to synthesize a high-quality and diverse training dataset that can effectively train a model for surgical instrument segmentation.Specifically, the paper proposes using just one background tissue image and a couple of foreground instrument images. It applies multiple augmentations to these to generate an augmented image pool. It then randomly combines augmented foregrounds and backgrounds via blending to create a synthetic dataset. It also utilizes chained augmentation mixing during training for further diversity. The experiments aim to evaluate whether models trained on such synthetic data can perform comparably to those trained on real manually annotated surgical data for instrument segmentation on held out real test sets. The results suggest the proposed synthetic data generation approach is promising, achieving decent performance without needing extensive real data collection and annotation effort.
