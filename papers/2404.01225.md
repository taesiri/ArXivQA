# [SurMo: Surface-based 4D Motion Modeling for Dynamic Human Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01225)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called SurMo for synthesizing realistic free-viewpoint videos of dynamic clothed humans from only a few input video sequences. 

The key problem addressed is that existing methods for novel view synthesis of humans mainly focus on reconstructing the appearance for each individual frame based on the static body pose. However, the appearance of clothed humans is also significantly affected by the dynamics of motion over time. Existing methods fail to model such temporal dynamics and thus cannot render realistic secondary motions of clothing, resulting in unrealistic renderings when poses change rapidly.

To address this, SurMo proposes a new paradigm that jointly models the temporal human motion dynamics together with the time-varying appearances in a unified framework. The key ideas are:

1) A compact surface-based motion triplane representation that encodes both spatial pose and temporal dynamics efficiently on the UV space of the body surface. This allows modeling clothing motion as offsets from the body surface over time.

2) A physical motion decoding module that predicts the spatial and temporal derivatives of the motion at the next time step from the current motion encoding. This enforces physics-based motion learning during training.  

3) An efficient image decoder with a surface-conditioned volumetric renderer focused around the body and a super-resolution network for high-quality novel view synthesis.

Experiments on 3 datasets with 9 subject sequences demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SurMo in rendering high-fidelity free-viewpoint videos. The method successfully models complex time-varying effects like clothing wrinkles and folds for rapid motions as well as motion-dependent shadows. The unified dynamics modeling sets SurMo apart from previous pose-conditioned novel view synthesis techniques.
