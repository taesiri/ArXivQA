# [ConKeD: Multiview contrastive descriptor learning for keypoint-based   retinal image registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Retinal image registration is important for medical applications like disease monitoring. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on intensity-based or direct parameter regression approaches which have limitations for registering color fundus images. Specifically, the small and scattered patterns useful for registration, large displacements, low overlap between images, and presence of pathology make these methods unsuitable. Feature-based methods using keypoints and descriptors avoid these issues but most use generic keypoints leading to accuracy and efficiency problems. Additionally, current learning approaches for descriptors use single/multi-negative contrastive losses failing to leverage all available information.

Solution:
The paper proposes ConKeD, a novel framework to learn descriptors for domain-specific keypoint-based retinal image registration using a multi-positive multi-negative contrastive loss. Blood vessel bifurcations and crossovers are used as distinctive keypoints detected by a trained CNN. A descriptor CNN is trained on multiview batches containing augmentations of each image, enabling multiple positives and negatives. Matches are made bidirectionally on cosine distance. The matches drive registration via RANSAC.

Contributions:

- First multi-positive multi-negative contrastive learning approach for keypoint registration

- Complete retinal registration methodology using ConKeD descriptors and domain keypoints  

- ConKeD outperforms triplet loss and single/multi-negative alternatives in experiments 

- Leveraging multiple positives and hard negatives enhances descriptor learning

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance without pre-processing, fewer training samples or keypoints, single inference

In conclusion, ConKeD advances deep descriptor learning for medical image registration via a novel contrastive framework, providing accuracy, efficiency and flexibility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel deep learning method called ConKeD to learn descriptors for retinal image registration using a multi-positive multi-negative contrastive learning approach with domain-specific keypoints, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while requiring less training data and preprocessing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing ConKeD, the first multi-positive multi-negative contrastive descriptor learning approach for keypoint-based image registration. Specifically:

- They propose a novel deep learning method to learn descriptors (ConKeD) for domain-specific keypoint-based retinal image registration using a multi-positive multi-negative contrastive learning strategy. This allows utilizing additional information from the available training samples compared to existing methods.

- They propose a complete retinal image registration methodology combining ConKeD with domain-specific keypoints (blood vessel bifurcations and crossovers).

- Through experiments on a public dataset, they demonstrate the benefits of the multi-positive multi-negative strategy over established baselines like triplet loss and single-positive multi-negative approaches. Their method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while offering advantages like avoiding pre-processing and requiring fewer training samples and detected keypoints.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel ConKeD framework for learning descriptors using a multi-positive multi-negative contrastive learning approach, which is shown to improve performance for keypoint-based retinal image registration.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a multi-positive multi-negative contrastive learning approach for the first time in image registration. Why is this more beneficial than traditional single/multi-negative approaches like triplet loss? What specifically does adding multiple positives enable?

2. The paper trains separate keypoint detector and descriptor networks. What is the rationale behind separating these two steps rather than having a single end-to-end network? What are the tradeoffs? 

3. The paper argues that domain-specific keypoints like vessel bifurcations are more robust than generic keypoints. However, they require labeled data. What are some ways to mitigate this supervision requirement? Could the keypoint detector be trained in a self-supervised manner?  

4. The paper finds that the SupCon and InfoNCE losses produce very similar results. Why might this be the case? What properties are common between them that could explain the similar performance?

5. The method seems to perform worse in the P category of FIRE compared to state-of-the-art. This category has low overlap between images. What could be done to improve results specifically for this challenging case?

6. The paper uses a simple projection model for alignment. What are some reasons not to use more complex deformable models? When might deformable models start to become necessary?

7. The paper matches descriptors between points of the same type (bifurcations-bifurcations, crossovers-crossovers). Is there any scenario where cross-matching could be beneficial? What would be the tradeoffs?

8. The paper relies solely on blood vessel keypoints. What other domain-specific retinal landmarks could provide complementary information? How could they be integrated into the pipeline?

9. The method seems very efficient compared to state-of-the-art in terms of required annotations, keypoints detected, etc. Could the approach be modified to improve absolute performance if efficiency was not a concern? 

10. The method is evaluated on retinal image registration. What would be required to adapt it to other modalities like CT or MRI? What components would transfer and what would need retraining?
