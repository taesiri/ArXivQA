# [RadarMOSEVE: A Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for Radar-Only   Moving Object Segmentation and Ego-Velocity Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14380)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Moving object segmentation (MOS) and ego velocity estimation (EVE) using radar data is an important but challenging task for autonomous systems. Existing methods have limitations: 1) LiDAR/camera sensors struggle in bad weather; 2) Radar data is sparse and noisy, making existing LiDAR MOS methods suboptimal; 3) Most works focus only on either MOS or EVE, not both.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes RadarMOSEVE, a spatial-temporal transformer network to achieve radar-only MOS and EVE simultaneously. The key ideas are:

1) A novel radar transformer module with specifically designed self- and cross-attention mechanisms to handle sparse, noisy radar data and leverage velocity information.

2) An ego velocity estimation (EVE) module that takes two radar frames as input to estimate ego velocity. A Doppler loss is introduced to help learn accurate velocity.  

3) A moving object segmentation (MOS) module that takes velocity-compensated radar frames using EVE results as input to segment moving objects.

Main Contributions:

1) A tailored radar transformer for sparse, noisy radar data which outperforms other transformers.

2) A unified framework to achieve both accurate EVE and MOS using only radar data, eliminating reliance on other sensors or odometry.

3) State-of-the-art performance on both tasks on a public dataset (VoD) and a new dataset built by the authors. EVE precision improved by >17% and MOS MIoU by >9% over existing methods.

4) Release of code, models and dataset to facilitate future radar MOSEVE research.

In summary, the paper presents a novel radar transformer network for the important task of simultaneous moving object segmentation and ego velocity estimation using only radar data. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over existing methods.
