# [NeuroLogic A*esque Decoding: Constrained Text Generation with Lookahead   Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08726)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis seems to be that existing decoding methods for neural text generation, which rely on maximizing sequence likelihood in a left-to-right fashion, are insufficient for generating high quality coherent text. 

The authors hypothesize that directly sampling from or maximizing sequence likelihood at each local step is an inadequate decoding heuristic, and can lead to issues like repetitive, incoherent or generic text.

To address this, the paper proposes a new decoding approach called A* Heuristic Decoding, which incorporates estimates of future states to guide the local decoding decisions. The central hypothesis is that by looking ahead and leveraging information about plausible future states, the decoding process can be improved to generate higher quality and more coherent text while avoiding common pitfalls like repetition.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that existing likelihood-based decoding heuristics are insufficient, and that explicitly modeling future states through a lookahead mechanism like the proposed A* Heuristic Decoding can lead to better text generation. The paper aims to demonstrate this through empirical evaluations across a range of text generation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new decoding method called A* Heuristic for neural text generation. The key ideas are:

- Motivated by limitations of standard decoding methods like beam search and sampling, which can lead to repetitive or incoherent text, the authors propose using estimates of future generation states to guide the current generation. 

- They draw inspiration from the A* search algorithm, which uses heuristics to guide search towards more promising results. The proposed A* Heuristic decoding method incorporates lightweight heuristics to approximate future losses and guide generation.

- The heuristics are based on looking ahead by generating possible continuations of the partially decoded text so far. Different strategies are explored for efficiently generating good lookahead continuations.

- The method can flexibly incorporate estimates of future costs like perplexity or constraint satisfaction. It's applied to both unconstrained text generation as well as constrained text generation using lexical constraints.

- For constrained text generation, A* Heuristic is combined with NeuroLogic decoding to create an improved algorithm called A*-NeuroLogic. The lookahead heuristics help guide generation towards satisfying more constraints.

- Experiments on 5 text generation benchmarks in both constrained and unconstrained settings show performance gains over competitive baselines brought by A* Heuristic decoding. The gains are notable especially in low-resource scenarios with limited supervision.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing a way to improve neural text generation by incorporating lightweight heuristics that look ahead to guide the search, inspired by A* search algorithms. Both unconstrained and constrained setups are considered, with strong empirical results.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel neural decoding method called A* Heuristic that aims to improve text generation from neural language models. Here are some key ways it relates to prior work:

- It builds on recent research in constrained/controllable text generation, especially the NeuroLogic decoding algorithm of Lu et al. (2021). The key novelty is augmenting NeuroLogic with lookahead heuristics to better satisfy lexical constraints. 

- For the lookahead heuristics, the paper draws inspiration from the A* search algorithm in classical AI. While A* has been applied to some structured NLP tasks before, using it to guide neural text generation with autoregressive LMs is novel.

- The paper shows A* Heuristic improves over likelihood-based decoding methods like beam search and sampling, which are known to sometimes cause repetitive/generic outputs. This relates to other recent work like Nucleus Sampling that tries to address text degeneration.

- For constrained generation, A* Heuristic outperforms prior approaches including constrained beam search, grid beam search, and specialized training methods. The gains are especially notable in few-shot learning scenarios.

- The paper studies unconstrained generation as well, showing A* Heuristic can improve coherence and diversity. This demonstrates the value of planning ahead even when no constraints are given.

To summarize, the key contributions are using informed lookahead search to augment standard decoding algorithms, and showing consistent improvements across diverse text generation tasks. The results highlight the importance of modeling the future when decoding from left-to-right language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest several promising future research directions:

1. Developing more effective lookahead heuristics for estimating future states in A*esque decoding. They point out that their proposed heuristics are simple and lightweight approximations of future costs like likelihood and constraint satisfaction. More advanced heuristics could potentially improve the benefits of lookahead.

2. Theoretical analysis of the properties and guarantees of A*esque decoding for text generation. The authors mention that guarantees from classical A* search don't directly apply in their setting. Further theoretical analysis could provide insights into the effectiveness of lookahead heuristics and guide development of better algorithms.

3. Exploring non-autoregressive and bidirectional decoding. The paper focuses on augmenting standard left-to-right autoregressive decoding, but suggests exploring how lookahead could benefit other decoding paradigms.

4. Applying informed heuristic search more broadly in NLP. The authors mention that while A* has been used for some structured NLP tasks like parsing, its application to neural text generation has been relatively unexplored. The effectiveness of their approach suggests promise for using informed search more widely.

5. Developing models and algorithms that can consider past and future context jointly during text generation. The gains from lookahead heuristics suggest the importance of modeling future text. New models and algorithms that globally consider past and future could further improve controllable text generation.

In summary, the authors propose several promising research directions centered around developing more advanced lookahead heuristics, theoretical understanding, and models that incorporate bidirectional context for higher quality and controllable neural text generation. Their work demonstrates the promise of informed heuristic search algorithms like A* for language generation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes A* Heuristic Decoding, a new inference algorithm for neural text generation that incorporates estimates of future states to guide generation. The dominant approaches for text generation like beam search and sampling lack foresight and can produce degenerate or incoherent text. A* Heuristic Decoding addresses this by using heuristic lookahead to estimate future states and guide generation towards higher quality outputs. The method is shown to improve performance on five text generation benchmarks in both constrained and unconstrained settings, especially in few-shot scenarios. The proposed algorithm combines heuristic search with NeuroLogic decoding, allowing constrained generation satisfying complex lexical constraints. Experiments demonstrate that A* Heuristic Decoding consistently improves generation quality on top of likelihood-based decoding methods like beam search and sampling. The results suggest the importance of modeling future states beyond just left-to-right context in text generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new decoding algorithm called \textsc{A$^\textbf{*}$ Heuristic} for neural text generation. The dominant approaches for decoding text from neural language models involve maximizing sequence likelihood using methods like beam search or sampling likely tokens. However, these methods can result in repetitive, incoherent text. The key idea of \textsc{A$^\textbf{*}$ Heuristic} is to use estimates of future states to guide the model's current predictions. Specifically, it incorporates heuristic lookahead to approximate the future quality of potential decoding paths. This allows the model to avoid local decisions that lead to poor overall generations. 

The authors show that \textsc{A$^\textbf{*}$ Heuristic} decoding improves results across five text generation benchmarks, for both constrained and unconstrained setups. For constrained generation tasks like commonsense sentence completion, it outperforms prior decoding algorithms including beam search. For open-ended generation like storytelling, it produces more coherent and interesting text compared to likelihood-based methods. The gains are particularly notable in few-shot scenarios where models have less explicit supervision. Overall, the paper demonstrates the promise of using informed heuristic search to address issues with standard decoding approaches in neural text generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new decoding algorithm called A*esque Decoding (or NeuroLogic A*esque Decoding) for neural text generation. The key idea is to incorporate heuristic estimates of future costs, inspired by the A* search algorithm, into existing decoding techniques like beam search and sampling. Specifically, at each step of decoding, the algorithm uses "lookahead heuristics" to approximate the future cost of continuing down different paths based on likely continuations. It then biases decoding towards lower-cost paths, for example, sequences that are more likely to satisfy lexical constraints. The heuristics enable the decoder to consider both past and future text when selecting the next token, going beyond standard left-to-right decoding. The method is evaluated on both constrained and open-ended text generation tasks using supervised and unsupervised language models, showing improved performance especially for complex constraints and in low-resource settings. The results demonstrate the promise of improved decoding techniques to enhance the capabilities of large pre-trained language models.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper addresses the problem of "degeneration" in neural text generation, where standard decoding methods like beam search and sampling can produce repetitive, incoherent or generic text. 

The key question the paper seems to be tackling is: How can we improve decoding from autoregressive language models to generate higher quality text, especially for constrained generation tasks?

To address this, the paper proposes a new decoding algorithm called A* Heuristic Decoding (or A*HD for short). The key ideas are:

1. Standard decoding methods like beam search only consider past context when generating the next token. A*HD incorporates estimates of future cost/constraints, inspired by heuristic search algorithms like A* search. 

2. For constrained text generation tasks, A*HD builds on NeuroLogic decoding which handles lexical constraints in conjunctive normal form (CNF). A*HD adds a "lookahead heuristic" to estimate future constraint satisfaction.

3. For open-ended generation, A*HD uses the likelihood of future continuations as a heuristic to guide decoding.

4. A*HD can be applied to beam search, sampling, and NeuroLogic decoding to improve results across a variety of generation tasks.

In summary, the paper introduces a new heuristic decoding algorithm that considers future estimates to address issues with standard decoding methods like repetitive or low-quality text. It shows improved performance especially for constrained generation tasks by planning ahead to satisfy constraints.
