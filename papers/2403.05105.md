# [Learning to Rematch Mismatched Pairs for Robust Cross-Modal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Cross-modal retrieval relies on well-matched training data, but real-world data often contains partially mismatched pairs (PMPs) that harm performance. 
- Prior work handles PMPs by downweighting their contribution, but underutilizes the potential value in mismatched pairs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes L2RM, a framework to rematch mismatched pairs using optimal transport.  
- The key idea is to excavate semantic similarity among unpaired samples to generate better alignments.

Methodology:
- Identify possibly mismatched pairs using loss distribution.
- Model the rematching as an optimal transport problem between visual and textual distributions. 
- Propose a novel self-supervised cost function to handle error accumulation from corrupted features.
- Further boost alignments by restricting false positive transports and allowing partial matching.
- Optimization can be efficiently solved with Sinkhorn algorithm.
- Rematched alignments provide supervision to train retrieval model.

Main Contributions:
- First work to address PMPs from an optimal transport perspective and rematch mismatched pairs.
- Novel self-supervised cost function robust to corrupted features.
- Modeling insights like partial transport and restricting false transports.
- General framework that boosts robustness of existing retrieval methods against PMPs. 
- Significantly outperforms state-of-of-the-art methods on three datasets.

In summary, the paper innovatively utilizes optimal transport to rematch mismatched training pairs for more robust cross-modal retrieval, with both modeling and generalization improvements over prior arts.
