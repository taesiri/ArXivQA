# [Joint State Estimation and Noise Identification Based on Variational   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09585)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of state estimation for dynamical systems when the process and measurement noise covariances are unknown. Not knowing the true noise statistics can lead to poor state estimates. The paper studies this problem for both linear and nonlinear state space models. 

Existing solutions using sampling-based or optimization-based methods have limitations in accuracy, speed, simplicity and generality. Variational Bayesian (VB) methods have shown promise for adaptive Kalman filtering but most existing methods are limited to linear models or perform updates in the natural parameter space which is inefficient.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel adaptive Kalman filter based on conjugate-computation variational inference (CVI) called CVIAKF. The key ideas are:

1) Formulate joint state and noise covariance estimation as a variational inference problem to approximate the intractable posterior density.

2) Optimize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective in the expectation parameter space instead of natural parameter space. This avoids computing the Fisher information matrix leading to faster updates. 

3) For nonlinear models, decompose the ELBO into conjugate and non-conjugate parts. Apply conjugate computations and stochastic mirror descent optimization for these parts respectively. Use reparameterization trick to reduce variance of stochastic gradients of non-conjugate part.

4) Ensure state covariance matrix remains positive definite after each update using line search.

Main Contributions:

- A new perspective for adaptive Kalman filtering using CVI framework with optimization in expectation parameter space

- Closed-form update equations for linear models 

- An iterative procedure based on stochastic mirror descent and reparameterization for nonlinear models

- Demonstrated improved performance over state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world tracking data

The CVIAKF method contributes towards accurate and computationally efficient solutions for joint state and noise covariance estimation problems, with broad applicability.

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel adaptive Kalman filter method called CVIAKF for joint state estimation and noise covariance identification in linear and nonlinear systems. Specifically:

- It formulates the joint state and noise covariance estimation problem as a variational inference optimization problem. 

- It performs the optimization in the expectation parameter space using conjugate-computation variational inference (CVI), which is more efficient than existing methods that optimize in the natural parameter space. 

- For linear systems, it provides closed-form update equations for the variational parameters.

- For nonlinear systems, it decomposes the objective into conjugate and non-conjugate parts, applies conjugate computations and stochastic mirror descent optimization respectively, and uses reparameterization trick to reduce variance.

- It ensures the state covariance matrix remains positive definite by incorporating additional constraints.

6. For nonlinear systems, the method iteratively updates the variational parameters. What is the convergence criterion used? How many iterations are typically required?

7. How do the update equations simplify for linear Gaussian models? What Kalman filter form is equivalent to the method in this case? 

8. The method is applied to maneuvering target tracking problems. What aspects of maneuvering targets make adaptive filtering challenging? How does the proposed method address these?

9. What are the computational and accuracy trade-offs between sampling-based and optimization-based approaches for adaptive Bayesian filtering? Why does this paper focus on an optimization method?

10. The performance is benchmarked against several other adaptive Kalman filters. Can you summarize the relative strengths and weaknesses identified? What future work could build on this method?
