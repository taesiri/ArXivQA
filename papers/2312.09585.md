# [Joint State Estimation and Noise Identification Based on Variational   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09585)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of state estimation for dynamical systems when the process and measurement noise covariances are unknown. Not knowing the true noise statistics can lead to poor state estimates. The paper studies this problem for both linear and nonlinear state space models. 

Existing solutions using sampling-based or optimization-based methods have limitations in accuracy, speed, simplicity and generality. Variational Bayesian (VB) methods have shown promise for adaptive Kalman filtering but most existing methods are limited to linear models or perform updates in the natural parameter space which is inefficient.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel adaptive Kalman filter based on conjugate-computation variational inference (CVI) called CVIAKF. The key ideas are:

1) Formulate joint state and noise covariance estimation as a variational inference problem to approximate the intractable posterior density.

2) Optimize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective in the expectation parameter space instead of natural parameter space. This avoids computing the Fisher information matrix leading to faster updates. 

3) For nonlinear models, decompose the ELBO into conjugate and non-conjugate parts. Apply conjugate computations and stochastic mirror descent optimization for these parts respectively. Use reparameterization trick to reduce variance of stochastic gradients of non-conjugate part.

4) Ensure state covariance matrix remains positive definite after each update using line search.

Main Contributions:

- A new perspective for adaptive Kalman filtering using CVI framework with optimization in expectation parameter space

- Closed-form update equations for linear models 

- An iterative procedure based on stochastic mirror descent and reparameterization for nonlinear models

- Demonstrated improved performance over state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world tracking data

The CVIAKF method contributes towards accurate and computationally efficient solutions for joint state and noise covariance estimation problems, with broad applicability.
