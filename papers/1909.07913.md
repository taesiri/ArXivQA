# [Learning to Deceive with Attention-Based Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07913)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether attention scores in neural networks necessarily indicate which input features influence the model's predictions. The authors test this by developing a method to manipulate attention scores away from certain "impermissible" tokens during training, while still relying on those tokens to make accurate predictions. Their main hypothesis seems to be that attention scores can be easily manipulated in this way, calling into question their use as explanations of a model's reasoning process. The authors evaluate their hypothesis through experiments on text classification and sequence-to-sequence tasks, showing they can diminish attention on impermissible tokens without substantially harming predictive performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is showing that attention weights in neural networks are easily manipulable and should not necessarily be interpreted as explanations for a model's predictions. The key points are:

- The authors propose a simple method to manipulate attention weights during training by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This penalizes models for assigning high attention to certain designated "impermissible" words or tokens, like gender indicators.  

- Across several text classification and sequence-to-sequence tasks, they show the attention weights can be significantly reduced on the impermissible tokens with little impact on overall accuracy. This suggests the models are still relying on those features despite minimizing attention to them.

- In a human study, they demonstrate that manipulated attention weights successfully deceive people into thinking a biased occupation classifier is not influenced by gender. This shows the potential for attention explanations to be misleading.

- They find the models use techniques like passing information through recurrent connections or increasing representation magnitudes to maintain performance when attention is restricted. This highlights the limitations of attention as the sole explanation method.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating the ease of manipulating attention weights to produce deceptive explanations, casting doubt on the reliability of using attention as the sole method for explaining or auditing neural models. The authors argue attention should be interpreted more cautiously in fairness and accountability applications.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper demonstrates that attention weights in neural networks can be easily manipulated during training to produce deceptive explanations that fool humans, raising concerns about using attention for model interpretability and auditing.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a clever approach to manipulate attention weights in neural network models, showing that attention may not provide true explanations for model predictions. Here are some key ways it relates to prior work:

- It builds on recent papers like Jain & Wallace (2019) and Wiegreffe & Pinter (2019) that have also questioned the explanatory power of attention weights. However, this paper goes a step further by actively manipulating attention during training, rather than just perturbing attention post-hoc.

- The training procedure to minimize attention on impermissible tokens is novel and demonstrates just how easy it is to alter attention without substantially hurting model accuracy. This casts more doubt on attention as explanation compared to prior work.

- The human studies evaluating how manipulated attention fools people is a nice addition over just evaluating model metrics. Showing that people find the explanations believable really highlights the potential risks.

- Looking at sequence-to-sequence tasks expands the scope beyond just classification tasks in most prior attention explanation papers. Identifying alternative mechanisms like increased token magnitudes is insightful.

Overall, this paper makes a strong statement about attention manipulation compared to related work. The active training procedure and human studies take the conclusions about attention being an unreliable explanation to another level. The analysis of how models find workarounds is also novel. This provides an important cautionary tale for those hoping to use attention for auditing or explaining models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other methods for manipulating attention besides the additive penalty term they introduced. They suggest that more sophisticated manipulation methods may allow even lower attention mass on impermissible tokens without sacrificing much accuracy.

- Extending the analysis to other modalities like images, where attention mechanisms are also commonly used. The authors only focused on NLP tasks in this work.

- Further analyzing the alternative mechanisms that models use to "cheat" and rely on impermissible tokens despite low attention. The authors identified some recurring mechanisms but suggest more work is needed to fully characterize this behavior. 

- Evaluating other proposed uses and interpretations of attention beyond explanation and auditing algorithms, to see if they are also susceptible to manipulation.

- Developing modified attention mechanisms that are more difficult to manipulate away from ground truth dependencies. The ease of manipulation they demonstrated highlights issues with current attention schemes.

- Exploring other evaluation methods beyond having humans rate attention maps, to more rigorously measure how well attention corresponds to feature importance.

- Testing the ideas on larger-scale state-of-the-art models like T5 and Meena to see if the same behaviors hold. The authors experimented with somewhat small models.

In summary, the authors call into question common practices around interpreting attention maps and suggest further work is needed to develop attention mechanisms that better capture meaningful explanations of model behavior. Their results highlight the ease with which attention can currently be manipulated and its lack of reliability for auditing algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper demonstrates that attention weights in neural networks can be easily manipulated during training to produce deceptive explanations. The authors propose a simple method to minimize the attention assigned to certain impermissible tokens, even when the model relies on those tokens for predictions. Across several classification and sequence-to-sequence tasks, they show that the attention weights can be significantly altered with minimal impact on accuracy. The manipulated attention masks are able to deceive human evaluators into thinking biased models do not use problematic features like gender. The authors identify mechanisms like recurrent connections and increased token magnitudes that allow models to workaround the diminished attention. They conclude that attention may not reliably indicate feature importance and caution against using it to audit algorithms for fairness or accountability without further verification.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper demonstrates that attention weights in neural networks can be easily manipulated during training to produce deceptive explanations. The authors introduce a simple penalty term to the training objective that discourages assigning attention to certain designated "impermissible" tokens, even though the models rely on these features for prediction. They show across several classification and sequence-to-sequence tasks that the attention weights can be diminished to very small values with little impact on accuracy. This indicates attention may not provide reliable explanations about which input tokens are influential in a model's predictions.

The authors conduct a human study where annotations are shown from models predicting occupation from biographies, some with manipulated attention. Annotators are deceived by the manipulated attention into thinking biased models do not rely on gender, even though they clearly do. Overall, the ease of manipulating attention during training without hurting predictive performance casts doubt on the validity of attention for auditing algorithms and providing trustworthy explanations. The results suggest attention mechanisms likely improve predictive accuracy through means distinct from their perceived role in highlighting explanatory input features.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a simple technique for training neural network models to produce deceptive attention masks. The key idea is to add a penalty term to the training loss function that discourages assigning high attention weights to certain impermissible tokens specified beforehand. This penalty term maximizes the total attention assigned to the permissible tokens. The method is evaluated across a diverse set of classification and sequence-to-sequence tasks where some tokens are known a priori to be indispensable for good accuracy. It is shown that the attention weights on the impermissible tokens can be significantly reduced via this approach while retaining the original task performance. The ease of manipulating attention raises concerns about using attention weights for model interpretability and auditing algorithms for fairness. The paper also analyzes the mechanisms through which models are able to work around the low attention weights on impermissible tokens.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points from my reading of the paper are:

- The paper is questioning the reliability of attention mechanisms in neural networks as explanations for model predictions. There is a common belief that attention weights indicate which input tokens a model "focuses on" when making a prediction.

- The authors challenge this notion by showing that attention weights can easily be manipulated during training without significantly affecting the model's predictions.

- They design a simple training scheme that reduces attention weights on specified "impermissible" input tokens that are known apriori to be useful for prediction. The models can still perform well while assigning low attention to these important tokens.

- This indicates attention may not provide true "explanations" for predictions, since models can rely on input tokens even when attention is manipulated to minimize weights on those tokens.

- The authors demonstrate their attention manipulation method on various classification and sequence-to-sequence tasks. They also show it is able to deceive human evaluators about whether models rely on problematic gender tokens for occupation classification.

- The key concern is that attention may not be a reliable method for auditing or explaining model behaviors, since attention weights can be deliberately manipulated by malicious actors or models that "cheat" to hide dependence on certain inputs.

In summary, the main issue addressed is questioning attention as an explanation tool, since attention weights can easily be manipulated to hide a model's true reasoning process. The authors rationally demonstrate this through experiments and analysis.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper questions whether attention weights in neural networks necessarily indicate the features that influence the model's predictions. Through experiments on classification and sequence-to-sequence tasks, the authors show that attention weights are surprisingly easy to manipulate without significantly affecting performance. They design a training scheme to minimize the total weight assigned to designated impermissible tokens, even when the models rely on these features for prediction. Across multiple models like LSTMs, Transformers and BERT, their approach manipulates attention weights while incurring little cost to accuracy. The paper demonstrates the implications for using attention to audit algorithms for fairness - malicious actors could employ this technique to mislead regulators into thinking their biased models do not rely on problematic features identified a priori. The authors also analyze the mechanisms through which the manipulated models attain low attention values, identifying effects like increased representation magnitudes and information flow through recurrent connections. Overall, this work casts doubt on the reliability of using attention weights as explanations of model predictions, showing they can be deceivingly manipulated away from tokens known to be useful a priori.
