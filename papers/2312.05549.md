# [Multi-granularity Causal Structure Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05549)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Multi-granularity Causal Structure Learning":

Problem:
- Existing causal structure learning algorithms focus only on modeling causality between individual variables (micro-variables), ignoring causal relationships at the level of multiple interacting variables (macro-variables). 
- However, in many real-world systems like the brain or complex networks, macro-level causality is more pronounced and revealing. This is known as "causal emergence".  
- Learning multi-granularity causality is more complex but provides a deeper understanding of the system's behavior. 
- Also, current methods struggle with computational complexity and efficacy drops on high-dimensional observational data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops a new method called Multi-granularity Causal Structure Learning (MgCSL) to learn causality between micro- and macro-variables.
- MgCSL first uses a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to automatically extract macro-variables from micro-variables by enforcing sparsity. This provides a causal abstraction to a higher level.
- Next, MgCSL builds an MLP for each micro-variable using both micro- and macro-variables as inputs to model the generative processes and causal mechanisms.
- It introduces a simplified acyclicity constraint for efficient optimization to search the DAG.  

Main Contributions:
- MgCSL pioneers learning of multi-granularity causality between micro- and macro-variables, capturing more complex causal interactions.
- The SAE component explores sensible coarse-graining strategies to obtain macro-variable representations.
- The simplified acyclicity penalty enables fast orientation of causal edges.
- Experiments show MgCSL outperforms baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency. It also discovers interpretable macro-level causality from fMRI data.

In summary, the key innovation of MgCSL is modeling more intricate causality across multiple granularity levels, while maintaining high efficacy. This helps gain deeper causal insights from complex real-world systems.
