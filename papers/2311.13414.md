# [From Images to Connections: Can DQN with GNNs learn the Strategic Game   of Hex?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13414)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores replacing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with graph neural networks (GNNs) in self-play reinforcement learning for the game of Hex. The authors argue that unlike games like Go where local spatial patterns dominate, Hex contains more complex non-local dependencies that are problematic for CNNs to capture. GNNs on the other hand can encode intricate relationships through message passing on graph structures. They first represent Hex boards as equivalent Shannon switching games, allowing for graph-based problem formulations. New self-play RL algorithms GraphDQN and GraphAra are proposed by integrating GNNs within Rainbow DQN and AlphaZero-style training frameworks. Evaluations reveal GNNs make far fewer mistakes on tailored long-range Hex dependency problems across varied board sizes, exhibiting stronger generalization. However, CNNs show greater proficiency on local patterns. In supervised Hex policy learning settings, GNNs also demonstrate significantly reduced overfitting. Finally, the GraphAra agent achieves competitive playing strength against state-of-the-art Hex agents. The analysis provides compelling evidence that task-specific inductive biases modeled via GNNs can enhance self-play RL, outlining a potential paradigm shift. While Hex provides an ideal testbed, efficiently representing other games like Go and Chess with graphs remains an open challenge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes replacing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with graph neural networks (GNNs) in self-play reinforcement learning for the game of Hex. The authors introduce GraphDQN and GraphAra, which integrate GNNs with RainbowDQN and AlphaZero methodologies respectively. Hex is used as an experimental testbed since it has an equivalent graph representation, allowing GNNs to capture non-local dependencies missed by CNNs. Empirical evaluations reveal GNNs make fewer mistakes on long-range dependency problems compared to CNNs, exhibiting better generalizability. However, CNNs show greater proficiency at discerning local patterns critical for competitive play. While not conclusively superior, GNNs demonstrate strengths in encoding complex connections in Hex. The authors conclude that problem-specific structural representations, instead of one-size-fits-all approaches, are key to effective self-play reinforcement learning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates replacing convolutional neural networks with graph neural networks in self-play reinforcement learning for the game of Hex, finding that GNNs are better at capturing long-range dependencies but may not surpass CNNs in playing strength.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my analysis, the central research question this paper addresses is:

Can graph neural networks (GNNs), with their ability to encode complex connections, replace convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in self-play reinforcement learning for games like Hex?

The paper investigates whether GNNs can overcome limitations of CNNs in capturing non-local dependencies and patterns in certain games, by leveraging graph representations and relational inductive biases. The game of Hex is used as an experimental testbed to compare GNNs against CNNs in the context of self-play reinforcement learning. The central hypothesis is that GNNs will excel at dealing with long range dependency situations in Hex game states compared to CNNs.

In summary, the paper examines if GNNs can replace CNNs in self-play RL for games, using Hex as a case study to demonstrate the potential of using game-specific graphical structures to reshape such learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and evaluating the combination of graph neural networks (GNNs) with self-play reinforcement learning for the game of Hex. Specifically, the paper introduces two GNN-based self-play RL approaches:

1) GraphDQN: Integrating GNNs with Rainbow DQN to enable self-play reinforcement learning while capturing non-local patterns and task-specific relationships in Hex more accurately compared to CNNs.

2) GraphAra: Combining GNNs with an AlphaZero-inspired methodology to show that the capabilities of GNNs extend beyond RainbowDQN.

The key findings are:

- GNNs excel at dealing with long range dependency situations in Hex game states and are less prone to overfitting compared to CNNs. 

- However, CNNs show better proficiency at discerning local patterns in Hex.

Overall, the paper demonstrates the potential of using game-specific structures like graphs to reshape self-play reinforcement learning instead of a one-size-fits-all convolutional neural network approach.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper compares graph neural networks (GNNs) to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for playing the game of Hex using self-play reinforcement learning. Specifically:

- It shows that GNNs make significantly fewer mistakes on long-range dependency problems in Hex compared to CNNs. This suggests GNNs are better at capturing non-local patterns.

- However, CNNs (specifically the Gao architecture) still achieve a higher win rate against the GNNs in self-play. This indicates CNNs are still more proficient at discerning local patterns important for strong Hex play. 

- GNNs exhibit better generalization across different Hex board sizes. The CNNs, especially the U-Net, see a huge drop in playing strength when evaluated on unseen board sizes.

- In supervised learning settings, GNNs overfit less compared to CNNs when trained to imitate expert Hex play.

Overall, the key comparison is between CNNs and GNNs on the task of learning to play Hex. The results demonstrate advantages of using a graph representation and GNNs in certain aspects, but CNNs still dominate in terms of raw playing strength. The paper argues game-specific structure should guide the choice of architecture in self-play reinforcement learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors do not explicitly suggest specific future research directions. They state in the conclusion:

"To conclude, the main message of our paper is to move beyond the one-size-fits-all approach and to use representations that fit the (game-)specific structures, problems and goals."

So they recommend using representations tailored to the specific game or problem at hand, rather than only relying on convolutional neural networks. They showed graph neural networks can be advantageous for Hex due to its underlying graph structure.

They do not outline specific avenues for future work. The paper focuses on analyzing the potential of graph neural networks for self-play reinforcement learning in the game of Hex.
