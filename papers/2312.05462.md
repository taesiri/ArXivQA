# [HumanReg: Self-supervised Non-rigid Registration of Human Point Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05462)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Estimating dense correspondence between pairs of sparse and noisy human point clouds captured in outdoor scenes. This is challenging due to sparsity, occlusion, ambiguity and noise in the scans. Existing methods rely on expensive manual annotations or fail to handle such sparse real-world scans.

Proposed Solution:
1) A registration framework called HumanReg that introduces a body-part segmentation head to enhance point features and guide the alignment process. 

2) A novel set of self-supervised losses to train on unlabeled real-world data, including:
   - Chamfer loss to warp source points close to target
   - Smoothness loss for local spatial flow smoothness  
   - Clustering loss so points of the same body part cluster together
   - Part-rigid loss that assumes each body part undergoes a near-rigid transformation

3) A synthetic dataset called HumanSyn4D with ground truth flows for pretraining, containing multi-person point clouds simulated from LiDAR scans.

Main Contributions:
1) An end-to-end framework HumanReg for registering sparse human point clouds in a self-supervised manner

2) A formulation of the non-rigid human registration problem as a part-rigid registration problem with designed losses  

3) HumanSyn4D, a large synthetic dataset of dynamic human point clouds with ground truth flows for pretraining

Experiments show HumanReg achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAPE-512 dataset and robust alignment on a very challenging real-world basketball dataset. Ablations demonstrate the benefits of the proposed components.
