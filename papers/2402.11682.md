# [Learning Conditional Invariances through Non-Commutativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11682)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional invariance learning algorithms that aim to extract shared features across domains tend to discard domain-specific information. However, certain domain-specific features can be useful for downstream tasks. 
- This is especially true under domain asymmetry, where the target domain contains additional semantically relevant information compared to the source domain(s). Discarding target domain-specific features harms performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new notion of non-commutative invariance (NCI) for learning conditional invariances based on the idea of operator non-commutativity. 
- NCI aims to map source samples to the representation space of the target domain, while retaining all components of the target domain unchanged. This allows leveraging source domains as augmentations, while preserving useful target-specific features.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the notion of domain asymmetry where target domain has additional useful semantic information compared to source(s).
- Shows NCI can leverage source domains to meet sample complexity of learning optimal target encoder.
- Proves NCI provides stricter generalization bound on target risk compared to marginal/unconditional invariance learning.  
- Empirically demonstrates state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance with NCI, approaching oracle that has access to all domains during evaluation.
- Overall, proposes a principled approach to conditional invariance learning that retains useful domain-specific information unlike traditional marginal invariance methods.

In summary, the paper introduces a theoretical framework based on non-commutativity to achieve conditional invariance across domains, with superior properties compared to existing invariance learning techniques.
