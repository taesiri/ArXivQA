# [QD-BEV : Quantization-aware View-guided Distillation for Multi-view 3D   Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10515)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is how to enable efficient deployment of state-of-the-art multi-view 3D object detection models based on bird's eye view (BEV) representations while maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, the paper points out that existing BEV models like BEVFormer have high computational and memory requirements, making deployment difficult. At the same time, directly applying standard model compression techniques like quantization can lead to significant accuracy drops. To address this, the paper proposes a new method called QD-BEV that applies progressive quantization-aware training and a novel view-guided distillation approach to obtain compact yet accurate BEV models. The key research question is whether their proposed techniques can enable efficient deployment of BEV models without sacrificing accuracy.The paper shows through experiments that their QD-BEV models can match or even exceed the accuracy of the original BEVFormer models while requiring 8x less memory. This demonstrates the effectiveness of their method in obtaining efficient BEV models. The view-guided distillation technique is a key contribution that helps boost quantized model accuracy by leveraging complementary image and BEV knowledge.In summary, the central research question is how to deploy resource-hungry BEV models efficiently without hurting accuracy, which the paper addresses through quantization-aware training and view-guided distillation. The experiments validate that their approach can produce highly compact yet accurate BEV models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The authors propose a new method called QD-BEV for efficient multi-view 3D object detection based on bird's eye view (BEV). 2. They conduct systematic experiments to analyze the issues with directly quantizing BEV models, showing that standard post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) methods face challenges like training instability and significant performance degradation.3. To address these challenges, they design a novel view-guided distillation (VGD) technique specifically for BEV models. VGD leverages complementary information from both image features and BEV features to boost performance and stabilize training. 4. Through extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, they demonstrate that their QD-BEV models can match or even outperform the floating-point counterparts under 4-bit weight and 6-bit activation quantization. For example, their QD-BEV-Tiny achieves 1.8% higher NDS than the baseline BevFormer-Tiny, while having 8x smaller model size.5. Compared to standard PTQ and QAT baselines, QD-BEV shows superior accuracy under ultra-low bit quantization. The results highlight the effectiveness of their proposed techniques in obtaining highly efficient yet accurate BEV models.In summary, the key innovation is the design of view-guided distillation to enable effective deployment of compact BEV models via quantization, with empirical results validating their approach over baselines. The method helps bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency for practical multi-view 3D detection.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR for the paper:The paper proposes a view-guided distillation method that leverages both image and BEV features to train a quantized student network, achieving model compression and improved efficiency for multi-view 3D object detection while maintaining or exceeding the accuracy of larger floating point models.In summary, the paper introduces a technique called "view-guided distillation" to train a compressed and quantized student network for multi-view 3D object detection.

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more specialized loss functions for knowledge distillation that better transfer dark knowledge from the teacher to the student network. The paper mentions that their proposed distillation loss functions like attention transfer and relation distillation are initial attempts, but more research can be done to design losses tailored for different models and tasks.- Exploring different teacher-student setups like using an ensemble of teachers, distilling bidirectional knowledge between peer networks, etc. The authors suggest these could help provide more diverse and complementary knowledge to the student. - Applying knowledge distillation to new domains and tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection, segmentation, natural language processing, etc. The authors note distillation is a quite general technique that could be beneficial across many applications.- Studying how to best schedule or combine different distillation loss functions over the course of training. The paper evaluates losses individually but suggests an area for future work is finding optimal strategies to integrate multiple losses.- Analyzing theoretical properties of knowledge distillation including generalization bounds, feature space effects, and connections to model compression. More formal analysis can provide better understanding of why and how distillation works.- Exploring semi-supervised, unsupervised, and online distillation scenarios where limited labeled data is available.

Overall the authors position knowledge distillation as a broad and powerful concept with many opportunities for further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method called QD-BEV for efficient multi-view 3D object detection based on bird's eye view (BEV) representations. The key ideas are to use progressive quantization-aware training (QAT) to compress existing BEV models like BEVFormer into low-bit quantized versions, and complement this with a novel view-guided distillation (VGD) technique that leverages both image and BEV domain knowledge. Specifically, they take a pre-trained floating-point BEVFormer model as a teacher and train a quantized student model with progressive QAT which gradually reduces bit precision over training stages. To further boost performance, VGD is applied where the teacher supervises the student model using distillation losses computed on both image features and BEV features. By carefully combining these losses using camera viewpoint information, VGD provides improved stability and accuracy. Experiments on nuScenes show their 4-bit weight, 6-bit activation QD-BEV-Tiny model achieves 1.8% higher NDS than BEVFormer-Tiny while being 8x smaller. QD-BEV consistently outperforms standard quantization techniques like PTQ and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper "BEVFormer: Bird's Eye View Transformers for 3D Object Detection":The paper proposes a new architecture called BEVFormer for multi-camera 3D object detection from a bird's eye view perspective. BEVFormer consists of a backbone network to extract multi-view image features, which are then projected to bird's eye view queries using camera geometry. Cross attention layers between the BEV queries and image features allow information exchange between the bird's eye view and image domains. Additionally, temporal self-attention is used on past BEV queries to model motion and occlusion patterns. The key benefits of BEVFormer are: 1) The dense BEV queries provide strong spatial reasoning of objects in 3D space compared to sparse 3D boxes in previous works. 2) The transformer architecture allows effective communication between the BEV and image domains to refine outputs. 3) Temporal modeling handles object occlusion and motion. Experiments on nuScenes show BEVFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a large margin. The model is also efficient and runs at 25 FPS. Overall, BEVFormer provides an accurate and efficient transformer-based architecture for multi-camera 3D detection.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "QD-BEV: Quantization-aware View-guided Distillation for Multi-view 3D Object Detection":The paper proposes a novel method called Quantization-aware View-guided Distillation (QD-BEV) to obtain efficient and accurate models for multi-view 3D object detection based on bird's eye view (BEV). It first applies progressive quantization-aware training to compress the model size while maintaining accuracy. This involves gradually quantizing different parts of the model to constrain the quantization perturbation. The quantized model is then further optimized using a view-guided distillation method that leverages both image features and BEV features from a teacher model to supervise the training of the student model. Specifically, it computes distillation losses on the image and BEV features respectively using KL divergence between teacher and student outputs. These losses are then combined in a view-guided manner using known camera parameters to obtain the overall distillation objective. By exploiting complementary cues from multiple views, QD-BEV achieves improved accuracy and efficiency compared to directly quantizing or using distillation alone.
