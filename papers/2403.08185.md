## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Perceive With Confidence: Statistical Safety Assurances for Navigation with Learning-Based Perception":

Problem:
Rapid advances in perception have enabled large pre-trained models to process sensor observations into rich representations of the environment (e.g. occupancy predictions). However, safely integrating these models into robots remains challenging due to lack of reliability in unfamiliar environments. Specifically, two key challenges are:
1) Generalization: Pre-trained models may fail to generalize to novel environments.
2) Closed-loop distribution shift: When the perception model is used by the robot's planner, the distribution of states visited shifts away from the original training distribution, causing more errors.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper presents a framework called "Perceive with Confidence" (PWC) to provide statistical safety assurances when using pre-trained perception models. The key ideas are:

1) Use conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in the perception model's outputs based on a calibration dataset, in order to provide assurances on correctness.

2) Address closed-loop distribution shift by considering errors from all possible locations in the calibration environments, making the assurances robust to any states visited at test time.

3) The calibrated perception system can be paired with any safe planner to ensure overall system safety. This modular approach allows easy integration.

Contributions:
1) A method to provide statistical safety assurances for pre-trained perception systems using conformal prediction. 

2) Explicit handling of generalization to novel environments and closed-loop distribution shift.

3) Demonstration of safety assurances holding both in simulation and hardware experiments with a quadruped robot navigating real unseen environments.

4) Significantly improved empirical safety over baselines, with only modest reductions in task completion rate.

In summary, the paper provides a principled framework to safely utilize unreliable perception systems by conformal calibration, allowing provable statistical safety assurances. The modular design also enables easy integration into existing systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework that utilizes conformal prediction techniques to provide statistical safety assurances when using pre-trained perception models for navigation by calibrating the perception system in a way that is robust to distribution shifts during closed-loop deployment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a framework for rigorously quantifying the uncertainty of a pre-trained perception model in order to provide an end-to-end statistical safety assurance for perception-based navigation tasks. Specifically, the authors propose a modular approach that produces a calibrated perception model by lightly processing the outputs of a pre-trained model using techniques from conformal prediction. This calibrated model can then be used with any downstream safe planner to ensure, with high probability, safety from obstacles in new environments not seen during training or calibration. A key aspect is accounting for closed-loop distribution shifts and ensuring generalization. The approach is evaluated in simulation and hardware experiments with a quadruped robot navigating in cluttered environments.

The paper presents a framework called "Perceive with Confidence" (PwC) that provides statistical safety assurances for perception-based navigation tasks. It utilizes conformal prediction techniques to quantify the uncertainty of a pre-trained perception model and account for distribution shifts that can occur when the perception system is deployed in a closed loop with a planner. A key contribution is handling the closed-loop distribution shift to ensure the safety assurances hold when the overall system is deployed. The calibrated perception outputs are combined with a non-deterministic filter and safe planner to guarantee end-to-end statistical safety in novel test environments. Experiments are demonstrated on a quadruped robot navigating real-world environments with unseen obstacles.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in the outputs of a pre-trained perception model. How does this approach for uncertainty quantification compare to other common techniques like ensemble methods or Bayesian neural networks? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The paper handles closed-loop distribution shift by considering the worst-case performance of the perception system across all states in the calibration environments. However, this could be overly conservative in some cases. Are there other techniques from distributionally robust optimization or offline RL that could provide less conservative ways to handle closed-loop shifts?  

3. The non-deterministic filter proposed relies on intersection and union operations over predicted bounding boxes. Could more sophisticated Bayesian filtering techniques be integrated while still providing formal guarantees? How would the complexity and conservatism compare?

4. What choices were made in constructing the non-conformity score function? How do these impact the conservatism and applicability of the overall approach? Could other non-conformity scores lead to better performance?

5. The paper focuses on bounding box prediction for obstacle avoidance. How could the overall framework be extended to provide assurances on more complex perceptual outputs like semantic segmentation or full scene completion?

6. What aspects of the planner used impact the overall safety assurances? Could the method work with more sophisticated motion planners like optimization-based approaches? Would the guarantees still hold?

7. The method is evaluated on a quadrupedal robot. How applicable is the approach to other robotic systems like autonomous cars or drones? Would new calibration procedures need to be devised?   

8. What kinds of dynamics uncertainties could be incorporated while still preserving the overall safety guarantees? Are there limits on the amount of uncertainty that could be handled?

9. How sensitive is the performance of the method to the composition and size of the calibration dataset used? Could active learning be utilized to reduce the dataset requirements?

10. The paper focuses on safety for navigation among static obstacles. How could the framework handle dynamic obstacles like pedestrians? Would the guarantees need to be modified?
