# [Sets are all you need: Ultrafast jet classification on FPGAs for HL-LHC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01876)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- With the upcoming high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the data volumes and complexity will increase drastically. This will require upgrades to the real-time trigger systems of LHC particle detectors to maintain detection efficiency.
- Specifically, there is a need for fast and accurate machine learning algorithms that can perform jet tagging (classifying origin of jets) to improve trigger selections. However, such algorithms must satisfy tight latency (<100 ns) and resource constraints to be deployable. 

Proposed Solution:
- Implement and evaluate jet tagging networks like multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), deep sets, and interaction networks on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), leveraging model compression techniques like pruning and quantization-aware training.  
- Use the hls4ml library to translate TensorFlow/Keras models to optimized firmware to map them efficiently onto the FPGA fabric.
- Study the accuracy, latency and resource utilization tradeoffs for architectures as the number of jet constituents is varied.

Main Contributions:
- Show that deep sets and interaction networks outperform MLPs in accuracy when number of jet constituents is >8, at the cost of higher latency and resource usage.
- Demonstrate MLP, deep sets, and interaction network architectures that can achieve <100 ns inference latency for jet tagging using FPGAs.
- Present detailed resource utilization and latency benchmarks for mapping these networks onto a representative FPGA chip using model compression. 
- Provide optimized firmware implementations and analysis to guide future on-detector deployments of fast machine learning for LHC triggers.

In summary, the paper makes significant progress towards enabling performant on-chip jet tagging for future high-luminosity LHC triggers by evaluating neural architectures and hardware mappings.
