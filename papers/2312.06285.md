## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel sampling algorithm called compensation sampling (CS) to accelerate the training convergence and improve image quality of diffusion models. The key idea is to use a learned compensation term to continuously direct the image reconstruction towards the true data distribution during training. This avoids error accumulation over time that leads to slow convergence. Specifically, the compensation term is implemented as a lightweight U-Net and trained with an L1 loss. The method retains the Gaussian assumptions of the denoising process in diffusion models. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on unconditional generation, face inpainting, and face de-occlusion tasks using CIFAR-10, CelebA, CelebA-HQ, FFHQ, and FSG datasets. The compensation sampling algorithm consistently yields higher quality images compared to current diffusion models, while requiring up to 10 times fewer steps during training and inference. This significantly reduces overall training time. The method can accelerate convergence during training by an order of magnitude without compromising output quality or diversity. Both qualitative and quantitative results validate the efficacy of compensation sampling in diffusion models.
