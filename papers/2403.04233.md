# [DEEP-ICL: Definition-Enriched Experts for Language Model In-Context   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04233)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) has limitations such as fixed input lengths, limiting the number of demonstrations that can be provided. Even with sufficient demonstrations, ICL performance cannot be improved further.  
- Few-shot learning techniques are difficult to generalize to completely unseen tasks.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce DEEP-ICL, a novel task Definition Enriched Expert Ensembling methodology for ICL.
- Delineate roles between two 3B models - one focuses on task definition determination, the other specializes in learning from task-specific demonstrations.  
- Create a dynamic expert pool filled with prior knowledge to overcome generalization issues in few-shot learning. Experts can be selected based on task definitions derived in the first phase.

Key Contributions:
- Confirm that improvement from ICL relies on understanding task definitions rather than solely on model size. 
- Demonstrate that the synergistic efficacy of the dual 3B model DEEP-ICL approach is on par with the ICL performance of a 13B parameter LLaMA model.
- Design the expert pool to expand continually with new demonstrations, enhancing capacity over time. This supports lifelong learning and surmounts limitations of fixed sequence lengths.

In summary, DEEP-ICL offers an efficient alternative to conventional ICL that divides roles between models, leverages expert ensembling, and facilitates continual learning - overcoming key limitations of existing methods. Experiments exhibit strong performance competitive with models much larger in size.
