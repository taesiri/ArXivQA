# [SM4Depth: Seamless Monocular Metric Depth Estimation across Multiple   Cameras and Scenes by One Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08556)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE) has long suffered from poor generalization due to challenges at three levels:

1) Camera level: Different camera parameters like focal length lead to "metric ambiguity", causing inconsistent depth predictions across cameras. 

2) Scene level: Real-world scenes have vastly different depth ranges (e.g. 1-2m for indoors vs 0.5-80m for streets). Existing methods tend to focus on specific scenes, leading to inaccurate depth ranges.  

3) Data level: Determining the correct depth range requires searching an extremely large solution space. Existing methods directly predict from this entire space, needing massive training data (e.g. 8 million images).

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes SM^4Depth, a single network for seamless MMDE across multiple cameras and scenes.

1) Camera level: The key insight is that consistent field-of-view (FOV) is crucial for resolving metric ambiguity. This guides a more straightforward pre-processing step to align images to the same FOV.

2) Scene level: The key ideas are: (i) Model metric scale determination as discretizing the depth range into bins; (ii) Propose "variation-based" bins to reduce ambiguity for diverse scenes. This better captures depth gaps between scenes.

3) Data level: A "divide and conquer" approach is proposed - instead of predicting from the vast solution space directly, divide this into "range domains" and estimate the depth bins in each domain separately. This greatly reduces complexity.

Main Contributions:

1) Reveals FOV consistency is key for camera-invariance, guiding the pre-processing design.  

2) Proposes variation-based depth bins to achieve consistent accuracy across diverse scenes.

3) Reduces reliance on massive training data via a "divide and conquer" domain-aware binning approach.

With just 150K training images, SM^4Depth achieves state-of-the-art performance on most unseen datasets, significantly enhancing the practical applicability of MMDE.
