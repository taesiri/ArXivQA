# [Network Pruning Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09453)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper explores the concept of "network pruning spaces" to study the structure of optimal subnetworks produced by pruning a large neural network. The key research questions/hypotheses are:1. There exists an optimal FLOPs-to-parameters ratio for a given level of pruning that leads to the best performing subnetworks.2. The best performing subnetworks tend to have pruning recipes that produce this optimal FLOPs-to-parameters ratio. 3. The optimal ratio and hence the maximum possible performance of the subnetworks can be predicted as a function of the level of pruning.4. Examining the distributions and ratios of FLOPs and parameters across populations of pruned subnetworks can reveal general principles about how to effectively prune neural networks.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the optimal structure of pruned subnetworks, characterized by the FLOPs/parameters ratio, follows certain general principles that can be revealed through a "network pruning space" analysis across populations of pruned networks. The goal is to gain insight into what makes for effective pruning and improve pruning algorithms.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces the concept of network pruning spaces to explore general principles for filter pruning by analyzing populations of subnetwork architectures, makes conjectures about optimal FLOPs-to-parameter ratios, and shows the performance limitation is predictable based on this ratio.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on network pruning spaces compares to other research in the field of network pruning:- Focus on exploring general principles rather than finding one optimal pruning recipe: This paper takes a broad view of sampling many possible pruning recipes and analyzing the overall distribution, rather than focusing only on finding one best recipe as in most prior pruning work. The goal is to uncover more general insights.- Concept of pruning spaces over populations of subnetworks: The paper introduces the idea of characterizing the space of possible pruned subnetworks for a given network architecture. This provides a framework to analyze distributions and structures of winning subnetworks. - Constraint-based pruning space refinement: Based on conjectures from analyzing pruning spaces, the paper proposes refining the spaces by adding constraints on flops-to-parameters ratios. This reduces the search space and cost of finding good recipes.- Predictability of accuracy tradeoffs: The paper finds accuracy limitations based on flops-to-parameters ratios follow predictable patterns. This is a new insight compared to most pruning research which looks at accuracy results empirically.- Focus on filter pruning: Many recent pruning papers focus on unstructured weight pruning. This paper provides insights specifically for filter pruning, which is important since it can accelerate models on any hardware.Overall, the concepts and insights around pruning spaces, constraints, predictability, and filter pruning specifically differentiate this paper from other approaches in the literature. The goal is to develop a more principled understanding of network pruning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several potential future research directions based on their work:- Further exploration of network pruning spaces and refinement of the proposed conjectures. They suggest sampling more subnetworks, studying other datasets and network architectures, and investigating if more complex relationships exist between factors like FLOPs, parameters, and accuracy.- Development of more systematic ways to reduce the search space and find optimal pruning recipes efficiently. Their constraint on mean computation budget is a first step, but more advanced methods could be developed.- Analytical modeling of the relationship between pruning ratio and accuracy drop limitations. Their empirical observations suggest this may be possible, but actually deriving/fitting such a model remains future work. - Extending the concepts and analysis to other pruning methods like weight pruning, structured pruning, etc. The authors focused on filter pruning but believe their concepts could provide insight into pruning more broadly.- Leveraging the network pruning space analysis and principles to develop new, improved pruning algorithms that generalize across settings. Their work helps interpret existing methods, but could inspire novel techniques.- Studying how factors like network width, depth, architecture design choices, etc affect the pruning space and optimal points within it. Their initial experiments used ResNet but further analyses could provide more architectural insight.So in summary, the main directions are: 1) More extensive empirical analysis of pruning spaces, 2) Developing efficient search methods, 3) Theoretical modeling, 4) Extending the concepts beyond filter pruning, 5) Using the insights to design new pruning algorithms, and 6) Relating pruning principles to architectural design.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces the concept of network pruning spaces to explore general principles for filter pruning. A pruning space comprises a large population of subnetwork architectures pruned from an original network. The authors sample subnetworks from pruning spaces and analyze the resulting distributions. Based on empirical studies, they find that winning subnetworks in different pruning regimes tend to have an optimal FLOPs-to-parameter-bucket ratio close to the original network's ratio. The authors make several conjectures about the existence of optimal ratios and predictable accuracy limitations in pruning regimes. They refine the initial pruning space using constraints on this optimal ratio. Experiments pruning ResNet-50 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet validate their conjectures and show their method finds better subnetworks than prior pruning techniques. Overall, the work provides insights into filter pruning by studying distributions over populations of subnetworks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces the concept of network pruning spaces for exploring general principles in filter pruning. Given a trained neural network, its pruning space comprises a large population of subnetwork architectures generated by different pruning recipes. By sampling and analyzing subnetworks from the pruning space, the authors find several interesting observations: 1) There exists an optimal FLOPs-to-parameter ratio for a given pruning regime. 2) Subnetworks achieving this optimal ratio tend to perform the best. 3) The optimal ratio increases as more aggressive pruning is done. Based on these findings, the authors make a series of conjectures about filter pruning and use them to refine the pruning space, reducing the cost of searching for a good subnetwork architecture. Their results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, outperforming prior pruning methods.In summary, this work proposes network pruning spaces to study populations of pruned subnetworks, revealing insights about optimal architectures. The core observations help explain why certain pruning recipes work well, and lead to techniques to more efficiently search for high-quality subnetworks. The pruning space viewpoint and empirical methodology offer a new way to analyze, understand, and improve neural network pruning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces the concept of network pruning spaces, which comprise populations of subnetwork architectures pruned from an original network model. The pruning space is defined by a constraint on the FLOPs of the subnetworks. The authors sample pruning recipes, which specify pruning ratios for each layer, from this space to generate subnetwork candidates. They analyze the distribution of subnetworks in the pruning space using tools like accuracy drop empirical distribution functions. Based on observations from analyzing subnetwork distributions, the authors make conjectures about the existence of optimal FLOPs-to-parameter ratios and mean computation budgets. They further refine the pruning space using constraints on these ratios to reduce the search cost for finding high-performing subnetworks. The core method is generating and statistically analyzing distributions of subnetworks pruned with different recipes, in order to uncover general principles about the relationship between subnetwork structure and performance after pruning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the limitation of existing filter pruning methods that produce only a single pruning recipe for a specific setting, which may fail to generalize to new settings. The key questions/problems the paper is trying to address are:- How to explore general principles and gain a deeper understanding of what makes pruning recipes effective, beyond just producing the best recipe?- How to refine pruning algorithms and spaces to reduce the cost of searching for good subnetwork architectures? - Whether there are underlying principles or patterns that characterize winning subnetwork architectures across different pruning regimes?Specifically, the paper introduces the concept of "network pruning spaces" to study populations of subnetworks and their distributions, in order to explore the structure of winning subnetworks across different levels of FLOPs/parameter reduction. The goal is to gain insights into core principles of effective pruning rather than just optimizing recipes individually.
