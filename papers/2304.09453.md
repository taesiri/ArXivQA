# [Network Pruning Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09453)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper explores the concept of "network pruning spaces" to study the structure of optimal subnetworks produced by pruning a large neural network. The key research questions/hypotheses are:1. There exists an optimal FLOPs-to-parameters ratio for a given level of pruning that leads to the best performing subnetworks.2. The best performing subnetworks tend to have pruning recipes that produce this optimal FLOPs-to-parameters ratio. 3. The optimal ratio and hence the maximum possible performance of the subnetworks can be predicted as a function of the level of pruning.4. Examining the distributions and ratios of FLOPs and parameters across populations of pruned subnetworks can reveal general principles about how to effectively prune neural networks.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the optimal structure of pruned subnetworks, characterized by the FLOPs/parameters ratio, follows certain general principles that can be revealed through a "network pruning space" analysis across populations of pruned networks. The goal is to gain insight into what makes for effective pruning and improve pruning algorithms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing the concept of network pruning spaces to study general principles for filter pruning. The key ideas and contributions are:- Introducing network pruning spaces that parameterize populations of subnetwork architectures pruned from an original network. This allows analyzing distributions of subnetworks to gain insights into filter pruning. - Making empirical observations from pruning space analysis, including the existence of an optimal FLOPs-to-parameter ratio and its relationship to the performance of pruned subnetworks.- Formulating conjectures based on the observations that help interpret and refine pruning algorithms, such as using constraints on the FLOPs-to-parameter ratio to reduce search costs.- Showing the performance limitation of pruned subnetworks can be predicted as a function of the optimal FLOPs-to-parameter ratio. This provides a tool to reason about efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.Overall, the main contribution is using the new concept of network pruning spaces to uncover general principles and properties of filter pruning through distributional analysis and empirical study. The insights gained can guide the development and improvement of pruning algorithms.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces the concept of network pruning spaces to explore general principles for filter pruning by analyzing populations of subnetwork architectures, makes conjectures about optimal FLOPs-to-parameter ratios, and shows the performance limitation is predictable based on this ratio.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on network pruning spaces compares to other research in the field of network pruning:- Focus on exploring general principles rather than finding one optimal pruning recipe: This paper takes a broad view of sampling many possible pruning recipes and analyzing the overall distribution, rather than focusing only on finding one best recipe as in most prior pruning work. The goal is to uncover more general insights.- Concept of pruning spaces over populations of subnetworks: The paper introduces the idea of characterizing the space of possible pruned subnetworks for a given network architecture. This provides a framework to analyze distributions and structures of winning subnetworks. - Constraint-based pruning space refinement: Based on conjectures from analyzing pruning spaces, the paper proposes refining the spaces by adding constraints on flops-to-parameters ratios. This reduces the search space and cost of finding good recipes.- Predictability of accuracy tradeoffs: The paper finds accuracy limitations based on flops-to-parameters ratios follow predictable patterns. This is a new insight compared to most pruning research which looks at accuracy results empirically.- Focus on filter pruning: Many recent pruning papers focus on unstructured weight pruning. This paper provides insights specifically for filter pruning, which is important since it can accelerate models on any hardware.Overall, the concepts and insights around pruning spaces, constraints, predictability, and filter pruning specifically differentiate this paper from other approaches in the literature. The goal is to develop a more principled understanding of network pruning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several potential future research directions based on their work:- Further exploration of network pruning spaces and refinement of the proposed conjectures. They suggest sampling more subnetworks, studying other datasets and network architectures, and investigating if more complex relationships exist between factors like FLOPs, parameters, and accuracy.- Development of more systematic ways to reduce the search space and find optimal pruning recipes efficiently. Their constraint on mean computation budget is a first step, but more advanced methods could be developed.- Analytical modeling of the relationship between pruning ratio and accuracy drop limitations. Their empirical observations suggest this may be possible, but actually deriving/fitting such a model remains future work. - Extending the concepts and analysis to other pruning methods like weight pruning, structured pruning, etc. The authors focused on filter pruning but believe their concepts could provide insight into pruning more broadly.- Leveraging the network pruning space analysis and principles to develop new, improved pruning algorithms that generalize across settings. Their work helps interpret existing methods, but could inspire novel techniques.- Studying how factors like network width, depth, architecture design choices, etc affect the pruning space and optimal points within it. Their initial experiments used ResNet but further analyses could provide more architectural insight.So in summary, the main directions are: 1) More extensive empirical analysis of pruning spaces, 2) Developing efficient search methods, 3) Theoretical modeling, 4) Extending the concepts beyond filter pruning, 5) Using the insights to design new pruning algorithms, and 6) Relating pruning principles to architectural design.
