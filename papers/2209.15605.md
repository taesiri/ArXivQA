# [Bias Mimicking: A Simple Sampling Approach for Bias Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15605)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we mitigate biases in visual recognition models that arise from spurious correlations in the training data, using simple data sampling techniques?

The key points are:

- Prior work has shown that visual recognition datasets often contain biases, where certain classes are over-represented by samples from particular groups (e.g. blondes are over-represented as female). This can lead models to learn spurious correlations between classes and bias groups.

- Most recent methods to address this problem require complex architectural changes or extra loss functions/hyperparameter tuning. 

- Simple data sampling methods (undersampling, oversampling, etc) from the class imbalance literature offer a cheaper alternative, but have significant shortcomings.

- This paper proposes a new sampling method called "Bias Mimicking" to mitigate the shortcomings of prior sampling approaches for bias mitigation.

- Bias Mimicking ensures models see the full distribution per epoch without repeating samples, preventing overfitting.

- It improves underrepresented group accuracy over sampling baselines while maintaining performance of non-sampling methods.

- The key hypothesis is that Bias Mimicking, through its novel sampling procedure, can effectively mitigate biases while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of sampling-based approaches. The experiments aim to demonstrate this capability.

In summary, the core research question is how to mitigate visual recognition biases effectively using simple sampling techniques, with a proposed solution of Bias Mimicking. The experiments analyze its capabilities compared to other sampling and non-sampling approaches.
