# [Bias Mimicking: A Simple Sampling Approach for Bias Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15605)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we mitigate biases in visual recognition models that arise from spurious correlations in the training data, using simple data sampling techniques?

The key points are:

- Prior work has shown that visual recognition datasets often contain biases, where certain classes are over-represented by samples from particular groups (e.g. blondes are over-represented as female). This can lead models to learn spurious correlations between classes and bias groups.

- Most recent methods to address this problem require complex architectural changes or extra loss functions/hyperparameter tuning. 

- Simple data sampling methods (undersampling, oversampling, etc) from the class imbalance literature offer a cheaper alternative, but have significant shortcomings.

- This paper proposes a new sampling method called "Bias Mimicking" to mitigate the shortcomings of prior sampling approaches for bias mitigation.

- Bias Mimicking ensures models see the full distribution per epoch without repeating samples, preventing overfitting.

- It improves underrepresented group accuracy over sampling baselines while maintaining performance of non-sampling methods.

- The key hypothesis is that Bias Mimicking, through its novel sampling procedure, can effectively mitigate biases while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of sampling-based approaches. The experiments aim to demonstrate this capability.

In summary, the core research question is how to mitigate visual recognition biases effectively using simple sampling techniques, with a proposed solution of Bias Mimicking. The experiments analyze its capabilities compared to other sampling and non-sampling approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Providing an extensive analysis of sampling methods for bias mitigation. The paper notes that many sampling-based methods were missing from recent visual bias mitigation benchmarks. Despite shortcomings, it shows that methods like undersampling and upweighting can be surprisingly competitive on some datasets. 

2. Introducing a new resampling method called Bias Mimicking that bridges the performance gap between sampling and nonsampling methods. It improves underrepresented groups' accuracy by over 3% compared to other sampling methods, while maintaining performance of nonsampling methods.

3. Thoroughly analyzing the behavior of Bias Mimicking through experiments. This includes verifying the importance of each subsample dataset to performance, and testing sensitivity to the core "mimicking" condition. The analysis provides insights into the method.

In summary, the key contributions are providing an analysis of sampling methods for bias mitigation, proposing the new Bias Mimicking approach, and extensively analyzing its behavior. The method bridges the gap between sampling and nonsampling techniques.
