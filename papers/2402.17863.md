# [Vision Transformers with Natural Language Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17863)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Transformers in computer vision (CV) use non-semantic patches/tokens unlike in natural language processing (NLP), where tokens carry semantic meaning. This makes CV transformers less interpretable and robust.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Semantic Vision Transformer (sViT) which uses a segmentation model to break images into semantic segments and take these as tokens.

- Use segment's bounding box coordinates and size as positional embeddings instead of just patch order.

- Allow variable token lengths in transformer, with a 'background token' for remaining pixels.

- Propose segment-level data augmentation to increase diversity.

- Use segment-level gradients for more interpretable importance maps.

Main Contributions:

- Identify lack of semantic tokens as a key difference between CV and NLP transformers. Provide a practical solution using segmentation.

- Demonstrate sViT requires less data, is more robust to distribution shifts, and generalizes better out-of-distribution. 

- Introduce new segment-level augmentation paradigm to increase diversity. Also make model robust to position/size changes.

- Show sViT is more interpretable since segments have inherent meaning. Grad-CAM highlights are hard to explain.

- Overall, bring CV transformers closer to NLP counterparts by using semantic tokens. Enhance performance and interpretability.

In summary, the paper proposes sViT which leverages semantic segmentation to create a more robust, generalizable and interpretable vision transformer, akin to how NLP transformers use meaningful words as tokens.
