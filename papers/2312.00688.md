# [Towards Transparency in Coreference Resolution: A Quantum-Inspired   Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00688)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a quantum-based approach for coreference resolution that integrates symbolic representations of sentence structure with vector representations of word meanings. It translates grammatical structure into parameterized quantum circuits using a quantum version of Lambek Calculus with soft subexponentials (SLLM). The approach represents words as quantum states and composes them guided by syntax. A dataset of over 16K Winograd-style ambiguous pronoun sentences is generated using GPT-3 prompting. A variational quantum classifier is trained on this dataset, integrated into an end-to-end coreference resolution system called QuantumCoref, and evaluated against classical models. QuantumCoref achieves an F1 score of 0.872, comparable to state-of-the-art SpanBERT. By combining predictions from QuantumCoref and classical models like SpanBERT in a mixed approach, performance improves significantly to 0.986 F1, demonstrating the complementary nature of quantum and neural methods. Overall, the quantum approach offers capabilities for modeling structure and gains in efficiency, while improving interpretability over black-box neural models. The promising results motivate further research into quantum natural language processing.
