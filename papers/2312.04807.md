# [Improving Neural Machine Translation by Multi-Knowledge Integration with   Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04807)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Improving neural machine translation (NMT) by integrating different types of external knowledge, such as sentences, terminologies/phrases, and translation templates, remains a challenge. 
- Existing methods focus on using only a single knowledge type and have limitations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a unified framework to integrate multiple knowledge types into NMT models using prompting. 
- The key idea is to concatenate different knowledge types into source and target prefix sequences. These sequences are then used to prepend the input and output of the NMT encoder and decoder.

- Three knowledge types are integrated: 
   1) Similar sentence pairs retrieved from a database
   2) Matching terminology pairs from a dictionary
   3) Predicted translation templates
   
- Special tokens indicate the knowledge type in the prefixes. Input and output separator tokens distinguish the prefixes from the actual source/target sentences.

- The model is trained to incorporate relevant information from the prefixes to improve translation. At inference, new prefixes can be provided without retraining.

Main Contributions:
- A flexible prompting-based method to integrate multi-knowledge into NMT without architecture changes.
- Demonstrated performance improvements from using multiple knowledge types simultaneously, including sentences, terminology and templates.  
- The method enables domain adaptation without model retraining and has better robustness than fine-tuning approaches.
- Significantly increased terminology match accuracy compared to prior works on English-German and English-Chinese translation.

In summary, the key novelty is a prompting approach to effectively incorporate diverse external knowledge into NMT models for better translation quality. The method is simple, flexible and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a unified framework to effectively integrate multiple types of knowledge, including sentences, terminologies/phrases and translation templates, into neural machine translation models as prefix-prompts of the input to guide the translation process for improving translation quality without changing the model architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a simple and effective approach to integrate multi-knowledge into NMT models with prompting. 

2. Demonstrating that an NMT model can benefit from multiple types of knowledge simultaneously, including sentence, terminology/phrases and translation template knowledge.

The paper presents a unified framework that can effectively integrate multiple types of knowledge as prefix-prompts to the encoder and decoder of an NMT model. This guides the translation process and improves both translation quality and terminology match accuracy, as demonstrated in experiments on English-Chinese and English-German translation tasks. The approach requires no changes to model architecture and can automatically adapt to new domains without retraining.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Neural machine translation (NMT)
- Knowledge integration
- Prompting
- Multi-knowledge 
- Sentence knowledge
- Terminology/phrase knowledge  
- Translation template knowledge
- Prefix prompts
- Domain adaptation
- Soft lexical constraints

The paper proposes a unified framework to integrate multiple types of knowledge, including sentences, terminologies/phrases, and translation templates, into neural machine translation models using prompting. The key ideas involve using the knowledge sequences as prefix prompts for the encoder and decoder to guide the translation process. This approach is shown to improve translation quality and terminology match accuracy, especially for domain adaptation, without needing to retrain the models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed method integrate multiple types of knowledge, including sentences, terminologies/phrases and translation templates, into the NMT model? What is the overall framework and what modifications are made to the NMT architecture?

2. How are the different types of knowledge represented and concatenated as input prefixes for the encoder and decoder? Explain the formatting and use of special tokens like [Sentence], [Term], [Template] etc.

3. What is the training strategy adopted? Why is the loss function calculated only over the target sentence tokens instead of the entire output sequence containing knowledge as well?

4. What are the various approaches explored for acquiring the different types of knowledge - similar sentences, terminology matches and translation templates? Explain each briefly. 

5. How does the proposed approach differ from previous priming based methods? What modifications are made to the training objective in the proposed approach compared to standard priming?

6. What decoding strategy is used during inference once the knowledge prefixes are provided as inputs? Does it employ forced decoding over some portion of the output?

7. What are the relative improvements observed by using different combinations of knowledge types - sentences, terminology and templates? Provide quantitative comparisons.

8. How robust is the method to the choice of similarity threshold used for retrieving similar sentences? Analyze the impact.

9. What is the relative inference time overhead compared to vanilla Transformer model? How can it be attributed to different knowledge types and sequence lengths?

10. What are the limitations of the current approach? What future extensions or improvements can be explored to address those?
