# [Improving Neural Machine Translation by Multi-Knowledge Integration with   Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04807)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a unified framework to integrate multiple types of knowledge, including sentences, terminologies/phrases, and translation templates, into neural machine translation (NMT) models using prompting. The key idea is to concatenate the source and target side of the knowledge as prefix-prompts for the encoder and decoder of NMT models. During training, the model learns to incorporate relevant information from the prefixes to improve translation quality. At inference time, new knowledge can be flexibly applied without retraining the model. Experiments on English-German and English-Chinese translation tasks demonstrate significant gains over strong baselines in both translation quality and terminology match accuracy. The method requires no architecture changes, enables automatic domain adaptation, and is more efficient than some prior knowledge integration techniques. Key advantages are the ability to simultaneously leverage multiple knowledge types and the model's capability to automatically select useful knowledge without manual identification. Limitations include added time costs and reliance on obtaining diverse high-quality external knowledge.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes integrating multiple types of knowledge into NMT models with prompting. What are the main motivations and potential benefits of using multi-knowledge integration compared to using only a single knowledge source?

2. How does the proposed method concatenate and represent different types of knowledge (sentences, terminologies, templates) in the input sequence? Explain the role of special tokens used. 

3. Explain in detail the training process and loss function used for the multi-knowledge NMT model. How is it different from standard NMT training?

4. During inference, how does the decoder leverage information from the multiple knowledge sequence prefixes? Explain the process. 

5. The paper evaluates on domain adaptation tasks. Why and how can multi-knowledge integration help for adapting NMT models to new domains without fine-tuning?

6. Analyze and compare the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach over methods like fine-tuning, data augmentation, and non-parametric NMT for domain adaptation.

9. What are the limitations of the multi-knowledge prompting approach in terms of computational overhead and knowledge requirement? Suggest methods to alleviate them.

10. The paper focuses on sentence, terminology and template knowledge integration. What other types of linguistic or semantic knowledge could be potentially integrated in the framework to further improve NMT performance?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Improving neural machine translation (NMT) by integrating different types of external knowledge, such as sentences, terminologies/phrases, and translation templates, remains a challenge. 
- Existing methods focus on using only a single knowledge type and have limitations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a unified framework to integrate multiple knowledge types into NMT models using prompting. 
- The key idea is to concatenate different knowledge types into source and target prefix sequences. These sequences are then used to prepend the input and output of the NMT encoder and decoder.

- Three knowledge types are integrated: 
   1) Similar sentence pairs retrieved from a database
   2) Matching terminology pairs from a dictionary
   3) Predicted translation templates
   
- Special tokens indicate the knowledge type in the prefixes. Input and output separator tokens distinguish the prefixes from the actual source/target sentences.

- The model is trained to incorporate relevant information from the prefixes to improve translation. At inference, new prefixes can be provided without retraining.

Main Contributions:
- A flexible prompting-based method to integrate multi-knowledge into NMT without architecture changes.
- Demonstrated performance improvements from using multiple knowledge types simultaneously, including sentences, terminology and templates.  
- The method enables domain adaptation without model retraining and has better robustness than fine-tuning approaches.
- Significantly increased terminology match accuracy compared to prior works on English-German and English-Chinese translation.

In summary, the key novelty is a prompting approach to effectively incorporate diverse external knowledge into NMT models for better translation quality. The method is simple, flexible and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
