# [Improving Neural Machine Translation by Multi-Knowledge Integration with   Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04807)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Improving neural machine translation (NMT) by integrating different types of external knowledge, such as sentences, terminologies/phrases, and translation templates, remains a challenge. 
- Existing methods focus on using only a single knowledge type and have limitations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a unified framework to integrate multiple knowledge types into NMT models using prompting. 
- The key idea is to concatenate different knowledge types into source and target prefix sequences. These sequences are then used to prepend the input and output of the NMT encoder and decoder.

- Three knowledge types are integrated: 
   1) Similar sentence pairs retrieved from a database
   2) Matching terminology pairs from a dictionary
   3) Predicted translation templates
   
- Special tokens indicate the knowledge type in the prefixes. Input and output separator tokens distinguish the prefixes from the actual source/target sentences.

- The model is trained to incorporate relevant information from the prefixes to improve translation. At inference, new prefixes can be provided without retraining.

Main Contributions:
- A flexible prompting-based method to integrate multi-knowledge into NMT without architecture changes.
- Demonstrated performance improvements from using multiple knowledge types simultaneously, including sentences, terminology and templates.  
- The method enables domain adaptation without model retraining and has better robustness than fine-tuning approaches.
- Significantly increased terminology match accuracy compared to prior works on English-German and English-Chinese translation.

In summary, the key novelty is a prompting approach to effectively incorporate diverse external knowledge into NMT models for better translation quality. The method is simple, flexible and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
