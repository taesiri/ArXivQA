# [ICD-LM: Configuring Vision-Language In-Context Demonstrations by   Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10104)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models to rapidly adapt to new tasks using demonstrations, but performance is sensitive to the selection and ordering of demonstrations. 
- Existing methods select and order demonstrations separately, which is suboptimal. Additionally, they are not tailored to vision-language tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an In-Context Demonstration Language Model (ICD-LM) to generate effective demonstration sequences for vision-language in-context learning. 
- ICD-LM is trained on a dataset of hand-crafted demonstration sequences paired with query samples, tailored to a specific large vision-language model. 
- Generating a sequence with ICD-LM mirrors composing a sentence with a language model - it jointly learns to select and order demonstrations.

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of formulating in-context demonstration configuration as a language modeling task.
- Construction of a model-specific dataset containing vision-language demonstration sequences.
- ICD-LM that can generate tailored, high-quality demonstration sequences for vision-language in-context learning.
- Experiments on image captioning and VQA demonstrating improvements over baseline demonstration selection methods.
- Comprehensive ablation studies on dataset construction and model training strategies.

In summary, the key innovation is using a language model to jointly select and order task demonstrations for more effective in-context learning on vision-language tasks. By training on a model-specific dataset, the ICD-LM generates superior demonstration sequences compared to existing approaches.
