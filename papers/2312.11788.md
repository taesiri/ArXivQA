# [Faster Convergence with Multiway Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11788)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of convex optimization with only preference feedback. In this setting, instead of having access to function values or gradients, the optimization algorithm can only query relative preferences between two or more points. Specifically, two types of preference feedback models are studied:

1) Batched preference feedback: The algorithm can query m parallel comparisons between m distinct pairs of points in each round. The feedback indicates which point has a lower function value in each pair. 

2) Multiway (battling) preference feedback: The algorithm queries a set of m points and receives the identity of the point with the lowest function value.

The goal is to understand whether and how much the added parallelism and comparisons over larger sets can speed up the convergence to the optima compared to traditional pairwise dueling feedback.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes efficient algorithms based on normalized gradient descent for both batched and multiway preference feedback models. For smooth convex functions, batched preferences yield a convergence rate that improves by a factor of m compared to pairwise preferences. For multiway preferences, an improvement by a factor of log(m) is shown. Further speedups are derived under an additional assumption of strong convexity. Matching lower bounds are also provided, showing the optimality of the algorithms.  

Main Contributions:

- First work to study convex optimization with multiway preference feedback
- Efficient algorithms with optimal dependence on the multiway batch size m 
- Batched preferences: Factor of m speedup in rate
- Multiway preferences: Factor of log(m) speedup  
- Improved rates under strong convexity 
- Matching lower bounds proving optimality

The paper provides both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of using different types of multiway preference feedback for optimizing convex functions. The key insight is in extracting more information from parallel batched comparisons or battling winner feedback to obtain faster convergence.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper studies the problem of convex optimization with preference feedback, where instead of direct function evaluations the algorithm receives relative comparison information of multiple query points, and analyzes the improved convergence rates possible with parallel batched and multiway preference queries.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing two multiway preference feedback models for convex optimization: (a) Batched sign feedback where the learner can query m parallel pairs of points and get sign feedback on each, and (b) Battling (multiwise winner) feedback where the learner queries a set of m points and gets the argmin feedback.

2. Designing efficient algorithms for smooth and strongly convex convex optimization under these two feedback models, with convergence rates that improve by a factor of 1/m and 1/log(m) respectively compared to standard sign feedback.

3. Proving matching lower bounds to show the optimality of the convergence rates with respect to m. 

4. Empirically evaluating the algorithms to demonstrate the improved convergence over standard sign feedback, and the tradeoffs between convergence rate and multiway preference size m.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and analyzing multiway preference feedback models for convex optimization, and designing optimal algorithms leveraging such feedback. The paper seems to be the first to study convex optimization with multiway preferences.

The paper studies the problem of convex optimization with preference feedback, using either batched preference queries or multiway "battling" preference queries. It analyzes algorithms for optimizing convex functions using only noisy binary preference feedback, rather than direct access to gradients. Key contributions include faster convergence rates for optimization with batched or multiway preference feedback, as well as matching lower bounds. The analysis relies heavily on properties of smooth and strongly convex functions. So in summary, the key focus is on convex optimization and preference learning, with a emphasis on convergence rates.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two types of multiway preference feedback models: batched sign feedback and battling (multiwise winner) feedback. How do these models conceptually differ from traditional pairwise dueling feedback? What specific properties allow them to exploit parallel queries?

2. The battling feedback model shows an $O(1/\log m)$ convergence rate improvement compared to $O(1/m)$ for batched feedback. Intuitively explain why the rate of improvement is slower for battling feedback. 

3. The battling algorithm constructs structured query sets with symmetric opposing points in order to extract multiple sign feedback comparisons from a single multiwise winner. Explain this idea in detail and why it is key to achieving the $\log m$ convergence rate.  

4. How does the perturbation analysis in Theorem 1 account for the bounded decision space, compared to prior work that assumed unconstrained domains? What effect does this have on setting the perturbation parameter $\gamma$?

5. Strong convexity allows for an improved convergence rate in both the batched and battling settings. Explain why this occurs based on the properties of strongly convex functions. How is the epoch-based method able to exploit this?

6. The battling algorithm achieves the information-theoretically optimal $O(d/(\epsilon \log m))$ lower bound. What intrinsic limitations prevent achieving $O(d/(m \epsilon))$ with multiwise winner feedback?

7. How do the proposed methods address noisy preference feedback? What modifications are made to the algorithms and how does this affect the convergence guarantees? 

8. The empirical evaluation uses both quadratic and non-quadratic functions. Compare the convergence behavior on these functions - do the relative rates between single, batched, and battling feedback hold across objectives?

9. What open problems remain regarding lower bounds for the class of smooth (non-strongly) convex functions? What barriers exist to removing the smoothness assumption entirely?  

10. Can these multiway preference ideas extend to other function classes and online settings? What types of regret bounds could one hope to prove in a non-stationary environment?
