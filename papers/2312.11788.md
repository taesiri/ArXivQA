# [Faster Convergence with Multiway Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11788)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of convex optimization with only preference feedback. In this setting, instead of having access to function values or gradients, the optimization algorithm can only query relative preferences between two or more points. Specifically, two types of preference feedback models are studied:

1) Batched preference feedback: The algorithm can query m parallel comparisons between m distinct pairs of points in each round. The feedback indicates which point has a lower function value in each pair. 

2) Multiway (battling) preference feedback: The algorithm queries a set of m points and receives the identity of the point with the lowest function value.

The goal is to understand whether and how much the added parallelism and comparisons over larger sets can speed up the convergence to the optima compared to traditional pairwise dueling feedback.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes efficient algorithms based on normalized gradient descent for both batched and multiway preference feedback models. For smooth convex functions, batched preferences yield a convergence rate that improves by a factor of m compared to pairwise preferences. For multiway preferences, an improvement by a factor of log(m) is shown. Further speedups are derived under an additional assumption of strong convexity. Matching lower bounds are also provided, showing the optimality of the algorithms.  

Main Contributions:

- First work to study convex optimization with multiway preference feedback
- Efficient algorithms with optimal dependence on the multiway batch size m 
- Batched preferences: Factor of m speedup in rate
- Multiway preferences: Factor of log(m) speedup  
- Improved rates under strong convexity 
- Matching lower bounds proving optimality

The paper provides both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of using different types of multiway preference feedback for optimizing convex functions. The key insight is in extracting more information from parallel batched comparisons or battling winner feedback to obtain faster convergence.
