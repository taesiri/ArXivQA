# [EulerMormer: Robust Eulerian Motion Magnification via Dynamic Filtering   within Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04152)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework called EulerMormer for robust video motion magnification. The key idea is to leverage Transformer architecture and introduce a dynamic filtering strategy to achieve static-dynamic field adaptive denoising during motion magnification and amplified frame generation. Specifically, the method disentangles an input video into texture and shape components based on Eulerian theory, with motion represented as inter-frame shape differences. A dynamic filter module is proposed consisting of a dynamic masking filter (DMF) and multi-scale gating regulator (MGR). DMF uses a sparse attention mechanism to filter noise while preserving motion information. MGR captures multi-scale interactions to refine motion representations. This filter is applied twice - during motion magnification and final amplified frame generation - to eliminate artifacts. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in accurately magnifying subtle motions in videos while minimizing spatial inconsistency issues like flickering and motion distortion. The unified framework with global modeling via Transformer and targeted denoising enables robust video motion magnification with fewer artifacts compared to prior works.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) It introduces a novel Transformer-based end-to-end framework called EulerMormer for video motion magnification. This is the first attempt to utilize Transformer architecture in learning-based video motion magnification methods.

2) It develops a dynamic filter module implemented within the Transformer to achieve static-dynamic field adaptive denoising. The filter eliminates noise cues from the motion representation during magnification and refines the texture and shape representations during reconstruction to generate high-quality results. 

3) It proposes a Point-wise Magnifier to incorporate global nonlinear feature interactions per pixel to maintain spatial consistency and reduce flickering artifacts. 

4) It collects a synthetic dataset containing various magnification factors, Poisson noise levels, and Gaussian blur kernels to comprehensively evaluate the model's accuracy and robustness.

5) Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that EulerMormer achieves state-of-the-art video motion magnification performance with fewer artifacts and distortions.

In summary, the main contribution lies in the proposal of a Transformer-based framework equipped with a dedicated dynamic filter for robust video motion magnification.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Video motion magnification (VMM) aims to reveal subtle motions in videos that are imperceptible to the human eye. However, it faces challenges such as photon noise introduced by camera sensors and spatial inconsistency that leads to artifacts like flickering, blurring, and distortion in the magnified video. Existing methods do not emphasize on prioritized denoising during motion magnification. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework called EulerMormer that introduces a dynamic filtering strategy into a Transformer architecture for robust video motion magnification. The key ideas are:

1) Texture-Shape Disentanglement: Based on Eulerian theory, texture and shape features are disentangled from the video. Motion is represented as inter-frame shape differences.  

2) Motion Magnification: A dynamic filter is applied on the motion to eliminate noise while preserving actual motion information. This filter contains a Dynamic Masking Filter (DMF) and Multi-Scale Gating Regulator (MGR).

3) Amplification Generation: The filtered motion is magnified and combined with original texture to generate the final output. The dynamic filter is applied again for joint refinement of texture and magnified shape.

Main Contributions:

- First framework to incorporate Transformer architecture for learning-based video motion magnification. Enables global contextualized modeling.  

- Novel dynamic filtering strategy specialized for static-dynamic field adaptive denoising during motion magnification and texture-shape joint refinement.

- Comprehensive quantitative evaluation using a new synthetic dataset with adjustable magnification factors, noise levels and blur.

- Extensive comparisons showing improved performance over state-of-the-art on real-world subtle motion datasets. Achieves fewer artifacts, reduced blurring and distortions.
