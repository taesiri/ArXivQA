# [Team Irisapu Project Description for DRC2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13765)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper describes the dialog system designed by Team Irisapu for the Dialogue Robot Competition 2023 (DRC2023). The goal of the competition is to evaluate dialog systems for travel agent robots that can recommend sightseeing plans in Kyoto. 

The key contributions of the paper are:

1) Using GPT-3 to generate natural language responses that follow a predefined dialog flow consisting of five phases - greeting, ice break, question, recommendation, and closing. Prompts are designed for each phase to generate appropriate responses. 

2) Incorporating dialog breakdown detection at each turn using GPT-3 prompts to check for failures. If a breakdown is detected, a recovery strategy is employed where the robot asks the user to repeat themselves.  

3) Reporting on results from the preliminary evaluation round of DRC2023 based on questionnaires and travel plan assessments. There was a system bug that severely impacted performance, but the system still ranked high in reliability of information provided.

In conclusion, the paper proposes a flexible dialog system that can generate responses using GPT-3 while following a structured dialog flow, detect and recover from breakdowns, and obtained promising results in the information reliability category despite bugs affecting overall performance. The competition setting provides insights into developing travel agent type dialog systems.
