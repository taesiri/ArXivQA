# [Self-Knowledge Distillation based Self-Supervised Learning for Covid-19   Detection from Chest X-Ray Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03009)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we develop an effective self-supervised learning method for COVID-19 detection from chest X-ray images? More specifically, the authors propose and evaluate a novel self-knowledge distillation based self-supervised learning method for COVID-19 detection from chest X-ray images. Their hypothesis is that by using self-knowledge of images based on similarities of visual features, their proposed method can learn good representations and achieve high performance for COVID-19 detection, even with limited labeled data.
