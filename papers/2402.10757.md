# [Fitness-based Linkage Learning and Maximum-Clique Conditional Linkage   Modelling for Gray-box Optimization with RV-GOMEA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10757)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many real-world optimization problems allow for partial evaluations, where the impact of changing a subset of variables on the objective function can be efficiently computed. This gray-box information can be leveraged by optimization algorithms like the Real-Valued GOMEA (RV-GOMEA). Recently, conditional linkage models were introduced in RV-GOMEA that significantly improve its performance on problems with overlapping dependencies between variables. However, this assumes the variable interaction graph (VIG) depicting the dependencies is known a priori, which may not be the case in practice.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes to learn the VIG during optimization using fitness-based dependency tests between pairs of variables. These tests build up a dependency strength matrix (DSM) from which a VIG can be derived. This learned VIG is then used to construct conditional linkage models in RV-GOMEA, combining the benefits of partial evaluations and conditional distributions to handle overlapping dependencies. Additionally, a new "clique seeding" technique is introduced to detect overlapping dependency structures and model them jointly. 

Contributions:
- Show that conditional linkage models can be incrementally learned during optimization with little overhead
- Propose a "clique seeding" method to improve modeling of overlapping dependencies
- Demonstrate superior scalability of learned conditional models over non-conditional linkage models and state-of-the-art VkD-CMA on problems with various dependency structures
- Open up black-box real-world problems where VIG is initially unknown to optimization with conditional RV-GOMEA

In summary, this paper enables RV-GOMEA to leverage conditional linkage models even when the problem's VIG is not known a priori, through novel techniques to learn dependencies and overlapping structures during optimization. This unlocks stronger optimization performance on complex real-world problems.
