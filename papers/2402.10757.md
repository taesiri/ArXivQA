# [Fitness-based Linkage Learning and Maximum-Clique Conditional Linkage   Modelling for Gray-box Optimization with RV-GOMEA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10757)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many real-world optimization problems allow for partial evaluations, where the impact of changing a subset of variables on the objective function can be efficiently computed. This gray-box information can be leveraged by optimization algorithms like the Real-Valued GOMEA (RV-GOMEA). Recently, conditional linkage models were introduced in RV-GOMEA that significantly improve its performance on problems with overlapping dependencies between variables. However, this assumes the variable interaction graph (VIG) depicting the dependencies is known a priori, which may not be the case in practice.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes to learn the VIG during optimization using fitness-based dependency tests between pairs of variables. These tests build up a dependency strength matrix (DSM) from which a VIG can be derived. This learned VIG is then used to construct conditional linkage models in RV-GOMEA, combining the benefits of partial evaluations and conditional distributions to handle overlapping dependencies. Additionally, a new "clique seeding" technique is introduced to detect overlapping dependency structures and model them jointly. 

Contributions:
- Show that conditional linkage models can be incrementally learned during optimization with little overhead
- Propose a "clique seeding" method to improve modeling of overlapping dependencies
- Demonstrate superior scalability of learned conditional models over non-conditional linkage models and state-of-the-art VkD-CMA on problems with various dependency structures
- Open up black-box real-world problems where VIG is initially unknown to optimization with conditional RV-GOMEA

In summary, this paper enables RV-GOMEA to leverage conditional linkage models even when the problem's VIG is not known a priori, through novel techniques to learn dependencies and overlapping structures during optimization. This unlocks stronger optimization performance on complex real-world problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes new techniques to learn the variable dependencies and overlapping structures in gray-box optimization problems during optimization, allowing RV-GOMEA to leverage conditional linkage models without needing the problem structure a priori.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and evaluating methods to learn the variable interaction graph (VIG) of a gray-box optimization problem during optimization, and using this to construct conditional linkage models in RV-GOMEA. Specifically:

1) It shows that the VIG can be incrementally learned using fitness-based dependency tests, with little overhead. 

2) It proposes a new "clique seeding" technique to identify overlapping dependency structures in the learned VIG, to maximize the joint modeling of interdependent variables.

3) It combines the learned VIG and clique seeding models with the existing conditional modeling techniques in RV-GOMEA, to optimize problems where the VIG is not known a priori.

4) It demonstrates through experiments on benchmark problems that the proposed techniques enable RV-GOMEA to scale similarly or better than state-of-the-art methods, including when the VIG must be learned. The overhead of learning is shown to be small.

In summary, the main contribution is enabling RV-GOMEA to effectively optimize problems with overlapping dependencies by incrementally learning the VIG during optimization and using this to construct better conditional linkage models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

Gray-Box Optimization (GBO), Real-Valued Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (RV-GOMEA), partial evaluations, linkage modeling, conditional linkage modeling, overlapping dependencies, fitness-based linkage learning, Variable Interaction Graph (VIG), Dependency Strength Matrix (DSM), marginal product Family of Subsets (FOS), linkage tree FOS, conditional distribution sampling, conditional Gene-pool Optimal Mixing (GOM), Gaussian Markov Field (GMF), factorized conditional distribution, Generational GOM (GG), clique seeding

The paper explores using fitness-based linkage learning to construct conditional linkage models in RV-GOMEA for GBO problems where the variable interaction graph is not known a priori. It introduces techniques to model overlapping dependencies more effectively and compares the performance of RV-GOMEA with these learned models against other algorithms on benchmark problems with different dependency structures. The key focus is on handling problems with strong overlapping dependencies when the structure is not fully known beforehand.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes combining fitness-based linkage learning with conditional linkage modelling in RV-GOMEA. Can you explain in detail how this combination works and the key steps involved? 

2. The paper introduces a new clique seeding technique for modelling overlapping dependencies in conditional linkage models. Can you walk through this technique step-by-step and explain the rationale behind it?

3. One of the key results is that the overhead of learning conditional linkage models dynamically during optimization is often negligible. What factors contribute to keeping this overhead low?

4. How exactly does the fitness dependency testing schedule work to spread computational load over time? What impact would changing parameters of this schedule have?

5. Explain how the choice of GMF factorization method (UCond versus MCond) impacts the resulting factorized distribution and FOS elements identified for GOM.

6. The paper analyzes performance on problems with heterogeneous block strengths. Why does clique seeding appear to work well on these types of problems compared to other approaches?

7. What modifications were made to the order in which FG and GG steps are optimized in Hybrid GOM compared to prior work? What was the rationale here?

8. What role does the full forward sampling GG step play in repairing linkage broken in separate FG steps? Can you illustrate with an example?  

9. The population sizing experiments reveal some non-intuitive results. What factors may explain differences between scalability in terms of evaluations versus population sizes?

10. If problem structure is unknown a priori, how might relative heterogeneity of dependency strengths help inform automatic linkage model selection? Can you propose techniques for capturing heterogeneity?
