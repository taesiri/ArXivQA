# [Sliced Wasserstein with Random-Path Projecting Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15889)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance is an effective distance metric between probability distributions that is more scalable than the original Wasserstein distance. A key component of SW is the "slicing distribution", which controls the contribution of each projection direction. Previous works on optimizing the slicing distribution are either computationally expensive (e.g. requiring iterative optimization) or require expensive sampling methods (e.g. importance sampling). 

The authors identify that an ideal slicing distribution should: (1) assign high probability to "informative" directions that highlight differences between distributions, (2) have maximal support to guarantee metric properties, (3) be computationally stable to obtain, and (4) allow efficient sampling.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a new "random-path projecting direction" (RPD) which captures the directions in which two distributions differ. Specifically, the RPD is defined as the normalized difference between two random samples from the input distributions, plus some random perturbation. 

Based on the RPD, they derive the "random-path slicing distribution" (RPSD) and two new SW variants:
1) Random-path projection sliced Wasserstein (RPSW): Replaces uniform distribution in SW with RPSD
2) Importance weighted RPSW (IWRPSW): Uses multiple RPD samples and weights them by projected distance

Contributions:
1) Introduction of RPD and theoretically-grounded RPSD that is discriminative yet simple to sample 
2) Two new SW variants RPSW & IWRPSW that avoid expensive optimization or sampling like prior works
3) Analysis of metric, statistical, computational properties of RPSW/IWRPSW
4) Experiments showing RPSW/IWRPSW improve performance in gradient flows and training of diffusion generative models.

In summary, the paper proposes more effective and efficient slicing distributions for sliced Wasserstein distance through a conceptually simple yet powerful idea of using random paths between distributions. This leads to noticeable gains while having good theoretical guarantees.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new slicing distribution for sliced Wasserstein distance based on random paths between measures, as well as variants leveraging this distribution, and analyzes their topological, statistical, and computational properties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new type of projecting direction for sliced Wasserstein distance called "random-path" projecting direction (RPD). The RPD is constructed by taking the normalized difference between two random variables following the input measures, with some random perturbation added.

2. Deriving a "random-path slicing distribution" (RPSD) based on the RPD, and two new variants of sliced Wasserstein distance using this distribution - "random-path projection sliced Wasserstein" (RPSW) and "importance weighted random-path projection sliced Wasserstein" (IWRPSW).

3. Analyzing the theoretical properties of RPSW and IWRPSW, including metricity, connections to other sliced Wasserstein variants, sample complexity, and computational complexity.

4. Demonstrating the performance of RPSW and IWRPSW on two applications - gradient flows and training of denoising diffusion generative models. The experiments show favorable results compared to existing sliced Wasserstein variants.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new way to construct the projecting directions for sliced Wasserstein distance that is discriminative yet simple and efficient to sample. This leads to the RPSW and IWRPSW distances that have nice theoretical properties and perform well empirically.

The paper proposes the RPD and RPSD as more effective and efficient ways to select projecting directions for computing sliced Wasserstein distances. It introduces the RPSW and IWRPSW distances based on these concepts. Theoretical properties around metricity, connections to other SW variants, sample complexity etc. are analyzed. Experiments demonstrate the utility of RPSW and IWRPSW in optimizing gradient flows and training diffusion models for generative modeling.

Key goals are developing more discriminative and efficient projecting directions while enabling easy parallel sampling. This leads to variants of sliced Wasserstein distance with improved performance.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new type of projecting direction called the random-path projecting direction (RPD). How is the RPD constructed and what is the intuition behind using the normalized difference between two random vectors from the input measures?

2. The paper introduces the random-path slicing distribution (RPSD) which is derived from the RPD. What are the key properties of the RPSD and why can it not be expressed in closed-form density while still being efficient to sample from?

3. Two variants of sliced Wasserstein are proposed based on the RPSD - the random-path projection sliced Wasserstein (RPSW) and importance weighted RPSW (IWRPSW). What is the key difference between these two variants and what are their advantages over conventional SW?

4. The paper shows that RPSW and IWRPSW satisfy certain metric properties like non-negativity, symmetry and identity of indiscernibles. What can you say about whether they satisfy the triangle inequality? What causes the difficulty in proving this?

5. How do the sample complexities of RPSW and IWRPSW compare to conventional sliced Wasserstein? What rates are they shown to achieve? What causes difficulty in extending the one-sided bound to a two-sided bound?

6. What are the key differences between the Monte Carlo approximation and gradient estimation of RPSW versus IWRPSW? How do the errors behave with number of projections L?

7. When using RPSW/IWRPSW loss for parameter estimation, what are the original and simplified gradient estimators? What are the tradeoffs between them? 

8. For the application in generative modeling, the paper proposes an augmented generalized mini-batch energy (AGME) distance for training diffusion models. How is the AGME distance constructed and why is it more suitable than a regular generalized distance?

9. In the gradient flow experiments, what scheduling is used for the concentration parameter Îº of the Power Spherical distribution when sampling RPDs? What is the intuition behind this dynamic scheduling?

10. What insights do the gradient flow and generative modeling experiments provide regarding the performance of RPSW/IWRPSW compared to other SW variants? How do they compare in terms convergence, speed and stability?
