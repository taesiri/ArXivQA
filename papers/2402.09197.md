# [Implementing local-explainability in Gradient Boosting Trees: Feature   Contribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09197)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) is a powerful machine learning algorithm widely used across many fields. However, it is considered a black-box model since the ensemble of decision trees makes the final prediction opaque. This lack of interpretability is an issue for trust and adopting AI systems. There is a need for explainable AI (XAI) methods tailored to tree ensemble methods like GBDT. Prior XAI techniques for GBDT are model-agnostic approaches that approximate the black-box model locally, causing loss of fidelity. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an intrinsic and exact explainability algorithm for GBDT called Decision Contribution. It reinterprets the nodes in the decision trees as residues - differences between a node's value and its parent's. The prediction is the sum of residues along the path traversed by a data point in each tree. Each residue quantifies the contribution of that node's split decision to the final prediction. Feature Contribution aggregates residues from decisions involving the same feature.  

Contributions:
- An exact and intrinsic method to explain individual GBDT predictions based on decomposing the prediction to contributions of each decision node.
- Mathematical proof that the residues equal the expected change in prediction due to a split decision.   
- Empirical demonstration that the approach reflects impact of feature noise/correlation and outlier data points better than LIME and SHAP.
- Establishes GBDT need not be a black-box model and its predictions can be explained by tracing the decision path.
- Aligns with objectives of model trust and transparency in ethical AI systems.

In summary, the paper offers a native solution to make opaque GBDT models interpretable by exposing the chain of decisions leading to predictions. The proposal has theoretical justification and practical advantages over prevailing model-agnostic methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new intrinsic algorithm called Decision Contribution for explaining predictions of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees by quantifying the contribution of each node's decision to the final prediction through theoretical proof and empirical experiments demonstrating improved fidelity over common model-agnostic methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper proposes a new intrinsic algorithm called "Decision Contribution" for providing local explainability in Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT). The key ideas are:

1) It reinterprets the node values in GBDT trees as the difference/residue between the node's value and its parent's value. This residue represents the estimated influence of that node's decision on the final prediction. 

2) By aggregating residues across decisions involving the same feature, the method defines a "Feature Contribution" value reflecting how much each input feature contributes to a given prediction. 

3) Compared to other local explainability techniques like LIME and SHAP, this approach is intrinsic and specific to the GBDT architecture. Theoretical proofs and experiments demonstrate it captures the internal behavior of GBDT better than model-agnostic methods.

In summary, the paper introduces a new intrinsic, architecture-specific algorithm to provide local explanations that closely reflect the GBDT model's own logic and decisions. This interpretable GBDT is positioned as better aligned with requirements like GDPR's "right to explanation".

The paper proposes an intrinsic, model-specific method called "Decision Contribution" to provide local explanations for predictions from Gradient Boosting Decision Tree models. It focuses on explaining predictions by calculating feature contributions using the residue values of nodes along the decision path. Theoretical proofs and experiments are provided to demonstrate the approach, and it is compared to model-agnostic methods like SHAP and LIME.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed Decision Contribution algorithm work to assign contribution values to each decision node in the GBDT model? Can you walk through the details of the algorithm?

2. The paper provides a mathematical proof that the Decision Contribution values accurately reflect the influence of each node on the prediction outcome. Can you summarize the key steps in this proof? What assumptions were made?

3. How does the proposed Feature Contribution aggregation differ from the commonly used Gini Importance measure? What extra insights does Feature Contribution provide about the model behavior? 

4. The consistency experiments test the method under feature correlation and noise - can you explain the results shown in these experiments? Do they demonstrate that Feature Contribution reflects intrinsic model behavior?

5. The paper compares the method to LIME and SHAP values. Can you describe the key similarities and differences observed? Why might Feature Contribution better capture model behavior for outliers?

6. What are the implications of having an intrinsic, model-specific explanation method like Feature Contribution versus a model-agnostic method? What are the tradeoffs?

7. How could the visibility into model decision paths enabled by Feature Contribution be useful for applications in areas like ethics, accountability, and regulation compliance?

8. Could the concept of reinterpreting tree nodes as additive contributions be applicable to other tree ensemble methods like random forests or single decision trees? Why or why not?  

9. What ideas for future work building on the Feature Contribution method are mentioned in the paper? What other directions could be explored?

10. How does Feature Contribution differ from a typical machine learning approach of understanding models purely based on accuracy metrics? What shift does it represent towards explainability?
