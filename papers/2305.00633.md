## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related work on improving reasoning with large language models:

- Main Approach: This paper uses self-evaluation guided stochastic beam search to refine the multi-step reasoning process. Other works have explored different techniques like self-consistency with sampling and majority voting, question decomposition, and program-aided reasoning. The use of self-evaluation to guide beam search is novel.

- Generalizability: The framework of self-evaluation guided decoding is tested on a wide variety of reasoning tasks. Many other approaches target specific tasks like math or commonsense reasoning. The consistent gains highlight the broader applicability.

- Performance: The results demonstrate strong improvements over competitive baselines across benchmarks. The gains are especially significant on longer reasoning chains. This shows the approach successfully addresses reasoning challenges.

Overall, the key novelty is the integration of self-evaluation into a stochastic beam search process for step-wise reasoning decoding. The customizable framework, strong results, and generalizability are advantages compared to prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Investigating how to better utilize external tools and knowledge to enhance the self-evaluation capability of LLMs. The paper mentions using LLM explanations in the qualitative analysis, so incorporating explanations more systematically could improve evaluation.

- Exploring the generalizability of their approach to other multi-step tasks beyond reasoning, such as multi-hop question answering. The core ideas around decomposed decoding and self-evaluation guidance could potentially apply more broadly. 

- Studying how to adapt the approach to multimodal reasoning scenarios, where reasoning involves integrating information across modalities like text, images, etc. The paper suggests their method is promising for more complex reasoning.

- Analyzing the synergies with more advanced LLMs like GPT-4, once capabilities like token-level likelihoods become accessible. The qualitative analysis indicates potential complementary benefits.

- Developing more sophisticated prompting techniques for self-evaluation to handle challenges illustrated in the case studies, like minor errors and uncertainty. There is room to improve prompting robustness.

- Investigating task-specific tuning of key hyperparameters like the evaluation weight λ, to optimize performance across diverse datasets. The paper shows decent stability but task-specific tuning could help.

- Expanding the approach to sample-efficient learning scenarios like one-shot or few-shot prompting. The paper focuses on few-shot but lower-shot prompting merits exploration.

In summary, the main future directions are enhancing self-evaluation, expanding applicability to broader tasks and modalities, adapting to advanced LLMs, improving prompting techniques, task-specific tuning, and lower-shot prompting. The core idea of decomposed decoding with self-evaluation guidance seems promising to explore further.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach to improve multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs) by utilizing self-evaluation to guide the decoding process. Specifically, it frames reasoning as a decomposed sequence of intermediate steps and applies constrained stochastic beam search to generate high-quality reasoning chains. At each decoding timestep, an LLM conducts self-evaluation by scoring the faithfulness of candidate reasoning steps. This self-evaluation score is combined with the generation probability to select the beams using stochastic sampling. By incorporating controllable randomness during decoding, the method balances quality and diversity. Experiments on arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrate significant improvements over baselines. The approach is analyzed to show how self-evaluation helps to pinpoint logic errors and enhance robustness.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2-paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method to improve multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to formulate reasoning as a step-by-step decoding process and use LLM self-evaluation to guide the search through the reasoning space. 

Specifically, the authors break down reasoning into multiple steps and view each step as a decoding timestep. At each timestep, they generate multiple candidate extensions and evaluate them based on a combination of the LM likelihood and an LLM-based self-evaluation score. This self-evaluation score judges the faithfulness of each reasoning step using LLM prompts. By incorporating this self-evaluation guidance through stochastic beam search, the proposed method refines the search process to produce reasoning chains of higher quality. Experiments on arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks show significant gains over baselines. The method adapts well to majority voting and is analyzed to enhance reasoning with higher consistency and robustness.

In summary, the key novelties are the formulation of reasoning as constrained decoding optimized with LLM self-evaluation, and the resulting gains in multi-step reasoning performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The self-evaluation guided decoding approach provides an effective way to leverage LLMs for more reliable and interpretable step-wise reasoning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method to enhance multi-step reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) through self-evaluation guided stochastic beam search decoding. Specifically, they formulate the reasoning process as a sequence of decoding steps, where each step outputs an intermediate reasoning chain. During decoding, they incorporate an LLM-based self-evaluation module to score the faithfulness of each reasoning step. This self-evaluation score is combined with the generative LM's probability to guide a stochastic beam search procedure, balancing quality and diversity. By using the self-evaluation score to constrain the beam search, they are able to refine the search process to obtain more accurate reasoning chains. Compared to prior work on chaining reasoning steps which rely on standard autoregressive decoding, their method uses the self-evaluation signal to explicitly optimize faithfulness during each reasoning subtask. Experiments across arithmetic, symbolic and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrate significant gains over baseline methods.
