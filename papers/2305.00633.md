## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2-paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method to improve multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to formulate reasoning as a step-by-step decoding process and use LLM self-evaluation to guide the search through the reasoning space. 

Specifically, the authors break down reasoning into multiple steps and view each step as a decoding timestep. At each timestep, they generate multiple candidate extensions and evaluate them based on a combination of the LM likelihood and an LLM-based self-evaluation score. This self-evaluation score judges the faithfulness of each reasoning step using LLM prompts. By incorporating this self-evaluation guidance through stochastic beam search, the proposed method refines the search process to produce reasoning chains of higher quality. Experiments on arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks show significant gains over baselines. The method adapts well to majority voting and is analyzed to enhance reasoning with higher consistency and robustness.

In summary, the key novelties are the formulation of reasoning as constrained decoding optimized with LLM self-evaluation, and the resulting gains in multi-step reasoning performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The self-evaluation guided decoding approach provides an effective way to leverage LLMs for more reliable and interpretable step-wise reasoning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method to enhance multi-step reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) through self-evaluation guided stochastic beam search decoding. Specifically, they formulate the reasoning process as a sequence of decoding steps, where each step outputs an intermediate reasoning chain. During decoding, they incorporate an LLM-based self-evaluation module to score the faithfulness of each reasoning step.
