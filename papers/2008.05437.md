## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to jointly optimize the structure and parameters of a tensor network to minimize a loss function in an efficient manner. Specifically, the paper considers the problem of minimizing a loss function over arbitrary tensor network structures, subject to a constraint on the total number of parameters. This is formalized as:\begin{equation}\min_{R_{i,j}} \min_{\mathbf{G}^{(1)},\dots,\mathbf{G}^{(p)}} \mathcal{L}(\text{TN}(\mathbf{G}^{(1)},\dots,\mathbf{G}^{(p)})) \quad \text{s.t. } \texttt{size}(\mathbf{G}^{(1)},\dots,\mathbf{G}^{(p)}) \leq C\end{equation}where $\mathcal{L}$ is the loss function, $\mathbf{G}^{(i)}$ are the core tensors of the tensor network, $R_{i,j}$ define the tensor network structure, and $C$ is a bound on the number of parameters. This formulation poses a bilevel optimization problem, with a discrete optimization over tensor network structures at the upper level, and a continuous optimization over tensor parameters at the lower level. The key research question is how to efficiently solve this problem in order to identify the best tensor network structure and parameters for minimizing a given loss function under a parameter budget constraint.To address this, the paper proposes a greedy algorithm that starts from a simple rank-1 tensor network and iteratively adds edges and increases ranks in a greedy fashion to improve the loss function. The greedy search is combined with continuous optimization techniques to solve the lower level problem.In summary, the core research contribution is an efficient joint optimization algorithm for adaptively learning the structure and parameters of tensor networks tailored to a specific loss function and parameter budget. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can find better tensor network structures and decompositions compared to existing approaches.
