# [A Generative Model of Symmetry Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01946)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many datasets exhibit symmetries, like translational or rotational symmetry. Incorporating knowledge of these symmetries into models can improve performance and data efficiency. However, the relevant symmetries are often not known a priori and need to be learned from data. While recent work has focused on learning symmetries in discriminative models, less attention has been paid to learning symmetries in generative models.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Symmetry-aware Generative Model (SGM) that aims to explicitly model the symmetries present in a dataset. The model assumes that each observation x is generated by applying a random transformation T_eta from a group of transformations to a latent "prototype" z. The transformation parameters eta are modeled via a conditional distribution p(eta|z) that captures the distribution over naturally occurring transformations, while the prototype z is encouraged to be invariant and contain no symmetry information. 

A two-stage procedure is used to learn the model:
1) Learn prototype inference function f_omega(x) in a self-supervised manner to map each x to a corresponding invariant prototype z  
2) Learn conditional distribution p_psi(eta | z) via maximum likelihood on the created dataset of (z, eta) pairs

By not needing to model p(z), the procedure avoids modeling the full data distribution while still learning about its symmetries.

Contributions:
- Proposal of the first generative model that aims to explicitly capture symmetries
- Simple and tractable two-stage learning procedure
- Demonstration that the model learns sensible distributions over transformations in MNIST and dSprites datasets
- Building the SGM into a VAE improves test log-likelihoods and robustness to deleting training data

The model shows promise for improving generative modeling and scientific discovery by surfacing the symmetries inherent in complex datasets.
