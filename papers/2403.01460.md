# [One-Step Multi-View Clustering Based on Transition Probability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01460)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing large-scale multi-view clustering methods using anchor graphs lack interpretability in the clustering process and do not sufficiently harness complementary information across views. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel One-Step Multi-View Clustering based on Transition Probability (OSMVC-TP) method. 
- It adopts a probabilistic perspective, where the anchor graph represents transition probabilities from samples to anchors. 
- The key idea is to learn the transition probabilities from anchors to categories, which allows directly computing the transition probabilities from samples to categories to obtain soft label matrices for both samples and anchors.

Main Contributions:
- Enhances interpretability of clustering by assigning meaningful probability associations.
- Applies Schatten p-norm constraint on the tensor of soft label matrices to effectively explore complementary information across views and align the labels.
- Directly learns the soft label matrices for samples and anchors in one step.
- Achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on both small-scale and large-scale benchmark datasets.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel anchor graph based multi-view clustering approach with a probabilistic interpretation to enhance interpretability. It applies advanced tensor constraints to harness complementary information across views and achieves impressive clustering performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering method called One-Step Multi-View Clustering Based on Transition Probability (OSMVC-TP) that enhances interpretability and performance by modeling anchor graphs as transition probability matrices to directly compute sample-to-cluster probabilities in one step while using Schatten p-norm regularization to extract complementary information across views.
