# [Customization Assistant for Text-to-image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03045)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text-to-image models fail to generate creative images for novel concepts contained in few-shot or single test images. Methods have been proposed to customize models via fine-tuning or embedding optimization, but they have limitations in efficiency, user-friendliness and flexibility. 

Proposed Solution - Customization Assistant (CAFE):
- Proposes a tuning-free customization assistant based on large language model (Llama-2) and diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 2).
- Takes an image of novel concept and arbitrary user text as input. Handles ambiguous inputs and generates images along with text explanations.
- Injects image embeddings from CLIP ViT-L and DINOv2-Giant into diffusion model to capture semantics and fine details.
- Trained with a novel self-distillation strategy to efficiently construct large-scale high-quality dataset without human labeling.

Main Contributions:
- Tuning-free customized generation in 2-5 seconds, much more efficient than optimization-based methods  
- Handles ambiguous user input through grounding on Llama-2, unlike other methods limited to directives/descriptions
- Provides text explanation and elaboration for generated images
- Self-distillation training strategy to massively scale up dataset generation with automatic quality control
- Experiments show competitive quantitative results and generations across multiple domains

In summary, it proposes an interpretable and user-friendly customization assistant that can efficiently adapt pre-trained models to novel concepts in few-shot images without any fine-tuning. The self-distillation training strategy also enables scaling the approach easily to large datasets.
