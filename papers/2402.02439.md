# [DiffStitch: Boosting Offline Reinforcement Learning with Diffusion-based   Trajectory Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02439)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
In offline reinforcement learning (RL), the performance of learned policies relies heavily on the quality of the offline datasets. However, in many cases, the offline datasets contain very limited optimal trajectories, posing a challenge for offline RL algorithms to acquire the ability to transit to high-reward regions. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Diffusion-based Trajectory Stitching (DiffStitch), a novel data augmentation pipeline that systematically generates stitching transitions between trajectories in the offline dataset. Specifically, DiffStitch randomly selects a low-reward trajectory and a high-reward trajectory, estimates the number of steps to stitch them, and generates new states as well as corresponding actions and rewards to form a complete trajectory connecting the two. 

The key components of DiffStitch include:
1) A step estimation module that determines the number of steps needed to stitch two trajectories. 
2) A state stitching module that generates intermediate transition states to connect two trajectories.
3) A trajectory wrap-up module that predicts actions and rewards for the generated states.
4) A qualification module that evaluates the quality of the generated trajectories.

By effectively connecting low-reward trajectories with high-reward trajectories, DiffStitch generates globally optimal trajectories that facilitate policy learning in offline RL algorithms.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes DiffStitch, the first augmentation method in offline RL that systematically stitches trajectories using diffusion models. This effectively transforms low-reward trajectories to high-reward ones.
- Demonstrates DiffStitch's capability in enhancing various offline RL algorithms including one-step methods, imitation learning methods and trajectory optimization methods.
- Conducts extensive experiments on D4RL datasets where DiffStitch achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art data augmentation baselines across offline RL algorithms.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in offline RL by designing a novel trajectory stitching paradigm for data augmentation. Experiments verify its effectiveness and generalizability across different base algorithms. The solution provides an promising direction to compensate for offline dataset deficiencies in offline RL settings.
