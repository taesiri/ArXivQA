# [Table-GPT: Table-tuned GPT for Diverse Table Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09263)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: Can we enhance the ability of large language models like GPT-3 to understand and perform well on diverse table-related tasks by "table-tuning" them on synthesized table task data?

The key points are:

- Large language models like GPT-3 excel at natural language tasks but may not be optimized for table-related tasks since they are trained mostly on natural text. 

- The paper proposes a "table-tuning" approach to continue training language models like GPT-3 on synthesized "table task" data to enhance their ability to understand tables.

- The table tasks cover a diverse range of areas like table understanding, QA, matching, cleaning, etc. and are synthesized from real web/database tables.

- Through experiments, the paper shows their resulting "Table-GPT" models outperform vanilla GPT-3 on a wide range of seen and unseen table tasks, demonstrating improved table understanding and versatility on new tasks.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that tuning language models like GPT-3 specifically on diverse table task data can enhance their ability to understand tables and generalize to new table-related tasks, which the paper aims to validate.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new "table-tuning" approach to enhance the ability of language models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT to understand tables and perform table-related tasks. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Observing that today's language models (e.g. GPT-3, ChatGPT) are not optimized for table tasks, as they are predominantly pre-trained on natural language text, whereas tables are two-dimensional structures requiring different understanding. The paper probes this through simple "missing value identification" and "column finding" tests where language models frequently fail.

- Proposing a new paradigm called "table-tuning", analogous to the successful "instruction-tuning" technique in NLP, where language models are further trained on diverse "table-task" demonstrations synthesized from real tables. This enhances models' ability to manipulate and reason with tables.

- Developing a systematic "synthesis-then-augment" approach to create high-quality and diverse table-task training data at scale from real tables, without expensive human labeling. This includes synthesizing new table-tasks, augmenting at instruction/table/completion levels, etc.

- Showing through extensive experiments that the resulting "Table-GPT" models outperform vanilla GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT significantly on a wide range of seen and unseen table tasks, while still maintaining versatility like ChatGPT in responding to new natural language instructions/tasks.

- Demonstrating the benefits hold even when downstream task-specific optimizations like prompt-engineering or fine-tuning are applied, suggesting Table-GPT can serve as an improved "table foundation model".

In summary, the key contribution is identifying limitations of current language models on table tasks, and proposing the new table-tuning approach to enhance table understanding, which is shown to be effective through systematic experiments. The paper helps open a promising new direction analogous to instruction-tuning for tables.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper proposes a new approach called "table-tuning" to enhance the ability of large language models like GPT-3 to understand relational tables and perform well on table-related tasks, by continuing to train the models on a diverse set of synthesized table tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other work in the field of table-tuning language models:

- This work proposes a novel "table-tuning" paradigm for fine-tuning language models like GPT-3 to be better at understanding and manipulating tables. This is analogous to the "instruction-tuning" approach developed in NLP, but focused specifically on enhancing performance on table-related tasks. Other work has not explicitly focused on table tuning in this way.

- The paper demonstrates table-tuning on a wide variety of table tasks, including unseen hold-out tasks, to show the approach improves performance and generalizability. This is more comprehensive than some prior work that focuses on only one or two table tasks (e.g. just entity matching).

- The paper emphasizes synthesizing diverse table tasks from real-world tables, and using different augmentation techniques, to avoid overfitting. Other work often relies only on existing academic benchmarks, which tend to have less diversity.

- Table-tuning is shown to provide benefits on top of vanilla GPT models even when using task-specific optimizations like prompt engineering and fine-tuning. This shows it can serve as a better foundation model.

- The work does not require expensive human labeling, instead relying on automatic synthesis. Other work often uses manual labeling which limits scale and diversity.

- The paper provides useful analysis like ablation studies to unpack the benefits of different components. Many papers in this space do not provide as much analysis.

Overall, I would say the table-tuning approach and emphasis on generalization, diversity, and integration with existing techniques helps advance the state-of-the-art in applying language models to table tasks. The comprehensive evaluation and analysis is also a notable strength compared to some related work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Expanding the set of table-related tasks used for table-tuning. The authors propose and experiment with a set of 18 table-related tasks for table-tuning, but suggest there is room for discovering and generating even more tasks to enhance the process.

- Exploring different table formats for representing tables. The authors mainly use Markdown format but suggest CSV, JSON and other formats could be explored further.

- Applying table-tuning to other base language models beyond GPT and ChatGPT. The authors show results on two base models, but the table-tuning approach could likely benefit other language models as well.

- Developing better techniques for synthesizing high-quality and diverse training data for table-tuning. The authors propose initial techniques but suggest this is an area for more research.

- Reducing the computational and labeling costs of table-tuning. The authors suggest the substantial costs incurred in their over 1000 experiments and hope their work can serve as a springboard to make table-tuning more accessible.

- Releasing code, data and models to facilitate research. The authors plan to release their implementations to help advance work in this direction.

- Comparing table-tuning to other methods like prompt-engineering. The authors view table-tuning as complementary but suggest more analysis of the tradeoffs.

- Evaluating the benefits of table-tuning on broader down-stream tasks. The authors show some initial results but suggest more analysis here.

- Developing table-tuning for non-English tables. The current work focuses on English but could be extended to other languages.

In summary, the authors propose table-tuning as an initial promising direction and suggest many avenues for extending this paradigm further. Releasing code/data, reducing costs, and developing better training data synthesis and augmentation techniques appear as key areas for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new paradigm called "table-tuning" to enhance the ability of large pre-trained language models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT to understand tables and perform table-related tasks. The key idea is to continue training these models using diverse table-tasks synthesized from large amounts of real-world tables as training data. This is analogous to the "instruction-tuning" approach in NLP that trains models like GPT-3 to better follow human instructions. The authors synthesize training data covering a diverse set of 14 table tasks using a "synthesis-then-augment" framework - first automatically generating table-task training triples of (instruction, table, completion), then augmenting at instruction/table/completion levels for diversity. Experiments show the resulting "Table-GPT" models consistently outperform vanilla GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT on a wide range of seen and unseen table tasks. Table-tuning is complementary to prompt-engineering, and Table-GPT can serve as a better "table foundation model" than vanilla GPT. The work demonstrates the promise of table-tuning as a new direction to develop optimized table-focused language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new paradigm called "table-tuning" to enhance language models' ability to understand tables and perform table-related tasks. The key idea is to continue training language models like GPT-3 using diverse table tasks synthesized from real-world tables as training data. This is analogous to "instruction-tuning" in NLP, where models like GPT-3 are trained on (instruction, completion) pairs to improve instruction-following. Similarly, the authors synthesize (table, task instruction, completion) triples as training data to improve table understanding. They leverage existing table tasks like entity matching and augment them with new synthesized tasks like table summarization and column/row generation. The training data is augmented at multiple levels to improve diversity. 

The resulting "Table-GPT" models are evaluated on a diverse set of seen and unseen table tasks. Experiments show Table-GPT consistently outperforms vanilla GPT-3 and ChatGPT in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Benefits are observed even when downstream prompt engineering or task-specific fine-tuning is used. The paper demonstrates table-tuning is a promising technique to develop capable and general table foundation models, analogous to instruction-tuned foundations models like ChatGPT developed in NLP.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new method called "table-tuning" to improve the performance of large language models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT on diverse table-related tasks. The key ideas are:

1. Synthesize a large and diverse set of table-tasks using real tables sampled from web and databases. Each table-task is a (instruction, table, completion) triple that defines a table-related task, such as data imputation, entity matching, etc.

2. Perform data augmentation at the instruction, table, and completion levels to create even more diverse training data for table-tuning. For example, paraphrase instructions, permute table columns, and add reasoning chains to completions. 

3. Use the synthesized and augmented table-tasks to continue training (fine-tune) large language models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT. The goal is to enhance the models' ability to understand tables and perform well on table-related tasks seen and unseen during training.

4. Show through experiments that the resulting "Table-GPT" models consistently outperform vanilla GPT-3 and ChatGPT on a wide range of table tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. The benefits hold even when downstream prompt engineering or task-specific fine-tuning is used.

In summary, the paper proposes a new "table-tuning" approach to improve language models' table understanding ability by training them on a large and diverse set of synthesized table-tasks. Augmentation strategies are used to further expand the training data diversity. Experiments show Table-GPT models achieve strong performance on diverse table tasks out-of-the-box and can serve as better foundations for downstream optimizations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper proposes a new method called "table-tuning" to improve the abilities of large language models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT to understand and perform diverse table-related tasks. 

The key observations and motivations behind this work are:

- Large language models today are pre-trained mostly on natural language text, which is one-dimensional and order sensitive. In contrast, tables are two-dimensional structures where reading vertically is crucial, and order/permutations often do not change meaning.

- Tests show today's language models are not optimized for "reading" tables - e.g. they struggle on simple tasks like identifying a missing cell or finding which column a value is in.

- Instruction tuning from NLP trains models like GPT on (instruction, completion) pairs to make them better at following instructions. This paper proposes analogous "table-tuning" to train on (table, instruction, completion) triples to make models better at table tasks.

- Existing academic table benchmarks have limited diversity. The paper proposes synthesizing diverse table tasks/data from real tables to avoid overfitting.

- Experiments show table-tuned models consistently outperform vanilla GPT/ChatGPT on a wide range of seen and unseen table tasks.

In summary, the paper aims to enhance language models' understanding of tables by proposing table-tuning, a strategy analogous to instruction-tuning, but tailored specifically to exercise and improve abilities on table tasks using synthesized data. The resulting table-tuned models are shown to be both strong table models outperforming vanilla LMs, while still generalizable to new tasks.
