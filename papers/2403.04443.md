# [FriendNet: Detection-Friendly Dehazing Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04443)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Object detection models struggle to perform well on hazy images due to degradation in visual quality. Simply using image dehazing as a pre-processing step does not necessarily improve detection accuracy. There is a need to establish a positive correlation between image dehazing (low-level) and object detection (high-level) tasks for mutual benefit.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FriendNet, an effective framework that bridges image dehazing and object detection via guidance information and task-driven learning to achieve detection-friendly dehazing. It contains a dehazing network (based on a U-Net architecture) and an object detection network (YOLOv7-tiny). 

Key ideas:
(1) Leverage frozen detector to generate detection guidance (mask indicating objects of interest) to guide dehazing network. 
(2) Proposed modules - Guidance Fusion Block (GFB) and Guidance Attention Block (GAB) to integrate guidance into dehazing network.
(3) Proposed Physics-aware Feature Enhancement Block (PFEB) to incorporate physics-based priors for better features.
(4) Use detection loss to optimize dehazing network to be more detection-friendly via task-driven learning.

The core concept is that:
(1) Clean features from dehazing can improve detection accuracy. 
(2) Detection guidance and task-loss can reciprocally guide dehazing process.

Main Contributions:
(1) Effective unified framework for detection-friendly image dehazing.
(2) Detection guidance and task-driven learning paradigm to optimize dehazing for detection.
(3) Physics-aware Feature Enhancement Block to enhance feature learning.
(4) Superior performance over state-of-the-arts on both synthetic and real datasets for image quality and detection accuracy.

In summary, the paper explores interaction between low-level and high-level vision tasks to attain mutual benefits through an integrated optimization paradigm. Evaluations demonstrate effectiveness for both enhanced image restoration and improved detection capacities.
