# [Closed-form Filtering for Non-linear Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09796)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sequential Bayesian filtering aims to estimate the current state distribution of a hidden Markov model given past observations. This is useful for tracking hidden states in dynamical systems.
- Computing the filtering distribution is intractable in most cases except for linear Gaussian models (where Kalman filter applies) or finite state spaces.
- Methods like particle filters have downsides: no closed-form solution, difficult implementation, high computational cost.

Proposed Solution:
- Approximate the transition and observation kernels using Gaussian PSD models, which have closed-form operations and optimal approximation guarantees. 
- Plug these approximate kernels into the filtering recursion to compute an approximate filtering distribution.
- This leads to an algorithm called PSDFilter which enjoys stability and robustness properties.

Contributions:
- A novel algorithm PSDFilter for approximate Bayesian filtering using Gaussian PSD approximate kernels.
- Proof that PSDFilter is stable and robust to initial distribution and approximation errors.
- PSDFilter attains total variation error scaling as O(ε−1) for very smooth kernels, compared to O(ε−2) for sampling methods.
- Computational complexity ranges from O(ε−1.5) to O(ε−3/2) depending on smoothness, including offline learning.
- Generalization to other PSD models allowing more flexible approximation while retaining stability properties.

In summary, the paper proposes a method for tractable approximate Bayesian filtering with strong theoretical guarantees by using Gaussian PSD models to represent transition and observation kernels. This contributes a new filtering algorithm which is faster and more accurate than particle filters for smooth dynamical systems.
