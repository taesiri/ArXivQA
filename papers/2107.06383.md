# [How Much Can CLIP Benefit Vision-and-Language Tasks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06383)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper investigates how much vision-language models like CLIP can benefit performance on downstream vision-and-language tasks. The key hypotheses are:- CLIP image encoders pretrained on image-text data can significantly improve performance on downstream V&L tasks compared to training from scratch.- Further pretraining CLIP on in-domain datasets can provide additional gains. - CLIP can rival or outperform state-of-the-art task-specific models on many V&L tasks.- CLIP can enable new state-of-the-art results by combining with existing task-specific models.The central research questions are:- How much do CLIP encoders improve different V&L tasks compared to training from scratch?- Does further pretraining CLIP on in-domain data consistently help? How much?- Can CLIP match or exceed specialized state-of-the-art models for various V&L tasks? - What performance can be achieved by combining CLIP with existing task-specific models?So in summary, this paper thoroughly investigates the potential of CLIP to benefit diverse V&L tasks, both on its own and when combined with other models. The key hypotheses are that CLIP can significantly improve over training from scratch, further pretraining helps, and CLIP can achieve highly competitive or state-of-the-art results.
