# [Leveraging Translation For Optimal Recall: Tailoring LLM Personalization   With User Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13500)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) systems face challenges in matching user queries to relevant documents due to language barriers and reliance on exact term matching. This leads to suboptimal recall performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a technique to improve CLIR recall via iterative, personalized query augmentation grounded in the user's lexical-semantic space.

- Key steps include:
  1) Initial retrieval using BM25 ranking
  2) Multi-level translation of the query (e.g. English -> Spanish -> English)
  3) Expand query with embeddings to find additional similar terms 
  4) Iteratively re-rank retrieved documents by matching to user profile terms
  5) Construct personalized prompts for a language model using retrieved docs  

Main Contributions:

- Novel framework to address long-standing CLIR recall limitations through context-aware translation and user profile-based augmentation

- Combines multi-level translation, query expansion via embeddings, and incremental BM25 re-scoring centered around user interests

- Experiments show clear improvement over baseline BM25 ranking across ROUGE metrics

- Framework is customizable regarding optimal translation cycles and advanced user modeling 

- Paves path for more attentive CLIR systems that account for nuances in user language and information needs

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative technique to boost CLIR recall performance by iteratively refining and personalizing queries to better capture documents relevant to an individual user's interests and lexical patterns.
