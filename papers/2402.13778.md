# [Weakly supervised localisation of prostate cancer using reinforcement   learning for bi-parametric MR images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13778)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fully supervised learning for medical image analysis tasks like prostate cancer localization requires expensive expert annotations and can introduce biases. Weakly supervised learning only requires image-level labels indicating presence of cancer, but conventional methods have limitations.

Proposed Solution:
- A reinforcement learning (RL) based weakly supervised system for object localization. 
- A controller function is trained to localize regions of interest by introducing a novel reward definition utilizing non-binarized classification probabilities from a pretrained classifier that detects object presence. 
- This allows training without localization labels, minimizing bias, while providing a likelihood of localization quality.

Methods:
- A classifier is pretrained on image-level labels to predict likelihood of cancer presence ("object-ness").
- The controller interacts with the environment (image and classifier) to sample localization crop actions. Reward is from classifier probability for the crop. 
- Controller is trained by policy gradient to maximize cumulative reward and learn optimal localization.

Experiments:
- Evaluate on prostate cancer localization in clinical bi-parametric MR images, using 630 patient cases. Only image-level cancer presence labels used.
- Proposed RL method outperforms multiple-instance learning baseline and achieves comparable performance to fully supervised method.

Main Contributions:  
1) Novel reward definition for RL localization training using object-ness classifier probabilities.
2) Demonstration on clinically important prostate cancer localization task.
3) Outperforms baseline weakly supervised method and approaches fully supervised performance without using localization labels.
