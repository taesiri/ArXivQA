# [The Strong Pull of Prior Knowledge in Large Language Models and Its   Impact on Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17125)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for in-context learning (ICL), where they can perform downstream tasks well with just a few demonstrations, without model finetuning. 
- However, recent work has found LLMs may overly rely on their prior knowledge and have difficulty integrating new evidence that contrasts their pre-existing beliefs about a task. This can limit performance on subjective tasks like emotion recognition where human annotations vary widely.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors design experiments to quantify the "pull" (similarity to prior predictions) and "consistency" (variability across runs) of LLM priors for emotion recognition. 
- They compare ICL performance to "task recognition zero-shot" where labels are randomized, to measure if predictions resemble priors more than ground truth labels.
- They also check if reinforcing priors in the prompt leads to more consistent predictions.

Key Findings:
- LLMs significantly underperform simpler BERT models on emotion recognition. Increased scale does not help.
- LLM predictions reliably resemble zero-shot priors more than ICL labels, especially for larger models, showing a strong pull from inconsistent priors.  
- Reinforcing priors in the prompt improves performance and consistency, indicating priors interfere with learning complex subjective mappings.

Main Contributions:
- Novel experimental design and metrics to quantify strength and consistency of LLM priors.
- Demonstration that larger LLMs suffer more from strong, inconsistent priors for subjective tasks like emotion recognition.
- Evidence that ICL provides little benefit over priors for emotion recognition, and priors severely limit performance.
- Highlights need for caution when interpreting LLM predictions for subjective tasks, and finetuning them to be more adaptable.

In summary, the authors show that large language models tend to default to their own biased knowledge when provided with emotion labels that conflict with their beliefs, rather than learning the new mapping. This effect gets worse with model size, severely limiting their performance on emotion recognition tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper finds that in complex subjective tasks like emotion recognition, larger language models display a stronger pull towards their own inconsistent priors such that in-context learning fails to sufficiently update the model, leading to stagnated performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper proposes an experimental design and measurements to quantify the pull and consistency of prior knowledge in large language models when performing emotion recognition. The key findings are:

1) LLMs have strong yet inconsistent priors in emotion recognition that ossify their predictions, with the phenomenon becoming more pronounced as model size increases. 

2) The predictions of LLMs more closely resemble their "task recognition" priors rather than the ground truth labels provided for in-context learning, demonstrating the strong pull exerted by their background knowledge.

3) The paper shows that in-context learning provides little benefit for highly subjective tasks like emotion recognition when the input-output mapping deviates substantially from the models' pretraining distribution. 

4) The proposed methodology and results contribute to understanding the tradeoff between in-context learning and in-weights learning in LLMs for subjective tasks, and urge caution in using LLMs for such tasks via simple prompting.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel experimental design and measurements to quantify prior knowledge bias in LLMs for emotion recognition, demonstrating limitations of in-context learning for subjective tasks that differ from the pretraining data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose metrics to quantify the "pull" and "consistency" of prior knowledge in language models. Could you explain in more detail how these metrics are defined and how they capture these concepts? 

2. When sampling label-text pairs from the dataset $D$ to create the prompts, different sampling strategies $p_S$ are used in the paper (e.g. $p_T^I$, $p_T^U$). What is the motivation behind these different strategies and how do they help elucidate different aspects of the priors?

3. The task-recognition zero-shot is used as a proxy to elicit task priors. What are some limitations of using this method as a true measure of the model's priors? Could there be other, better ways to quantify priors?

4. Fig. 4 shows that similarity to the task prior remains higher than similarity to ground truth even as more examples are added for large models like GPT-3.5. Why does this happen and why does it get worse with larger models? 

5. The results suggest that in-context learning provides little benefit over the models' own priors for emotion recognition. Do you think this conclusion would hold for other subjective/sentiment-oriented tasks as well?

6. The paper hypothesizes that input-output mappings that deviate substantially from the pre-training distribution get ignored by LLMs during in-context learning. What evidence supports this hypothesis and what are its implications?  

7. What could be some ways to "fine-tune" LLMs to make them less rigid and more adaptable to new mappings, especially for subjective tasks?

8. The authors use several controlled experiments to disentangle the effects of task learning vs task recognition by LLMs. Discuss some of these key experiments and what conclusions were drawn from them.  

9. In Sections 4.6 and 4.7, prompt demonstrations are sampled from the task priors rather than the true dataset. Explain the motivation for this, and what it reveals about the upper bounds on model performance.

10. The authors urge caution in using LLMs for emotion recognition via in-context learning. What are some alternative existing methods that could work better? What advances need to happen before LLMs become reliable for such subjective tasks?
