# [LLM A*: Human in the Loop Large Language Models Enabled A* Search for   Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01797)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel path planning approach called LLM A* that leverages large language models (LLMs) to achieve near-optimal, human-guided planning for mobile robots. Specifically, LLM A* allows humans to interactively guide the planning process through natural language prompts, granting full transparency into how the plan is generated. By encoding key information like the environment map, costs, heuristics etc. into prompts for the LLM, it can suggest action sequences that minimize cost, while human feedback helps further optimize the path. Comparisons to A* and reinforcement learning methods show LLM A* requires a smaller search space and achieves smoother, more optimal paths. The interactive nature also improves safety and interpretability. Overall, LLM A* pioneers a collaborative path planning approach combining the optimality of A* and common sense of LLMs, opening new possibilities for human-robot interaction.
