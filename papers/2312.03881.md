# [FoMo Rewards: Can we cast foundation models as reward functions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03881)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Designing reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging, especially for real-world tasks. Handcrafted rewards can often be hacked by the agent. Learning rewards from offline datasets is expensive and doesn't generalize well. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use foundation models (FoMos), especially large language models (LLMs), as generic reward functions. Specifically, authors propose a pipeline that interfaces an image model with an LLM.
- Given a trajectory of observations, compute the likelihood of an instruction describing the task using the LLM. This likelihood acts as the reward.
- The key idea is that the LLM's world knowledge allows it to reason if the trajectory matches the intent described in the instruction.

Contributions:
- Propose a novel framework to cast decoder LLMs as reward functions by learning a lightweight interface model.
- Evaluate framework on perturbed trajectories and instructions in VIMABench environment.
- Show that FoMo rewards can distinguish between intended behavior and various adversarially constructed incorrect behaviors.  
- Demonstrate that contrastive training and auxiliary success detection loss enable the framework to avoid shortcuts, unlike sole maximum likelihood training.
- Overall, work provides evidence that foundation models can elicit sensible rewards for interactive RL agents. This opens possibilities for end-to-end training of generalist RL agents.

In summary, the paper explores an exciting direction of utilizing foundation models' knowledge to automatically generate rewards, instead of handcrafting them. Results are promising and motivate future work on scaling this to real-world environments and agents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores using foundation models to define reward functions for reinforcement learning agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and evaluating a framework for casting foundation models as reward functions for reinforcement learning. Specifically:

- The paper proposes a pipeline that interfaces a vision model with a language model to compute the likelihood of a task instruction given a trajectory of observations. This likelihood acts as the reward signal.

- The paper demonstrates through extensive experiments that the proposed "FoMo rewards" exhibit desirable properties expected from good reward functions. The rewards distinguish between a correct trajectory solving the task and various systematically constructed incorrect trajectories.

- The paper analyzes different training protocols for the interface model between the vision and language components. It finds that simple maximum likelihood training suffers from shortcut solutions, while contrastive and auxiliary success detection losses yield interfaces that produce more meaningful rewards.

- Overall, the paper makes a case for the viability of using the world knowledge encoded in foundation models to automatically construct reward functions for interactive tasks, instead of requiring manual specification. This can greatly simplify the design of generalist agents.

In summary, the key contribution is showing, both conceptually and empirically, that foundation models can be cast as sensible reward functions for reinforcement learning agents.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Foundation models (FoMos) - The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) and vision models as generic reward functions for reinforcement learning. These models are referred to as "foundation models".

- Reward modeling - The paper focuses on using FoMos specifically for the task of designing reward functions, also known as "reward modeling", which is an integral part of reinforcement learning. 

- Likelihood rewards - The proposed approach involves computing the likelihood of a task description given a trajectory of observations. This likelihood acts as the reward signal.

- Interface learning - The paper proposes learning a lightweight "interface" model to map representations from a vision model into the input space of a language model. This enables using the LLM for reward modeling.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using foundation models as reward functions for reinforcement learning. What are some potential advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to designing reward functions manually?

2. The paper trains an "interface" model to transform visual representations into a space understandable by the language model. What considerations went into the design of this interface model? How was it trained?

3. The authors propose three different training protocols for the interface model: maximum likelihood, contrastive, and success detection. Can you explain the motivation and specifics behind each of these protocols? What are their relative strengths and weaknesses?  

4. The paper evaluates the proposed method on a version of the VIMABench environment converted to use unimodal textual prompts. What were some of the modifications made to the original VIMABench environment? Why was this conversion necessary?

5. Various systematically perturbed trajectories and instructions are used to evaluate whether the proposed pipeline elicits desirable reward function behaviors. Can you describe 2-3 of these perturbation strategies and what behaviors they aim to test?

6. The results show that the maximum likelihood training protocol for the interface model suffers from "shortcut" solutions. What is meant by shortcuts in this context? How might the other two protocols help mitigate this issue?

7. The paper demonstrates the viability of using foundation models as reward functions, but does not actually train RL policies using them. What experiments would you propose as logical next steps to build on this work?

8. The VIMABench environment used is not very representative of real-world complexity. What considerations would using this pipeline in more realistic environments raise?  

9. The paper hints at the possibility of using in-context learning to allow adopting behaviors out of domain. Can you expand more on what this might entail and how it could be beneficial?

10. The framework relies on using a vision model to generate representations of observations. How might the choice of vision model impact the kinds of behaviors and tasks that could be successfully rewarded?
