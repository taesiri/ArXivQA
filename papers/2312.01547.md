# [Near-Optimal Algorithms for Gaussians with Huber Contamination: Mean   Estimation and Linear Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01547)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies the fundamental problems of robust Gaussian mean estimation and linear regression under Huber contamination. The main contribution is the design of the first near-optimal, almost linear time algorithms that achieve optimal error guarantees for both problems. Specifically, for robust mean estimation of a Gaussian in d dimensions with contamination rate ε, the paper gives an algorithm with sample complexity Õ(d/ε2), runtime Õ(nd), and error O(ε). This matches the information-theoretic optimal error with near-optimal sample and time complexity, improving on prior polynomial time algorithms. For robust linear regression, the paper gives the first polynomial time algorithm achieving optimal O(σε) error using a novel reduction to robust mean estimation. The algorithm has near-optimal Õ(d/ε2) sample complexity and Õ(nd) runtime. At the technical level, the paper develops a methodology for multi-directional filtering in almost linear time that may be useful more broadly. The results help resolve open problems on achieving optimal error efficiently for these basic robust learning tasks.
