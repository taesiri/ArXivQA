# [Arabic Handwritten Text Line Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07573)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- There is a lack of publicly available datasets for historical Arabic document image analysis tasks like layout analysis, text line segmentation, and handwriting recognition. 
- Existing Arabic manuscript datasets don't contain annotation of word positions, which is crucial for developing and evaluating word segmentation and recognition systems.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors present a new dataset called KALIMA that contains 497 text line images extracted from 26 pages of 2 historical Arabic manuscripts from the RASM2019 dataset.  
- The text lines are manually annotated with bounding box coordinates around each word, along with the word's ground truth transcription and location order within the line. 
- In total, the dataset contains 4943 annotated Arabic words over 497 text lines originating from the 2 manuscripts.

Key Contributions:
- KALIMA is the first publicly available dataset of historical Arabic documents with word-level bounding box annotations.
- It can enable new research on Arabic word segmentation and recognition for ancient documents.  
- The diversity of writing styles across the 2 manuscripts provides unique data challenges.
- In addition to standard Arabic words, the dataset contains non-word elements like isolated letters, numbers, and symbols.
- The dataset is manually annotated to ensure accurate ground truth for developing and benchmarking Arabic word analysis models.
- By releasing the dataset publicly, the authors aim to advance Arabic document image processing research.

In summary, the key contribution is an expertly annotated, challenging dataset to drive progress on historical Arabic word detection and recognition. By releasing it publicly, the authors seek to close the dataset gap and promote further innovations in this space.
