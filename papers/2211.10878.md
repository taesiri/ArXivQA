# [DYNAFED: Tackling Client Data Heterogeneity with Global Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10878)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is: how to tackle the challenge of heterogeneous client data in federated learning and improve the performance of the global model? 

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel method called DynaFed to address the issue of non-IID (non-identically and independently distributed) client data in federated learning. The main hypothesis is that it is possible to extract essential knowledge about the global data distribution from the update dynamics of the global model, and transfer this knowledge to a small synthesized pseudo dataset to aid model aggregation on the server side. This allows improving the performance of the global model without compromising client data privacy.

In summary, the key research question is how to deal with heterogeneous client data in federated learning, and the main hypothesis is that synthesizing a small pseudo dataset containing global data distribution knowledge extracted from the global model dynamics can help address this challenge. The paper introduces the DynaFed algorithm to implement this idea and demonstrates its effectiveness empirically.
