# [Mixed Pseudo Labels for Semi-Supervised Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07006)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Mixed Pseudo Labels (MixPL), a novel semi-supervised learning approach to improve object detection by addressing limitations of pseudo-labeling. Through analysis of common detectors, the authors find pseudo-labels tend to amplify model strengths and weaknesses, missing more small/tail objects while improving on large/common ones. To address this, MixPL uses Pseudo Mixup and Mosaic to mitigate the impact of false negative pseudo-labels and balance learning across scales/categories. Specifically, Pseudo Mixup overlays two images to make missed objects more background-like, reducing their negative training effects. Pseudo Mosaic combines four downsampled images to provide more balanced small/medium objects for training. Additionally, Label Resampling oversamples rare categories in the labeled set to improve tail category performance. Experiments show MixPL boosts various detectors on COCO, with new state-of-the-art results for Faster R-CNN, FCOS and DINO. It also scales well, improving top models like DINO-Swin-L by 2.5 mAP to 60.2, a new record for COCO semi-supervised detection without extra data. Overall, MixPL offers an effective, unified framework for semi-supervised detection across architectures.
