# [Visual Prompt Tuning for Generative Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00990)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is whether generative vision transformers can effectively transfer learned knowledge to new visual domains/tasks through prompt tuning. 

The authors note that transfer learning is well-established for discriminative models like image classifiers, but not as much for generative image models. Recent work has shown some success transferring knowledge from pretrained GANs, but mostly in limited visual domains or requiring large amounts of target data. 

This paper proposes using prompt tuning, which has proven effective for transfer in NLP transformers, to adapt pretrained generative vision transformers to new downstream image generation tasks. The key hypothesis seems to be that prompt tuning will allow efficient and effective transfer of knowledge from a large pretrained generative vision transformer to enable high-quality image generation on new datasets with limited data.

To evaluate this, the paper tests prompt tuning for transfer with autoregressive and non-autoregressive vision transformers on a diverse set of visual domains and tasks in the VTAB dataset. The results are compared to from-scratch training and prior GAN transfer work. The paper aims to provide empirical evidence that prompt tuning enables generative vision transformers to efficiently learn new image distributions from small data via transfer.
