# [Visual Prompt Tuning for Generative Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00990)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is whether generative vision transformers can effectively transfer learned knowledge to new visual domains/tasks through prompt tuning. 

The authors note that transfer learning is well-established for discriminative models like image classifiers, but not as much for generative image models. Recent work has shown some success transferring knowledge from pretrained GANs, but mostly in limited visual domains or requiring large amounts of target data. 

This paper proposes using prompt tuning, which has proven effective for transfer in NLP transformers, to adapt pretrained generative vision transformers to new downstream image generation tasks. The key hypothesis seems to be that prompt tuning will allow efficient and effective transfer of knowledge from a large pretrained generative vision transformer to enable high-quality image generation on new datasets with limited data.

To evaluate this, the paper tests prompt tuning for transfer with autoregressive and non-autoregressive vision transformers on a diverse set of visual domains and tasks in the VTAB dataset. The results are compared to from-scratch training and prior GAN transfer work. The paper aims to provide empirical evidence that prompt tuning enables generative vision transformers to efficiently learn new image distributions from small data via transfer.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents a generative visual transfer learning framework for vision transformers using prompt tuning. Prompt tuning adapts pretrained vision transformers to new target domains by prepending learnable prompt tokens to the input image token sequence. 

2. It proposes two novel components for prompt tuning:

- A parameter efficient prompt token generator design that incorporates class/instance conditions. This allows controllable image generation.

- A "marquee header" prompt engineering method that composes/interpolates learned prompts over multiple decoding steps. This enhances diversity of generated images.

3. It conducts a large-scale empirical study validating the proposed framework on the visual task adaptation benchmark (19 datasets, diverse domains). It shows state-of-the-art image synthesis compared to prior GAN transfer learning methods.

4. It demonstrates the efficacy of the framework in few-shot scenarios, generating high quality and diverse images from just a couple examples per class. 

5. The work provides substantial evidence for the importance of transfer learning for efficient image synthesis using a standard visual transfer benchmark.

In summary, the key novelty is in developing and validating a prompt tuning framework for transferring knowledge of pretrained vision transformers to new generative image modeling tasks, with both algorithmic innovations and comprehensive experiments.
