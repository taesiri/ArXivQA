# [SCADE: NeRFs from Space Carving with Ambiguity-Aware Depth Estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13582)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents SCADE, a novel technique for reconstructing neural radiance fields (NeRFs) of indoor scenes from sparse, unconstrained 2D views. 

The central hypothesis is that leveraging monocular depth estimation priors with ambiguity modeling can help constrain and improve NeRF reconstruction from sparse views. However, monocular depth estimation is an ill-posed problem with inherent ambiguities. 

The key research questions addressed are:

- How can we model the inherent ambiguity in monocular depth estimation to get useful priors for sparse-view NeRF reconstruction?

- How can we resolve the ambiguity and get a globally consistent scene reconstruction when fusing the ambiguous depth estimates from different views?

- Can ambiguity modeling and multiview fusion improve NeRF reconstruction from sparse views compared to using standard (non-ambiguity-aware) monocular depth priors?

In summary, the central research question is whether explicitly modeling ambiguity in monocular depth can help improve sparse-view NeRF reconstruction through effectively fusing estimates from multiple views. The paper proposes a novel technique SCADE to address this question.
