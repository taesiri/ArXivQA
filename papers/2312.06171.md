# [Jointly Explicit and Implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Network for   Anterior Chamber Inflammation Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06171)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel cross-modal interaction network called Jointly Explicit and Implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Network (EiCI-Net) to diagnose anterior chamber inflammation (ACI) by fusing multimodal data including slit-lamp images, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images, and clinical data. The key innovation is the joint modeling of explicit and implicit cross-modal interactions. Specifically, an Explicit Cross-Modal Interaction Module generates attention maps from tabular features (derived from AS-OCT and clinical data) to guide slit-lamp encoders to focus on more ACI-relevant regions. Meanwhile, an Implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Module employs transformer-based architecture for further feature alignment. Experiments on a real-world ophthalmology dataset demonstrate EiCI-Net's superior performance over state-of-the-arts in diagnosis accuracy and other metrics. The ablation studies also validate the importance of both explicit and implicit interaction modeling. This is the first work investigating multimodal diagnosis of ACI, providing a valuable fusion paradigm for improving automation in ophthalmic care.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately diagnosing and classifying the severity of anterior chamber inflammation (ACI) is important for guiding uveitis treatment. 
- Current methods rely on limited single-modality data (either slit-lamp or AS-OCT images), leading to poor performance. 
- Fusing multimodal data (slit-lamp images, AS-OCT images, clinical data) can improve diagnosis, but prior fusion methods focus only on implicit interactions and neglect explicit clinical knowledge.

Proposed Solution:
- A jointly explicit and implicit cross-modal interaction network called EiCI-Net for ACI diagnosis using slit-lamp images, AS-OCT images and clinical data.
- Uses CNN encoders and Tabular Processing Module (TPM) to extract features from images/data.  
- An Explicit Cross-Modal Interaction Module (ECIM) generates attention maps from tabular features to guide slit-lamp encoders to focus on effective areas.  
- An Implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Module (transformer) enables further feature interaction.

Main Contributions:
- First method to diagnose ACI by fusing multimodal data.
- Jointly models explicit and implicit cross-modal interactions, unlike prior fusion methods that used only implicit interactions. Explicit interactions via ECIM improve performance.
- Constructed a real-world multimodal ACI diagnosis dataset and showed EiCI-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods on this dataset.

In summary, the key ideas are fusing multimodal data for improved ACI diagnosis and jointly learning explicit and implicit interactions between modalities. The proposed EiCI-Net outperforms existing single-modality and fusion methods.
