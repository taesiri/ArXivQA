# [Jointly Explicit and Implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Network for   Anterior Chamber Inflammation Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06171)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel cross-modal interaction network called Jointly Explicit and Implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Network (EiCI-Net) to diagnose anterior chamber inflammation (ACI) by fusing multimodal data including slit-lamp images, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images, and clinical data. The key innovation is the joint modeling of explicit and implicit cross-modal interactions. Specifically, an Explicit Cross-Modal Interaction Module generates attention maps from tabular features (derived from AS-OCT and clinical data) to guide slit-lamp encoders to focus on more ACI-relevant regions. Meanwhile, an Implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Module employs transformer-based architecture for further feature alignment. Experiments on a real-world ophthalmology dataset demonstrate EiCI-Net's superior performance over state-of-the-arts in diagnosis accuracy and other metrics. The ablation studies also validate the importance of both explicit and implicit interaction modeling. This is the first work investigating multimodal diagnosis of ACI, providing a valuable fusion paradigm for improving automation in ophthalmic care.
