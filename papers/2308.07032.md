# [S3IM: Stochastic Structural SIMilarity and Its Unreasonable   Effectiveness for Neural Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07032)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can the structural similarity (SSIM) index be adapted and utilized to improve the training of neural radiance fields (NeRF) and neural surface representations?The key hypothesis is that incorporating a novel stochastic structural similarity (S3IM) loss that captures nonlocal structural information from groups of pixels can significantly enhance the performance of NeRF and neural surface models compared to only using pointwise losses like MSE during training.In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates a new S3IM loss and associated multiplex training paradigm that exploits nonlocal structural similarities to improve state-of-the-art neural field methods like NeRF and NeuS. The core hypothesis is that this multiplex training approach via S3IM can provide significant benefits over standard pointwise training losses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a novel training paradigm and loss function called Stochastic Structural SIMilarity (S3IM) for improving neural radiance fields and neural surface representations. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Formulating a new "multiplex" loss that captures structural similarity information from groups of pixels, rather than just individual pixels. This allows exploiting nonlocal relationships between pixels.- The S3IM loss is based on stochastic patches, making it suitable for standard stochastic gradient training. It captures nonlocal structural relationships, unlike standard SSIM on local patches.- Demonstrating that adding the S3IM loss significantly improves performance across different models and tasks like novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, with minimal extra computation. The gains are especially large for challenging cases like sparse view or corrupted training data.- Proposing a new training paradigm called "multiplex training" that uses both pointwise losses like MSE and structural losses like S3IM. This provides supervision from both individual pixels and collective information.So in summary, the key contribution is introducing a new training approach via the S3IM loss to exploit structural relationships between pixels, leading to big improvements in neural radiance and surface reconstruction with minimal extra cost. The results support the value of nonlocal information and multiplex-style training.
