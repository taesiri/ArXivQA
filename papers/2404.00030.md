# [Visualization of Unstructured Sports Data -- An Example of Cricket Short   Text Commentary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00030)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sports visualization has focused on using structured data like box scores and tracking data. Unstructured text data like commentary has been underutilized.  
- There is a need for new visualizations to analyze cricket players' strengths and weaknesses using commentary data.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a dataset of 1+ million cricket text commentaries to construct "confrontation matrices" mapping batting features (runs scored, shots played etc) to bowling features (length, line, speed etc). 
- Apply correspondence analysis on matrices to derive computational "strength rules" and "weakness rules" for each player. Rules capture batting-bowling feature dependencies.
- Visualize rules using biplots showing proximity between batting and bowling feature vectors. Also cluster players with similar rules.

Main Contributions:
- First use of unstructured text commentary data to augment cricket visualizations
- Method to compute player's strength and weakness rules from commentary
- Visualizations of rules using biplots
- Validation using expert analysis and statistical testing
- Analysis of 264 players, with all data and visualizations publicly released

The key idea is to leverage short text commentary to get granular batting-bowling insights for players in the form of strengths and weaknesses rules, and provide novel visualizations for them. The paper discusses a computational approach and design goals to achieve this.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes novel visualizations of cricket players' strengths and weaknesses derived from unstructured short text commentary data using correspondence analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing the use of unstructured cricket text commentary data for visualization for the first time. This augments the traditional graphical representations in cricket that primarily use structured data like box-score data and tracking data.

2. Identifying strength and weakness rules of individual players using short text commentary data, and providing a computational definition for these rules. 

3. Proposing visualization methods for:
(a) Interpreting the obtained strength and weakness rules of individual players through biplots. 
(b) Finding players with similar strengths and weaknesses using t-SNE plots.

4. Validating the obtained strength and weakness rules through expert analysis and statistical methods like Procrustes Analysis.

So in summary, the main contribution is using a new data source (unstructured text commentary) in cricket visualization to identify and visualize strength/weakness rules of players, which previous visualization techniques did not capture. The paper also validates the constructed rules.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Cricket short text commentary
- Strength and weakness visualization
- Sports data visualization
- Unstructured sports data
- Correspondence analysis
- Confrontation matrix
- Biplots
- Procrustes analysis
- t-SNE plots

The paper focuses on using unstructured cricket short text commentary data to construct strength and weakness rules for individual cricket players. It proposes visualization methods for these rules using biplots. It also visualizes similar players based on strength and weakness rules using t-SNE plots. Some of the key analysis techniques used are correspondence analysis to compute the rules and Procrustes analysis for validation. So the key terms reflect this focus on using text commentary for cricket visualization and analysis.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the paper define "strength rule" and "weakness rule" for a cricket player computationally? What is the justification behind these definitions?

2. The paper mentions obtaining unigrams and bigrams that correspond to different batting and bowling features. What was the process used for mapping unigrams/bigrams to cricket features? Was any automatic mapping technique tried?

3. Correspondence Analysis (CA) has been used for obtaining the low dimensional representation of batting and bowling features. Why was CA suitable for this task compared to other dimensionality reduction techniques? 

4. The confrontation matrix captures the co-occurrence between different batting and bowling features. What was the motivation behind using a confrontation matrix representation? How does it help in identifying strengths and weaknesses?

5. For visualizing the strength and weakness rules, contribution biplots have been used. How do these biplots help to identify dependencies between batting and bowling features compared to simple biplots?

6. Two validation approaches have been taken - expert analysis and Procrustes analysis. Why was statistical validation through Procrustes analysis required in addition to expert validation? What are the limitations of expert validation?

7. The paper identifies that word clouds cannot identify relationships between batting and bowling features. What are the key differences between the proposed approach and word clouds for this task?

8. How does the choice of filter tuple impact the subset of commentary selected and the eventual confrontation matrix? What are the guidelines employed for selecting the filter tuple?

9. Have the authors open sourced the dataset, source code and results? If so, how can one reproduce the results or test new methods on this data?

10. The paper focuses only on Test cricket. Do you think the proposed method can be applied to other formats of cricket as well, like ODI and T20? What adaptations would be required?
