# [Reviewer2: Optimizing Review Generation Through Prompt Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10886)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a two-stage review generation framework called \textsc{Reviewer2} that incorporates aspect prompts to improve the coverage and specificity of generated reviews. The key idea is to first generate aspect prompts focusing on different issues with the paper, and then generate reviews conditioned on both the paper and the aspect prompts.

2) Implementing \textsc{Reviewer2} using LongLoRA and FlashAttention-2 models to enable reviewing long documents. This avoids the limitation of prior works that had to summarize papers due to context length constraints.

3) Designing a prompt generation pipeline with evaluation (\textit{PGE}) to augment existing review datasets with high-quality aspect prompts. This results in the first large-scale peer review dataset with aspect prompts.

4) Extensive experiments demonstrating that \textsc{Reviewer2} trained on the dataset with aspect prompts substantially outperforms existing methods in terms of review quality, specificity, and coverage. The method is shown to be adaptable to review formats from different venues.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a controlled review generation framework that leverages aspect prompts and full paper context to produce higher quality and more tailored reviews compared to prior state-of-the-art. The constructed dataset and strong empirical results also represent important contributions.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects and contributions of this paper:

\textbf{Problem:}
- Standard fine-tuning of language models for review generation leads to several shortcomings like lack of specificity, lack of reviewer aspect coverage, and lack of controllability. Reviews tend to become generic with little details and do not cover the range of aspects that human reviewers focus on. 

\textbf{Proposed Solution:}
- Propose a new two-stage review generation framework called \textsc{Reviewer2} that incorporates explicit aspect prompts. 
- First stage generates a set of aspect prompts that identify weaknesses or aspects the review should focus on. 
- Second stage generates the actual review conditioned on both the paper as well as the aspect prompt.
- Shows that by modeling distribution of aspects explicitly, can get more detailed and better coverage of aspects.

\textbf{Key Contributions:}
- Novel two-stage review generation approach \textsc{Reviewer2} with explicit aspect prompt modeling.
- Demonstrate improved performance across multiple metrics like quality, specificity and coverage. 
- Design new metrics for specificity and coverability.
- Develop prompt generation pipeline to create dataset with 99k paper-review-prompt triplets across 6 venues.
- Compare against several baselines and prior works to demonstrate effectiveness.
- Open source dataset to facilitate future research in this area.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in improving review generation through an innovative two-stage approach based on aspect prompts, while supporting it through comprehensive experimentation and creation of new public datasets.
