# [Online Embedding Multi-Scale CLIP Features into 3D Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18178)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional semantic mapping methods have limited vocabularies and cannot capture the full semantic richness of environments. 
- Existing visual-language mapping methods are often computationally expensive and impractical for real-time exploration of unfamiliar environments.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel method to efficiently embed multi-scale CLIP features into 3D maps. 
- It extracts CLIP features from image patches at multiple scales, concatenates them into batches, and embeds the features into 3D point locations computed from RGB-D images.
- This allows integrating rich semantics while being efficient for real-time performance.

Main Contributions:
- The method facilitates real-time object search and mapping of unfamiliar environments by efficient computation and embedding of multi-scale CLIP features.
- It enables offline retrieval from the resulting map using linguistic queries, enhancing utility.
- A zero-shot object-goal navigation system is proposed using the mapping method.
- The method is validated on tasks of object-goal navigation, offline object retrieval, and multi-object navigation in simulation and real robots.
- It demonstrates higher success rates and faster performance compared to state-of-the-art mapping methods like VLMap.
- The multi-scale feature representation allows detecting both objects and spaces, outperforming others.

In summary, the key innovation is an efficient way to embed rich visual-language semantics into maps, enabling real-time exploration and offline retrieval capabilities. The comprehensive evaluation highlights the effectiveness for navigation tasks across objects and spaces.
