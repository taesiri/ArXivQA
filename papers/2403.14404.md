# [Physics-Informed Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14404)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Physics-Informed Diffusion Models":

Problem:
Generative diffusion models can effectively learn complex high-dimensional data distributions. However, when applied to scientific machine learning, the generated samples are often required to adhere to constraints imposed by physical laws like partial differential equations (PDEs). Existing diffusion models trained purely on data fail to ensure the required precision of these constraints. Prior works correct samples after generation, but do not address the underlying distribution mismatch.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel framework called "physics-informed diffusion models" (PIDM) which incorporates constraints like PDEs directly into the training process. This is achieved by modeling the PDE residuals as "virtual observables" with a Gaussian likelihood distribution. Minimizing the negative log-likelihood of zero residual leads to an additional loss term that penalizes deviations from the constraints. This physics-informed loss is combined with the standard data likelihood term for training. The constraints are enforced on the model's internal estimates of clean samples at each denoising timestep.

Contributions:
- PIDM training framework that significantly reduces PDE residual of generated samples by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to prior arts
- Interestingly, physics-informed training acts as regularization against overfitting and leads to more robust internal representations
- Simple to implement on existing architectures with minimal computational overhead
- Versatile for enforcing equality constraints, inequality constraints as well as optimization objectives
- Sets new state-of-the-art for physics-informed generative modeling while retaining full generation diversity

The promise of PIDM is connecting the representation power of generative models with scientific domain knowledge to generate samples adhering to imposed physical constraints. This can accelerate scientific discovery through applications like materials design, drug discovery etc. Future work includes extending PIDM to handle complex geometries using graph networks or coordinate-based models.
