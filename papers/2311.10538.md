## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a framework for safely conducting open-world tests of autonomous agents by using a context-sensitive monitor to enforce safety boundaries, rank concerning behaviors, and enable human review.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework for safely conducting automated tests of autonomous agents on the open internet. A context-sensitive monitor is used to audit agent actions, enforcing stringent safety boundaries to halt unsafe tests. The monitor ranks and logs suspect behavior for human examination. The authors design a basic safety monitor flexible enough to monitor existing language model agents, and test it using an adversarial simulated agent to measure its ability to identify and stop unsafe situations. They apply the safety monitor to a battery of real-world tests of the AutoGPT agent, identifying limitations and challenges for creating safe in-the-wild tests as agents become more capable. The goal is to enable safe testing of both agent capabilities and safety through this methodology, as a prerequisite for safe autonomy in real-world applications. The work aims to motivate further research into ensuring language model agent safety during automated testing.
