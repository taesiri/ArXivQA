# [Fast k-connectivity Restoration in Multi-Robot Systems for Robust   Communication Maintenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03834)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Maintaining connectivity of communication networks is critical for successful operation of multi-robot teams performing cooperative tasks. However, robots can fail causing the network to get disconnected.
- The paper focuses on the Fast k-Connectivity Restoration (FCR) problem, which aims to repair/restore connectivity of a multi-robot network by making it k-vertex-connected (cannot be disconnected by removing k-1 nodes). The objective is to minimize the max movement of any robot.

Proposed Solution - EA-SCR Algorithm:
- Divides the problem into two sub-problems:
   1) Graph Topology Optimization (GTO): Determine which new edges need to be added to make the graph k-connected while minimizing cost of the most expensive added edge. Solved optimally using the Edge Augmentation algorithm.
   2) Movement Minimization (MM): Move robots to establish edges from GTO while minimizing max movement. Solved using Sequential Cascaded Relocation algorithm based on cascaded movements of robots using breadth-first search trees.
- The overall algorithm is scalable compared to optimal solutions.

Other Contributions:  
- First optimal QCP (Quadratically Constrained Program) formulation of FCR problem based on network flow, but only works for small instances
- Extensive experiments showing EA-SCR performs within 10% of optimal, and reduces max movement by 30% compared to prior algorithms
- Demonstration of algorithm working with teams of 6 drones performing a persistent monitoring task

In summary, the paper makes key contributions in formulating the FCR problem, providing the first optimal algorithm, and presenting a scalable heuristic algorithm called EA-SCR that efficiently restores k-connectivity after failures while minimizing max robot movement. The performance of EA-SCR is demonstrated thoroughly.
