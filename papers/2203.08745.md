# [Multi-Stage Prompting for Knowledgeable Dialogue Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08745)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we leverage the inherent knowledge stored in pretrained language models along with a small knowledge database to generate knowledgeable and engaging dialogue without needing to finetune the model?The authors propose a multi-stage prompting framework to address this question. The key aspects are:1) Using the pretrained language model as an additional knowledge source to complement the small database, to improve generalization to out-of-domain topics. 2) A first stage of prompting the language model to generate relevant knowledge based on the dialogue context.3) A second stage of prompting to generate an engaging response conditioned on the dialogue context and generated knowledge, without finetuning the model. 4) Demonstrating that this approach can outperform finetuning-based dialogue models in terms of response knowledgeability and engagement, especially when scaled up to large models like 530B parameters.5) Showing the approach generalizes better to unseen topics compared to retrieval-based methods constrained by the knowledge database.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that multi-stage prompting of large pretrained language models can produce knowledgeable and engaging dialogue without finetuning, by utilizing the model's inherent knowledge. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a novel multi-stage dialogue prompting (MSDP) framework for knowledgeable dialogue generation using a single language model without any finetuning.2.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel multi-stage prompting framework for knowledgeable dialogue generation that uses a pretrained language model, does not require finetuning, can generate relevant and factually correct knowledge, and produces knowledgeable and engaging responses.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in knowledge-grounded dialogue systems:- It focuses on using a single pretrained language model (LM), without any finetuning, for generating both relevant knowledge and responses. Most prior work relies on finetuning LMs and/or using separate models for knowledge retrieval vs. response generation. Relying on a single pretrained LM makes the approach more parameter-efficient.- The proposed multi-stage prompting approach is novel compared to prior work. OtherPrompt-based dialogue models like PPLM and PPCM  don't explicitly incorporate external knowledge. Multi-stage prompting allows incorporating knowledge while still avoiding finetuning large LMs.- Scaling up to huge LMs (530B parameters) demonstrates the potential of this approach. Many prior works use smaller pretrained LMs. Showing improvements from larger LMs suggests this approach will continue benefiting from future growth in model scale.- Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies analyze the approach from many angles. The comparisons to strong baselines like finetuned models and SOTA retrieval models provide convincing evidence of the benefits.- There is a strong focus on robustness - the model does not require in-domain training data and can generalize to unseen topics. This is a notable advantage over finetuning-based approaches.Overall, the multi-stage prompting framework and analysis around knowledge quality, response engagement/knowledgeability, and generalization seem like important contributions compared to prior work. The scale and comprehensiveness of the experiments also help demonstrate the strengths of this approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring other prompt-based methods like prefix-tuning for the knowledge generation and response generation tasks. The authors mention prefix-tuning as an alternative approach to finetuning, so they suggest exploring how it could be applied in this framework.- Testing the approach on other dialogue datasets and knowledge sources beyond Wizard of Wikipedia/Internet. The authors note their method uses a relatively small knowledge source, so exploring larger knowledge corpora could be interesting.- Scaling up to even larger language models beyond 530B parameters. The authors show performance gains from 126M to 530B parameters, so they suggest continuing to scale up model size.- Adding more stages to the prompting framework, such as an explicit knowledge selection/filtering stage before the response generation. The two-stage prompting approach shows promise, so exploring additional stages could further improve performance.- Incorporating other modalities like images, audio, etc. in addition to text. The current work focuses just on textual dialogue, so multi-modal extensions are suggested.- Evaluating on a wider range of automatic metrics and human evaluations. More comprehensive evaluation protocols could reveal further insights.- Exploring different prompt selection strategies beyond the query-based and perplexity-based approaches tested. Other methods for choosing effective prompts should be investigated.Those are some of the key potential next steps proposed by the authors to build on this initial work on multi-stage prompting for knowledge-grounded dialogue systems. Testing the approach in new settings and continuing to scale model size seem to be the core suggestions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel multi-stage prompting framework called MSDP for generating knowledgeable dialogue responses from a pretrained language model without any finetuning. MSDP has two stages - first it prompts the LM to generate relevant knowledge based on the dialogue context, and then prompts it again to generate an engaging response conditioned on the dialogue context and generated knowledge. It is shown to outperform retrieval baselines for knowledge generation in terms of relevance and correctness, especially for out-of-domain topics. For dialogue response generation, MSDP generates more knowledgeable and engaging responses compared to finetuning-based models. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of various components of MSDP like the sample selection and multi-stage design. Scaling up MSDP to larger LMs consistently improves the quality of knowledge and response generation. The main advantages of MSDP are its simplicity, good generalization ability, and avoidance of expensive finetuning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel multi-stage dialogue prompting (MSDP) framework for knowledge-grounded dialogue generation using a single pretrained language model (LM). The framework has two main components: a knowledge generator and a dialogue generator. In the first stage, the knowledge generator selects similar dialogue samples from a database and constructs prompts to get the LM to generate relevant knowledge based on the dialogue context. In the second stage, the dialogue generator selects samples where the responses are highly dependent on the knowledge and uses prompts to get the LM to generate engaging, knowledgeable responses conditioned on the dialogue context and generated knowledge. Experiments on the Wizard of Wikipedia and Wizard of Internet datasets show MSDP can produce better knowledge and responses than retrieval baselines and finetuning methods. Ablations demonstrate the importance of the prompt selection and multi-stage design. Scaling up MSDP to larger LMs consistently improves knowledge correctness and response quality.In summary, the key ideas are: 1) Leveraging inherent knowledge in LMs via prompting without finetuning, 2) Novel multi-stage design with separate knowledge generation and conditioned response generation stages, 3) Careful selection of samples to construct effective prompts, 4) Demonstrated improvements over finetuning and retrieval methods, 5) Benefits of scaling to larger LMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a multi-stage prompting framework called MSDP for generating knowledgeable dialogue responses from a pretrained language model (LM) without any finetuning. In the first stage, the LM is prompted to generate relevant knowledge based on the dialogue context by providing example prompts of dialogue contexts paired with corresponding knowledge. In the second stage, the LM is further prompted to generate a response based on the dialogue context and previously generated knowledge, by providing example prompts of dialogues along with knowledge and responses. The prompts are constructed to guide the LM to produce knowledgeable and engaging responses. This prompting-based approach allows leveraging the knowledge stored in LMs and generating high-quality responses without needing a large finetuned model or knowledge base.
