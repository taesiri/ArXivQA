# Multi-Stage Prompting for Knowledgeable Dialogue Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we leverage the inherent knowledge stored in pretrained language models along with a small knowledge database to generate knowledgeable and engaging dialogue without needing to finetune the model?The authors propose a multi-stage prompting framework to address this question. The key aspects are:1) Using the pretrained language model as an additional knowledge source to complement the small database, to improve generalization to out-of-domain topics. 2) A first stage of prompting the language model to generate relevant knowledge based on the dialogue context.3) A second stage of prompting to generate an engaging response conditioned on the dialogue context and generated knowledge, without finetuning the model. 4) Demonstrating that this approach can outperform finetuning-based dialogue models in terms of response knowledgeability and engagement, especially when scaled up to large models like 530B parameters.5) Showing the approach generalizes better to unseen topics compared to retrieval-based methods constrained by the knowledge database.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that multi-stage prompting of large pretrained language models can produce knowledgeable and engaging dialogue without finetuning, by utilizing the model's inherent knowledge. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a novel multi-stage dialogue prompting (MSDP) framework for knowledgeable dialogue generation using a single language model without any finetuning.2. The proposed knowledge generator in MSDP outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models in generating relevant and factually correct knowledge for both in-domain and out-of-domain topics. 3. Showing that MSDP can produce more knowledgeable and engaging responses compared to finetuning-based dialogue models.4. Demonstrating that scaling up the language model in MSDP to 530 billion parameters further improves the knowledge and response quality in terms of relevance, correctness, knowledgeability and engagement. 5. Conducting comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of different components in the proposed framework.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel prompting framework that can produce high-quality knowledge and responses for knowledgeable dialogue without requiring finetuning of large pretrained language models. The effectiveness of MSDP is shown through comparisons to strong baselines and human evaluations.
