# [On-device Self-supervised Learning of Visual Perception Tasks aboard   Hardware-limited Nano-quadrotors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04071)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Nano-drones (under 50g) are gaining traction for applications relying on onboard deep learning models for perception. However, when deployed in new unknown environments not seen during training, these models tend to underperform due to the problem of domain shift.  
- Addressing this by collecting new training data from the deployment domain is difficult due to limitations of nano-drones such as extremely constrained sensors, compute capabilities, memory and power.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose on-device learning on the nano-drone itself, where the first part of the mission is used to fine-tune the pretrained model using self-supervised learning before deploying it. 
- This allows adapting the model to the new environment to deal with domain shift by leveraging unlabeled data from the test environment.

Key Contributions:
- First demonstration of on-device self-supervised learning on an actual nano-drone (Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.1) for a real-world vision-based regression task (human pose estimation).
- Analysis of performance vs cost trade-offs along 3 axes: dataset size, training methodologies (fine-tuning all or subset of parameters), and self-supervision strategies.
- Up to 56% error reduction compared to non-finetuned baseline by leveraging onboard odometry for self-supervision.
- Demonstration of feasibility on ultra low-power GAP8 and GAP9 embedded processors, with fine-tuning possible in tens of seconds.  

Conclusion:
- The work pushes state-of-the-art for on-device learning on nano-drones and sets the stage for more advancements in addressing the domain shift problem on highly hardware-limited robots.
