# [Multi-Patch Prediction: Adapting LLMs for Time Series Representation   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04852)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Effective time series representation learning remains challenging. Traditional approaches like contrastive learning or mask-and-reconstruction struggle to fully capture intricate temporal variations in time series data. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for time series analysis through prompting or fine-tuning, they have not been adapted comprehensively for time series representation.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents Multi-Patch Prediction (\method), an innovative framework to adapt LLMs for time series representation learning. The key ideas include:

1. Reconceive time series forecasting as a self-supervised, multi-patch prediction task. This captures temporal dynamics at the patch level more effectively compared to traditional mask-and-reconstruction.

2. Two-stage training strategy: (i) Causal continual pre-training on diverse time series datasets based on next patch prediction to transfer LLM capabilities to time series modality. (ii) Fine-tuning for multi-patch prediction on target time series to align representations.

3. Patch-wise decoding layer to decode each patch independently into temporal sequences instead of sequence-level decoding used in prior works. This enhances model proficiency in learning temporal patch representations.

Main Contributions:

1. Propose \method, an innovative LLM adaptation framework for time series representation learning, utilizing a two-stage forecasting-based self-supervised training strategy.

2. Introduce a patch-wise decoding approach to disentangle encoding and decoding in patch-based time series modeling. This significantly improves LLM backbone's capability for temporal representation learning.

3. Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of \method{} across diverse TSA tasks like long-term forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection and excellent few-shot learning ability. This validates the learned representations' transferability across time series domains.

4. Set new benchmarks in effectively adapting LLMs for advanced time series analysis via the introduced forecasting-aligned pre-training and tailored patch-wise decoding.
