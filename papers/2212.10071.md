# Large Language Models Are Reasoning Teachers

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question addressed in this paper is:How can large language models be used as "reasoning teachers" to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to much smaller student models, reducing model size requirements by orders of magnitude?The key points are:- Recent works have shown chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting can elicit complex reasoning in very large models (175B parameters). However, these models are infeasible to deploy at scale due to computational costs. - This paper proposes using large models to generate CoT reasoning samples, which are then used to fine-tune much smaller student models. This transfers reasoning abilities while drastically reducing model size.- They introduce "diverse reasoning" - generating multiple distinct rationales per sample via stochastic sampling of the teacher - to further improve the teaching effects.- Experiments on a wide range of public models and tasks show their method enables significant reasoning in models 25-2500x smaller than the teacher. Diverse reasoning provides substantial gains at minor cost.- Analysis indicates performance is uniquely scalable along axes of diverse reasoning, data size, teacher performance, and student model size. This demonstrates potential for reliable reasoning in small feasible models.In summary, the core research question is how to transfer complex reasoning abilities from huge teacher models to much smaller students via fine-tuning on teacher-generated reasoning samples, with a focus on minimizing student model size.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Fine-tune-CoT to enable complex reasoning capabilities in small language models. The key ideas are:- Using very large "teacher" models to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning samples via zero-shot prompting. This allows generating reasoning data without task-specific engineering or human annotations.- Using the generated CoT samples to fine-tune much smaller "student" models. This transfers the reasoning abilities of large models to smaller, more deployable ones. - Introducing "diverse reasoning" to generate multiple explanations per sample and augment the fine-tuning data. This further improves the reasoning abilities learned by the student models.The paper shows that Fine-tune-CoT can unlock notable reasoning skills in models orders of magnitude smaller than large teacher models. It also demonstrates the scalability of the method along various axes like diverse reasoning, dataset size, teacher model, and student model size.Overall, the key contribution is a simple yet effective approach to distill complex reasoning abilities from huge language models into small ones, making advanced reasoning skills accessible to the broader community. The method is versatile, scalable, and does not require task-specific engineering or human annotations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes a method to enable complex reasoning abilities in small language models by using very large models to generate training data. The key points are:- Using large models as "reasoning teachers" to generate step-by-step reasoning samples via zero-shot prompting - Using the generated samples to fine-tune much smaller "student" models- Enriching the training data with diverse reasoning samples further improves student performance - The method enables notable reasoning capabilities in models orders of magnitude smaller than required for zero-shot reasoning- Results show performance is scalable with diverse reasoning, dataset size, teacher model, and student model sizeIn summary, the paper shows how very large models can teach smaller, more efficient models to perform complex reasoning through generated training data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related research:- The core idea of using large language models (LLMs) to generate training data for smaller student models is similar to knowledge distillation, but with a focus specifically on complex reasoning tasks. This is a relatively new application area.- Other recent works have tried fine-tuning smaller models on human-annotated reasoning chains or using CoT prompting to self-generate examples in very large proprietary models. This work generates training data through zero-shot CoT prompting in open-source LLMs, making the approach more accessible.- The idea of generating multiple diverse reasoning samples per question for data augmentation is novel. Previous work has generated multiple samples for enhancing inference, but not for teaching student models. This simple technique leads to significant performance gains.- The work provides a comprehensive empirical analysis on 12 diverse reasoning tasks using a range of model sizes, including very small models (<1B parameters). Most prior work focused on 1-2 tasks using models >10B parameters. The scalability is notable.- The analyses on factors like sequence length, dataset scale, teacher accuracy, etc. provide useful insights on how to optimize fine-tuning for complex reasoning, which has often been overlooked.- Sample studies analyze common failure modes and shed light on how small models learn to reason from teacher examples. This level of qualitative analysis is not common, but highly informative.Overall, this work makes fine-tuning with teacher-generated reasoning data a viable and accessible approach through methodical experimentation and analysis. The simple incorporation of diverse reasoning is impactful. The work provides a template for enabling complex reasoning in small, deployable models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring more advanced prompting methods for the teacher model, such as Few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, to further improve the quality of generated rationales for fine-tuning. The authors note that Zero-shot chain-of-thought was chosen mainly for efficiency, but other methods could produce better rationales.- Incorporating recent techniques to boost chain-of-thought reasoning performance in the student models, such as self-consistency training and iterative self-improvement. This could further enhance the reasoning abilities learned through fine-tuning.- Analyzing the connections between Fine-tune-CoT and knowledge distillation more formally, such as using distillation loss functions or comparing soft token distributions. The authors suggest their method resembles distillation but does not fully explore this connection.- Considering a wider range of teacher and student models beyond those tested in the paper. For example, using more recent and efficient models as students, or leveraging the capabilities of models like ChatGPT as teachers.- Further analysis of the tradeoffs involved, like choice of teacher model, degree of diverse reasoning, and data acquisition strategies. The authors propose diverse reasoning helps mitigate tradeoffs but more work is needed.- Exploring whether the approach could work for broader reasoning tasks beyond the datasets tested, which rely more heavily on general world knowledge. The authors suggest their method may be more applicable to restricted reasoning domains.- Investigating techniques to make student model answers more concise while retaining reasoning abilities, for improved efficiency and interpretability.So in summary, the authors point to enhancements in the teacher/student models used, reasoning techniques applied, formal connections to distillation, and mitigating tradeoffs as promising directions for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes Fine-tune-CoT, a method to enable complex reasoning abilities in small language models by using very large models as reasoning teachers. It generates reasoning samples from large teacher models via zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting and uses them to fine-tune smaller student models. This preserves the versatility of prompt-based methods while overcoming their reliance on huge models. The method also utilizes diverse reasoning by generating multiple explanations per sample to augment the training data. Experiments on 12 reasoning tasks show Fine-tune-CoT elicits significant capabilities in small models, outperforming prompt-based methods and even the 175B teacher model in some cases. Performance is scalable across diverse reasoning, dataset size, teacher model quality, and student model size. Ablations address overlooked issues like incorrect rationales and templated datasets. Overall, the method makes complex reasoning feasible in small models, demonstrating potential for real-world deployment. The distillation of chain-of-thought reasoning also provides insight into emergent abilities.
