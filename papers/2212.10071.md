# [Large Language Models Are Reasoning Teachers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10071)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question addressed in this paper is:

How can large language models be used as "reasoning teachers" to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to much smaller student models, reducing model size requirements by orders of magnitude?

The key points are:

- Recent works have shown chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting can elicit complex reasoning in very large models (175B parameters). However, these models are infeasible to deploy at scale due to computational costs. 

- This paper proposes using large models to generate CoT reasoning samples, which are then used to fine-tune much smaller student models. This transfers reasoning abilities while drastically reducing model size.

- They introduce "diverse reasoning" - generating multiple distinct rationales per sample via stochastic sampling of the teacher - to further improve the teaching effects.

- Experiments on a wide range of public models and tasks show their method enables significant reasoning in models 25-2500x smaller than the teacher. Diverse reasoning provides substantial gains at minor cost.

- Analysis indicates performance is uniquely scalable along axes of diverse reasoning, data size, teacher performance, and student model size. This demonstrates potential for reliable reasoning in small feasible models.

In summary, the core research question is how to transfer complex reasoning abilities from huge teacher models to much smaller students via fine-tuning on teacher-generated reasoning samples, with a focus on minimizing student model size.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Fine-tune-CoT to enable complex reasoning capabilities in small language models. The key ideas are:

- Using very large "teacher" models to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning samples via zero-shot prompting. This allows generating reasoning data without task-specific engineering or human annotations.

- Using the generated CoT samples to fine-tune much smaller "student" models. This transfers the reasoning abilities of large models to smaller, more deployable ones. 

- Introducing "diverse reasoning" to generate multiple explanations per sample and augment the fine-tuning data. This further improves the reasoning abilities learned by the student models.

The paper shows that Fine-tune-CoT can unlock notable reasoning skills in models orders of magnitude smaller than large teacher models. It also demonstrates the scalability of the method along various axes like diverse reasoning, dataset size, teacher model, and student model size.

Overall, the key contribution is a simple yet effective approach to distill complex reasoning abilities from huge language models into small ones, making advanced reasoning skills accessible to the broader community. The method is versatile, scalable, and does not require task-specific engineering or human annotations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a method to enable complex reasoning abilities in small language models by using very large models to generate training data. The key points are:

- Using large models as "reasoning teachers" to generate step-by-step reasoning samples via zero-shot prompting 

- Using the generated samples to fine-tune much smaller "student" models

- Enriching the training data with diverse reasoning samples further improves student performance

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The core idea of using large language models (LLMs) to generate training data for smaller student models is similar to knowledge distillation, but with a focus specifically on complex reasoning tasks. This is a relatively new application area.

- Other recent works have tried fine-tuning smaller models on human-annotated reasoning chains or using CoT prompting to self-generate examples in very large proprietary models. This work generates training data through zero-shot CoT prompting in open-source LLMs, making the approach more accessible.

- The idea of generating multiple diverse reasoning samples per question for data augmentation is novel. Previous work has generated multiple samples for enhancing inference, but not for teaching student models. This simple technique leads to significant performance gains.

- The work provides a comprehensive empirical analysis on 12 diverse reasoning tasks using a range of model sizes, including very small models (<1B parameters). Most prior work focused on 1-2 tasks using models >10B parameters. The scalability is notable.

- The analyses on factors like sequence length, dataset scale, teacher accuracy, etc. provide useful insights on how to optimize fine-tuning for complex reasoning, which has often been overlooked.

- Sample studies analyze common failure modes and shed light on how small models learn to reason from teacher examples. This level of qualitative analysis is not common, but highly informative.

Overall, this work makes fine-tuning with teacher-generated reasoning data a viable and accessible approach through methodical experimentation and analysis. The simple incorporation of diverse reasoning is impactful. The work provides a template for enabling complex reasoning in small, deployable models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring more advanced prompting methods for the teacher model, such as Few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, to further improve the quality of generated rationales for fine-tuning. The authors note that Zero-shot chain-of-thought was chosen mainly for efficiency, but other methods could produce better rationales.

- Incorporating recent techniques to boost chain-of-thought reasoning performance in the student models, such as self-consistency training and iterative self-improvement. This could further enhance the reasoning abilities learned through fine-tuning.

- Analyzing the connections between Fine-tune-CoT and knowledge distillation more formally, such as using distillation loss functions or comparing soft token distributions. The authors suggest their method resembles distillation but does not fully explore this connection.

- Considering a wider range of teacher and student models beyond those tested in the paper. For example, using more recent and efficient models as students, or leveraging the capabilities of models like ChatGPT as teachers.

- Further analysis of the tradeoffs involved, like choice of teacher model, degree of diverse reasoning, and data acquisition strategies. The authors propose diverse reasoning helps mitigate tradeoffs but more work is needed.

- Exploring whether the approach could work for broader reasoning tasks beyond the datasets tested, which rely more heavily on general world knowledge. The authors suggest their method may be more applicable to restricted reasoning domains.

- Investigating techniques to make student model answers more concise while retaining reasoning abilities, for improved efficiency and interpretability.

So in summary, the authors point to enhancements in the teacher/student models used, reasoning techniques applied, formal connections to distillation, and mitigating tradeoffs as promising directions for future work.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper proposes a method called Fine-tune-CoT that uses very large language models as reasoning teachers to enable complex reasoning capabilities in smaller models. The method involves generating reasoning samples from large teacher models using chain-of-thought prompting and then fine-tuning smaller student models on the generated samples. This allows the transfer of reasoning abilities from huge 100B+ parameter models to much smaller and more deployable models without task-specific engineering. The method is shown to outperform standard fine-tuning and prompt-based methods like Few-shot-CoT and Zero-shot-CoT on a range of reasoning tasks.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Fine-tune-CoT that uses very large language models (LLMs) as "reasoning teachers" to teach smaller models how to perform complex reasoning tasks. The method first uses an existing zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting technique to generate step-by-step reasoning samples from a 175B parameter LLM teacher model. These samples containing the question, reasoning steps, and answer are then used to fine-tune much smaller student models, reducing the size requirement by orders of magnitude compared to prompt-based CoT methods. The paper also proposes an extension called diverse reasoning, where the stochastic nature of LLM generation is exploited to create multiple distinct reasoning paths for each sample, further augmenting the fine-tuning data. Experiments across a variety of reasoning tasks and model sizes show that Fine-tune-CoT can enable strong reasoning capabilities in models under 1B parameters, outperforming prompt-based methods. Additional analyses demonstrate consistent performance improvements from diverse reasoning, larger datasets, better teacher models, and larger student models. Overall, the method provides a way to distill complex reasoning abilities from very large models into much smaller and more accessible models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, the key problem this paper is addressing is how to enable complex reasoning capabilities in smaller language models, rather than only very large models with hundreds of billions of parameters.  

The paper notes that recent works have shown prompting very large models (e.g. GPT-3 175B) to generate reasoning explanations, or "chain-of-thought" (CoT), can solve complex reasoning tasks. However, such large models are infeasible to deploy at scale due to their computational requirements. 

Therefore, the paper proposes a method called "Fine-tune-CoT" to transfer the reasoning capabilities from very large teacher models to much smaller student models through fine-tuning. The core idea is to use the large teacher models to generate reasoning samples via CoT prompting, and then use those samples to fine-tune the smaller models.

In summary, the key problem is how to enable complex reasoning in small, deployable models rather than just huge 175B+ parameter models. The proposed solution is to utilize the reasoning generation capabilities of large models to create training data for fine-tuning much smaller student models.
