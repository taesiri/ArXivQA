# [Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with   Bidirectional State Space Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09417)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing vision transformers (ViTs) face efficiency challenges when scaling up to high-resolution inputs, limiting their application in dense prediction tasks. 

- Convolutional networks also have efficiency limitations in processing high-resolution images.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Vim, an efficient Vision transformer using Memory-efficient Attention with Backbone design. 

- Vim adopts the memory-efficient attention from Mamba that reduces quadratic complexities to linear. This enables Vim to handle long input sequences efficiently.

- Vim further proposes a bidirectional design where each block contains a forward Mamba encoder and an additional backward Mamba encoder. This captures bidirectional context and is more suitable for dense visual tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes Vim transformer that has linear complexity w.r.t input sequence length, enabling efficient processing of high-resolution images.

- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification with fewer parameters than ViT. Also shows strong performance on semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation.

- Demonstrates exceptional efficiency - Vim matches DeiT's speed and memory on 512x512 images, but is 2.8x faster at 1248x1248 images while using 86.8% less GPU memory.

- The simplified transformer design and linear complexity offer a strong and hardware-friendly backbone for computer vision models to process high-resolution visual data.

In summary, the paper presents Vim, an efficient vision transformer that can scale linearly to long input sequences and high-resolution images, overcoming limitations of previous works. Vim also achieves excellent performance across multiple vision tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Vim, an efficient vision Transformer backbone that leverages shift-based self-attention and a bidirectional design to achieve superior performance on image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection with fewer parameters and better efficiency compared to convolutional networks and attention-based Transformers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a new vision backbone called Vim (Vision Perceiver) for computer vision tasks. Specifically:

1) Vim is based on spatial-sequential modeling (SSM), which models an image as a spatial sequence of patches and applies Transformer to learn representations. This avoids the quadratic computation and memory cost of standard Transformer.

2) Vim uses a bidirectional design to capture both forward and backward context in the image, which is shown to be beneficial for downstream dense prediction tasks like segmentation. 

3) Experiments show Vim achieves better accuracy and efficiency compared to CNNs and Transformers on tasks like image classification, segmentation, and detection. Specifically, it has linear complexity w.r.t. image size and sequence length.

4) Vim does not need modifications like window attention to handle high-resolution inputs, thanks to its efficient modeling of images as sequences. It can learn representations directly from gigapixel images.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Vim as an efficient SSM-based vision backbone with a bidirectional design, which achieves strong performance on multiple vision tasks while having linear complexity for processing high-resolution images.
