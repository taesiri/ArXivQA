# [ACTrack: Adding Spatio-Temporal Condition for Visual Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07914)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Efficiently modeling spatio-temporal relations of objects is a key challenge in visual object tracking (VOT). 
- Existing methods either track by appearance similarity or long-term relation modeling, overlooking rich temporal context between frames.
- Training trackers from scratch or fine-tuning large models requires substantial time and memory.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose ACTrack, a tracking framework with additive spatio-temporal conditions. 
- It freezes parameters of a pre-trained Transformer backbone to preserve its capabilities.
- A lightweight trainable additive network is introduced to model spatio-temporal relations.
- An additive siamese convolutional net preserves spatial features integrity. 
- Temporal sequence modeling simplifies the pipeline by directly predicting frame-by-frame coordinate sequences.

Main Contributions:
- Balances training efficiency and tracking performance by freezing backbone and adding lightweight network.
- Designs additive siamese convolutional net to capture spatial patterns across patches.
- Performs temporal sequence modeling to track coordinate sequences, eliminating custom heads.
- Sets new state-of-the-art on VOT2020, LaSOT, TrackingNet and GOT-10k benchmarks.
- Reduces overall training time and memory consumption substantially.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient tracker called ACTrack that balances performance and training requirements. By freezing a Transformer backbone and adding lightweight trainable networks to model spatial and temporal relations, it simplifies the tracking pipeline while achieving top results on major benchmarks.
