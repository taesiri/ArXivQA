# [Collaborative Neural Painting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01800)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel task called Collaborative Neural Painting (CNP) to facilitate collaborative art generation between users and AI agents. The goal is to enable users to iteratively create paintings by providing brushstrokes as context, which the agent then completes by generating coherent and creative strokes based on the user's input. To solve this, they introduce a parametrized stroke representation and a novel Transformer architecture with two key components: a Position-Aware Attention Bias (PAAB) to model relationships between neighboring strokes, and an Interaction-Aware Masking (IAM) procedure to simulate user interactions during training. They also adopt a diffusion model framework for effective stochastic sampling. To benchmark progress, they curate a dataset of stroke-based animal paintings and propose quantitative metrics and user studies to evaluate performance. Their method outperforms baselines like BERT and Continuous Transformer in completing partial paintings. By supporting incrementally adding context strokes, modifying existing ones, generating missing areas, and even creating full paintings from scratch conditioned just on class labels, their approach facilitates more natural human-AI collaborative painting while promoting creativity on both sides.
