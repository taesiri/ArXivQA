# [CLAPP: Contrastive Language-Audio Pre-training in Passive Underwater   Vessel Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02099)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing research on audio classification lacks ability to recognize attributes of passive underwater vessel scenarios and lacks well-annotated datasets due to data privacy concerns. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes CLAPP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pre-training in Passive Underwater Vessel Classification), a novel model that trains a neural network using a wide range of vessel audio and vessel state text pairs obtained from an oceanship dataset.

- CLAPP is capable of directly learning from raw vessel audio data and carefully curated labels to improve recognition of vessel attributes in passive underwater scenarios.  

- The model has zero-shot capability to predict relevant vessel state descriptions for given audio without directly optimizing for the task.

- It aims to solve two key challenges - vessel audio-text classification and passive underwater vessel attribute recognition.

Key Contributions:

- Introduces Oceanship, the first large-scale multi-labeled dataset (121 hours, 9261 vessels in 15 classes) for pre-training passive underwater vessel classification. It is much larger than existing datasets like Deepship and Shipsear.

- Redefines intra-domain underwater audio classification tasks and introduces a Domain-Generalization task, being the first to conduct cross-domain experiments in this area. 

- Proposes the CLAPP model tailored for passive vessel audio classification which achieves state-of-the-art performance through zero-shot learning on Deepship and Shipsear datasets.

- CLAPP shows ~20% performance gains in cross-domain effectiveness and 7-13% boosts over prior methods on zero-shot tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes CLAPP, a novel contrastive language-audio pre-training framework for passive underwater vessel classification, which leverages a new large-scale multi-labeled oceanship dataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing the first large-scale, multi-labeled dataset called Oceanship for pre-training passive underwater vessel audio classification. Oceanship is at least 2.5 times larger than existing datasets in this domain.

2. Redefining intra-domain underwater audio classification tasks and introducing a cross-domain task. Conducting cross-domain experiments in passive underwater audio classification, where the proposed CLAPP model demonstrates a 20% improvement. 

3. Leveraging the Oceanship dataset to develop a multimodal underwater audio classification model called CLAPP. This represents pioneering work in constructing a pre-trained model specifically for passive vessel audio classification. 

4. The CLAPP model achieves state-of-the-art performance through zero-shot learning on the Deepship and Shipsear datasets, with improvements of 7-13% in accuracy over prior methods.

In summary, the main contributions are creating a large-scale pre-training dataset (Oceanship), redefining tasks in this domain, proposing a novel pre-trained model (CLAPP), and achieving new state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks through zero-shot evaluation.
