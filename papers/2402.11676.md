# [A Multi-Aspect Framework for Counter Narrative Evaluation using Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11676)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Counter narratives are informed responses to hate speech that aim to challenge harmful claims and de-escalate encounters. They are an important hate speech intervention strategy.  
- However, evaluating counter narratives is difficult. Metrics like BLEU have poor correlation with human judgment. Human evaluation is costly and time-consuming. 
- No existing automatic evaluation methods effectively capture key aspects of counter narrative quality based on NGO guidelines.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a novel multi-aspect evaluation framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to provide scores (1-5 stars) and feedback for counter narrative candidates.
- Prompt LLMs to evaluate 5 key aspects of counter narratives derived from NGO guidelines: specificity, opposition, relatedness, toxicity, fluency.
- Validate framework by correlating LLM scores with human annotations and analyzing alignment of feedback.

Main Contributions:
- First framework prompting LLMs to provide multi-aspect, interpretable evaluation of counter narratives based on NGO guidelines requiring social understanding.
- LLM evaluators achieve much higher correlation to human judgment than existing automatic metrics like BLEU, ROUGE-L, etc. 
- Qualitative analysis shows LLM feedback mostly aligns with human reasoning while identifying some errors.
- Framework allows improved evaluation even for weaker models by decomposing into aspects.
- Serves as more effective automatic evaluator to augment costly manual evaluation. Enables optimized counter narrative generation.

In summary, the paper develops a novel way to effectively evaluate counter narratives to hate speech by utilizing LLMs for multi-aspect scoring and feedback inspired by NGO guidelines. This improves alignment with human judgment while providing interpretability.
