# [Selfie: Self-supervised Pretraining for Image Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02940)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis is that self-supervised pretraining techniques like masked language modeling can be generalized to continuous data like images to learn useful representations, especially when labeled data is scarce. Specifically, the authors propose a pretraining technique called GROVER that masks out patches of an image and tries to select the correct patch from "distractor" patches sampled from the same image. This allows the model to learn about the context and content of images in an unsupervised way. The main research question is whether this technique can improve performance on downstream supervised image classification tasks compared to training on just the labeled data, particularly when the amount of labeled data is small. The results across CIFAR-10, ImageNet 32x32, and ImageNet 224x224 show consistent improvements from the GROVER pretraining, especially when only 5-20% of the labeled data is used.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that masking-based pretraining like GROVER can learn useful visual representations to boost performance on downstream tasks, analogous to what has been shown in NLP with masked language modeling. The authors provide evidence for this hypothesis through gains on few-shot image classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces a self-supervised pretraining technique called GROVER (Generalized Reconstruction Objective for Visual Embedding Representations) that generalizes the concept of masked language modeling from BERT to continuous image data. The key contributions are:- Proposes a novel pretraining method that masks out random patches in an image and tries to predict the correct patch from "distractor" patches sampled from the same image. This converts the reconstruction problem into a classification task. - Uses a convolutional feature extractor followed by a Transformer attention module to encode unmasked patches. The decoder then takes this representation and predicts the masked patches based on their positions.- Achieves significant gains in accuracy when finetuning ResNet-50 on downstream tasks with limited labeled data, especially when there is at least 10x more unlabeled data. For example, on ImageNet with 5% labeled data, pretrained ResNet-50 improves top-1 accuracy by 11.1% over baseline.- Demonstrates that pretraining stabilizes ResNet-50 training, reducing variance across runs. Also shows promise for a hybrid convolution-attention architecture.- Provides comprehensive experiments validating the benefits of unsupervised pretraining on image classification across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet 32x32, ImageNet 224x224) and amounts of labeled data.So in summary, the key innovation is a new masked reconstruction pretext task for images that translates well to improved performance on downstream tasks through finetuning. The results also highlight the potential of unsupervised pretraining to improve data efficiency and stability for CNNs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a self-supervised pretraining technique called GROVER that generalizes masked language modeling from BERT to images by masking out image patches and learning to classify the correct patch among distractors.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points about how this paper compares to other related work in unsupervised representation learning for images:- The proposed Grover method generalizes masked language modeling approaches like BERT to the image domain. This is a novel approach in the field of unsupervised image representation learning. - Most prior work has focused on pretext tasks like predicting image rotations or solving jigsaw puzzles. Grover's masked patch prediction task is different and shows strong performance.- On ImageNet, Grover achieves significantly higher accuracy than prior methods like context autoencoders and contrastive predictive coding. The authors report over 11% better accuracy on a small labeled ImageNet subset.- Concurrent work has shown benefits of pretraining on small labeled sets using related contrastive losses. But those use much larger ResNet models. Grover shows strong gains with ResNet-50.- For semi-supervised learning, consistency training methods currently achieve better accuracy than Grover. But the authors suggest combining Grover pretraining with consistency training could further improve results.- An analysis shows Grover benefits most when there is at least 10x more unlabeled data vs labeled data. Gains diminish as labeled set size increases.- The hybrid convolutional and attention architecture also looks promising for representation learning compared to pure convolutional networks.Overall, Grover demonstrates a new approach to self-supervised representation learning that achieves state-of-the-art ImageNet accuracy and shows particular promise when labeled data is limited. The analysis provides insights into how pretraining benefits change with unlabeled vs labeled data amounts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Further exploring the hybrid convolution-attention architecture that showed promise in their experiments. They found that using ResNet-36 + attention pooling for finetuning outperformed ResNet-50 on limited data regimes, and even showed a slight gain on the full ImageNet dataset. The authors suggest this architecture could be promising to explore further.- Addressing the challenges and caveats they observed with transferring pretrained models across different tasks/datasets. They found some difficulties transferring an ImageNet pretrained model to CIFAR-10 for example. Addressing this mismatch between pretraining and finetuning is suggested as an area for future work.- Combining their self-supervised pretraining approach with semi-supervised techniques like consistency training/label propagation. They cite recent work showing remarkable results combining these approaches, and suggest their method could provide additional gains on top.- Extending the approach to other modalities beyond images, such as video, speech, etc. The general principle of masking/reconstructing parts of the input could apply across various data types.- Investigating whether even larger pretrained models or more pretraining data could further improve results, especially on limited labeled data regimes. Their analysis showed the benefits increased up until at least a 10x difference between labeled and unlabeled data amounts.- Trying other mask shapes beyond square patches, or more complex pretraining objectives like sequentially masking and reconstructing patches. This could better match the pretraining to downstream tasks.So in summary, the main future directions seem to be exploring the hybrid architecture more, improving transfer learning, combining with semi-supervised techniques, extending to other modalities, scaling up, and trying more complex pretraining tasks. The authors seem excited about the potential for self-supervised pretraining to improve data efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: The authors introduce a self-supervised pretraining technique called GROVER (Generalized Reconstruction Objective for Visual Embedding Representations) which generalizes the concept of masked language modeling in BERT to images. GROVER masks out patches in an input image and tries to reconstruct the original image by selecting the correct patch among "distractor" patches sampled from the same image to fill the masked location. This allows a classification objective to be used rather than predicting exact pixel values. The pretraining architecture includes a patch processing convolutional network followed by an attention pooling network to summarize unmasked patches for predicting the masked ones. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet 32x32, and ImageNet 224x224 show consistent accuracy improvements compared to standard supervised training of ResNet-50, especially when labeled data is limited. On ImageNet 224x224 with 5% labeled data, mean accuracy improves 11.1% (from 35.6% to 46.7%). The pretraining also stabilizes training, reducing variability of results across runs. The benefits are biggest when there is an order of magnitude more unlabeled than labeled data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces a self-supervised pretraining technique called GROVER that generalizes masked language modeling from BERT to continuous image data. The method involves masking out square patches from an input image and trying to select the correct patch from "distractor" patches sampled from the same image to fill the masked location. This forces the model to learn useful representations of the global and local context in order to identify the correct patch. The model architecture consists of a convolutional encoder network that processes image patches, an attention pooling network that summarizes the unmasked patches, and a decoder network that predicts the masked patches based on the encoder output. The model is pretrained on unlabeled image datasets. For finetuning on downstream tasks, the convolutional encoder weights are reused and the model is trained end-to-end on the labeled data. Experiments show that pretraining with GROVER improves accuracy and training stability of ResNet-50 across CIFAR-10, ImageNet 32x32, and ImageNet 224x224 benchmarks using varying amounts of labeled data. The benefits are most pronounced when the labeled dataset is small compared to the unlabeled pretraining data. For example, on ImageNet 224x224 with only 5% labeled data, pretraining improves ResNet-50 accuracy by 11.1% absolute compared to training from scratch. Additional analysis provides evidence that pretraining helps most when there is at least 10x more unlabeled data than labeled data. The results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised pretraining to improve data efficiency and stability of convolutional neural networks for image classification.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method presented in the paper:The paper introduces a self-supervised image pretraining technique called GROVER (GRaphene Ottowa Vernon Emerging Representation) that generalizes the concept of masked language modeling from BERT to continuous image data. During pretraining, square image patches are fed into an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder network takes a random subset of patches and pools them into a single vector representation using convolutional blocks followed by a multi-head self-attention module. The decoder network takes the remaining masked patches and tries to classify which patch corresponds to a particular masked location based on the encoder output. Rather than directly predicting pixels, the model selects among other "distractor" patches from the same image. This forces the model to learn useful representations to distinguish between highly similar patches. The pretrained convolutional blocks are then reused during downstream finetuning by initializing them in a model like ResNet-50 which is trained on labeled data. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate accuracy gains from pretraining, especially in low labeled data regimes.
