# [Towards A Better Metric for Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07781)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Evaluating text-conditioned generated videos is challenging. Existing metrics like FVD, Video IS, and CLIP Score have limitations in assessing the quality and text-video alignment of generated videos. They show mismatch with human judgments. Conducting large-scale human evaluations is also laborious and impractical. There is a need for automatic metrics tailored for this task.  

Proposed Solution: The paper introduces the Text-to-Video Score (T2VScore), a new automatic evaluator for text-conditioned video generation. T2VScore has two components:

1) T2VScore-A: Evaluates text-video alignment by generating diverse questions covering text prompt elements using LLMs. It then answers questions by feeding the video and auxiliary trajectories from object tracking into multimodal LLMs and measures alignment as VQA accuracy.

2) T2VScore-Q: Predicts quality score using a mix-of-experts approach, fusing judgments from:
(a) A technical expert assessing spatial and temporal distortions 
(b) A semantic expert using text-prompted evaluation

The optimization strategy uses progressive training on datasets of reducing sizes to improve metric generalization.


Main Contributions:

1) Proposing T2VScore for automatic text-video alignment and quality evaluation of generated videos.

2) Introducing the Text-to-Video Generation Evaluation (TVGE) dataset with human judgments on 2,543 videos to benchmark T2VScore against existing metrics.

3) Demonstrating through experiments that T2VScore shows significantly better correlation with human opinions compared to previous metrics like CLIP Score and FVD.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in developing more reliable automatic evaluation methods for text-conditioned video generation. The T2VScore and TVGE dataset pave the way for improved assessment of generated video quality and alignment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new metric called Text-to-Video Score (T2VScore) for evaluating text-to-video generation models from two key perspectives - text-video alignment and video quality - along with a new benchmark dataset for validating metric performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces T2VScore, a novel automatic evaluation metric specifically designed for text-conditioned generated videos. T2VScore focuses on two key aspects - text-video alignment and video quality.

2) It presents the Text-to-Video Generation Evaluation (TVGE) dataset, which collects human judgments on over 2,500 text-conditioned generated videos along the two perspectives that T2VScore evaluates. The dataset serves to benchmark T2VScore against human perception. 

3) Through experiments on the TVGE dataset, the paper shows that T2VScore demonstrates superior correlation with human judgments compared to existing metrics like FVD, Video IS, and CLIPScore. This validates T2VScore's effectiveness as an automatic evaluation metric for text-to-video generation.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the T2VScore metric and the accompanying TVGE benchmark to facilitate better evaluation of text-guided video generation models.
