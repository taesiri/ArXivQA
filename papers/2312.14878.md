# [Pangu-Agent: A Fine-Tunable Generalist Agent with Structured Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14878)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Reinforcement learning (RL) methods that directly map perception to actions struggle to achieve generality across tasks and require large amounts of training data. This is because they cannot effectively incorporate prior information and reasoning into the perception-action cycle when devising policies.  
- Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a way to provide cross-domain knowledge to AI agents, but lack crucial learning and adaptation capabilities for specific decision problems.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents the Pangu-Agent framework to integrate structured reasoning into policies to remedy the above problems. 
- It introduces intrinsic functions that operate on the agent's memory state to enable reasoning, planning, tool use etc. These are optimized jointly with the extrinsic policy that interacts with the environment.
- The framework supports fine-tuning of both intrinsic and extrinsic functions via supervised learning on expert demonstrations and RL.

Main Contributions:
- A general agent framework that can incorporate reasoning structure and supports tuning intrinsic/extrinsic functions.
- Comprehensive evaluation of reasoning methods and demonstration of performance gains from fine-tuning. 
- Implementation of rejection sampling-based supervised fine-tuning and RL pipeline tailored for LLM policies.
- Experiments showing significant improvements in held-out tasks after fine-tuning e.g. 27% to 82% success in ALFWorld, 28% to 91% in BabyAI.
- Ability to achieve high success rates simultaneously in ALFWorld (82%) and multiple BabyAI tasks (58.7% avg) using a single cross-domain model.

The proposed Pangu-Agent framework and fine-tuning methodology advance the state-of-the-art in building capable and adaptable agents using large language models. The results demonstrate the benefit of incorporating reasoning structure and tuning the full pipeline.
