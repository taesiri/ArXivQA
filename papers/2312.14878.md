# [Pangu-Agent: A Fine-Tunable Generalist Agent with Structured Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14878)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Reinforcement learning (RL) methods that directly map perception to actions struggle to achieve generality across tasks and require large amounts of training data. This is because they cannot effectively incorporate prior information and reasoning into the perception-action cycle when devising policies.  
- Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a way to provide cross-domain knowledge to AI agents, but lack crucial learning and adaptation capabilities for specific decision problems.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents the Pangu-Agent framework to integrate structured reasoning into policies to remedy the above problems. 
- It introduces intrinsic functions that operate on the agent's memory state to enable reasoning, planning, tool use etc. These are optimized jointly with the extrinsic policy that interacts with the environment.
- The framework supports fine-tuning of both intrinsic and extrinsic functions via supervised learning on expert demonstrations and RL.

Main Contributions:
- A general agent framework that can incorporate reasoning structure and supports tuning intrinsic/extrinsic functions.
- Comprehensive evaluation of reasoning methods and demonstration of performance gains from fine-tuning. 
- Implementation of rejection sampling-based supervised fine-tuning and RL pipeline tailored for LLM policies.
- Experiments showing significant improvements in held-out tasks after fine-tuning e.g. 27% to 82% success in ALFWorld, 28% to 91% in BabyAI.
- Ability to achieve high success rates simultaneously in ALFWorld (82%) and multiple BabyAI tasks (58.7% avg) using a single cross-domain model.

The proposed Pangu-Agent framework and fine-tuning methodology advance the state-of-the-art in building capable and adaptable agents using large language models. The results demonstrate the benefit of incorporating reasoning structure and tuning the full pipeline.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents Pangu-Agent, a framework for developing generalist AI agents that can effectively incorporate structured reasoning and adapt via fine-tuning to improve performance across diverse tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes the Pangu-Agent framework to facilitate research towards developing generalist AI agents. The framework builds upon large language models (LLMs) to address reasoning and decision problems, allowing the incorporation of human priors. 

2. It introduces a novel RL-based formulation to optimize both the agent's intrinsic and extrinsic functions. The intrinsic functions operate on the agent's memory state while the extrinsic functions interact with the environment.

3. It implements and evaluates several intrinsic functions like planning, tool use, reflection etc. and shows how the framework can support recent advances in LLM research through modular and flexible design.

4. It conducts a comprehensive evaluation of structured reasoning methods on multiple LLMs and tasks. The results provide insights into the relative advantages of different methods.

5. It demonstrates the impact of supervised and reinforcement learning fine-tuning to significantly improve the agent's performance in tasks like ALFWorld and BabyAI. A cross-domain model is shown to achieve high performance simultaneously on both tasks.

6. The work discusses limitations of the current framework and outlines future work towards developing more generalist agents with full differentiability, real-world applicability, more advanced memory and planning capabilities.

In summary, the key innovation is the proposal of a novel agent framework with intrinsic/extrinsic functions, structured reasoning and fine-tuning to ultimately enable the development of more capable and generalist AI agents.
