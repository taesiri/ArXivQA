# [Membership Inference Attacks on Diffusion Models via Quantile Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05140)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new membership inference attack against diffusion models using quantile regression. The attack learns to predict the distribution of the reconstruction error ($t$-error) for examples not used in training. By thresholding the target example's reconstruction error based on its predicted quantile, the attack can determine if the example was likely used in training or not. A key advantage is the attack model is very small, unlike prior attacks requiring multiple full "shadow models", making it efficient. Further, bagging many such small quantile regression models as "weak attackers" and taking a majority vote improves accuracy. Experiments on diffusion models for CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL-10 and Tiny ImageNet show state-of-the-art attack accuracy, identifying members with over 99% true positive rate for a 0.1% false positive rate. The efficiency and accuracy demonstrate the extreme vulnerability of diffusion models to membership inference attacks. The method provides an effective auditing approach and underscores the need for privacy protections when releasing diffusion models.
