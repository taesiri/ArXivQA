# [Supervised Fine-tuning in turn Improves Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10222)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Supervised Fine-tuning in turn Improves Visual Foundation Models":

Problem:
- Image-text pretraining like CLIP has become the mainstream approach for training visual foundation models. Efforts like GLIP and RegionCLIP aim to introduce region-level representation learning into CLIP's pretraining but face scalability challenges due to lack of large-scale region-level datasets. 

- In NLP, the scalability issue is addressed by employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) after pretraining language models, through methods like instruction tuning. However, the potential of fine-grained pure vision SFT (termed ViSFT) to enhance generalization of vision models has not been extensively explored.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a two-stage ViSFT method to unleash the fine-grained knowledge within vision foundation models like CLIP. 

- In the first stage, task heads for detection, segmentation and captioning are trained on COCO while keeping the vision backbone frozen. This obtains compatible task heads.

- In the second stage, the vision backbone is augmented with LoRA weights and trained on the tasks while freezing the task heads. This ensures fine-grained information is directed to the LoRA weights.

- ViSFT differs from traditional multi-task training in not needing to maximize in-domain task performance. The goal is to obtain fine-grained information through joint learning and evaluate on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Main Contributions:
- Showcases the potential of fine-grained SFT to enhance generalization capabilities of vision models, through a two-stage ViSFT process.

- Achieves consistent improvements across vision and vision-linguistic benchmarks by updating a 4.4B parameter CLIP vision transformer using ViSFT on 8 GPUs in under 2 days.

- Demonstrates ViSFT's capabilities in unleashing fine-grained knowledge within vision models to identify more optimal representational subspaces.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage method termed "ViSFT" to effectively enhance vision foundation models' generalization capability by unleashing their fine-grained knowledge through supervised fine-tuning on object-level tasks after pretraining.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Showcasing the potential of fine-grained supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in enhancing the generalization capabilities of vision foundation models.

2. Proposing a two-stage ViSFT process to effectively unleash the fine-grained knowledge of vision foundation models. 

3. Demonstrating improvements in the performance of visual foundation models across various benchmarks in both visual and vision-linguistic scenarios with lightweight training.

So in summary, the main contribution is exploring and demonstrating the effectiveness of a specific fine-tuning method (ViSFT) to improve vision foundation models, requiring only lightweight training.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords related to this work include:

- Vision foundation models - The paper focuses on enhancing the generalization capabilities of foundation models for computer vision tasks. This includes models like EVA-CLIP and BLIP-2.

- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) - The core method proposed is supervised fine-tuning of vision models on in-domain tasks to improve performance on out-of-domain tasks. This is inspired by SFT methods in NLP like instruction tuning.

- ViSFT - The vision SFT method proposed in the paper. It is a two-stage training process involving first training task heads then training LoRA parameters on the foundation model.

- Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) - Used to efficiently fine-tune the vision transformer backbone without changing the original weights. Stores the fine-grained info learned during ViSFT.

- In-domain vs out-of-domain - ViSFT uses COCO datasets for in-domain supervised training, while evaluations are done on out-of-domain benchmarks to test generalization.

- Object detection, instance segmentation, image captioning - The specific in-domain vision tasks used for ViSFT based on COCO dataset annotations.

So in summary, the key terms cover the ViSFT method itself, the concepts of in-domain and out-of-domain learning, LoRA fine-tuning, and the vision tasks used for supervised training.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage training process for ViSFT. What is the motivation behind splitting the training into two stages instead of jointly training the task heads and backbone network?

2. In the first stage of training, the task heads are trained while keeping the backbone network frozen. What is the purpose of this and why is the backbone network kept frozen? 

3. During the second stage of training, the backbone network is updated while the task heads are frozen. Why is it important to freeze the task heads at this stage rather than continuing to update them?

4. The paper explores ViSFT using EVA vision transformers. How do you think ViSFT would perform using other backbone architectures like convolutional networks? Would it still be as effective?

5. The paper shows improvements on multiple out-of-domain benchmarks after ViSFT. Do you think further gains could be achieved by carefully selecting the in-domain tasks or would any set of diverse vision tasks work just as well? 

6. Could the improvements from ViSFT be further boosted by using a larger dataset for the in-domain tasks instead of just COCO or would the gains be marginal?

7. The paper implements lightweight LoRA tuning in the second stage to preserve the unleashed information. How does this compare to other backbone tuning methods? Are there any disadvantages?

8. Table 5 shows that freezing the task heads performs better than reducing their learning rate or finetuning them jointly. Why do you think that is the case? 

9. The paper performs ViSFT on EVA and BLIP models. How do you think ViSFT would fare on other vision-language models like ALIGN, Florence, etc? Would all models benefit equally?

10. The paper focuses only on vision SFT and keeps the text encoder of CLIP fixed. Do you think further gains could be achieved by also incorporating text SFT for the full model? How would you go about designing relevant text tasks?
