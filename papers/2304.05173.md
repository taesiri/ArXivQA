# [Improving Image Recognition by Retrieving from Web-Scale Image-Text Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05173)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we improve image recognition by augmenting models with external memory retrieved from massive-scale image-text data?

Specifically, the authors propose a retrieval-augmented image recognition approach where relevant examples are retrieved from a large external memory bank to enhance the model's predictions. The main contributions are:

- They introduce an attention-based memory module that learns to weight the importance of each retrieved example, keeping the relevant ones and removing noisy/irrelevant examples. 

- They thoroughly study different ways of constructing the memory bank, showing benefits of using massive datasets up to 1 billion image-text pairs.

- They evaluate the approach on long-tailed recognition, learning with noisy labels, and fine-grained classification. Results show state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-LT, Places-LT and Webvision datasets.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that image recognition can be significantly improved by retrieving and fusing relevant knowledge from massive-scale external data in a selective way, which their proposed approach achieves. The large-scale memory bank and attention over retrieved examples are key to effectively augmenting the base recognition model.
