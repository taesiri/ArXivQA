# [PACC: A Passive-Arm Approach for High-Payload Collaborative Carrying   with Quadruped Robots Using Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19862)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Using actuated manipulator arms for collaborative carrying tasks with legged robots reduces the robot's payload capacity and increases mechanical complexity/failure points.  
- Current methods for robot-robot and human-robot collaborative carrying rely on rigid payload connections or active arms, and are not well suited for rough terrain locomotion.

Proposed Solution:
- A 3DOF passive arm design with intrinsic joint impedance for high-payload collaborative carrying (PACC), allowing compliant payload interaction.
- Arm joint displacements are used to generate motion commands to guide the robot in a leader-follower manner during collaboration. 
- A model predictive control (MPC) formulation that incorporates the arm dynamics and estimated interaction forces for locomotion stabilization.  

Main Contributions:
- Concept and preliminary design of a lightweight passive arm to exploit legged robots' payload capabilities for collaborative tasks without compromising locomotion.
- Guidance strategy to command robot motion based on passive arm joint displacements.
- MPC controller that handles estimated interaction forces for stabilized locomotion.
- Experimental validation of passive arm and controller for robot-robot and human-robot collaboration carrying rigid and non-rigid payloads over stairs and rough terrain.

In summary, this paper introduces a passive arm approach to enable high-payload human/robot collaborative carrying for legged robots, while ensuring stable locomotion over rough terrain. A decentralized control scheme exploits the arm displacements and impedance for reactive follower behavior during collaboration.
