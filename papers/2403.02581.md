# [VEglue: Testing Visual Entailment Systems via Object-Aligned Joint   Erasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02581)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Visual entailment (VE) is an important multimodal reasoning task that determines the relationship between an image (premise) and a text sentence (hypothesis). Testing the reliability and robustness of VE systems is critical before deployment, but existing testing techniques have limitations: 1) They only perturb a single modality, breaking the semantic consistency between image and text, 2) They conduct shallow perturbations that can hardly affect the VE system's reasoning and have low issue-finding capability. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an object-aligned joint erasing approach called VEglue for testing VE systems. The key idea is to leverage objects as the basic reasoning components and conduct deeper joint erasing to images and texts based on object-level alignment:

1) It first detects objects in the image premise and extracts object descriptions from the text hypothesis. 

2) It then aligns the image objects with text descriptions to identify linked vs unlinked objects.

3) Based on the alignment, three Metamorphic Relations (MRs) are designed to erase: both the object and its linked text description, only linked objects, and only unlinked objects.

4) The modified image-text pairs are fed into the VE system, and errors are detected by checking if the predictions violate the MRs.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel object-aligned joint erasing approach for testing VE systems by understanding semantic relations of image-text objects.

- Extensive experiments on 4 VE systems and 2 datasets show VEglue detects 11,609 issues on average and achieves 52.5% issue finding rate, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

- Further model retraining using the detected issues improves accuracy on VEglue tests by 50.8% without sacrificing original accuracy.

- The idea of aligning and jointly erasing multimodal objects can motivate future research on testing multimodal AI systems.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in reliability testing for the emerging and critical VE task by innovative object-aligned joint input perturbations.
