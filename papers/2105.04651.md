# [Not All Relevance Scores are Equal: Efficient Uncertainty and   Calibration Modeling for Deep Retrieval Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04651)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we efficiently model uncertainty in neural information retrieval models to improve their effectiveness and reliability? 

Specifically, the authors are interested in developing an efficient Bayesian framework to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in neural retrieval models. Their key hypotheses are:

1) An approximate Bayesian framework using only the last layer of a neural retrieval model can capture useful uncertainty information while adding minimal computational overhead. 

2) The uncertainty information from this Bayesian framework can improve model calibration, risk-aware reranking, and performance on downstream tasks like cutoff prediction.

3) Generative neural IR models that report their own uncertainty are not as robust as the proposed Bayesian models.

The authors propose using Monte Carlo dropout as an efficient variational Bayesian approximation. They show this captures useful uncertainty information with minimal overhead, improves model calibration and risk-aware reranking, and boosts cutoff prediction performance. The Bayesian models significantly outperform generative models at conveying robust uncertainty estimates.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient Bayesian framework for neural IR models to improve their effectiveness and reliability by better modeling uncertainty. The key hypothesis is that even approximate Bayesian inference restricted to just the last layer can provide substantial benefits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an efficient Bayesian framework to estimate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in neural retrieval models. Specifically:

- They show that by only making the last layer(s) of a neural retrieval model Bayesian using Monte Carlo dropout, they can capture both types of uncertainty with minimal computational overhead. This allows the uncertainty modeling to be applied to large models like BERT.

- They introduce a new calibration metric called expected ranking calibration error (ERCE) to measure how well a model's uncertainty correlates with its accuracy on ranking relevant documents higher. The Bayesian models have significantly better calibration. 

- They demonstrate the usefulness of the uncertainty information by using it to do risk-aware reranking, getting gains of 3-5% nDCG. The uncertainty is also shown to improve performance on the downstream task of cutoff prediction by around 10%.

- Overall, the paper shows an efficient way to make neural ranking models Bayesian to quantify uncertainty, and empirically validates that this uncertainty provides meaningful information that can improve ranking and downstream tasks. The minimal computational overhead makes it feasible to apply to large neural models.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in the field of uncertainty modeling for neural information retrieval:

- Most prior work has focused on capturing uncertainty through ensemble methods or query performance/cutoff prediction using deterministic model outputs. This paper proposes an efficient Bayesian framework to directly model uncertainty within the retrieval model itself.

- The Bayesian framework introduces minimal computational overhead, making it feasible to apply to large transformer models like BERT. This is an advantage over ensemble approaches that require running multiple models.

- The paper demonstrates that modeling uncertainty improves ranking calibration, risk-aware reranking, and downstream tasks like cutoff prediction. This shows the usefulness of uncertainty information beyond just the raw relevance scores.

- For calibration, the paper proposes a new expected ranking calibration error metric tailored to measuring calibration of ranked lists rather than just scalar predictions.

- The Bayesian models are shown to be better calibrated and achieve stronger performance on downstream tasks compared to deterministic baselines and a generative retrieval model baseline.

- The framework is model-agnostic, shown to be effective for both hand-crafted models like Conv-KNRM and large pre-trained models like BERT.

Overall, this paper presents a novel and efficient way to model uncertainty in neural retrieval that conveys useful information for improving ranking, calibration, and downstream tasks. The model-agnostic Bayesian framework and new calibration metric are valuable contributions compared to prior work focused on ensemble and post-hoc uncertainty methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Applying the efficient Bayesian framework to other IR tasks like fairness, diversity, transparent search, dialog agents, etc. The uncertainty information could be useful in these areas.

- Exploring the impact of modeling uncertainty in situations where the retrieval model is an information gathering agent in a larger system. The authors suggest the uncertainty could provide useful signals in such downstream applications.

- Improving sample efficiency when training neural retrieval models using the Bayesian framework. The uncertainty estimates could help guide more effective sampling.

- Incorporating stochastic models for other tasks like diversity and fairness aware rankings. The uncertainty modeling could help capture aspects like exposure bias. 

- Using the framework for conversational information retrieval systems and dialog agents. The uncertainty signals could improve understanding and dialog management.

- Overall, the authors highlight the potential of the uncertainty modeling approach across a wide range of IR tasks and applications. The key advantage is efficiently capturing useful epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty from neural models.

The efficient approach makes it feasible to incorporate into many modern neural retrieval architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces an efficient Bayesian framework to estimate uncertainty in neural retrieval models. The key idea is to use Monte Carlo dropout only on the last layers of the model during inference to capture a distribution over scores. This allows the model to express its confidence in the relevance estimation through the variance over multiple stochastic forward passes. The authors show that this method adds minimal computational overhead compared to standard deterministic models while improving the model's calibration and providing useful uncertainty information. They demonstrate improved performance on risk-aware reranking using Conditional Value at Risk and on the downstream task of cutoff prediction. Overall, the paper provides a computationally feasible way to make neural retrieval models probabilistic, capturing useful uncertainty information with applications to ranking, calibration, and decision making tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient Bayesian framework to capture uncertainty in neural retrieval models. The key idea is to use Monte Carlo dropout in the last layers of the neural network to induce a distribution over scores for each query-document pair. This allows the model to capture both epistemic uncertainty over the model parameters as well as aleatoric uncertainty over the inputs. The framework is shown to work well with both large pretrained models like BERT as well as handcrafted similarity functions like in ConvKNRM. 

Experiments demonstrate that the stochastic models achieve similar mean performance to deterministic variants, while providing useful uncertainty information. The uncertainty enables risk-aware reranking using conditional value at risk, leading to improved ranking performance. The models are also better calibrated in their rankings based on a proposed expected ranking calibration error metric. Finally, the uncertainty information is shown to be useful for the downstream task of cutoff prediction, with the Bayesian models significantly outperforming deterministic versions as well as a baseline using a generative BERT model. Overall, the work provides an efficient way to capture useful uncertainty information in state-of-the-art neural retrieval models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient Bayesian framework to estimate uncertainty in neural retrieval models. The key idea is to use Monte Carlo dropout, where dropout is applied during inference to induce a probabilistic model. Specifically, the authors show that only the last layer(s) of a neural ranking model need to be made Bayesian through dropout in order to capture uncertainty. This allows uncertainty estimation with minimal computational overhead even for large transformer models like BERT. During inference, Monte Carlo samples are drawn by applying dropout, producing a distribution over scores for each query-document pair. The mean score approximates the deterministic scoring, while the variance and skewness capture uncertainty. This additional uncertainty information enables risk-aware reranking and improves performance on the downstream task of cutoff prediction. Overall, the method provides an efficient way to make existing neural ranking models Bayesian to quantify and leverage uncertainty.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of capturing uncertainty in neural information retrieval (IR) models. The key questions it aims to address are:

1) How can we efficiently model uncertainty in relevance scores predicted by neural IR models? 

2) Does capturing model uncertainty improve ranking effectiveness and calibration?

3) Can the uncertainty information be exploited for downstream tasks like risk-aware reranking and cutoff prediction?

Specifically, the paper argues that most neural IR models provide deterministic point estimates of relevance scores. This obscures uncertainty information about the model's confidence in its relevance predictions. Capturing this uncertainty can help models generalize better across collections, handle out-of-distribution inputs, and improve effectiveness on downstream tasks. 

To address this, the paper proposes an efficient Bayesian framework to model uncertainty using Monte Carlo dropout. It shows empirically that only the last layer of a model needs to be Bayesian to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This allows uncertainty modeling at low computational overhead for large neural models like BERT. 

The paper introduces metrics to evaluate uncertainty calibration and uses the uncertainty for risk-aware reranking and cutoff prediction. Results show the Bayesian models have better calibration and leverage uncertainty to significantly improve performance on ranking and cutoff prediction.

In summary, the key focus is on efficiently modeling neural IR model uncertainty and demonstrating its benefits for ranking, calibration, and downstream tasks. The Bayesian framework provides a way to do this even for large neural models.
