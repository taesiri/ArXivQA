# [One-Shot Transfer of Long-Horizon Extrinsic Manipulation Through Contact   Retargeting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07468)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Extrinsic manipulation involves leveraging environment contacts to achieve manipulation goals that may be impossible through standard grasping alone. However, orchestrating complex sequences of extrinsic manipulation primitives is challenging due to environment diversity, large action space, and contact dynamics. Some prior works leverage demonstrations but still require hundreds for a single task. And while hierarchical approaches exist for long-horizon manipulation using reusable primitives, there is limited work successfully integrating complex extrinsic primitives.  

Proposed Solution: 
1) Decompose long-horizon extrinsic manipulation into sequences of short-horizon primitives delimited by contact state switches. For example, a common sequence would be push-pivot-grasp for occluded grasping. 
2) Develop a library of robust feedback policies for reusable extrinsic primitives like pivoting and pulling that can handle variations in objects and environments.  
3) Define semantic contact specifications for initializing each primitive.
4) Generalize a demonstration of a long-horizon task from one scene to a new scene through contact retargeting. Identify the primitive sequence from the demonstration. Enforce contact constraints from adjacent primitives via inverse kinematics to find freestanding goal states for each primitive switch in the new scene. Execute the sequence using the robust primitive policies.

Contributions:
- Contact retargeting framework to transfer demonstrated manipulation sequences to new scenes while respecting contact constraints
- One-shot transfer pipeline enabling a single demonstration to achieve long-horizon extrinsic manipulation in diverse scenes  
- Extensive hardware validation over 4 long-horizon tasks, 10 objects and 6 environments, achieving 80.5% success rate
- Empirical ablation study confirming contact retargeting as key enabler of combining primitives

The method decomposes a notoriously challenging problem into more tractable sub-problems to enable complex, contact-rich robotic manipulation from minimal human input. The extensive hardware validation highlights real-world applicability.
