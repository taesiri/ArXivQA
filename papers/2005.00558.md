# [POINTER: Constrained Progressive Text Generation via Insertion-based   Generative Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00558)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper seeks to address is: 

How can we develop an effective model for constrained text generation that is able to incorporate given lexical constraints and generate coherent, fluent, and informative natural language text?

The paper proposes a model called POINTER that aims to address the challenges of hard-constrained text generation, where the model must generate text containing specific required words or phrases. 

The key ideas proposed to address this research problem are:

1) A progressive, multi-stage generative process that inserts words in order of importance, from high-level concepts to details.

2) Leveraging pre-trained BERT to initialize the model parameters.

3) Large-scale pre-training on Wikipedia text to create a versatile generative model. 

4) A parallel, non-autoregressive generation approach to improve efficiency.

5) Customized beam search to improve the coordination of the parallel generation.

Through experiments on news and Yelp review datasets, the paper shows that POINTER outperforms previous models on constrained text generation by producing more fluent, coherent, and lexically diverse text. The human evaluation also indicates POINTER generates text that is generally preferred over baseline models.

In summary, the key research contribution is developing a simple but effective approach for constrained text generation using insertion-based pre-training and progressive generation. The model is shown to improve over previous methods for this challenging generative task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel non-autoregressive model called PTG (Progressive Text Generation) for hard-constrained text generation. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. PTG generates text in a progressive and iterative manner, starting from lexical constraints. It first generates high-level words that bridge the constraints, then uses them as pivots to insert finer details. This coarse-to-fine hierarchy allows long-term control over generation.

2. PTG allows initializing from large pre-trained language models like BERT via its masked language modeling-like objective. The authors also pre-train PTG on a large Wikipedia corpus for better generalizability.

3. PTG uses parallel non-autoregressive decoding, achieving logarithmic time complexity during inference, unlike previous linear-time methods. They also propose an inner-layer beam search to improve the decoding.

4. Extensive experiments on News and Yelp datasets show PTG outperforming previous constrained text generation methods on relevance, fluency and diversity. The human evaluation also prefers PTG outputs.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the progressive text generation framework PTG that enables efficient non-autoregressive decoding while allowing better control over lexically constrained text generation through pre-training and hierarchical coarse-to-fine generation. The overall approach is simple, interpretable and performs well empirically.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- The paper introduces a new model called Pointer for constrained text generation. This appears to be a novel approach compared to prior work like NMSTG and CGMH that relied on different architectures/training procedures. Pointer leverages recent advances like BERT pre-training and insertion-based transformers in a creative way.

- The paper claims Pointer allows better long term planning and control during generation due to its coarse-to-fine hierarchical structure. This seems to be an advantage over prior methods that may struggle with long input constraints or paragraphs. The log runtime complexity is also superior.

- The paper shows strong empirical results on multiple text generation benchmarks like News and Yelp. Pointer outperforms the baselines on relevance metrics like BLEU/NIST as well as human evaluation. The diversity scores are also competitive.

- The simplicity and interpretability of Pointer's staged generation is noteworthy. The technique seems more straightforward than complex sampling or search procedures used before. The model architecture and training process also seem accessible.

- Pre-training on a large Wikipedia corpus allows the model to generalize better, an advantage over prior work that only trains on task-specific data. The pre-trained model is released to enable further research.

Overall, Pointer pushes the state of the art on constrained text generation through novel modeling, training, and inference techniques. The results are superior to prior work empirically while the approach is simple and intuitive. Releasing the pre-trained model is also a contribution to the field. The paper advances research on controllable natural language generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several interesting future research directions:

1. Improving explainability of synthesizing programs: The authors note that while their method can synthesize programs for many tasks, it remains challenging to understand and explain the reasoning behind the generated programs. Developing techniques to understand and interpret the generated programs is an important future research direction.

2. Discovering richer program structures: The generated programs in the current work are relatively simple and modular. Extending the approach to discover richer program structures like loops, recursion etc. could allow solving more complex tasks.

3. Learning from fewer examples: The current approach requires many input-output examples to synthesize programs. Reducing the number of examples needed for learning programs, perhaps by incorporating strong inductive biases, is an important direction. 

4. Learning higher-level functional representations: The programs are currently represented as low-level instructions. Learning programs in terms of higher-level functional representations like mathematical expressions could improve generalization and transfer learning.

5. Multi-task and lifelong learning: Extending the approach to multi-task and lifelong learning settings where related tasks need to be solved sequentially could improve sample efficiency and allow learning more complex behaviors.

6. Broader evaluation: Evaluating the approach on more diverse tasks beyond grid world navigation and Bash command line tasks, including real world robotics applications.

In summary, the key future directions are improving explainability, discovering richer structures, improving sample efficiency, learning higher-level representations, multi-task and lifelong learning, and broader evaluation on more diverse tasks. Advancing these aspects could significantly extend the capabilities of program synthesis through deep learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for constrained text generation using insertion-based generative pre-training. The key idea is to progressively insert new tokens between existing tokens in a parallel manner to generate text that contains specific lexical constraints. This is done by first initializing the model using BERT and then pre-training it on a large Wikipedia corpus. During training, the data is prepared by masking out less important tokens first so that the model learns to generate more important words like nouns and verbs earlier in the process. The insertion-based transformer generates text stage-by-stage, where at each stage it predicts whether to insert a new token or not for each position. Experiments on news and Yelp datasets show this approach outperforms previous methods like non-monotonic sequential text generation and constrained sentence generation by metropolis-hastings sampling. The main advantages are the ability to leverage large pre-trained models like BERT, the interpretable and controllable coarse-to-fine generation process, and faster parallel decoding during inference.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper proposes a novel method for constrained text generation. The key idea is to generate text progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner. The model starts with a few keyword constraints and iteratively inserts additional tokens between the existing tokens to expand the text. This insertion-based generation approach allows better control over the output text compared to prior autoregressive or tree-based methods. 

Specifically, the model uses importance scores based on TF-IDF, POS tags and keyword extraction to determine the generation order. The more important words like nouns and verbs are generated earlier to form the skeleton of the text. Then less informative words are filled in later through insertion operations. This coarse-to-fine generation order resembles how humans write. The training uses prepared data that encourages generating important words first. Inference employs beam search for high quality output. Experiments on news and reviews datasets show the model outperforms strong baselines on automatic and human evaluations. The non-autoregressive decoding provides logarithmic time complexity. In summary, the progressive insertion-based method enables controllable generation while being simple and fast.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for constrained text generation based on a progressive, insertion-based approach. The key idea is to generate text in multiple stages by iteratively inserting new tokens between existing tokens. Starting from a set of lexical constraints, at each stage the model inserts new tokens that are more important (e.g. nouns, verbs) to bridge the constraints. Later stages fill in less important tokens (e.g. articles, prepositions) to complete the sentence. This coarse-to-fine generation process resembles how humans write. To implement this approach, the authors leverage the masked language modeling objective used to train BERT. Data is prepared by reversing this process - masking out less important tokens first to create training instance pairs. The insertion-based Transformer is applied repeatedly in a non-autoregressive manner to generate each stage. Large-scale pretraining on Wikipedia data helps learn the language model. Beam search and a custom inner-layer beam algorithm are proposed to coordinate the parallel generation process across tokens and improve results.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is addressing the problem of generating natural language text that contains specific lexical constraints or keywords. This is useful for applications like summarizing notes or search queries into fluent sentences. 

- Most prior work has focused on "soft" constraints, where keywords are provided as hints but may be dropped during generation. This paper tackles "hard" constraints where the keywords must be included.

- Hard constrained generation is challenging because it requires modifying the network architecture to enforce the constraints during decoding. Prior work has downsides like slow sampling procedures or lack of interpretability. 

- This paper proposes a new model called Pointer that generates text progressively using an insertion-based transformer. It inserts new words between existing words in parallel, allowing large-scale pretraining and faster inference.

- Pointer follows a coarse-to-fine hierarchy, generating important words like nouns and verbs first, then details like articles/prepositions. This matches how humans write.

- Experiments on news and Yelp review datasets show Pointer outperforms prior approaches on constrained generation. The progressive insertion allows better long text generation.

In summary, the key contribution is a new insertion-based transformer approach to hard constrained text generation that is interpretable, fast, and leverage large pretrained models. It shows superior performance on benchmark datasets.
