# [Improving Implicit Regularization of SGD with Preconditioning for Least   Square Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08585)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior work has shown SGD can achieve better or worse generalization than ridge regression depending on the problem instance. The underperformance of SGD is attributed to imbalance optimization in the data covariance matrix.  
- Preconditioning is proposed as a natural solution to rebalance optimization and enhance SGD's performance, but open questions remain about whether it can outperform ridge regression.

Proposed Solution:
- Derive excessive risk bounds for preconditioned SGD and ridge regression to enable analytical comparison. Propose preconditioning matrix design for SGD tailored to amplify and flatten signal strength for leading eigenspace.  

Main Contributions:
- Establish excessive risk characterization for preconditioned SGD and ridge, expanding current theoretical understanding.
- Demonstrate through construction the existence of preconditioning matrix that enables SGD to consistently outperform standard and preconditioned ridge regression.  
- Propose simple yet effective preconditioning design for SGD leveraging data covariance information. Demonstrate robustness to estimation error and practical feasibility.
- Empirical evaluations validate improved generalization of preconditioned SGD over ridge, aligning with theoretical findings.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions demonstrating SGD with thoughtful preconditioning can surpass ridge regression by effectively harnessing benefits of preconditioning to control bias. Both theoretical and empirical results affirm preconditioning allows SGD to achieve enhanced implicit regularization.
