# [Going Denser with Open-Vocabulary Part Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11173)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we empower object detectors to go beyond open-vocabulary object detection and achieve open-vocabulary part segmentation, i.e. being able to parse any object in the wild into its component parts?The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- Proposing the task of open-vocabulary part segmentation, which aims to segment both objects and their constituent parts in an open-world setting. This moves beyond just detecting objects to a more fine-grained understanding. - Adapting an object detector architecture based on Mask R-CNN and CLIP to support part segmentation through multi-granularity training.- Parsing novel objects into parts by finding the nearest base object using semantic correspondence from DINO and transferring the part annotations. This expands the vocabulary of detectable part categories.- Training the detector on joint object, part and image level data to align vision and language across multiple granularities. - Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on Pascal Part and PartImageNet for open-vocabulary part segmentation, and training a single detector that generalizes to multiple datasets better than dataset-specific training.In summary, the key hypothesis is that with multi-granularity alignment and parsing novel objects using foundation models, object detectors can be empowered to segment objects and their parts in an open-vocabulary setting. The results validate this hypothesis and represent progress towards more detailed open-world scene understanding.
