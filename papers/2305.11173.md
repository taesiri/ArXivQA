# [Going Denser with Open-Vocabulary Part Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11173)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we empower object detectors to go beyond open-vocabulary object detection and achieve open-vocabulary part segmentation, i.e. being able to parse any object in the wild into its component parts?The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- Proposing the task of open-vocabulary part segmentation, which aims to segment both objects and their constituent parts in an open-world setting. This moves beyond just detecting objects to a more fine-grained understanding. - Adapting an object detector architecture based on Mask R-CNN and CLIP to support part segmentation through multi-granularity training.- Parsing novel objects into parts by finding the nearest base object using semantic correspondence from DINO and transferring the part annotations. This expands the vocabulary of detectable part categories.- Training the detector on joint object, part and image level data to align vision and language across multiple granularities. - Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on Pascal Part and PartImageNet for open-vocabulary part segmentation, and training a single detector that generalizes to multiple datasets better than dataset-specific training.In summary, the key hypothesis is that with multi-granularity alignment and parsing novel objects using foundation models, object detectors can be empowered to segment objects and their parts in an open-vocabulary setting. The results validate this hypothesis and represent progress towards more detailed open-world scene understanding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Setting up benchmarks and baseline models for open-vocabulary part segmentation in Pascal Part and PartImageNet datasets. This expands part segmentation from a limited number of categories to open vocabulary.2. Proposing a method to utilize various data sources like image-level labels, object-level boxes, and part-level masks to improve part segmentation performance. This is done by training the detector on the joint of part-level, object-level, and image-level data to establish multi-granularity alignment between vision and language. 3. Introducing a parsing pipeline to expand the vocabulary of part categories. This pipeline leverages foundation models like CLIP and DINO to parse novel objects into parts based on semantic correspondence with base objects.4. Demonstrating improved performance on cross-dataset and cross-category part segmentation benchmarks using the proposed methods. For example, on PartImageNet the method improves over baseline by 3.3-7.3 mAP and on Pascal Part novel AP50 is improved by 7.3.5. Training a single detector that achieves good performance on multiple part segmentation datasets, outperforming dataset-specific training. This shows the potential of a general part segmentation model in the open world.In summary, the main contribution is enabling open-vocabulary part segmentation by effectively utilizing various data sources and foundation models. The proposed methods significantly improve performance on existing datasets and point towards more generalized part segmentation models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes an open-vocabulary part segmentation model that can detect objects and their component parts in images, even for novel objects unseen during training. The key ideas are (1) multi-granularity alignment between vision and language by joint training on part, object and image data, and (2) parsing novel objects into parts by finding semantic correspondence to base objects. The model achieves significant improvements in part segmentation performance compared to baseline methods.In one sentence: The paper presents an open-vocabulary part segmentation model with multi-granularity vision-language alignment and parsing novel objects into parts via semantic correspondence.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper on open-vocabulary part segmentation compares to other related work:- It moves beyond just open-vocabulary object detection to also segmenting object parts in an open-world setting. Most prior work has focused on detecting full objects, not their constituent parts.- The method leverages multiple data sources and foundation models (CLIP, DINO) to expand the vocabulary and learn alignments between language and visual concepts at multiple granularities (image, object, part). Other works tend to train on more limited datasets.- It introduces a parsing pipeline to generate part annotations for novel objects by finding correspondence with base/seen objects. This helps expand the vocabulary of parts. Other open-vocab detection methods rely more on just image captions or classification data.- Experiments show it achieves state-of-the-art performance on PartImageNet and Pascal Part benchmarks for cross-dataset and cross-category generalization. Performance is also strong when evaluated across multiple datasets.- It demonstrates the approach on a wider variety of objects and parts than many prior part segmentation works that focused on more domain-specific taxonomies (e.g. for humans, birds, cars).- The method does segmentation in a class-aware, semantically-oriented way compared to recent "segment anything" models like SAM that take a class-agnostic, edge-based approach.Overall, this paper pushes part segmentation to be more open-world and shows how to effectively leverage multiple data sources and foundation models to improve generalization. The parsing pipeline and joint training approach seem novel compared to prior art.
