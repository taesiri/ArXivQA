# [CO3: Low-resource Contrastive Co-training for Generative Conversational   Query Rewrite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11873)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the task of conversational query rewrite (CQR) under low-resource settings. CQR aims to rewrite an abbreviated in-context query into a more complete and explicit form based on the conversation history. However, existing methods rely heavily on a large amount of expensive human annotated data. Besides, few-shot learning methods are sensitive to noise and language style shifts between training and testing data.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a contrastive co-training framework (CO3) that utilizes unlabeled data to improve performance. It consists of a Rewriter model that generates fully specified queries and a Simplifier model that simplifies queries. The two models provide pseudo-labels on unlabeled data to train each other iteratively. To reduce the impact of noise, a contrastive learning based data augmentation technique is used that brings in randomness and enables distinguishing valuable information.

Main Contributions:
1) A novel co-training paradigm combining a Rewriter and Simplifier based on iterative pseudo-labeling that reduces the need for expensive labeled data.
2) An effective contrastive learning based data augmentation strategy to handle noise by learning common semantic features. 
3) Extensive experiments showing CO3 outperforms state-of-the-art methods under few-shot and zero-shot settings. Analyses demonstrating the superior generalization ability when handling language style shifts.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative co-training approach for low-resource conversational query rewrite. By effectively utilizing unlabeled data and contrastive learning for denoising, it achieves new state-of-the-art while being robust to shifts in language styles.
