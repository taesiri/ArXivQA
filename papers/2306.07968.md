- This paper introduces a new challenging task called Automatic Table Verification (AutoTV) that focuses on verifying numeric data accuracy in tables by cross-referencing cited sources. This is a novel contribution not explored in prior work. 

- The proposed arXiVeri benchmark for AutoTV is unique. While previous table-related tasks have datasets, they focus on table detection and structure recognition within single documents rather than across documents.

- The metrics defined for evaluating table matching and cell matching are tailored to the AutoTV task. Other table analysis works have not needed such specialized evaluation protocols.

- The paper explores simple but effective baselines using large language models like GPT-4. Most prior table analysis research relies on traditional computer vision or NLP techniques rather than modern large models.

- The findings reveal even powerful models like GPT-4 struggle with AutoTV, highlighting it as an open challenge. This contrasts with other table tasks where deep learning models now achieve strong results.

- The focus on scientific documents and precise numeric data transfer is a distinct emphasis not shared by other table analysis works that operate on more general documents.

In summary, this paper pioneers the AutoTV task and creates a new benchmark to facilitate research. The proposed techniques and experiments underscore the complexity of the problem. It clearly outlines an open research direction separate from existing table analysis literature.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new task called Automatic Table Verification (AutoTV) to verify the accuracy of numerical data in tables by cross-referencing cited sources. To support this task, the authors introduce a new benchmark dataset called arXiVeri, which contains tabular data extracted from academic papers on arXiv. The benchmark is designed to evaluate performance on two key sub-tasks: table matching, which involves identifying the source table in a cited document that matches a given target table, and cell matching, which aims to locate cells with identical values and meanings across the target and source tables. 

To provide baselines for the AutoTV task, the authors leverage large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. For table matching, they use text embedding models to compute similarity scores between target and candidate source tables. For cell matching, they employ GPT-4 to generate matches between target and source cells based on semantic meaning. The results demonstrate the complexity of AutoTV, even for advanced LLMs, highlighting the need for further research. Through the new task and benchmark, the paper enables future work on ensuring data accuracy in scientific documents via automatic table verification.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key focus of this paper is introducing a new task called Automatic Table Verification (AutoTV) to address the issue of ensuring accuracy of numerical data copied between scientific papers. 

Specifically, the paper proposes that researchers often manually copy numerical results from one paper's tables into their own work to enable comparisons. However, this copying process is prone to human error, which can affect the conclusions drawn from any comparative analysis.

To tackle this, the paper puts forth the AutoTV task. The goal is to automatically verify the accuracy of numerical data in tables by cross-referencing the original cited sources. 

The paper frames AutoTV as having two sub-tasks:

1. Table matching: Identifying which table in a cited paper matches the table being referenced in the new paper.

2. Cell matching: Pinpointing which cells contain identical numerical data between the matched tables and locating them via their row and column indices.

Overall, the key problem is ensuring fidelity and accuracy when transferring numerical data from one scientific paper to another. The proposed AutoTV task aims to automate this verification process to prevent human errors from going unchecked.
