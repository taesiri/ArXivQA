# [arXiVeri: Automatic table verification with GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07968)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we automatically verify the accuracy of numerical data contained in tables in academic papers by cross-referencing the cited sources?The key hypothesis seems to be:By leveraging large language models, it is possible to develop methods for automatic table verification that can accurately match tables across documents and identify corresponding cells containing the same data.To summarize, the main goal of the paper is to introduce a new task called Automatic Table Verification (AutoTV) that aims to verify numerical table data by comparing it to referenced sources. The central hypothesis is that large language models can be applied to this problem to perform table matching across documents and identify matching cells, despite challenges like varying data presentation. The paper proposes a benchmark dataset, metrics, and baselines to facilitate research on this task.Does this summarize the core research question and hypothesis accurately? Let me know if you need any clarification on my interpretation.
