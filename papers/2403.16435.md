## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Passage reranking is an important component in information retrieval systems. It serves as a second-stage that refines and reranks the retrieval results from the first-stage retrieval models to improve accuracy. Recent approaches rely on extensive training with query-passage relevance labels or retrieval-specific instructions, limiting their applicability. There is a need for an effective unsupervised passage reranking method that does not require labeled data.

Method:
The paper proposes an instruction-based unsupervised passage reranking method called InstUPR. It utilizes the instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to estimate the relevance between a query and a passage. Specifically, it instructs the LLM to predict a 1-5 Likert score reflecting the relevance. To obtain robust score estimates, the paper introduces a soft aggregation technique that aggregates the LLM's predicted probability distribution over possible scores. Furthermore, the method employs pairwise reranking between passages to refine the rankings.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes InstUPR, a novel unsupervised passage reranking method using instruction-tuned LLMs without needing any labeled data or model fine-tuning.
2) Introduces a soft score aggregation technique for robustly combining an LLM's predictions.
3) Employs and evaluates both pointwise and pairwise reranking schemes based on the framework.
4) Experiments demonstrate InstUPR outperforms previous unsupervised methods and achieves comparable performance to supervised state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets.

In summary, the paper presents an effective unsupervised passage reranking framework using LLMs that does not require any labeled relevance data. Both the instruction-based scoring and aggregation provide improvements over prior arts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces InstUPR, an unsupervised passage reranking method that leverages the instruction-following capabilities of large language models to rank retrieved passages by relevance without needing any additional training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution of this work can be summarized in three key points:

1. The authors propose \instupr, which is an instruction-based unsupervised passage reranking method that leverages the instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for reranking without needing any labeled relevance data or additional fine-tuning. 

2. They introduce a soft relevance score aggregation technique to compute a weighted sum of the LLM's predicted score distribution, aiming to produce more robust score estimates.

3. They propose and evaluate both pointwise and pairwise reranking schemes within their framework, demonstrating their effectiveness compared to unsupervised baselines and supervised models fine-tuned on retrieval tasks. 

In summary, the key contribution is an unsupervised passage reranking method that can leverage recent advances in instruction-tuned LLMs to achieve strong performance without needing relevance annotations or retrieval-specific fine-tuning. The introduced score aggregation and comparison of ranking schemes also aim to push forward research in unsupervised dense retrieval.
