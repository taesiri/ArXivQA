# How convolutional neural network see the world - A survey of   convolutional neural network visualization methods

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to interpret and visualize the internal representations learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The paper provides a comprehensive survey of methods for CNN visualization and interpretation.Some key points:- CNNs have achieved impressive performance on computer vision tasks, but their internal representations are hard to interpret. Visualization can help make these representations more interpretable.- The paper reviews four main approaches for CNN visualization:1) Activation Maximization: Synthesizes input images that maximize the activation of individual neurons to illustrate their preferred stimuli.2) Deconvolutional Networks: Projects activations back to the input pixel space to show which input patterns lead to high activation. 3) Network Inversion: Reconstructs approximate images from layer activations to show the information retained at each layer.4) Network Dissection: Quantifies the alignment between individual neurons and a set of semantic concepts to assign semantic meanings.- Visualization provides insight into the learned representations and can help with tasks like network debugging, architecture design, monitoring training, and more.So in summary, the main research question is how to interpret CNN representations through visualization techniques, with a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art approaches. The visualization methods aim to make CNNs more transparent and interpretable.

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:This paper provides a comprehensive survey of several representative convolutional neural network (CNN) visualization methods, including Activation Maximization, Network Inversion, Deconvolutional Neural Networks, and Network Dissection, in order to interpret what features are learned inside CNNs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper provides a comprehensive review and comparison of several key methods for visualizing and interpreting convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Here are some ways this survey paper relates to other work in CNN visualization:- It focuses on categorizing and explaining major visualization techniques, including activation maximization, deconvolutional networks, network inversion, and network dissection. Many other papers introduce or apply just one of these methods. - The paper aims to give a broad overview of the motivations, algorithms, and results for each visualization approach. Other works tend to provide more technical details or focus on a new proposed technique.- It summarizes and contextualizes a wide span of research from the past decade on CNN visualization. Many papers cover just a subset of methods or a narrow time period. - The survey highlights connections between visualization and broader goals like network optimization and adversarial robustness. Other works are more narrowly focused on the visualization itself.- It attempts to provide a unified view of how different methods provide insights into the CNN from different perspectives (individual neurons, whole layers, etc). Many papers analyze visualization techniques in isolation.Overall, this survey gives a high-level synthesis of the landscape of CNN visualization research, in terms of the techniques, their capabilities, and their applications. It stands out for its comprehensive treatment of the motivations and outcomes of prominent visualization methods applied to modern CNNs.
