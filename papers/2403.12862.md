# [Epistemology of Language Models: Do Language Models Have Holistic   Knowledge?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12862)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit characteristics consistent with the philosophy of epistemological holism - specifically, whether they possess "core knowledge" that is more difficult to revise, acting as a foundation for their wider belief system. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors create a scientific reasoning dataset based on the WorldTree corpus to evaluate LLMs' responses when their core knowledge is contradicted. They assess this through 3 tasks:

1. Abduction - LLMs must choose between negating a core scientific fact or providing an alternative peripheral explanation for an observation. 
2. Revision - LLMs must choose whether to modify a core scientific fact or a statement denying auxiliary conditions to explain an observation.  
3. Argument Generation - LLMs must provide a conclusion explaining an observation that either negates or maintains a core scientific hypothesis.

Main Contributions:

- LLMs adeptly provide abductive explanations without altering core facts, suggesting proficiency in navigating knowledge to explain observations.
- In revision/argument generation, LLMs frequently directly negate core knowledge, exhibiting less reluctance to modify core beliefs.
- Results indicate partial rather than fully comprehensive adherence of LLMs to principles of epistemological holism.
- Extent of holistic knowledge processing appears context-dependent in LLMs rather than consistently applied across reasoning challenges.

In summary, the paper provides an assessment of epistemological characteristics of LLMs, revealing their capabilities and limitations in managing core factual knowledge in a manner consistent with the tenets of holistic belief systems. Findings contribute to open questions around organizational principles of knowledge in large language models.
