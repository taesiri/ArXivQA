# [DSP: Dynamic Sequence Parallelism for Multi-Dimensional Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10266)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Scaling large neural network models with long input sequences is crucial for applications like language generation, video generation, and multimodal tasks. However, long sequences lead to high memory costs and slow processing.
- Existing sequence parallelism methods like Megatron-SP and DeepSpeed-Ulysses assume a single sequence dimension. They fail to adapt to multi-dimensional transformers that perform attention across multiple dimensions like spatial, temporal, etc.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Dynamic Sequence Parallelism (DSP), a novel approach to enable efficient sequence parallelism for multi-dimensional transformers. 
- The key idea is to dynamically switch the parallelism dimension during training according to the current computation stage, leveraging the separate spatial, temporal, or other dimensions.

- DSP minimizes communication overhead by using only two AlltoAll communication operations per transformer block, reducing volume by 75% over other methods.

- It also combines with ZeRO parameter partitioning to reduce memory footprint.

Key Contributions:
- DSP achieves 42-217% higher end-to-end throughput over prior sequence parallelism methods like DeepSpeed-Ulysses.
- It reduces communication volume by at least 75% compared to alternatives.
- Supports large models, long sequences, various attention types, and requires minimal code changes for ease of use.
- Enables scaling of multi-dimensional transformers for video, language, proteins, etc. with improved parallel efficiency.

In summary, the paper introduces Dynamic Sequence Parallelism to overcome limitations of existing methods and efficiently parallelize multi-dimensional transformers by dynamically switching the distributed dimension based on computation stage.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Dynamic Sequence Parallelism (DSP), a novel method to efficiently scale multi-dimensional transformers for processing long sequences. Specifically:

1) DSP scales long sequences with minimal communication cost by utilizing the potential characteristics of multi-dimensional transformers and dynamically switching the parallelism dimension according to the current attention dimension. 

2) DSP improves end-to-end throughput by 42.0% to 216.8% and reduces communication volume by at least 75% compared to state-of-the-art sequence parallelism methods.
