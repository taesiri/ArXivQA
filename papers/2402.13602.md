# [Hybrid Reasoning Based on Large Language Models for Autonomous Car   Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13602)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates how well Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform hybrid reasoning, specifically a combination of arithmetic and commonsense reasoning, to assist in decision-making for autonomous driving. Autonomous vehicles face challenges in unfamiliar and complex situations that require advanced reasoning abilities. While rule-based and reinforcement learning approaches have limitations, the paper explores whether LLMs could provide complementary capabilities to improve decisions.

Methodology:
The authors developed 9 scenarios in the CARLA simulator under varying weather conditions. They feed real-time sensor data and detected objects from YOLOv8 as inputs to the LLM. The LLM outputs precise brake/throttle values over 5 seconds to control the ego vehicle, based on understanding the scene, physical laws and mathematical calculations.

Results: 
The LLM demonstrated the ability to adapt reasoning - from commonsense to mathematical formulations to a combination, providing increasingly accurate control values. Evaluated against human ground truth, hybrid reasoning achieved over 65% accuracy on average, outperforming purely commonsense or arithmetic approaches. This shows LLMs can analyze multifaceted inputs to make informed decisions for autonomous driving assistance.

Contributions:
- Showcased LLMs' effectiveness in hybrid reasoning for vehicle control, calculating precise parameters based on complex, real-time data
- Demonstrated value of LLMs to complement autonomous driving systems, particularly in adverse weather conditions
- Developed prompting methodology and evaluation framework that combines computer vision, simulation and NLP to assess reasoning abilities.

The paper makes an important contribution in exploring how LLMs can be leveraged to enhance decision-making for autonomous vehicles using a mix of modalities. The results show promise for LLMs to provide a backup layer of intelligence to handle unfamiliar and edge cases.
