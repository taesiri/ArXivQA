# [Causal Fairness under Unobserved Confounding: A Neural Sensitivity   Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18460)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework for ensuring causal fairness of machine learning predictions in the presence of unobserved confounding. The authors first derive theoretical bounds on common causal fairness metrics like the counterfactual direct effect (Ctf-DE) under different sources of unobserved confounding. Leveraging these bounds, they then develop a neural prediction framework that provides worst-case guarantees regarding the extent to which causal fairness can be violated due to unobserved confounding. Specifically, their method involves training a predictor subject to user-defined fairness constraints on the derived bounds, effectively limiting the worst-case bias. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in restricting causal unfairness compared to standard and na√Øve baselines. A key benefit of their framework is the ability to perform sensitivity analysis regarding the robustness of predictions to unobserved confounding in critical applications. Overall, this work makes important theoretical and practical contributions towards ensuring the fairness of machine learning models under misspecified causal assumptions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a neural sensitivity framework to analyze the robustness of causal fairness metrics under different sources of unobserved confounding, derive fairness bounds to examine model sensitivity, and develop a method to train fair machine learning models that provide worst-case guarantees on the degree of causal fairness violations due to unobserved confounding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It derives bounds for causal fairness metrics under different sources of unobserved confounding. These bounds serve as a refutation strategy to help practitioners examine the sensitivity of machine learning models to unobserved confounding in fairness-critical applications. 

2. It develops a novel neural prediction framework which offers worst-case guarantees for the extent to which causal fairness may be violated due to unobserved confounding. 

3. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in experiments, including on a real-world case study for predicting prison sentences. 

In summary, this is the first work to study causal fairness under unobserved confounding. It provides a practical framework to ensure the fairness of predictions by accounting for potential violations of causal fairness assumptions due to unobserved confounding. The key novelty is bounding and guaranteeing fairness notions that are otherwise unidentifiable.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Causal fairness - Ensuring fairness by blocking unfair causal pathways between sensitive attributes and outcomes. The paper focuses specifically on path-specific causal fairness effects like counterfactual direct effect (Ctf-DE), counterfactual indirect effect (Ctf-IE), and counterfactual spurious effect (Ctf-SE).  

- Unobserved confounding - When important causal variables are unobserved or missing from the data, leading to biased estimates of causal effects. The paper allows for different types of unobserved confounding.

- Bounds - Deriving upper and lower bounds on the path-specific causal fairness effects under unobserved confounding. This allows assessing the sensitivity and robustness to missing confounders.  

- Neural prediction framework - Proposing a method to train neural network predictors that are robust and fair even under unobserved confounding by optimizing an objective based on the derived bounds.

- Sensitivity analysis - Analyzing how causal inferences change under different assumptions about the magnitude of unobserved confounding. The paper employs causal sensitivity models like the generalized marginal sensitivity model (GMSM).

- Identification - Moving from point identification of causal effects to partial identification by deriving bounds under different sensitivity models.

So in summary, key concepts include causal fairness, unobserved confounding, sensitivity analysis, partial identification, and robust training of fair predictors.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed framework for deriving bounds on causal fairness metrics under unobserved confounding build upon and extend existing work on causal sensitivity analysis? What modifications were needed to adapt sensitivity analysis tools to the causal fairness setting?

2. The paper argues that existing causal fairness methods assume no unobserved confounding, which can lead to severely biased estimates of fairness metrics. Why is accounting for potential unobserved confounding so critical in fairness analyses? In what types of real-world applications might we expect substantial unobserved confounding?  

3. The generalized marginal sensitivity model (GMSM) is used in this work to model unobserved confounding. What are the key benefits of the GMSM compared to other sensitivity models? When might alternative sensitivity models be more appropriate?

4. The framework involves decomposing nested counterfactual expressions of fairness metrics into identifiable and unidentifiable parts. How does the counterfactual unnesting procedure work and how was the unnesting theory from Correa et al. (2021) extended?   

5. Walk through the detailed derivations involved in bounding each of the three path-specific causal fairness effects (DE, IE, SE). What assumptions were made and what are the limitations?

6. How exactly does the proposed neural prediction framework optimize for both prediction accuracy and robustness of fairness metrics to unobserved confounding? Explain both the constraint optimization problem and the training procedure.

7. What are some practical considerations in selecting the sensitivity parameters in real applications where knowledge of unobserved confounding may be limited? How useful are the bounds when sensitivity parameters are unknown?

8. The method assumes discrete covariates and sensitive attributes. What are some potential ways to extend the approach to handle continuous variables? What are the main challenges involved?  

9. How well did the method perform in the synthetic and real-world experiments? What were the key limitations and areas for improvement observed?

10. This paper focused on causal fairness notions. How might the sensitivity analysis approach be extended to bound other causal effects or fairness metrics? What modifications would be required?
