# [DiffusionPhase: Motion Diffusion in Frequency Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04036)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for generating high-quality, diverse, and arbitrarily long human motion sequences from text descriptions. The key idea is to map motions into a learned compact periodic phase space that captures the inherent local periodicity of motions over time and across body joints. This periodic representation allows smooth concatenation and repetition of motions for generating seamless transitions and arbitrary lengths. Specifically, the method consists of: (1) an encoder-decoder network to transform motions into a parameterized frequency domain and back; (2) a periodicity-based data augmentation technique to increase training data diversity; and (3) a conditional diffusion model that takes in text prompts and start poses to predict periodic phase parameters for motion generation. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, especially for generating longer motion sequences. The compact latent space also allows efficient sampling of arbitrary length motions. Key advantages are the ability to generate smooth natural transitions between motions, high motion quality maintained over longer sequence lengths, and efficient sampling.
