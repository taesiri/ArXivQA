# [Robust Mixture-of-Expert Training for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10110)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How to make convolutional neural networks (CNNs) more robust against adversarial attacks when integrated with sparsely-gated mixture of experts (MoE)?

Specifically, the paper investigates whether the standard adversarial training approach used for vanilla CNNs remains effective for CNNs integrated with sparse MoE modules. The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) Adversarial training for MoE-CNNs is non-trivial compared to vanilla CNNs due to the added complexity of the sparsely-gated routing system. 

2) Improving the robustness of the routers alone is not sufficient to robustify the overall MoE-CNN model. The routing decisions need to be robustified in conjunction with the expert CNN pathways.

3) A coupled training approach is needed that enables the routers and expert pathways to co-adapt and make concerted efforts towards improving robustness of the overall MoE-CNN model.

So in summary, the main research question is how to achieve robustness for MoE-integrated CNNs, with the central hypothesis being that this requires a coupled adversarial training approach tailored for the router-expert structure of MoE-CNNs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a new adversarial training framework called AdvMoE for robustifying Mixture of Experts (MoE) convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

- Dissecting the robustness of MoE-CNNs into two dimensions - robustness of the routers (gating functions for expert selection) and robustness of the experts (subnetworks of the CNN backbone). Analyzing how these two components interact during adversarial training.

- Developing a router-expert alternating adversarial training approach based on bi-level optimization to make routers and experts robustify each other in an adaptive fashion. This is in contrast to conventional adversarial training that optimizes the entire model jointly.

- Conducting extensive experiments on 4 CNN architectures over 4 benchmark datasets to demonstrate that the proposed AdvMoE method can improve adversarial robustness over both conventionally trained dense CNNs and MoE-CNNs. AdvMoE also retains the efficiency benefits of sparse MoE models.

In summary, the key innovation seems to be proposing a new adversarial training protocol tailored for MoE-CNNs by decomposing the model into routers and experts and alternately training them to achieve better robustness than standard adversarial training methods. The router-expert interaction analysis and bi-level optimization framework for robustness appear to be the main technical novelties.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key comparisons of this paper to other related work in the field of adversarial training for convolutional neural networks (CNNs):

- This paper focuses specifically on adversarial training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based CNNs. Most prior work has focused on standard CNN architectures without MoE components. This paper provides new insights into the challenges of making MoE-CNNs robust against adversarial attacks.

- The paper shows that standard adversarial training methods like TRADES are not very effective for MoE-CNNs. The routers and experts in MoE-CNNs seem to require specialized treatment to achieve robustness. This is an important finding as it suggests adversarial training needs to be adapted for novel architectures like MoE-CNNs.

- To address the limitations of standard adversarial training, the paper proposes a new method called AdvMoE that alternately trains the routers and experts in an MoE-CNN. This router-expert alternating training approach is novel and tailored for MoE architectures.

- Through extensive experiments, the paper shows AdvMoE can improve adversarial robustness of MoE-CNNs beyond standard CNNs trained with TRADES. It also retains the efficiency benefits of sparse MoE architectures. This demonstrates the promise of properly adapted adversarial training for advanced models like MoE-CNNs.

- Compared to concurrent work like Puigcerver et al. that studied robustness for ViT-based MoEs, this paper provides a thorough investigation focused on CNN-based MoEs. The insights may generalize across different MoE architectures.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions in adapting adversarial training specifically for MoE-CNNs. The proposed AdvMoE method and analysis of routers/experts shed new light on achieving robustness for efficient MoE architectures. More broadly, it suggests robustness solutions need to be tailored to novel deep learning architectures.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Develop robust training methods for other types of mixture of experts (MoE) models, such as MoE transformers. The current work focuses on convolutional neural network based MoEs, but the authors suggest exploring adversarial training for other types of MoE models as well.

- Improve training efficiency of the proposed adversarial training method. The current alternating optimization approach requires more computation than standard adversarial training. Reducing this training cost while maintaining robustness would be useful.

- Theoretical analysis of the convergence and robustness guarantees for the proposed training method. The current work is empirical but developing formal guarantees would strengthen the approach. 

- Explore other defense strategies and architectures for robust MoE models, beyond adversarial training. This could provide complementary benefits and further enhance robustness.

- Study the interplay between model capacity, efficiency and robustness for MoE models in more depth. The current work provides some analysis but further investigation could yield more insights.

- Extend the robust MoE approach to other tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection, segmentation, etc.

- Consider other threat models beyond $\ell_\infty$ bounded perturbations. Extending the robustness analysis to other perturbation types could broaden applicability.

In summary, the authors point to several promising research avenues, including improving training efficiency, providing theoretical guarantees, exploring alternative defense strategies, studying model capacity effects, and extending the approach to new tasks and threat models. Advancing robust MoE research along these directions can further unlock the benefits of these models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new adversarially robust training method called AdvMoE for convolutional neural networks integrated with sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE-CNNs). MoE-CNNs have demonstrated improved efficiency for inference through input-dependent routing of data through only a subset of model experts. However, the paper finds that standard adversarial training methods are ineffective for robustifying MoE-CNNs, unlike for standard CNNs. The key insight is that the robustness of the routers (which determine expert selection) and the robustness of the predictors (the expert subnetworks) are coupled in complex ways during adversarial training. To address this, the proposed AdvMoE method uses a bi-level optimization approach to alternatingly train the routers and predictors so they can adapt to each other and improve robustness in a concerted fashion. Experiments across diverse datasets and CNN architectures demonstrate AdvMoE can improve adversarial robustness over standard training and other baselines by 1-4% on average. Further, AdvMoE retains the computational efficiency benefits of MoE during inference. The method also shows promise when evaluated on MoE-enhanced vision transformers.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new robust training method for convolutional neural networks with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE-CNN) architectures. MoE-CNNs have shown promise for enabling high accuracy and efficient inference by using a sparse gating mechanism to activate only certain "expert" subnetworks for each input. However, prior work has not explored how to make MoE-CNNs robust to adversarial examples. 

The key contribution is a new adversarial training technique called Adversarial MoE (AdvMoE) that alternates between robustifying the gating functions (routers) and expert subnetworks of an MoE-CNN. Experiments across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate AdvMoE can improve adversarial robustness over standard training and prior adversarial training methods. AdvMoE also retains the computational efficiency benefits of MoE-CNNs, with over 50% cost reduction versus dense models. The results highlight how explicitly modeling and optimizing router-expert robustness interdependence is crucial for defending MoE-CNNs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new adversarial training framework called AdvMoE for robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) integrated with sparsely-gated mixture of experts (MoE). The key idea is to optimize the routers (which determine expert selection) and expert weights (CNN backbone pathways) in an alternating fashion using bi-level optimization. Specifically, the method treats router parameters as lower-level variables and expert weights as upper-level variables. It then alternates between robust training of routers with fixed experts and robust training of experts with fixed routers. This allows routers and experts to adapt to each other during training to improve overall robustness. Compared to directly applying adversarial training on the whole MoE model, the proposed method can achieve higher robust accuracy against adversarial attacks without losing efficiency benefits of the MoE structure. Experiments on multiple CNN architectures and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AdvMoE method.

- To address this issue, the paper proposes a new robust training framework called AdvMoE that alternates between adversarially training the routers and experts. This allows them to adapt to each other and improve robustness in a concerted way.

- Experiments across diverse datasets and CNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of AdvMoE. It improves adversarial robustness over robustly trained vanilla CNNs by 1-4% and reduces inference cost by over 50% due to the sparsity of MoE.

In summary, the key novelty is proposing a specially designed adversarial training method to improve the robustness of MoE-CNN models, while retaining their efficiency benefits. The core idea is the router-expert alternating training scheme.
