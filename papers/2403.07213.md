# [Which LLM to Play? Convergence-Aware Online Model Selection with   Time-Increasing Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07213)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the recent surge in adoption of large language models (LLMs), online model selection has become important to choose the best model among a diverse set while balancing task performance and exploration cost. Organizations face tradeoffs like using a costly API-based LLM versus a locally fine-tuned small LLM. Traditional selection methods often comprehensively evaluate models before choosing, becoming impractical given rising LLM training costs. Also, allocating excessive resources to explore poor models is undesirable. Recent works using online bandits overlook the increasing-then-converging trend in iterative LLM fine-tuning, leading to suboptimal selections.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a time-increasing bandit algorithm called TI-UCB that predicts reward increase from past observations and balances exploration-exploitation. To capture converging points, a change detection mechanism compares consecutive increase predictions using sliding windows. If the difference exceeds a threshold, the reward is considered stable. 

Main Contributions:
- Formulates online LLM selection as a time-increasing bandit problem capturing the increasing-then-converging performance trend during iterative fine-tuning.

- Develops the TI-UCB algorithm that predicts reward increase via linear approximation and detects converging points via change detection between consecutive predictions.

- Proves TI-UCB achieves logarithmic regret bound in a typical increasing bandit setting, implying fast convergence. 

- Empirically validates TI-UCB's advantages in synthetic experiments and real-world model selection tasks for classifiers and LLMs, highlighting the importance of modeling increasing-then-converging rewards.

The work underscores considering iterative LLM fine-tuning trends for efficient and economic model selection, paving the way for LLM deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a time-increasing bandit algorithm, TI-UCB, that effectively predicts the increase and convergence of model performance during iterative training or finetuning to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation for online selection of the best model among multiple candidates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a time-increasing bandit algorithm called TI-UCB for efficient and economic online model selection. Specifically:

1) The paper formulates the online model selection problem as a time-increasing bandit problem that captures the increasing-then-converging trend in model performance as models are iteratively trained or finetuned. 

2) The proposed TI-UCB algorithm can effectively predict the reward increase using a least square estimator and adaptively capture converging points using a sliding-window change detection mechanism.

3) The paper provides a theoretical analysis of TI-UCB, proving it achieves a logarithmic regret upper bound and fast convergence rate in a typical increasing bandit setting. 

4) Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world data for online selection of classification models and large language models. The results validate the advantage of TI-UCB over existing methods by effectively utilizing the increasing-then-converging reward pattern.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a bandit algorithm that capitalizes on the increasing-then-converging model performance trend for more efficient and economic online model selection, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evaluations. The work underscores the importance of considering such reward trends in practical model selection scenarios.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Online model selection
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Exploration-exploitation tradeoff
- Increasing-then-converging pattern
- Time-increasing bandits
- Regret bounds
- Change detection

The paper focuses on the problem of online model selection, especially in the context of selecting among and deploying large language models. A key challenge is balancing the tradeoff between exploration (evaluating different models) and exploitation (choosing the currently best model). 

The authors propose a time-increasing bandit algorithm called TI-UCB that aims to capture the increasing-then-converging pattern of model performance over iterative training or finetuning. The algorithm uses a least square estimator to predict reward increases and a change detection mechanism to identify convergence points.

Theoretical analysis shows TI-UCB achieves a logarithmic regret upper bound, implying fast convergence. Experiments on classification model selection and LLM selection demonstrate empirical advantages over existing approaches.

In summary, the key focus is on efficient and economic model selection that considers increasing-then-converging trends in an online learning setting, especially for selecting and deploying large language models. The proposed TI-UCB algorithm and analysis around time-increasing bandits are central contributions.
