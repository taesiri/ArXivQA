# [Venn: Resource Management Across Federated Learning Jobs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08298)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Venn, a federated learning (FL) resource manager that efficiently schedules ephemeral, heterogeneous edge devices among multiple concurrent FL jobs to minimize their average job completion time (JCT). Venn formulates the intersection resource scheduling (IRS) problem to model the complex resource contention patterns among FL jobs, where the eligible devices for one job may overlap, contain, or be within other jobs' resources. To tackle this, Venn first proposes a contention-aware scheduling algorithm that prioritizes small jobs needing scarce resources to reduce scheduling delay. It then employs a resource-aware device-to-job matching heuristic to minimize response collection time by mitigating stragglers. Through both simulation and testbed evaluation across diverse FL workloads, Venn is shown to improve average JCT by up to 1.88x compared to state-of-the-art solutions. The scheduling and matching components of Venn are demonstrated to provide complementary benefits depending on the workload. Overall, by jointly addressing scheduling delay and response collection time, Venn enables efficient sharing of heterogeneous edge devices among a large number of diverse FL jobs.
