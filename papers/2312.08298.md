# [Venn: Resource Management Across Federated Learning Jobs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08298)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Venn, a federated learning (FL) resource manager that efficiently schedules ephemeral, heterogeneous edge devices among multiple concurrent FL jobs to minimize their average job completion time (JCT). Venn formulates the intersection resource scheduling (IRS) problem to model the complex resource contention patterns among FL jobs, where the eligible devices for one job may overlap, contain, or be within other jobs' resources. To tackle this, Venn first proposes a contention-aware scheduling algorithm that prioritizes small jobs needing scarce resources to reduce scheduling delay. It then employs a resource-aware device-to-job matching heuristic to minimize response collection time by mitigating stragglers. Through both simulation and testbed evaluation across diverse FL workloads, Venn is shown to improve average JCT by up to 1.88x compared to state-of-the-art solutions. The scheduling and matching components of Venn are demonstrated to provide complementary benefits depending on the workload. Overall, by jointly addressing scheduling delay and response collection time, Venn enables efficient sharing of heterogeneous edge devices among a large number of diverse FL jobs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Venn, a federated learning resource manager that efficiently schedules ephemeral, heterogeneous devices among many federated learning jobs to reduce their average job completion time through intelligent scheduling algorithms and device-to-job matching heuristics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing Venn, a federated learning (FL) resource manager that efficiently schedules ephemeral, heterogeneous devices among many FL jobs to reduce their average job completion time (JCT). Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Venn formulates the Intersection Resource Scheduling (IRS) problem to account for the complex resource contention among multiple FL jobs, where the resources one job contends for may overlap, contain, or be within those of other jobs. 

2) To minimize the average JCT, Venn proposes a scheduling algorithm that determines the job order to optimize scheduling delay, and a matching algorithm that assigns devices to jobs to reduce response collection time. Together they jointly optimize both factors that contribute to JCT.

3) Evaluation over various real-world FL workloads shows that compared to state-of-the-art FL resource managers, Venn improves the average JCT by up to 1.88x.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Venn to enable efficient sharing of heterogeneous devices across multiple FL jobs by optimizing scheduling delay and response collection time, which is demonstrated to improve average JCT over existing solutions.
