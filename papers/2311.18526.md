# [HOT: Higher-Order Dynamic Graph Representation Learning with Efficient   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18526)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a new model called HOT (Higher-Order dynamic graph representation learning with efficient Transformers) for dynamic graph representation learning. It enhances recent Transformer-based models like DyGFormer by incorporating higher-order graph structures, specifically k-hop neighbors and subgraphs containing pairs of vertices. This allows encoding more useful information into the temporal dimension, improving the accuracy of dynamic link prediction. However, using higher-order structures inflates memory requirements. To address this, HOT employs recent hierarchical Transformer designs like Block-Recurrent Transformer which divide the attention matrix into blocks and compute attention locally, significantly reducing memory utilization. The authors theoretically analyze the tradeoff enabled by HOT between accuracy and memory. Evaluations on datasets like MOOC, LastFM and CanParl show that HOT outperforms state-of-the-art models like DyGFormer, TGN and GraphMixer on metrics like Average Precision and AUC-ROC for dynamic link prediction, especially when higher-order structures provide value. The generic architecture of HOT also allows straightforward extensions to other dynamic graph ML workloads like node classification.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a dynamic graph representation learning model called HOT that enhances predictions by encoding higher-order graph structures into the attention matrix of a hierarchical Transformer, achieving higher accuracy while reducing memory footprint.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Designing HOT, a model that harnesses higher-order graph structures for more accurate predictions in dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, it encodes k-hop neighbors and more general subgraphs into the attention matrix of the underlying Transformer model.

2) Employing hierarchical Transformers, specifically the Block-Recurrent Transformer, to alleviate the memory requirements imposed by encoding the higher-order structures. This reduces memory footprint while preserving accuracy.

3) Providing a theoretical analysis of HOT's design, formally illustrating the tradeoff between memory requirements and compute costs. 

4) Evaluating HOT and showing it outperforms a wide selection of baselines on datasets like MOOC, LastFM, and CanParl for dynamic link prediction. For example, HOT achieves 9%, 7%, and 15% higher accuracy than DyGFormer, TGN, and GraphMixer respectively on the MOOC dataset.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a novel model called HOT that effectively encodes higher-order structures to improve accuracy for dynamic graph representation learning, while using hierarchical Transformers to reduce the memory overhead.
