# [Leveraging Domain Adaptation and Data Augmentation to Improve Qur'anic   IR in English and Arabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02803)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores state-of-the-art neural information retrieval (IR) methods for improving search relevance from the Holy Qur'an in both English and Arabic. The authors prepare an Islamic corpus and domain-specific language model (LM) for English to compensate for the lack of resources. They propose a data augmentation technique leveraging verse relation references that significantly boosts retrieval models' performance by generating more training data. Comprehensive experiments compare various retrieval models after training on general domain data and subsequent in-domain training. The results demonstrate that both training on a domain-specific LM and the data augmentation method lead to considerable gains across metrics like MRR and NDCG, setting a new state-of-the-art for Qur'anic IR. While English models outperform Arabic equivalents likely due to language complexity differences, transferring successful techniques helps improve Arabic retrieval as well. The best performing model utilizes the ColBERT architecture that captures fine-grained query-document interactions. Overall, the work provides valuable insights on preparing retrieval models for sacred religious texts across languages.
