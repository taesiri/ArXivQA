# [Decoupling Human and Camera Motion from Videos in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12827)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question that this paper addresses is:

How can we recover the global 3D trajectories of people from videos captured with uncontrolled, moving cameras?

The key ideas and contributions are:

- A method called SLAHMR to reconstruct the global 3D motion trajectories of people from monocular videos captured with uncontrolled, dynamic cameras. This enables recovering the original trajectories of people in the world coordinate frame, rather than just their apparent motion in the camera view.

- Leveraging relative camera motion estimated from scene parallax to help resolve the scale ambiguity and constrain the global human motion. This allows the method to work on regular monocular videos without needing full 3D scene reconstructions.

- Combining the relative camera motion with learned human motion priors to further refine the trajectories and handle missing observations. The priors help constrain plausible human motions.

- Demonstrating the approach on challenging in-the-wild videos from PoseTrack and a new egocentric video dataset EgoBody. The method achieves significantly improved trajectory reconstruction compared to prior state-of-the-art.

- Showing a downstream application of improving multi-person 3D tracking by integrating the recovered camera motion. This highlights the benefits of reasoned global human trajectories.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that by combining relative camera motion cues with learned human motion priors, they can recover full 3D global trajectories of people from regular monocular videos, without needing expensive capture setups, multiple cameras, or complete scene 3D reconstructions. The experiments on challenging in-the-wild video datasets support this hypothesis.
