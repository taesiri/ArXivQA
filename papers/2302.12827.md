# [Decoupling Human and Camera Motion from Videos in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12827)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question that this paper addresses is:

How can we recover the global 3D trajectories of people from videos captured with uncontrolled, moving cameras?

The key ideas and contributions are:

- A method called SLAHMR to reconstruct the global 3D motion trajectories of people from monocular videos captured with uncontrolled, dynamic cameras. This enables recovering the original trajectories of people in the world coordinate frame, rather than just their apparent motion in the camera view.

- Leveraging relative camera motion estimated from scene parallax to help resolve the scale ambiguity and constrain the global human motion. This allows the method to work on regular monocular videos without needing full 3D scene reconstructions.

- Combining the relative camera motion with learned human motion priors to further refine the trajectories and handle missing observations. The priors help constrain plausible human motions.

- Demonstrating the approach on challenging in-the-wild videos from PoseTrack and a new egocentric video dataset EgoBody. The method achieves significantly improved trajectory reconstruction compared to prior state-of-the-art.

- Showing a downstream application of improving multi-person 3D tracking by integrating the recovered camera motion. This highlights the benefits of reasoned global human trajectories.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that by combining relative camera motion cues with learned human motion priors, they can recover full 3D global trajectories of people from regular monocular videos, without needing expensive capture setups, multiple cameras, or complete scene 3D reconstructions. The experiments on challenging in-the-wild video datasets support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is a method to reconstruct global human trajectories from videos captured with moving cameras. The key ideas are:

- Leveraging relative camera motion estimates from scene pixel motion to initialize human and camera trajectories in a shared world coordinate frame. This allows decoupling of camera and human motion.

- Optimizing the initialized trajectories along with a learned human motion prior to obtain plausible global human trajectories that are consistent with both the image observations and typical human motions. 

- Jointly optimizing for multiple people in the scene allows their motions to constrain the global scale and improve each other's trajectories.

- The recovered global human trajectories and scaled camera motion improve performance on downstream tasks like tracking.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach to recover full 3D human motion trajectories from monocular videos captured with uncontrolled moving cameras. This enables reasoning about human actions and interactions in real-world settings where multi-view capture systems are not available. The method combines geometric principles with data-driven human motion priors for robust performance on challenging in-the-wild videos.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes SLAHMR, a method to simultaneously recover the global trajectories of multiple people and cameras from monocular videos in the wild by combining geometric insights about relative camera motion from scene structure with learned human motion priors to resolve scale ambiguity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in 3D human pose and motion estimation from video:

- The key novelty of this paper is in explicitly modeling the camera motion to recover global human trajectories from in-the-wild videos with moving cameras. Most prior work focuses on scenarios with static cameras or controlled capture settings. Modeling the camera motion allows the authors to decouple the human and camera motion and place people in a shared world coordinate frame.

- This is one of the first papers to show convincing results on recovering full 3D human trajectories on very challenging in-the-wild datasets like PoseTrack. Prior methods like GLAMR struggle on such datasets as they rely solely on local pose transitions without considering camera motion. 

- The idea of using geometric cues from scene motion along with learned human motion priors is novel. The authors show you can get reliable camera motion estimates even when scene geometry is ambiguous by combining it with strong human motion priors.

- For evaluation, the paper makes use of the recently introduced EgoBody dataset which provides ground truth 3D poses for in-the-wild videos. Quantitative experiments on EgoBody demonstrate significant improvements over prior state-of-the-art.

- The method is also shown to improve state-of-the-art performance on the PoseTrack dataset when used to provide camera motion information for tracking. This demonstrates the practical utility of the approach on downstream tasks.

- The approach has some limitations such as reliance on off-the-shelf components for detection and camera estimation. Modeling camera and human motion jointly could be an interesting avenue for future work.

Overall, this paper pushes the boundary on monocular 3D human pose estimation to very challenging in-the-wild videos. The novel ideas combine geometric and learning based techniques in an elegant optimization framework to recover convincing global human trajectories.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Improving the camera motion estimation by jointly optimizing the human motion, camera motion, and 3D scene structure. Currently, they rely on existing SLAM methods for camera estimation, which can fail for certain camera motions like pure rotation. Jointly optimizing all components could address cases where SLAM struggles.

- Incorporating identity/tracklet association into the optimization framework, rather than just using off-the-shelf tracking. This could help resolve identity switches and occlusion cases.

- Adding priors on background scale, using monocular depth estimation methods. This could help resolve scale ambiguity in challenging cases like co-linear human and camera motion.

- Extending the framework to handle non-periodic motions like interactions between people, by using more complex learned motion priors. Currently they use a cyclic motion prior which works well for periodic actions.

- Exploring self-supervision techniques to train motion priors directly on in-the-wild video data, reducing the domain gap from mocap data.

- Developing better model-based tracking systems by integrating the optimized scales and cameras proposed in this work. They demonstrate improved tracking performance by simply providing camera scale, but more robust integration could further improve tracking.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the camera motion estimation, handling complex scenes with multiple people, expanding the motion priors to more actions, and better integration into downstream tasks like tracking. The key is joint optimization of all scene components like humans, cameras, background, and incorporating more priors to resolve ambiguities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a method called SLAHMR for simultaneously localizing and reconstructing the 3D human mesh and motion trajectories from monocular videos in the wild. The key idea is to decouple the camera motion from the human motion by combining geometric insights and learned human motion priors. Specifically, the method first estimates the relative camera motion between frames using a SLAM system and detects people's identities and poses using a 3D human tracker. These estimates are used to initialize the trajectories of the humans and camera in a shared world coordinate frame. Then an optimization is performed over multiple stages to refine the trajectories to be consistent with both the 2D observations in the video and learned priors about plausible human motions, while also estimating the scale ambiguity between the camera and human motions. This allows for reconstructing the global 3D trajectories of people from challenging uncontrolled monocular videos. The method is evaluated on the EgoBody dataset where it outperforms prior state-of-the-art, and on the PoseTrack dataset where it demonstrates more robust tracking results by reasoning jointly about the people and camera motions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to reconstruct the global 3D human trajectories from monocular videos captured with moving cameras. The key insight is to leverage the relative camera motion estimated from the background pixels to help resolve the ambiguity between the human motion and camera motion. Specifically, the method first uses an off-the-shelf SLAM system to estimate the relative camera motion between frames. It also detects people and estimates their 3D poses independently in each frame. These initial estimates of human poses and camera motions are used to initialize an optimization that solves for the global scale of the camera motion as well as the global trajectories of all people in a shared world coordinate system. The optimization incorporates data-driven human motion priors to constrain the human motion and disambiguate it from the camera motion.

The method is evaluated on the EgoBody dataset of ego-centric videos as well as the in-the-wild PoseTrack dataset. The experiments demonstrate that explicitly modeling the camera motion enables more accurate recovery of global human trajectories compared to prior work. The estimated camera motion also improves performance on downstream tasks like tracking. Overall, the proposed approach effectively handles challenges of monocular reconstruction like scale ambiguity and recovers plausible global human motions from complex in-the-wild videos. The ability to do this without external sensors or controlled capture opens up new possibilities for understanding humans in the wild.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called SLAHMR (Simultaneous Localization And Human Mesh Recovery) to reconstruct the global 3D trajectories of people from monocular videos captured with moving cameras in unconstrained environments. The method combines geometric insights with learned human motion priors. It first estimates the relative camera motion between frames using a SLAM system and the identities and 3D poses of people using a human pose tracker. These estimates are used to initialize the trajectories of people and cameras in a shared world coordinate frame. The method then jointly optimizes over these trajectories and a scale factor relating camera and human motion to be consistent with 2D observations from the video and a learned data-driven human motion prior that constrains plausible human displacements. This allows resolving the scale ambiguity and recovering the global trajectories. The optimization is done incrementally over chunks of the video using a transition-based human motion prior. The resulting scaled camera motion and global human trajectories are shown to outperform prior methods on datasets with ground truth.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of recovering the global 3D trajectories of people from monocular videos captured with uncontrolled moving cameras. The key challenges are:

- When a camera moves while filming people, the motion of people in the 2D image plane is a combination of both the camera motion and the actual 3D motion of people. Existing methods that only look at the 2D motion cannot recover the true 3D trajectories. 

- Recovering the global 3D motion requires estimating the scale of translation between the camera and people. This is a challenging ambiguous problem from monocular videos.

- Videos captured in the wild often do not have good scene geometry that can be reconstructed to provide the scale. They may also contain complex motions of multiple people interacting.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a method that:

- Leverages relative camera motion estimated from static scene pixels to constrain the camera motion.

- Uses learned human motion priors to constrain the plausible displacement of people and resolve the scale ambiguity. 

- Jointly optimizes over camera scale and trajectories of all people to be consistent with scene motion and human motion priors.

- Demonstrates results on challenging in-the-wild videos with moving cameras and multiple people, where prior global reconstruction methods struggle.

In summary, the key contribution is a method to recover global 3D trajectories of multiple people from monocular in-the-wild videos by combining geometric constraints and learned human motion priors. This enables reconstructing the spatial relationships between people, which is useful for downstream tasks.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points of the paper:

This paper presents SLAHMR, a method for recovering the global 3D trajectories of people from monocular video captured with uncontrolled camera motion. The key insight is to leverage the complementary signals from human motion priors and relative camera motion estimated from scene pixels. Since the observed 2D motion of people in videos is a combination of their actual 3D motion and the camera motion, modeling the camera movement is critical to recover the original trajectories of people in a shared world coordinate frame. The authors use a SLAM system to estimate the relative camera motion which provides constraints on the scale ambiguity. They combine this with a learned human motion prior that constrains the space of physically plausible motions. Through joint optimization, they determine the scale factor between camera and human motion and recover full trajectories of all people. Experiments on in-the-wild datasets like Egobody and PoseTrack demonstrate significant improvement over prior state-of-the-art. A tracking experiment also shows benefit from the recovered camera scale. This approach unlocks the ability to reconstruct global human motions from challenging monocular video where previous scene reconstruction and multicamera methods fail.

This paper presents SLAHMR, a method to reconstruct the global 3D trajectories of people from monocular videos captured with moving cameras. The key idea is to decouple the camera motion from the human motion by combining geometric insights with learned human motion priors. Specifically, the method first estimates the relative camera motion between frames using structure-from-motion. It also detects people and estimates their local 3D poses per frame. These estimates are used to initialize the global trajectories of the people and camera using a scale factor. The scale factor and trajectories are then optimized based on consistency with 2D observations, smoothness of pose transitions, and a learned human motion prior that captures realistic pose transitions. Experiments on the EgoBody and PoseTrack datasets demonstrate that explicitly modeling the camera motion allows recovering more accurate and smooth global human trajectories compared to prior state-of-the-art. The recovered camera motion also improves tracking performance when integrated into an existing 3D tracking system.
