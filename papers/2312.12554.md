# [Rectangle Search: An Anytime Beam Search (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12554)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Rectangle Search: An Anytime Beam Search":

Problem:
- Heuristic search algorithms are often used to find solutions to problems where finding the optimal solution is computationally infeasible. 
- Anytime algorithms quickly find an initial, potentially suboptimal solution, and then continuously improve the solution quality over time.
- Most existing anytime algorithms are based on best-first search, but best-first search can struggle with problems that have large "local minima" that mislead the heuristic evaluation function.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new anytime algorithm called "rectangle search" based on beam search rather than best-first search. 
- Rectangle search incrementally widens and deepens the search beam, exploring alternatives at all depth levels. This allows it to escape local minima by reconsidering previous decisions.
- The beam exploration resembles a rectangle - hence the name. The algorithm has a parameter "aspect" that controls how rapidly the depth increases.
- Rectangle search does not need to expand nodes in heuristic order and can thus avoid getting stuck in local minima that mislead the heuristic.

Contributions:
- Introduction of a new anytime search algorithm architecture based on beam search rather than best-first search
- Rectangle search algorithm that incrementally widens and deepens the search beam
- Experimental evaluation showing rectangle search matches or outperforms previous anytime algorithms on several standard benchmark domains
- Analysis showing rectangle search performs well on problems with large local minima that are challenging for best-first search methods
- Demonstration that rectangle search can replace fixed-width beam search, while also improving solutions over time

In summary, the paper introduces a new anytime search algorithm called rectangle search that explores alternatives at all depths based on beam search. Experiments show this approach is competitive or superior to prior algorithms and well-suited to problems with misleading heuristics.
