# [Guided Generation of Cause and Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09846)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question seems to be: 

How can we develop an approach to generate diverse, high-quality, and naturalistic causal sentences (expressing possible causes and effects) for a given textual input, by leveraging large-scale causal knowledge extracted from text?

The central hypothesis appears to be that:

- By mining a large corpus of web text, we can extract a massive set of cause-effect sentence pairs (CausalBank) and a lexical causal knowledge graph (Cause Effect Graph). 

- These resources can then be used to train neural conditional text generation models with constrained decoding, to produce varied and plausible causal explanations for arbitrary textual events.

- The diversity and quality of generated causal sentences can be improved by using disjunctive positive lexical constraints during decoding, forcing the model to include morphological variants of causal concepts from the knowledge graph.

So in summary, the key idea is using large-scale causal corpora for acquiring open-domain causal knowledge, which is then utilized to guide conditional text generation via constrained decoding, achieving high-quality and diverse causal sentence production.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing the task of open causal generation: generating multiple plausible causes and effects for any free-form textual event.

2. Construction of a large-scale causal corpus (CausalBank) containing 314 million cause-effect pairs extracted from web text.

3. An extension to lexically-constrained decoding to support disjunctive positive constraints, allowing generation of outputs containing morphological variants of constrained words. 

4. Models for generating causes and effects conditioned on an input sentence, trained on the CausalBank corpus and decoded with disjunctive constraints. 

5. Evaluations showing the approach can generate high-quality and diverse causes and effects based on human assessment. 

6. Demonstrating the usefulness of CausalBank by using it to improve performance of a causal reasoning model on the COPA benchmark simply via continued pre-training.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be the proposal of open causal generation, the creation of resources to support this task, and showing the feasibility of the approach via models trained on this data and evaluated automatically and by humans.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to prior work in causal knowledge acquisition and conditional text generation:

- The paper proposes a new task of open-ended generation of causes and effects for free-form textual input. This differs from most prior work that focuses on extracting causal relations from text or generating simple if-then statements. 

- The paper introduces a large-scale causal corpus called CausalBank, containing 314 million cause-effect pairs extracted from Common Crawl. This is much larger than other existing sentential causal corpora like PDTB, BECauSE, CaTeRS, etc.

- The paper trains neural conditional generation models using this new causal corpus. Most prior work has relied on knowledge graphs or rule-based methods for acquiring causal knowledge. Using deep learning on a large corpus is a comparatively new approach.

- The paper extends lexically constrained decoding to support disjunctive constraints, allowing generation of diverse outputs. This modification to beam search allows better exploration of the output space compared to standard decoding.

- The paper shows the value of their causal corpus by using it to improve performance on the COPA causal reasoning benchmark via continued pretraining of BERT. This demonstrates the corpus contains useful causal knowledge.

- The size and recall of the extracted causal knowledge is likely higher than resources relying on manual annotation. But it may suffer from reporting bias issues of a purely extracted resource.

Overall, the key novelties are the task formulation, large causal corpus, neural generation approach with constrained decoding, and demonstrations of usefulness on human evaluation and COPA. The work brings recent advances in neural text generation to bear on the problem of open-ended acquisition of causal knowledge.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the quality and diversity of generated causes and effects further through more advanced constrained decoding techniques or refinement of the causal patterns used for extracting CausalBank.

- Incorporating implicit causal relations into the framework in addition to the explicit relations currently used. This could expand the coverage of causal knowledge acquired.

- Exploring the use of trained span extraction models to identify more precise cause and effect segments from sentences, rather than treating the entire clauses on either side of causal patterns as causes/effects. 

- Expanding the text genres covered in CausalBank beyond the Common Crawl web text corpus, to reduce potential reporting bias.

- Applying the CausalBERT model to additional causal reasoning tasks beyond COPA, to further demonstrate its utility.

- Leveraging the generated causal sentences for other applications like story generation, question answering, conversational agents, etc.

- Improving run-time efficiency of the disjunctive positive constraints decoding to support more constraint candidates.

- Trying disjunctive constraints for objectives beyond lexical diversity, like generating outputs containing synonyms or different subword segmentations.

In summary, there are many opportunities to build on this work to both improve the core causal generation capability and apply the models and resources to broadly advance causal reasoning and natural language generation systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework for guided generation of plausible causes and effects for a given textual input sentence. The key components of the framework are: 1) CausalBank, a large corpus of 314 million cause-effect sentence pairs mined from CommonCrawl data using causal discourse patterns; 2) Cause Effect Graph, a lexical graph of causal term relations extracted from CommonCrawl; 3) Transformer encoder-decoder models trained on CausalBank to generate causes and effects using disjunctive positive constraint decoding - an extension of prior work in lexically constrained decoding that allows requiring only one of a set of possible words. Human evaluation shows the approach generates higher quality and more diverse outputs compared to baselines. Experiments also show continued pretraining of BERT on CausalBank improves performance on the COPA causal reasoning benchmark, demonstrating usefulness of the corpus. The main contributions are the causal corpus, disjunctive decoding approach, and evaluations showing the efficacy of the overall framework for open-ended causal text generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a framework for generating plausible causes and effects conditioned on an input sentence. The key components of the framework are: 1) CausalBank, a large corpus of 314 million cause-effect pairs extracted from Common Crawl using causal patterns; 2) Cause Effect Graph, a lexical causal knowledge graph built from Common Crawl with 89 million edges; 3) Transformer encoder-decoder models trained on CausalBank to generate causes and effects using disjunctive positive constraint decoding. Disjunctive positive constraints allow forcing the decoder to include morphological variants of words from the Cause Effect Graph. 

The approach is evaluated both automatically and via human evaluation, showing it can generate high quality and diverse causes and effects. CausalBank is also shown to be useful for downstream tasks by using it to continue training BERT (CausalBERT), improving performance on COPA causal reasoning benchmark by 3%. Overall, this work presents important new resources in CausalBank and Cause Effect Graph, an effective approach for open causal text generation, and an extension to constrained decoding that supports disjunctive constraints. The resources and models are publicly released to support future causal language generation and reasoning research.
