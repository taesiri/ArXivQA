# Guided Generation of Cause and Effect

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question seems to be: How can we develop an approach to generate diverse, high-quality, and naturalistic causal sentences (expressing possible causes and effects) for a given textual input, by leveraging large-scale causal knowledge extracted from text?The central hypothesis appears to be that:- By mining a large corpus of web text, we can extract a massive set of cause-effect sentence pairs (CausalBank) and a lexical causal knowledge graph (Cause Effect Graph). - These resources can then be used to train neural conditional text generation models with constrained decoding, to produce varied and plausible causal explanations for arbitrary textual events.- The diversity and quality of generated causal sentences can be improved by using disjunctive positive lexical constraints during decoding, forcing the model to include morphological variants of causal concepts from the knowledge graph.So in summary, the key idea is using large-scale causal corpora for acquiring open-domain causal knowledge, which is then utilized to guide conditional text generation via constrained decoding, achieving high-quality and diverse causal sentence production.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing the task of open causal generation: generating multiple plausible causes and effects for any free-form textual event.2. Construction of a large-scale causal corpus (CausalBank) containing 314 million cause-effect pairs extracted from web text.3. An extension to lexically-constrained decoding to support disjunctive positive constraints, allowing generation of outputs containing morphological variants of constrained words. 4. Models for generating causes and effects conditioned on an input sentence, trained on the CausalBank corpus and decoded with disjunctive constraints. 5. Evaluations showing the approach can generate high-quality and diverse causes and effects based on human assessment. 6. Demonstrating the usefulness of CausalBank by using it to improve performance of a causal reasoning model on the COPA benchmark simply via continued pre-training.In summary, the main contribution seems to be the proposal of open causal generation, the creation of resources to support this task, and showing the feasibility of the approach via models trained on this data and evaluated automatically and by humans.
