# [Imitation Learning-Based Online Time-Optimal Control with   Multiple-Waypoint Constraints for Quadrotors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11570)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Controlling quadrotors to aggressively fly through multiple waypoints in minimum time is challenging due to the need for online trajectory generation and control techniques. Existing methods either rely on offline optimization which is too slow for online replanning, or sacrifice optimality for speed.

Proposed Solution  
- Propose an imitation learning-based approach using Waypoint & Control Networks (WN&CNets) to learn time-optimal control policies from dataset generated by offline optimization. This allows fast online trajectory generation.

- To address limited training data and hover maneuver issue when switching waypoints, propose a polynomial transition phase strategy to help quadrotor "jump over" unnecessary hovers.

Main Contributions:
1) Develop WN&CNets to learn time-optimal control law from pre-generated optimal trajectory dataset. Use this online to generate aggressive commands.

2) Propose polynomial transition phase method to switch between waypoints smoothly without slowing down, ensuring near time-optimal performance. 

3) Validate approach in simulation and real-world experiments with a quadrotor flying 7 waypoints at 7 m/s in a confined 6mx4mx2m space. Achieves online performance with only slight optimality loss compared to offline optimization.

In summary, the paper develops an imitation learning based method for online time-optimal control of quadrotors through multiple waypoints. A transition phase strategy is used to enable smooth waypoint switching. The method is shown to achieve aggressive flight in real world comparable to offline optimization, but with significantly faster online computation time.
