# [PlankAssembly: Robust 3D Reconstruction from Three Orthographic Views   with Learnt Shape Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05744)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a robust 3D reconstruction method from orthographic views that is tolerant to imperfections in the input drawings?The key ideas and contributions to address this question appear to be:- Using a deep generative model based on Transformer architecture rather than traditional reconstruction pipelines. This allows more flexible mapping between input and output.- Designing the model to output shape programs that assemble planks, incorporating domain knowledge of furniture modeling.- Creating a large-scale dataset of cabinet models to train and evaluate the method.- Demonstrating significantly improved robustness to input noise and errors compared to traditional reconstruction methods.In summary, the paper develops a learning-based approach to 3D CAD reconstruction from orthographic views that is much more robust to imperfect inputs than prior geometry-based techniques. The use of deep generative models and domain-specific shape programs are key to achieving this robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- They propose a new method for reconstructing 3D CAD models from three orthographic views using deep generative models. Traditional methods establish explicit correspondences between 2D and 3D entities, making them sensitive to errors/noise in the inputs. In contrast, the proposed method uses attention mechanisms to learn more flexible mappings between the inputs and outputs.- They design a shape program representation suitable for generating cabinet models. The shape program resembles how a human would construct the model in CAD software. Using this representation improves reconstruction accuracy and enables downstream editing operations. - They create a large-scale dataset of over 26,000 cabinet models and systematically evaluate the proposed method against traditional methods. Experiments show their method is much more robust to imperfect inputs like missing/noisy lines.In summary, the key novelty is the use of deep generative models for 3D CAD reconstruction from orthographic views, which is more robust than prior geometry-based methods. The shape program representation is also a useful way to incorporate domain knowledge.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes a new method to automatically convert 2D line drawings of objects from three orthographic views into 3D CAD models. The key idea is to use a Transformer-based sequence model to generate shape programs that assemble simple geometric primitives like planks into complex objects like cabinets. This learned approach is more robust to imperfections in the input drawings compared to traditional reconstruction methods.
