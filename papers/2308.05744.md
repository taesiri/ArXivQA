# [PlankAssembly: Robust 3D Reconstruction from Three Orthographic Views
  with Learnt Shape Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05744)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop a robust 3D reconstruction method from orthographic views that is tolerant to imperfections in the input drawings?

The key ideas and contributions to address this question appear to be:

- Using a deep generative model based on Transformer architecture rather than traditional reconstruction pipelines. This allows more flexible mapping between input and output.

- Designing the model to output shape programs that assemble planks, incorporating domain knowledge of furniture modeling.

- Creating a large-scale dataset of cabinet models to train and evaluate the method.

- Demonstrating significantly improved robustness to input noise and errors compared to traditional reconstruction methods.

In summary, the paper develops a learning-based approach to 3D CAD reconstruction from orthographic views that is much more robust to imperfect inputs than prior geometry-based techniques. The use of deep generative models and domain-specific shape programs are key to achieving this robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- They propose a new method for reconstructing 3D CAD models from three orthographic views using deep generative models. Traditional methods establish explicit correspondences between 2D and 3D entities, making them sensitive to errors/noise in the inputs. In contrast, the proposed method uses attention mechanisms to learn more flexible mappings between the inputs and outputs.

- They design a shape program representation suitable for generating cabinet models. The shape program resembles how a human would construct the model in CAD software. Using this representation improves reconstruction accuracy and enables downstream editing operations. 

- They create a large-scale dataset of over 26,000 cabinet models and systematically evaluate the proposed method against traditional methods. Experiments show their method is much more robust to imperfect inputs like missing/noisy lines.

In summary, the key novelty is the use of deep generative models for 3D CAD reconstruction from orthographic views, which is more robust than prior geometry-based methods. The shape program representation is also a useful way to incorporate domain knowledge.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a new method to automatically convert 2D line drawings of objects from three orthographic views into 3D CAD models. The key idea is to use a Transformer-based sequence model to generate shape programs that assemble simple geometric primitives like planks into complex objects like cabinets. This learned approach is more robust to imperfections in the input drawings compared to traditional reconstruction methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel deep learning approach to reconstructing 3D CAD models from three orthographic views. It makes several key contributions compared to prior work:

- It is the first to use a deep generative model for this task, specifically a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model. Previous methods relied on traditional computational geometry pipelines to explicitly establish correspondences between 2D and 3D. The generative modeling approach allows for more flexible mapping and greater robustness to imperfect inputs.

- It incorporates domain knowledge by designing a simple domain-specific language to represent the 3D models, tailored to the furniture domain. This shape program output boosts accuracy and supports downstream CAD applications like editing. Prior learned methods output generic representations like meshes or point clouds. 

- It introduces a large-scale dataset of over 26,000 cabinet models, most created by professional designers. Previous datasets were smaller and synthetic. The scale and realism enable thorough benchmarking.

- Experiments demonstrate substantially higher robustness to input noise and errors compared to both traditional methods and other recent learned approaches. The method also runs efficiently on GPUs.

Overall, this work makes significant advances in learning-based 3D reconstruction from orthographic views. The novel deep generative modeling approach, combined with domain-specific shape programs, enables reconstruction that is far more robust and practical for real-world engineering. The ideas could generalize well to other CAD model types beyond furniture.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Extending the approach to more complex CAD models beyond cabinet furniture, such as mechanical parts. The authors suggest that the main idea of using a learned generative model is generalizable, but extending it to domains without large-scale training data remains an open challenge.

- Incorporating additional information available in CAD drawings, such as layers, text, symbols and annotations. The authors note that their current approach does not leverage these and integrating them could help reconstruct more complex drawings.

- Going beyond reconstructing 3D geometry to also inferring relationships like kinematic joints. The current work focuses only on modeling geometry but many mechanical CAD models also contain non-geometric information that could be useful to capture.

- Exploring different neural network architectures beyond Transformers. The authors demonstrate the benefits of using attention for this task but other network architectures may have complementary strengths.

- Improving robustness to imperfect inputs and reducing failure cases. The authors show their method is more robust than prior approaches, but handling noise and incomplete data remains an open problem.

- Enabling intuitive user interaction for error correction and editing. Leveraging the learned generative model for user interactions like correcting mistakes or editing models is suggested.

In summary, the main future directions pointed out are: extending the approach to new domains, incorporating more CAD information, inferring non-geometric relationships, exploring alternative network architectures, improving robustness, and enabling user interactions. Advancing any of these aspects could build nicely on the authors' proposed generative modeling approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a new method for 3D reconstruction of CAD models from three orthographic views. The key ideas are:

1) They formulate it as a sequence-to-sequence problem and use a Transformer architecture to generate shape programs that can assemble the 3D models. This allows more flexible alignment between input views and output models compared to prior methods. 

2) The shape programs are designed specifically for generating cabinet furniture by declaring planks and attachment relationships. This incorporates domain knowledge and also enables downstream editing of the reconstructed models.

3) They create a large dataset of cabinet models and systematically evaluate the method. Experiments show their approach is much more robust to imperfect inputs like noisy or incomplete drawings compared to traditional reconstruction pipelines. The learned shape programs also outperform a more generic face-based generation method.

In summary, the work demonstrates the advantages of using deep generative models for 3D CAD reconstruction from 2D, in terms of flexibility and robustness. The design of shape programs specific to the furniture domain is a key contribution.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for reconstructing 3D CAD models from three orthographic views. Traditional approaches follow a pipeline to explicitly match entities between the 2D and 3D, making them sensitive to imperfections in the input drawings. In contrast, the authors formulate the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task and use a Transformer architecture to generate shape programs that assemble the 3D models. Specifically, the shape programs declare wooden planks and define their relationships by attachment constraints, resembling how a designer would build the models. This representation improves robustness and supports downstream editing operations. 

The method is evaluated on a new dataset of over 26,000 cabinet models. Experiments demonstrate its superiority over traditional reconstruction, especially on noisy or incomplete inputs. For example, it achieves 90% F1 score with 30% missing lines, whereas the traditional approach completely fails. Ablations verify the benefits of using line sequences vs images as input and shape programs vs polygon meshes as output. Failure cases mostly involve incorrect attachments or premature stopping. Overall, the work provides new perspective to mesh vision and graphics with deep generative models. The idea of learning shape programs could generalize to other CAD domains, given suitable training data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a deep learning approach for reconstructing 3D CAD models from three orthographic views. The key ideas are:

1. They cast 3D reconstruction as a sequence-to-sequence problem and use a Transformer encoder-decoder model to generate shape programs that assemble wooden planks into cabinet models. Compared to traditional reconstruction methods that establish explicit correspondences between 2D and 3D, the attention mechanism in Transformers allows more flexible mapping and makes the method robust to imperfect inputs. 

2. The shape programs resemble how a human designer builds cabinet models, by declaring plank models and specifying attachment relationships between them. Using such domain-specific language as output improves reconstruction accuracy and supports downstream CAD applications like editing.

3. They created a large-scale dataset of cabinet models and systematically evaluated the method. Experiments showed the approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, especially when inputs contain noise or incomplete edges. The learned generative model is also more efficient compared to sequentially generating faces or vertices.

In summary, the key novelty is using deep generative models with domain-specific language to tackle the 3D CAD reconstruction problem. This contrasts with traditional reconstruction pipelines and shows superior robustness and efficiency.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem the authors are addressing is how to automatically convert 2D engineering drawings with three orthographic views into 3D CAD models. 

The traditional methods for this task reconstruct 3D models by establishing explicit correspondences between input 2D lines/edges and output 3D vertices, edges, faces etc. However, they are very sensitive to noises and errors in the input drawings, which are common in real-world scenarios where drawings are created manually by designers. 

To address this limitation, the authors propose a new deep learning based approach. Instead of explicit mapping between input and output, they formulate it as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem and use a Transformer model to learn more flexible input-output alignments. Further, they design a domain specific language of "shape programs" to represent the 3D models, which improves reconstruction accuracy for the specific object class of interest (cabinets) and also facilitates downstream CAD applications.

In summary, the key research problem is developing a more robust 3D reconstruction approach from 2D orthographic views that can handle imperfect real-world engineering drawings. The authors propose a deep generative model with shape programs to address this problem.
