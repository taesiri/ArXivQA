# [FedX: Unsupervised Federated Learning with Cross Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09158)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an unsupervised federated learning framework that learns unbiased representations from decentralized, heterogeneous local data while preserving privacy between clients?The key points about the research question are:- It focuses on unsupervised federated learning, which is an emerging research area. Many existing federated learning methods rely on supervised learning with labeled data.- The goal is to learn good representations from non-IID (non-identically distributed) local data in a decentralized network. This setting poses challenges due to the heterogeneity and lack of global data distribution knowledge at individual clients.- Privacy preservation between clients is a key consideration. The method should avoid directly sharing or exposing local data.- The aim is to develop a novel framework that addresses these challenges in unsupervised federated learning and learns unbiased representations despite the decentralized heterogeneous data.So in summary, the core research question is around developing a new privacy-preserving unsupervised federated learning approach for learning from decentralized non-IID data. The paper seems to propose a solution called FedX that employs two-sided knowledge distillation to achieve this goal.
