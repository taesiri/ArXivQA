# [Self-supervised co-salient object detection via feature correspondence   at multiple scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11107)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing unsupervised co-salient object detection (CoSOD) methods suffer from limited performance due to their reliance on handcrafted features and insufficient utilization of feature correspondences at multiple scales (patch and region levels). 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel two-stage self-supervised approach called SCoSPARC for CoSOD that effectively leverages feature correspondences at different scales to significantly enhance performance.

In the first stage, a network is trained to compute cross-attention maps that highlight commonly occurring salient regions via local patch-level feature correspondences across images. Two losses are used - a co-occurrence loss to force the detected regions across images to have similar features while being dissimilar to the background, and a saliency loss to maximize saliency of detected regions. The maps are thresholded using a confidence-based adaptive thresholding method to generate intermediate segmentations. 

In the second stage, connected component labeling is done on the intermediate masks and regions whose features do not match the average foreground feature representation are eliminated to refine the segmentations. Finally, dense CRFs are used to ensure spatial coherence.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a simple yet effective two-stage self-supervised model SCoSPARC for CoSOD that utilizes both patch and region-level feature correspondences of self-supervised ViT features.

- Introduces a confidence-based adaptive thresholding approach for the cross-attention maps that outperforms the standard 0.5 threshold.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised CoSOD on three benchmarks and even outperforms several recent supervised CoSOD methods while having a lightweight design.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in advancing unsupervised CoSOD by effectively harnessing multi-scale feature correspondences in a self-supervised framework to boost performance beyond existing unsupervised methods and remain competitive with recent supervised techniques.
