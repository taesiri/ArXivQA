# [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is whether diffusion probabilistic models are capable of generating high-quality image samples. The authors note that while other deep generative models like GANs, flows, VAEs, etc. have shown impressive image synthesis abilities, diffusion models have not previously demonstrated high quality sample generation. The key hypothesis seems to be that with a suitable model architecture, training procedure, and sampling scheme, diffusion models can achieve state-of-the-art sample quality comparable to other types of generative models.The experiments in the paper aim to validate this hypothesis by training diffusion models on image datasets like CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, and LSUN, and evaluating the sample quality using metrics like Inception Score, FID, and visual inspection. The results demonstrate diffusion models generating images comparable or superior to GANs, VAEs, and other likelihood-based models.In summary, the central research question is whether diffusion models can generate high-quality image samples, with the key hypothesis that they can with a proper model design and training procedure. The experiments aim to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:- It demonstrates high quality image synthesis using diffusion probabilistic models, showing they are capable of generating images competitive with other state-of-the-art generative models like GANs, flows, VAEs, etc. - It establishes connections between diffusion models and other techniques like denoising score matching, Langevin dynamics, and autoregressive decoding. Specifically, it shows a certain parameterization of diffusion models is equivalent to denoising score matching, and the sampling procedure resembles Langevin dynamics.- It provides analysis showing diffusion models can be interpreted as performing progressive lossy compression, with a bit ordering that generalizes what is possible with autoregressive models.- It introduces modifications to the training objective that improve sample quality, like using a weighted variational bound that emphasizes later diffusion steps. - It achieves state-of-the-art sample quality on datasets like CIFAR-10 and 256x256 LSUN bedrooms, outperforming many other generative models.In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating the generation capabilities of diffusion models and connecting them to other techniques, as well as introducing modifications to improve their performance. The results help establish diffusion models as a useful generative modeling tool.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents high quality image synthesis results using diffusion probabilistic models, establishes connections between diffusion models and denoising score matching/Langevin dynamics, and interprets the diffusion model sampling procedure as a form of progressive decoding that resembles autoregressive models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:- This paper focuses on diffusion probabilistic models, a class of latent variable models trained with variational inference. Other related models like VAEs, normalizing flows, and autoregressive models use different model architectures and training techniques.- The authors establish an explicit connection between diffusion models and denoising score matching. This helps motivate their particular parameterization of the reverse process as predicting gradient-like noise terms. Other work on score matching and denoising autoencoders has not made this direct connection.- The diffusion probabilistic model is shown to be capable of generating high quality image samples, competitive with state-of-the-art GANs and other likelihood-based models on datasets like CIFAR10 and CelebA. Prior work did not demonstrate the sample quality potential of diffusion models. - The progressive decoding view provides a new perspective on these models as a type of autoregressive decoding with a generalized bit ordering. This contrasts with the restricted pixel-wise orderings used in other autoregressive models.- While sample quality is excellent, lossless codelengths are not competitive with other types of models like flows or autoregressive models. The analysis shows the model allocates bits to imperceptible details.- The connections to score matching and energy-based models are related to other recent work drawing relationships between generative modeling techniques.In summary, this paper makes both empirical and theoretical contributions to better understand diffusion probabilistic models and relate them to other areas like score matching, autoregressive decoding, and lossy compression. The sample quality results are the most striking empirical result compared to prior work.
