# [Selective Task offloading for Maximum Inference Accuracy and Energy   efficient Real-Time IoT Sensing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16904)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper tackles the challenge of efficiently assigning inference jobs to multiple local inference models on resource-constrained edge devices or deciding whether to offload them to a nearby edge server. This problem of multi-inference model selection is subject to time and energy constraints and aims to maximize overall inference accuracy. The paper draws parallels to the NP-hard unbounded multidimensional knapsack problem (UMdKP).

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes LGSTO, a lightweight hybrid genetic algorithm tailored to solve the inference job scheduling problem under stringent time and energy constraints. LGSTO introduces novel mechanisms including a termination condition to stop evolution early when an optimal solution is reached, and a neighborhood exploration technique to accelerate convergence. 

Main Contributions:
- Formulates the novel problem of multi-inference model selection for edge devices under time and energy limitations, relating it to UMdKP complexity.

- Proposes LGSTO, a fast and lightweight metaheuristic approach, incorporating a termination condition and neighborhood search for rapid convergence.

- Compares LGSTO experimentally to brute-force, dynamic programming, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization using real-world models and data.

- Demonstrates LGSTO finds higher accuracy schedules 70% faster than the next best scheme, producing solutions in under 5ms making it suitable for real-time edge applications.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions by formally defining and efficiently solving the open challenge of job allocation across multiple inference models on resource-constrained edge devices using a tailored lightweight genetic algorithm. Experiments highlight LGSTO's superior performance.
