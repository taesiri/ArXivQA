# [Generative Visual Compression: A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02140)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Generative Visual Compression: A Review":

Problem:
Traditional hybrid video codecs like H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC and H.266/VVC are reaching their limits in compression performance. Meanwhile, the explosive growth of visual data requires more efficient compression algorithms as well as intelligent analytics capabilities beyond signal reconstruction.

Solution: 
This paper reviews recent advances in using deep generative models for visual data compression. Several genres of generative visual compression are presented:

1) End-to-end latent code representation: VAEs, GANs and diffusion models are used to map images/videos to compact latent spaces. State-of-the-art learned codecs have surpassed traditional standards.

2) Cross-modal image coding: Images are encoded into text or other modalities that require fewer bits yet preserve semantics.

3) Conceptual image coding: Images are disentangled into structure and texture codes for separate compression. 

4) Generative coding for temporal evolution: Keyframes and compact animation parameters are transmitted to exploit temporal redundancy.

5) Omni-dimensional data coding: Point clouds, light fields and 360Â° data are compressed via generative models.

In addition, the paper summarizes machine-oriented visual compression tasks performed directly on latent spaces or reconstructed features. Both single-branch and scalable frameworks are introduced to balance rate, distortion and machine performance.

Main Contributions:
- Provide a thorough review of the recent progress in generative visual compression for both human and machine vision.
- Categorize and compare different genres of generative compression techniques. 
- Discuss fundamental challenges regarding quality measurement, robustness, generalization, task dependency, and standardization.  
- Envision great potential and promising applications of generative visual compression.
